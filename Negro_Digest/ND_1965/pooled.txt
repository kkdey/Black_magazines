why direct action must not cease one of the least discussed of all the major recent events in the rv r freedom movement is the moratorium on demonstrations i i m and direct action for the period of the presidential campaign agreed to by major civil_rights organizations with core dissenting shortly after the nomination of senator goldwater in san francisco it is curious that there has been little postelection speculation as to whether that decision to halt negro militancy for days was in fact a wise course to have followed the major assumption which led to the decision to call a moratorium on all organized civil_rights protests was of course the feeling that such protests might tend to spread or deepen the white backlasheven to the point of altering the results of the presidential election prior to the election there was no method by which any certainty regarding the advisability of the moratorium could be secured and unfortunately no such postelection method has been discovered the deliberate delay of days however cannot simply be written off as an event that has passed into history the moratorium on civil_rights demonstrations during the presidential election may turn out to be one of the major turning pointsfor better or for worseof the entire freedom movement without minimizing or maximizing the presumed effects of the moratorium it seems warranted to note at least the following conclusions or inferences which may be made regarding the unprecedented voluntary postponement for three months of civil_rights demonstrations perhaps the most importanteousinference which may be drawn from the moratorium and the election is the conclusion that militant tactics by negro and civil_rights although possibly the most erron leaders in a preelection period will cause many white persons to vote against the negro cause whereas the absence of such tactics will result in a white vote not discemibly based on antinegro sentiment this conclusion appears to be widely accepted although one can argue that the white backlash would not have been significant in the vote in northern cities even if civil_rights demonstrations had in fact continued during the campaign the fact is that a feared white antinegro vote appears to have disappeared between labor day and election day did the blackout on negro militancy cause the fadeout of the white backlash one can fear that the answer to that question by countless persons would be yes and that the election may become in the popular imagination a symbol of the apparent truth however appalling and erroneous it may be that the presence of negro militancy during the period of an election campaign may elicit more antinegro than pronegro voters it must be remembered that this conclusion was the major assumption which led negro leaders to adopt the moratorium one may not therefore recoil from accepting its validation in the election results however repugnant and however open to question the validation may be it may well be that the leaders of core were correct when they refused to agree to the moratorium and when they argued that its adoption was a fundamental error but the ironic tragedy is that the moratorium on demonstrations presumably brought about within a few weeks a substantial diminution of antinegro feeling a second conclusion which may have been silently reached by many individuals is the judgment that we should be gratified and grateful that any significant white backlash vote in northern cities was eliminated from the presidential election this conclusion is premised on the assumption that the neutrality or apathy towards civil_rights by the white majority which is assertedly visible in the election results is better for the negro than a clearly antinegro vote would have been the fundamental premiseor mythwhich apparently leads to these conclusions is the concept that the negro needs friends in the white community and that the way to cultivate such friends is not to test their loyalty at the polls but to postpone negro demands during certain preelection periods those who rejoice at the absence of a notable white backlash vote in the election and who attribute its absence to the moratorium on demonstrations must also conclude that the loss of the friends for the freedom movement who would have been obtained if demonstrations had continued during the preelection period is clearly offset by the advantages to the negro people of an election where no northern communityunlike five southern statesexpressed its resentment against the negro by voting for a man who thought the civil_rights act of unconstitutional it is conceivable that the judgment of these persons may turn out to be correct but it is clear that there are so many imponderable and unknowable factors that it is simply impossible to make any overall judgment at this timeand perhaps everon the wisdom and the advisability of the moratorium what is very clear however is the fact that during the present interim period before the freedom movement resumes its militancy there are dangers fallacies and fears both for whites and negroes which need constant and careful analysis let us address ourselves to some of these pitfalls the negro backlash not many white persons have worried very much over any resentment and bitterness which may have understandably come into the hearts of negroes over the fact that their leaders felt impelled by the intensity of antinegro feeling among whites to suppress for days the negros right to present his grievances it may be that the virtue of longsuffering so remarkably present in the negro soul lias been in strumental in softening whatever resentment may have come about as a result of the addition of days to the years during which the american negro has patiently waited for freedom and equality but what can we say about the effect of the moratorium on those countless negroes who are aware of the frightening fact that the presumed extent of antinegro feeling in northern cities may well have brought about irreparable harm and irreversible trends in public opinion as a result of the disappearance for three months of a program by civil_rights organizations and ever more importantly will many negroes bowing to antinegro feeling in the white community succumb to the temptation to continue to substitute caution for courage or even try to forget the unendurability of the negros condition in america is it possible that the relative peace during the moratorium on civil_rights demonstrations could have had such an impact on both negroes and whites that most of the impetus of americas third revolution could disappear could a desire to have law and order be raised to a virtue above that of a hunger for justice could the mood of the northern white moderates dominate the orientation of the civil_rights movement could discretion be substituted for dynamism and prudence for progress as a result of the cessation of militancy for three months it is obvious that no one has the answers to these disturbing questions but what does emerge from the moratorium more clearly than ever before is the necessity of analyzing explaining and justifying the program of direct nonviolent action adopted by civil_rights leaders to bring justice and equality to the american negro relatively few white persons have apparently ever understood the mystique the purposes and the indispensability of a campaign of direct nonviolent action designed to eliminate the badges of slavery which still afflict the negro in america let us try therefore to probe deeply into the reasons why the negro feels that he can secure justice only by means of direct nonviolent action the reasons for direct nonviolent action in reinhold neibuhr wrote prophetically about the negros plight in his book moral man and immoral society in these words if anyone disagrees substantially with dr neibuhrs conclusion that the white majority will not give justice to the negro if it is not forced to do so he has a difficult and perhaps an impossible task in collecting evidence to support his view the negro leaders in america decided many years ago that the white majority would not yield if it is not forced to do so it is this fundamental premise which makes the campaign of direct nonviolent action indispensably necessary if one doubts the judgment that progress for the negro has come about only by forcing the white majority to yield he should recall the following recent events in negro history if one agrees that history demonstrates that the white majority in america must be forced to give justice to the negro the real issue then centers on the best way to bring about the required force the freedom movement has adopted a program of direct nonviolent actiona concept which needs constant explanation and analysis this program does not in any way minimize the necessity for continued recourse to the courts and to the legislatures but direct nonviolent action assumes that the ordinary political processes and the normal legal institutions of america cannot completely solve the problems of the negro prejudice is so deep white supremacy is so taken for granted and the negro is so downtrodden and poor that the ordinary legal processes cannot be expected to bring about the elevation of the negros status to substantial equality with the majority of white citizens only direct actiondramatic and continuouscan sear the conscience of the white majority and thereby bring about an improvement in the negros position direct action involves a confrontation in a positive manner requesting or demanding equality and justice it is not opposed or inconsistent with carrying on the struggle for negro freedom in the courts but it insists that the struggle must also be carried on in the streets in the parks in the mass media direct action is designed to portray injustice vividly and thereby to arouse the indignation of those in the white majority who care direct action has many faces it can be a protest against slumlords by a rent strike an orderly march on city hall to demand better schools for negroes or demonstrations at construction sites to remind the world that the unions involved in the construction have systematically excluded negroes from their membership direct action is the result of a conviction by the negro that he simply cannot rely on the moral sense of the white majority direct action is therefore a way to force the white man to give justice direct action is a cry of anguish frustration and anger from the other america direct action as employed by the freedom movement has always had the added element of nonviolence when the negroes in the late s started to assert their rights in the south by sitins and similar demonstrations they anticipated and expected violence in return from the white power structure hence the negroes resolved to resist violence with nonviolencein the noblest tradition and spirit of thoreau gandhi and all of those minorities in history who have practiced civil disobedience to unjust laws nonviolence and civil disobedience have not meant the same thing in northern cities as they have in the south in the north the law grants equality to all but prejudiced people deny equality in housing employment and education to nonwhite groups as a result the term passive resistance is probably a more descriptive and more accurate name for the program of direct action carried on by civil_rights groups in the north but the spirit and purposes of direct action in the north are the same as in the south in both places direct action is a means to dramatize injustice to protest inequality and to force the white majority to yieldthere are many white moderates and even liberals who have never understood or sympathized with the direct action programs of negro organizations these individuals are quick to criticize one of the few extremists examples of demonstrationsprobably unauthorized by any civil_rights organizationand point out the adverse effects which this protest allegedly had on white citizens but the point that the white moderate who is quick to criticize demonstrations misses is the central and crucial truth that law and morality have not solved the negro problem and that as a result the negro has quite understandably come to the conclusion that direct action is the only way by which he can secure equality and justice if the white moderate wishes to repudiate direct action as ineffective and inopportune he must first either prove that law and morality will in fact bring equality to the negro or in the alternative the white moderate must offer the negro a substitute for direct action it seems clear that there is a widespread and profound misunderstanding of the purpose and the necessity for direct nonviolent action the most fundamental cause of this misunderstanding is the common fallacy endorsed by countless americans that the negro will find his rightful place in american society just as every other ethnic or immigrant group has done although the naivete and the basic falsity of this supposition should be clear to everyone this totally unrealistic view of the negro predicament in america continues to find adherents the fact is of course that the negro cannot be analogized to the immigrant or to any other ethnic group in america the negros problems and predicament are unique and have never been experienced or confronted by any other white minority in america the negro has disabilities beyond the obvious one of color the fundamental disability or infirmity which the negro must contend with is his status as the only culturally deprived minority in the whole history of america every other ethnic group in america can trace its origins to a particular nation race and religion the negro has no ties and indeed no knowledge of the nation or religion of his ancestors he has been deprived of his culture and exists in america almost as a person separated from the mainstream of american culture both negroes and whites can sense the nobodiness of the american negro because of this characteristic the negro has a feeling of inferiority and a tendency to selfsegregation the same characteristic causes the white majority to have an unconscious feeling of superiority and an inclination to think that the negro should exist apart from or outside the mainstream of white culture it is because of this apartness of the negro from the white in america that a program of direct action is necessary to bring about equality for the nations twenty million nonwhite citizens without direct action the white majority will try to forget the plight of the negro the campaign of direct action conducted by civil_rights groups for several months prior to the moratorium in the summer of had educated and aroused the white majority more than at any other time in all of recent history in some places to be sure apathy turned into antagonism but in many other places apathy became acquiescence acceptance and even approval of the negros demands the dramatic progress of the negro in education and employment during the period from to the summer of is attributable in part to the fact that a sufficiently large number of citizens in the white community became aware of and angry about the injustices inflicted on negroes in america will that awareness and righteous anger fade away if a program of direct action is not resumed history suggests and indeed almost proves that the answer to that question is yes the white man in america will forget about the plight of the negrounless he is forced to remember direct action therefore cannot cease its necessity should shame the white man but its indispensability should never be forgotten by negro groups the immediate future will be a critically important period in the freedom movement negro organizations are understandably reluctant to reinitiate an extensive program of direct action while most whites do not have the insight or the courage to urge negroes to resume their militancy the vacuum which currently exists is a dangerous lulla period in fact when the northern counterpart of the southern white citizens council could be formed it is well to recall that the white citizens councils in the south were formed after a period of several months following the supreme courts famous desegregation mandate in may a period when a vacuum existed in southern leadership on civil_rights the white councils moved into this vacuum poisoned the atmosphere and formed a climate of opinion which has so successfully resisted the supreme courts mandate that in per cent of the deep souths negro children were still in segregated schools could antinegro movements move into the vacuum now present in northern cities due to the moratorium and to a cessation or diminution of negro militancy frightening events seem to suggest that such an eventuality is possible the passage of proposition in california by a to margin the massive resistance to the pairing of schools in new york city the fading enthusiasm of labor and industry for plans to train negro workersall of these are symptoms of the inveterate habit of the white majority to try to resolve the negro problem by attempting to deny its existence all persons therefore who are deeply interested in the future of the freedom movement must actively and articulately urge the resumption of a program of direct action by civil_rights groups the program may be modified in important ways because of the passage of the civil_rights act of but it must nonetheless be militant continuous and systematic events involving direct action must moreover be connected at least in a general way with some stated objectives direct action programs must not give the impression that they are simply the outburst of hitherto suppressed anger and frustration it seems clear that the resumption of negro militancy may depend more on the encouragement of white leaders than upon the initiative of negro groups negroes will understandably hesitate to recommence a program of direct action if they feel that only a few white leaders of public opinion will endorse and support it white leaders therefore are more than they realize the intellectual advisers and professional counsellors of the negro freedom movement the white majority or the leaders of public opinion within it are now whether they realize it or not the architects of the moral and social structure of northern cities for the foreseeable future the attitude toward negro aspirations among northern whites is at present characterized by ambiguity and ambivalence the moratorium on demonstrations during the presidential campaign has brought even more confusion and misunderstanding into the minds of innumerable white citizens in the north it is a truism to note that catholics will continue to be among the most influential leaders of public opinion in northern cities with regard to the race problem catholics in public life and in positions of influence in public and private education will have a crucial and decisive role to play in the struggle of the negro for equality in housing education and employment that struggle cannot end in victory without the active collaboration and the closest cooperation of the white majority and particularly of white public officials the world which our childrens children will inherit may well be determined by the moral climate which is created in the generation from to that climate will depend to almost a frightening degree on the attitudes and feelings of catholics in northern communities it is time therefore for catholics and all white citizens to reassert the legacy of human equality which more than any one doctrine expresses the essence of the freedom movement and it is also time for everyone who desires the negro to have full equality in american life to confess publicly that this ideal cannot be attained unless the negroes aided by their white associates resume and continue a program of direct nonviolent action without such a program the white majority will soon forget the plight of the negro and will settle down complacently into a society where de facto white supremacy prevails but with a wellorganized program of direct action the negro in america mayhopefully within the foreseeable futuremove into a world where race is irrelevant and human dignity is a respected ideal the sun striking in between the pillars of the cayuga county courthouse in the upstate city of auburn new york glinted across two large bronze plaques on either side of the entrance one honored william h seward a familiar name in history books the other plaque honored harriet tubman an unknown name it read why was this plaque to a black slave woman given such a place of honor in a northern city years ago if an important historical figure why have we not heard about her is it because she was a woman because she was a negro because she left no account of her deeds why although a fullblack unschooled slave harriet tubman was an active force in the civil war and she showed herself to be the worlds greatest heroine in the fight for personal freedom yet she has been almost forgotten harriet tubmans was not a life of service primarily devoted to the sick and suffering as was that of florence nightingale nor did she give her life in a single great burst of fanatical leadership as did joan of arc rather this runaway slave risked her life runaway times in the cause of freedom and she gave a wars worth of devoted nursing care and spying service for her country during those frothyheaded days of a century ago harriet tubman awakened the prewar era and civil war days to masterful adventure and sacrifice not knowing how to write she kept no written records of her trips on the underground railroad it was better so without looking back at the fears and hardships of former trips her faith carried her onward she lived with face turned toward the future but the lack of such records makes it impossible to recount exact detailed descriptions of her various trips with their individual crises only by piecing together the stories she told and that others recorded can a typical trip be reconstructed by morning tired they bedded down in the woods for an uneasy rest each snapping twig startled them into wideeyed fear by nightfall they were glad to be up again and on their way now they took to the dusty road harriet who had been over it a dozen times before knew her destination by dawn they reached the home of a free negro upon her signal the door opened and the group filed into the little place so many moses only a few can get into the potato hole this was a hole dug in the center of the hardpacked earth floor of the cabin where potatoes were stored it was a fine place for hiding refugees out of the wind and the rain well put as many as we can in there and the rest under the haystack by daylight there was no sign of the visitors the sunshine striking through the early mist fell on not one of them that night when they were again on their way harriet suddenly stopped and listened quickly she scuttled her charges into a thicket a baby cried she gave it a dose of paragoric it quieted none too soon the pounding of the horses hooves grew louder and the patrollers galloped past stopping a short distance beyond the little group could hear one patroller say we might as well give up after the patrollers had gone back harriet and the others laughed as they scrambled out of the bushes they say were fools but were not fools enough to keep on the road when we hear them coming she said they skirted the highway tramping through the night at daybreak harriet hid them in a clump of brush near a mosquitoinfested swamp it was the best she could do i a whispering relay would inform the slaves that harriet was preparing for another trip north they waited expectantly for her muted singing call that indicated she was ready to start finally it came a low husky voice sang outside the cabins one saturday night in the middle s the singing rose and fell with the fickle wind as it carried its message through the slave quarters of a maryland plantation moses is here moses has come to take another load to freedom on waves of the wind the singing words spread from cabin to cabin plantation to plantation dark forms shadows of the night glided silently to the source of the whispering melody taking shape the shadows became dark outlines of people who wanted to be guided north who came to plead with their moses to take them to the promised land harriet tubman the moses of her people chose her followers carefully they had to prove their conviction their courage that they had the physical stamina needed to endure the hundreds of tortured miles to freedom yet a woman with a young child might be among the travelers for harriet knew that a mother would not turn back if it meant her babys freedom when the group was selected the chosen ones went back to their cabins to make last preparations and say their goodbyes meantime harriet went to visit a free negro nearby jake well be needing your help again remember follow the patrollers and tear down the reward signs and she was gone the travelers each with a bit of food and a few precious trifles tied in a bandana listened for her whippoorwills call this signalled that moses was ready to leave the group took off through the woods on this saturday night their masters would not miss them until monday by then if all went well they would be miles away it was a cloudy night progress was slow without the north star to guide them still being close to home they could pick their way along the familiar little trails that led northward through the woods harriet tubman their moses urged them on making the most of this first night out while her followers were fresh and filled with enthusiasm for the adventure stay here she warned tve got to get us food in the village ill be back as soon as i cantoward dark dont come out you wait until you hear me sing if i singhail oh hail ye happy spirits death no more shall make you fear everything is safe but if i sing moses go down in egypt tell ole pharo let me go then you stay hidden as darkness settled over the road that evening the low sound of harriets singing told them all was well they came out to meet her she passed out the rations they ate as they trudged northward harriet tried to keep their minds off themselves by telling them tales although she herself had had little rest that day now she told them of her first trip north alone and not knowing the way or who was friend or foe i wondered if i should try itif i should leave my family behind she began as i listened to the stories told around the cabin i wanted more and more to be free one day i decided to run away to freedom it was worth it youll see while i was waiting for the day to leave i met john she went on with a sigh he was free i married him that didnt make me free but it did give me a nametubman i wanted to be free like him i got me a lawyerman he told me that my mother was to be freed when her young mistress died they never told her for they wanted her to go on working that meant i was really free i was going to be free or die i talked it over with john he was a good man but he was already free why should he run away then one day i heard that i was sold and was going to be shipped south i crept into the woods that night and ran away to freedomalone during the day i hid in the thickets like i heard tell at night i followed the north star i waded through swamps to hide my tracks from bloodhounds some people were kind and helped me but generally i didnt trust any one because id heard how even free negroes sometimes returned slaves to get the reward steps were beginning to lag theres rest ahead well soon be stopping harriet soothed the tired ones as they dragged on and then there it was the form of a house in the darkness harriet went to the door and knocked three times as was her custom no answering squeak of a door swinging open finally a head a white mans head appeared at an upstair window is before she could go on the man shouted down no he isnt he was run out of town last month for helping fugitivesand im staying here to catch the rest the window slammed down now harriet worked fast she hurried her charges across the fields keeping them carefully in a tight little group so that their shadows would not stretch out like tall men could they get away before the white man sounded the alarm they came to a river it looked broad and deep we cross it she ordered the men shrank back the women watched the men no one made a move to start into the water harriet fearful now that the hounds might already be on their trail waded in the water came up to her knees her waist her armpits her neckand then it began to recede seeing this the others followed carrying a baby high over head they were all safely across but wet and cold still there were no baying hounds to be heard but harriet would not allow a fire to be built the smoke might tell them where we are she said so with chattering teeth they sloshed on leaving a telltale trail of water behind them now worn out to fainting one man declared he could not go another step he begged harriet to take them back its better to be slaves than go on like this he pleaded im wore out you know theres no turning back if you go back now youll go to the chaingang for sure theres only one way thats ahead still the man demurred i cant go on im done in harriet was ready when strong measures were needed drawing her gun she said dead niggers tell no tales you go onor die the man stumbled to his feet the little party continued plodding northward one tired foot dragging after the other resting by day and traveling by night they were a little farther north each morning one evening harriet exhausted fell asleep without warning this was a failing of hers since a blow on her head when she was in her teens they looked at her leaning up against a tree fast asleep this was a chance for the disheartened they could take the gun from her pocket they could leave go back but they were far from home now they could not find their way back alone and during these days and nights in which she had cared for them and had told them stories of her past and of other trips their trust in her had increased they waited in a short time harriet awoke looked around and took up the march and the story she was telling where she left off as if nothing had happened she went on to tell them about thomas garrett the good quaker who gave every fugitive that stopped at his house a pair of new shoes as they neared wilmington delaware harriet knew that this time her group was too big to go unchallenged she made them remain hidden while she went for help returning with two men she divided the party into three groups each went in a different direction for two days the groups remained hidden and apart finally they met they were glad to be reunited having come to feel secure together in the early morning several men in an empty wagon crossed the bridge from wilmington to the country as they passed the sentries at the bridge they hailed them and rattled on when they returned that evening their cart was loaded with hay the sentries recognizing the men who had crossed in the morning motioned them on talking and laughing they clattered across the bridge into town under the hay the fugitives rode into the city after devious ruses the group finally reached the back door of thomas garretts shoe shop at dawn garrett led the fugitives up the back stairs at the head of the stairs was a wall lined with rows of shoe boxes the travelers looked at them greedily remembering harriets tale garrett pulled out one of the boxes but instead of opening it he tucked it under his arm then he said be very quiet for the store is right under here if you are quiet you will be quite safe he put his hand in the hole left by the empty box and the entire wall swung round gaping the group followed harriet as silently the wall swung back into place they were in a large windowless room lighted by a long skylight looking up they saw the blue sky looking around they saw a wash stand some clothing piled high on a chair and blankets neatly folded by the wall wrapping in the blankets they dropped to the floor and no longer worried about pursuers succumbed to their need of rest accustomed by now to awakening with the dusk they were up and had the blankets folded when mrs garrett brought in a huge tray of steaming food this was their first hot meal since leaving maryland as they ate she talked softly with harriet when they were finished she turned to the group try on the clothes she said and helped them find suitable outfits after garrett had closed up shop and the protection of darkness surrounded them he led them down stairs each one was fitted with a pair of new shoes refreshed reclothed and reshod they started out once more but this time it was not the disheartened little band it had been when it entered with new respectability they stepped forth from now on the way was smoother for here the abolitionists quakers and free negroes were ready to help stops were closer conditions were better and often wagon rides made the journey easier still they did not feel safe the fugitive slave law of made it mandatory for anyone recognizing slaves to return them to reach pennsylvania was no longer enough it was necessary to reach canada before freedom was sure so on through new york to albany and across the state in syracuse they stopped at larin loguens house a free negro and former slave he kept them a few days to rest as he sent word on ahead that the party would be coming in rochester frederick douglass another well known free negro took over their care finally they crossed the new niagara falls bridge they were free this reconstructed trip composed of actual happenings gives some measure of the hardships harriet tubman and her followers endured all her trips were like this in two respects the traveling was always done at night and every trip was successful although each trip was unique varying according to circumstances each weighed hope against suffering naturally details and maneuvers changed according to need for each trip had its own emergencies but harriet was able to cope with all the mishaps unfailingly she reached the land of freedom with her little groups she was never caught with her contrabands sometimes if pursuers were hot after the group it might double back on its path taking a train going south no one would suspect southbound slaves of running away in later years harriet used another device even more daring she started out with the masters horse and surrey the fugitives hidden within anyone seeing a slave driving his masters horse would conclude that he was on an errand for his master harriet had many close escapes once she carried two live chickens to distract attention as she entered a village where she had lived suddenly she saw her old master round a corner and come her way quickly she let the chickens go they flew over a fence with the negro woman racing after them the man laughed unaware that he was watching his old slave so she succeeded in avoiding him another time in a railroad station she heard a man standing near her read a description of her to his friend unschooled she opened a book she had praying that she was holding it right one of the men seeing her said this cant be the one the runaway woman cant read harriets early trips took the fugitives to one of the northern states later trips terminated in canada she remained long enough to help them find quarters food and jobs then working until she had enough money saved for the next trip she left to lead another group north to freedom vs m harriet tubman was born in eastern maryland around by the time she was sixyearsold she knew the heartache of being separated from her family the backache of working beyond her years and the searing ache of the whip cutting into her flesh she understood the fear of being sold like an animal away from her family and she sensed the cringing hatred of many slaves toward their masters although she had never been inside a schoolroom by the time harriet was she had learned much to prepare her for later life from old ben her father she learned what roots and berries were edible he showed her how to stalk silently through the woods like an indian and he taught her how to steer a course by the north star harriets weeknight education was gleaned from listening to the negroes gathered about the cabin they told of their african past and of their superstitions they told of remedies they concocted from roots and herbs to bring them back to health they talked of god who was very near to help them in their tribulations but always the talk turned night after night to slave uprisings turners rebellion and to runaway slaves reaching the north and freedom on the underground railroad they would say but nobody seemed to know just what or where this railroad was they mentioned it in reverent whispers as though when the time came god would show them how to find it and when the right time did comeharriet too followed the north star via the underground railroad to freedom she was about at the time she waded through swamps and crossed streams to hide her trail from the longeared hounds when she learned her next stop from the conductor at each station finally crossing the line to the north which meant freedom harriet looked down at her hands theyre the same black hands but im as free as though they was white reaching philadelphia harriet found work and freedom but she did not find happiness im free but theres nobody to welcome me to freedom here im a stranger up here in this strange place my home and my friends they be in maryland still a plan to remedy this soon formed in her mind she was free others should be free with her and she made her dream come true during the following years harriet used all her ingenuity her friends in both the north and the south and her money toward one end freeing more of her people over the years in her trips south she led more than slaves to the free north every trip was successful she gave counsel and directions to many groups that were responsible enough to start out without her and there is no counting those individuals who gained courage to flee to the north and freedom from hearing stories of her heroic successes each slave arriving in the north meant another crippling blow to slavery every freed slave added another worker to the abolitionist ranks as more and more of her people reached freedom in the north harriet tubman was no longer a stranger in a strange land as tales of her trips on the underground railroad became legend she became known as moses for she was the leader of the exodus of the slaves from the south she was the guide of a slave people to a land of freedom after succeeding magnificently in her efforts harriet was determined to take her parents north but they presented a problem now old they were unable to trek the long miles undaunted harriet went after them she made a makeshift wagon and started out with them reaching a railroad station she put them aboard for wilmington thomas garrett provided money for continuing them on their journey to canada by rail in john brown wanted harriet general tubman as he called her to join his forces but overwork and exposure had finally caught up with her she was too ill to join him in his uprising at harpers ferry but he became one of her heroes to whom she referred as the emancipator of my people when the civil war broke out harriet offered her services doing any job given her she managed to help her own staying close to the line she directed negroes to security as they came through harriets description of one of the battles is vivid and then we saw the lightning and that was the guns and then we heard the thunder and that was the big guns and then we heard the rain falling and that was the drops of blood falling and when we came to get in the crops it was dead men that we reaped she worked with her people in war hospitals the conditions were terrible as she describes them id go to the hospital every morning id get a big chunk of ice and put it in a basin and fill it with water then id take a sponge and begin first man id come to id thrash away the flies and theyd rise like bees around a hive then id begin to bathe the wounds and by the time id bathed off three of four the fire and heat would have melted the ice and made the water warm and itd be as red as clear blood then id go and get some more ice and by the time i got to the next one the flies would be around the first ones black and thick as ever after working in the hospital all day harriet spent part of the night baking pies and gingerbread and making a keg of root beer to sell in the camps in this way she provided for her meagre needs until then colonel montgomery enlisted harriets services as a spy in the south as a negro woman she could wedge her way into places that a white man could not enter without suspicion her courage and cunning always brought her back safely following a plan resulting from one of her spying missions she went up the combachee river in south carolina with colonel montgomery and about negro troops in three gunboats as they appeared the confederate troops withdrew from the shore putting off a few soldiers along the way they soon spread word that lincolns gunboats were coming to free the slaves the slaves came down to the river in droves hayforks still in their hands women carrying babies and food some leading animals their owners threats and whippings could not stop them the rowboats were soon loaded but by making several trips at each point all were taken aboard the gunboats on one of harriets missions the commonwealth a boston newspaper on july says colonel montgomery and his gallant band of black soldiers under the guidance of a black woman dashed into the enemys country many and many times she has penetrated the enemys lines and discovered their situation and condition and escaped without injury but not without extreme hazard harriet was becoming a legend some said that she was a man who could see in the dark like a cat some said that she could fly over rivers and see into enemy territory like a bird some claimed that she had a way with animals so that no bloodhound would trace her nor any watchdog give warning of her presence when on january lincoln proclaimed the negroes free the union had to assume responsibility for keeping order among them for supplying them with provisions for caring for them northern dogooders offered their services for rehabilitating the negroes although they knew very little about them harriet acted as liaison between these northern forces and the negroes suddenly bewildered by their freedom harriet tubman had been promised a soldiers wage the pay of negro soldiers had been cut in half but she decided to take hers and to return to her parents in the north for she was worried about them she found she was unable to collect her wages for serving as a war nurse harriet did however receive a halffare travel pass but when she used it the conductor cursing threw her into the baggage car in the doing he seriously wrenched her arm and shoulder tired and sick with aching arm the fearless fighter traveled north as baggage it was one of the inconsistencies of the war that after serving throughout the conflict without mishap that on her way home she should experience her only war injury and with it suffer an ordeal that proved to her that the negro was still not truly free on this return trip harriet anticipated making a home for her aged parents in auburn new york where through the help of secretary of state seward she had acquired a little place she hoped once more to work outofdoors in a garden it was well that she enjoyed this kind of labor for soon her home became a stopping place for the distressed shortly she was raising food and money to care for the helpless and ill who remained with her for she would not turn a needy person away as fast as she got money she spent it on others she could see no purpose in saving when others needed what her money could buy as a result she was always in need influential friends appealed to the pension committee in washington on her behalf but even her friend seward could not get the committee to vote funds for this deserving heroine who had served her country so faithfully every time the matter came up it was shelved until it took on proportions of a government scandal in john tubman harriets husband who could not go north with her who had taken another woman as his wife two months after harriet ran away was murdered so when nelson davis arrived at her home ill with tuberculosis she married him the better to care for him in he died harriet was again alone but now as the wife of a war veteran she was pensioned at first her pension was eight dollars a month since she was by now well known newspaper articles took up the pension matter finally the government acceded to popular demand and harriet was granted a month for the rest of her life in her later years she turned her attention to getting a hospitalhome for those of her race looking for a suitable location she attended an auction for a plot of ground near her home in auburn she describes herself at that auction there i was like a blackberry in a pail of milk she finally managed to pay for this land and to build the hospitalhome she had dreamed of but a few years after her death it closed its doors her energy and enthusiasm alone had kept it running she willed the home to the ame zion church the house has been repaired and is now being used as a manse for the church but one room has been set aside as a memorial museum to the worlds greatest heroine of personal freedom when harriet tubman died in auburn n y on march she was tendered a military funeral now that she was gone the citizens of the city recognized that an unsung hero of the civil war and the moses of a people had been one of their neighbors as a memorial july was set aside as harriet tubman day in auburn a memorial service was held a plaque was set up in her honor at the entrance to the court house and flags were lowered to halfmast for this black woman in a city of whites the great trees bloomed red saffron purple and gold as late fall lingered sad and splendid on old screamer mountain at clayton georgia and lillian smith anal yst artist and prophet of the south beheld the last bright blaze of the ebbing year restive in the benign embrace of old screamers gentle peaks miss smith peoplehungry in her hilltop isolation and illness nevertheless was ablaze too with work study ideas and her apparent triumph over her sixth cancer she talked with love solemn thought and a lot of bite of herself and her work of mankinds grand advance through the aeons of this piddling present person or that one of southern sins and northern complacency of teensyweensy writing by deep narrow talents of mens hostility toward serious women andwith most faith and fascinationof this crucial time in the history of humans when we are so close together as thinking beings that our intellects push and polish each other into new brilliance to light gods destiny for mental man at sixtysix miss smithwhose strange fruit shocked north and south and was read around the world in and ever since whose profound and audacious analysis of dixie killers of the dream became a classic and whose one hour was received indifferently because it was about decent upperclass cultivated southerners the northern critics dont know about and dont want to believe inwell now miss smith who never did want to write about race but just about people has decided she wont talk about civil_rights any more unless it is a matter of duty and housekeeping she explained that all her life as the middle daughter of a large welltodo highminded southern family has been shared between mary the creative one the artist and martha who tends the house and cleans up the mess often the two have merged in the demands of conscience and art and have fed one another so marthas chores helping her father after a depression business failure with a girls camp at their summer home in clayton speaking and writing for important causes nursing her mother in her last four years of illness ministering to this troubled brother sister or friendprovided experience and perception for mary miss smith considers perhaps twenty per cent of her output of countless magazine stories pamphlets seven books innumerable lectures tv and radio discussions and talks with needful groupsto be martha work such is now is the time a simple and vivid little tract as she terms it calling on white southerners after to meet the racial change with love and justice a book she feels was smothered by publishers subject to angry pressure her new book pages of monologues accompanying photographs of the negro direct action movement our faces our words w w norton written in dire illness after a precarious pneumonia may be called martha work she thinks but there is high artistry in miss smiths penetration of the aims sorrows and heroisms of black and white boys and girls pushing and enduring the movement and in her idiomatic and poetic expression of their feelings and thoughts this little book may be the truest picture of these nonviolent young revolutionaries to come out of the fearful spate of good and bad writing about the negro revolt miss smith talked fiercely and carefully and often laughing in the huge pine living room of her cabin house once a part of the girls camp laurel falls with its window wall open to the double mountain ridge and blue skya wildly gorgeous invasion of the spacious comfort and taste of the big room which a lesser woman might not sustain without draw draperies but miss smith slight and vivid in black pants and a figured shirt her strong fair face ravaged by pain and thought and crowned with a shimmering cloud of softly curling white hair her big dark eyes intense looked a valiant and vigorous match for old screamer mountain and his wild autumn she reminded me also that in her twelveyear war with cancer she always looks her luminous best under death sentence ill look lovely in my coffin she promised happily im somewhat naturally an optimist she mused thats not to say i dont see evil ive always seen evil since i was three years old and i continue to see it everywhere but ive always been positive in my feelings almost in my bloodstream that good is stronger my optimism about the world and human experience has not always been intellectually understood though i just felt it the book which has influenced me more than any other book on the face of the earth is tielhard de chardins the phenomenon of man this great paleontologist a jesuit priest believed that we can think of man in no other way than in sweeping spans of time and when i read himhe is hard i grub away at himi knew why the cynics from beatsville to sartre and existentialism were wrong because they were thinking of mans experience in time spans of maybe a thousand years when it seemed to me one must think of man in times of or half a million years chardin sees mans purpose the purpose of it allas achieving more and more complex forms of life and more quality this is what evolution is and since it is chardin believes that man was planned by the great creator finally man appeared and then a certain point was reached in this purposeful evolution when man began to think man began to participate in his own evolution man grows in his mind julian huxley is a great optimist and a stronger mind than aldous he says we must not look at one hundred years nor twenty thousand or fifty thousand years because the movement toward purpose is so slow miss smith paused and smiled relishing the huxley minds and then went on her whole person inclining persuasively with her talk her fine small hands cupping ideas and qualifications and her face smiling wondering and frowning dramatizing her sentences what has been done in the last one hundred years is the most critical point she pronounced in grave excitement change always comes in evolution the first time people get very close together and the human temperature has gone way up there is great heat in our proximity our crowding together and this is the heat that transforms us i wrote in the revived killers of the dream that man is evolving and participating in his own evolution now that he has a mind and that it is increasing rapidly in brilliance as it is pushed and polished by other minds this coming together acceleration and proliferation of thought this great change that is upon us is one reason for our tremendous anxiety today of course anxiety comes along with thought and great questions and enormous change it explains the goldwater people they realize we are at a critical point and they cant understand it so theyre using race and segregation as a dead end in which to crawl and stay out of the troubling future she talked of tired and troubled young personalities in the negro movement battered from the suffering and courage it demands in the resistant south some of whom come by to see me kids from the north and california and of more than one white southern activist whom miss lil and her friend paula snelling have entertained and mothered in the restoring haven of beautiful hills good food civilized comfort and searching talk this one poor little thing has more trouble than the movement another one has literary talent a lot of them political confusion and another one a firstrate mind real quality there are others former campers and proteges at camp laurel falls who come back for introspection talk and miss lils examination of their troubles until i sometimes think ill have to hang out a shingle and bill them for psychoanalysis miss smith made a face of distaste for the appraisal of her as that earnest little old lady up on the mountain who wants the negroes to have everything for the negroes and the witless tribe of readers and critics who stereotype her as a race writer and dont appreciate what she considers her best work she recalled her first awakening to the ugliness of color as a girl teaching music in china where white missionaries and british colonialists barred chinese from parks swimming pools and clubs she realized it was the same as the southern thing in china my brain woke up i knew the trouble was worldwide and ive never thought otherwise i never talk about civil_rights if i can help it thats housekeeping cleaning up the mess im interested in the whole thing the meaning of the whole thing that this massive defense of segregation of inhuman experience is a symptom of our dehumanization almost total dehumanization looking back on her work she made her own appraisals literary people dont like me very much she observed scientists philosophers painters people of the theater do like me in the last few years ive been so very ill with long hours of reflecting ive reread my books and evaluated them from my own point of view i would not change a word maybe in strange fruit my fumbling beginning and poorest novel might add two or three more chapters in the center because i left out a southerner of subtlety and with a complex grasp of the south which no character in the book really had laura the artist and sister of the troubled boy could have represented this southerner but it was my flrst novel and i didnt have the technique to let her into it without becoming awkwardly philosophical then this great weakness keeps strange fruit from being great it is my most famous novel but one hour is my best i think strange fruit was the first book in the united states which treated negroes as human beings she remembers with satisfaction the originality and distinction of south today which she and miss snelling published from clayton from to started as a journal strictly of literature and arts with no remote notion of discussing race at all the little magazine did however publish stories articles and poetry by southerners of both races range audaciously into race and politics and got up to a circulation of despite troubles with a friendly but horrified printer whose conscience on one occasion would not let him print a race piece and some post office censorship in atlanta which was resolved in washington and i just couldnt take georgia that year she remembered shaking her shining white head to wake up every morning to insults in the newspapers friends falling away and people turning their faces when i passed then we really knew who our friends were and there were some great ones newspaper comments on the author of strange fruit included one atlanta columnists description of the novel as an orgasm and anothers appraisal of the novelist as a sexobsessed old woman who he suggested could not attract white men and settled for negro men and in the curious southern way while miss smith was and is a favorite and favored citizen of the little town of clayton she has had three vigilante fires on her mountaintop and some property and uncounted letters manuscripts and book notes have disappeared while friends fell away and newspapers and preachers tore to pieces my reputation as a woman welltodo parents of laurel falls campers rallied handsomely only four parents withdrew their daughters and forty others applied for the vacancies and no one tried officially to ban the novel or killers of the dream in the south they just squeezed them out or smothered them at any rate she lived between brooklyn and clayton for six years of celebrity travel work and friendship with some of the top minds in the country she objects to readers calling killers of the dream a freudian interpretation of the south im a great admirer of freud a great mind the greatest of all in his field who opened the gate and explored the heart she said some of his disciples could go beyond him because he made the great beginning he failed i think on the collective unconscious and jung did things freud never got to freud was an intellectual as against jung who was more of an artist intuitively grasping truths that were lost on freud freud used reason i dont genuflect easily but i do here so that i hate to point out the gaps in his great accomplishment killers of the dream is my knowledge and understanding and interpretation of the south the way i lived and studied and experienced and know the south to be if it happened to coincide with some of freuds theories well so it did miss smith mused over current letters now and then in smiling joy and here and there in fierce distaste or weary disapproval criticism today is at a very low point everybody agrees to that no critics today actually love books rather they want to fight writers and peopleto praise or damn them personally we have a disease called faulknerism there is no future in faulkners books he never wrote about his equals he has created no decent women he loathes females and it shows in his work camus is great i dont think sartre is except in his plays and melodramas i dont like anybody really who leaves the future out of his writing were stepping into an enormous future and any great writer must have a vision of that future i dont know a single negro writer who can write about white people they dont understand them neither hate nor fear gives understanding only love does but white people have written truly of negroes because they loved them respected them and believed in them as persons thats the greatest trouble the negro artist has today his feelings against white people make it impossible to create a white character real and whole thirty years ago white writers had the same trouble and wrote of negroes only in stereotypes any valid literary creation takes love i always loved truman capote he always writes with love imagination and delicacy carson mccullers is a beautiful small talent just beautiful nobody writes better of certain aspects of life in perfectly pure memory of childhood i really dont enjoy any american literary writers very much our literary world is not very intellectual oh they have all done nice things you can relish i like european writersthev have an intellectual content we and some of the europens too are still talking about the things dostoevski talked about in were a brainless lot im not still talking in though not still one hundred years behind in thinking and perhaps that is why my writing is more recognized by scientists and intellectual people than by literary people miss smith sternly dissents from the current liberal notion that in race prejudice and negro disadvantage the north and the south are the same the difference in the north and south is the difference between a neurosis and a psychosis she said were sick people racism has made us sick at every level of our culture we kill and they dont in the north its a matter of blindness prejudice and indifference you can be merely prejudiced with out killing people but in the south we kill them then in the south not one of us has escaped in the north millions have you can live there all your life and never see harlem it wont hurt you youre not responsible for it any more than you are for china but we cant get away from it in the south many of us have tried to but every time you walk out your door there are the signs the walls the inhuman dehumanizing separation to manipulate you i could cry when i think how white children have suffered from this the north has a tremendous urban problem complicated by race but we sent the negroes up north we drove them up there the north didnt write letters of invitation asking for them now our people whom we drove away are metamorphosed into victims of the ghetto poverty crime and enough problems to beat us all to death where the north was disturbed in its own psychic organization showed in yankee willingness to be foreign missionaries to us instead of home missionaries to their own black ghettos blaming the south shaking off their own responsibility on the south this maimed the personalities of most northeners with false moral complacency regarding southern community after community desegregating for peace for profit for law and order for business as usual miss smith still thinks the south may lead the way for the nation to racial justice and amity but first she declared solemnly we must humbly confess our sins and ask forgiveness we must suffer more than we havenot because were the southbut to deny old ways and come to right and wisdom how each individual must do it newspapers must acknowledge and espouse the brave truth preachers must preach it in church teachers must teach it in school now were not doing that at all were just sweeping the truth under the rug and not acknowledging our brutal sins and asking forgiveness and our sins are terrible we must face them were moving beautifully she said with a quick bright smile lighting up her face like a girls of course in atlanta you open up everything and never think about why you closed up everything in the first place you must confess your sins and ask forgiveness well never move out of our trouble without this moral act she protested that dangerous writer ayn rand who has the strongest following of any writer in the united states with the dictum anybody who says he can live his own life and be responsible to nobody else is a wicked fool we dont have to be dependent nor can we be independent we must be lovingly and respectfully interdependent the very elegance of the human race is in the love and concern which every member of it always felt for someone else if we do not have this then we have lost our minds and have become evil theres always much talk about the south thats because its a state of mind of white supremacy but my dear always remember that theres a male and female south which are two different entities then theres a black south and a white south which are two more cleavages that makes four souths the south has usually meant the male white south it does not need to mean that any more and indeed it doesnt it is clear that miss smith knows we shall overcome from mccomb mississippi to harlem and stanleyville and shanghai and it is clear that we means gods good thinking human beings under some peculiar quota system it seems that the american public can entertain or lionize only one negro writer at a time thus the price we pay for the justifiable audience granted james baldwin is the unwarranted neglect of richard wright this is a pity because though they have much in common there is much that holds them apart for one thing as evidenced by his recent novel and play baldwin is not at his artistic best when trying in fictional form to make those objective quasiinstructional statements which his social awareness impels him to make he writes directly from his emotions and their expression is the key to what is best in his writing whereas in wright perhaps more than in any other writer of our time except george orwell the combination of involvement and detachment is exactly right to seek out meaning without the tone either of facile preaching or of jeremiad and rather than burdening their fiction it was with both wright and orwell just this seeking that gave life and drama to their novels in any case baldwin and wright are in no way interchangeable a fact that would be too obvious to mention if they were not negroes and therefore to a great part of the public mind indistinguishable aside from their talents they have mainly in common their anger but again they are negroes and writers and this is not an exceptional quality for either american literature has had after all a long train of angry writersone has only to name dreiser or farrell or fast and the negro has just gotten on the end of the train it has taken him a long time to get on board and he has done so at a time when so many of the formerly angry seem to have assuaged their wrath and to have departed for the suburbs where adultery has become the only irritant to their artistic sensibilities it is very important to relate richard wright to this american tradition of angry literature for it is this allegiance that prevents him from being just another negro writer after wright it is probably no longer possible to be just a negro writer he was an american writer it is this distinction that makes wright so important and this that creates such bias in assessing him though he could not avoid an intensely racial awareness he had escaped from the parochial viewpoint it is only a few decades from the major jewish migrations to ludwig lewisohn it is eighty years from the irish migrations to james t farrell but it is over two centuries from the great slave importations to richard wright three centuries from phyllis wheatley the cultured boston slave girl writing dainty english lyrics to the first writer whose consciousness was acutely negro and acutely american if richard wright had written only uncle toms children those four novellas with which he first attracted critical attention his place would have been clear and assured he would have been the outstanding negro writer of his time avidly read by a wide negro audience sympathetically read by those white americans who could be touched by the plight of their negro fellow citizens who could at least respond humanly to pathos as wright confessed he had written stories to make an audience even bankers daughters cry the image he had evoked had as his title indicated been handed down from uncle toms cabin and was the image of the negro maintained by every writer black or white from douglass to fast intent upon creating a favorable impression negroes were goodhearted generous wellmeaning people pathetically suppressed by southern bigotry wrights triumph as an artist was his singleminded determination to get at the truth behind this stereotype as clearly as any other this image was no more complete than the bigots stereotype was in fact compatible with it for if the good darkies were still just that after decades of persecution if they thrived on it wasnt it after all the way to handle them and behind both stereotypes lay the truth that centuries of the souths peculiar institution did more than suppress a people it corrupted them and that corruption was an irresponsible rampant dangerous thing that could destroy corrupted and corrupter alike so wright said of his first novel native son that he was writing a book so hard and deep that they would have to face it without the consolation of tears the hero bigger is a youthful criminal with no ambition except a wistful desire to be an airline pilot and no respect for home family church law or life either black or white perhaps not even his own he accidentally kills the first white woman who has ever treated him humanly but he had already been contemplating raping her he then mutilates and burns the body and tries to collect ransom from the girls father his kindly employer finally he kills his girl friend when the murder is discovered to prevent her giving him away bigger was a bitter draught for those whom uncle toms children had made lachrymose it is doubtful that any white person has ever been moved to pity bigger it is almost impossible to condescend to him that way nor did bigger sit well with those negroes who preferred white america to think black america was still content with offhanded paternalism and willing to go slow toward equality wasnt wright giving fuel to those who said the negro must be kept in his place and those to whom go slow meant at least a millenium had they read native son would not have been able to neglect bigger either they would have found him too like the demon which their paternalistic code of casual cruelty of brutal kindness of genial despotism had tried to appease and subjugate for them to read with any satisfaction wrights indictment of them for having created by that code a subnation of million biggers within the borders of the united states it was one of the constant ironies of richard wrights career that having created what must certainly be the least likeable negro protagonist in our literature he was thereafter continually assailed with charges of negro chauvinism and racial bitterness that were never raised against his first book certainly there is bitterness but it seems called for and firmly grounded in the artistic frame of the novel the charge of chauvinism seems dubious there are in all of wrights novels white men of genuine goodwill whom wright does not belittle for their inability to effect a solution what was offensive was simply the truth it had taken three centuries for someone to look in both directions across that boundary line between races and tell the truth about what he saw and the negro was as hesitant to acknowledge what wright said as was the white man because he had given away the negros most guarded secret the secret he kept because he was afraid of reprisal and which the whites would never try to uncover because their total rationalization of the negros place in american society was constructed to deny it that the black man could hate his white neighbor could envy him and was capable of wishingperhaps carrying outhis destruction multiply bigger thomas twelve million times and you have the psychology of the negro people let us not concern ourselves with the part of bigger thomas confession that says he murdered accidentally who knows when another accident involving millions of men will happen an accident that will be the dreadful day of our doom asks biggers white lawyer and the authors mouthpiece out of his anger wright was always raising this cry this warning which those who did not want to hear dismissed as a biased threat bigger is within each and every negro thus his last book before his death was titled white man listenhis last strident warning which those who preferred obsequiousness to truth took for a threat not to white america alone but to the white race to avoid tragic blindness in dealing with the new nonwhite powers of africa and asia after native son over a decade passed before richard wright published his second novel the outsider by this time wright had been living in paris for a few years and to the criticisms of the earlier novel was added the charge that he was out of touch with america actually the reviews of the outsider in the liberal white press show merely how out of touch white america was how stubbornly the import of what wright had been shouting was being ignored the outsider is not a good book although with all his fiction it shares that excitement that electrifying realism of sensation and violence which is his trademark as surely at it is dashiell hammetts to whom wright has acknowledged a debt the plot is far from simple cross damon its hero is a postal employee with a tiresome wife and a pregnant mistress through mistaken identification with a body in a subway crash he is thought dead takes another identity kills a former buddy when he is about to be discovered joins the communist party and manipulates its leaders for his own ends finally killing two of its leaders out of disgust and is ultimately trapped by a brilliant detective who is like cross an outsider it is melodramatic and strung on a series of implausible coincidences it is his one book where the intellectual rhetoric existential does not cohere to the action but these serious technical flaws aside the reviewers also found its protagonist unmotivated by they were sophisticated enough to understand bigger a poor abused slum negro a stunted brute who hardly knew what he was doing but cross damon is a highly intelligent and educated man a reader of innumerable books a man who has been to a university why should he walk out on everything live by violence disavow all moral rules a man today who believes that he cannot live by the articles of faith of his society is a criminal damon declares it is not necessary to follow the trappings of existentialist dogma that wright invokes fo realize that the negro is by this definition a criminal he has only to realize and accept it to be an outsider clearly because cross is a negro even the reviewers saw that the rules did not apply that is why they cannot see the motivation for dissatisfaction in this brilliant man with his post office job government security and potential retirement in thirty years what more could a negro want there is an implied and subtle barrier to equality of opportunity for cross which is as impenetrable and unavoidable as that in wrights autobiographical account of being forced out of a job because he expressed interest in learning an operation which was white mans work the articles of faith of his society do not necessarily apply to him this has of course been the fate in variable degree of every persecuted minority group in america but the negro has more than any other group been defenseless to its stigma unlike the other major groups only the negro has had no distinctive subcultural values toward which he could proudly turn and snub the larger society coming as captured individuals moved about as chattel having frequently no common language but that of the slavemaster no common religion but that of the slavemaster having no communal existence that was not subject to the slavemaster the negro could not possibly either have imported or created a distinctive subculture he could only adopt the forms he saw about him negro culture is a shadow of the total culture as no other american subculture is and being such its major distinction is its inferiority negro culture is a poor substitute for a fully integrated culture of black and white and exists because by its own standards its members are inferior thus the negro who cannot live by the articles of faith in the larger society must reject also his racial society and exist as an unrelated individual a criminal an outsider the district attorney who traps damon is an intellectual and a hunchback a freak in a manner analogous to that in which the ne gro is a freak in american society and he is therefore quicker to sense damons individuality damon is not able as he has been before to conceal himself behind the negro stereotype to become invisible as a person his disgust and hatred of the society that excludes him are in the open when in white man listen wright tells of the negro who accused him of giving away racial secrets by discussing negro and african psychological attitudes with a white man he is again revealing that selfsame secret that covert hatred it is what the reviewers found unmotivated about cross damon wright gives in his autobiography a terrifying account of a real variant of this type in the person of the elevator operator who short of money refused to take a white passenger to his floor until he paid a quarter for which the white man could have the privilege of kicking him he is a criminal as much as cross though he has foregone his pride to objectify his position in society and as clearly as cross out of his masochism he is making the white man pay for the punishment he inflicts the long dream was wrights last full length novel and like its predecessor it was held up as evidence of his estrangement from the american scene and yet in this chronicle of a negro boy growing up in the american south wright had written the finest and fullest exposition of the corruption of sec ond class citizenship since his autobiography useless to say as of bigger that he was only one brutalized individual caught in an hostile environment useless to exclude cross damon as a faulty abstraction in a world of coincidences the world of fishbelly the hero of the long dream is very real and fishbelly is very normal and his southern society is very real and very normal and very familiar only that reality is corrupt and that corruption is so normal to it that almost no one can consider changing it it is a society where a black mans respectability must be founded on illegal enterprise because legal enterprise would bring him into forbidden competition with whites it is a society where the local government accepts rakeoffs from the illegal enterprise and still can demand servility from the owner because he is black it is a world corrupt enough to reduce any man of goodwill to bewilderment or to cynicism thus the one white man of authority who is sincerely concerned with justice without prejudice is totally baffled and repulsed by the corrupt complex of black and white by the seemingly innate suspicion and dissembling of the negro victims he is trying to help through fear and habit they cannot escape assuming the traditional postures of stereotypes in which they can conceal their defiant hatred at the end of this novel fishbelly now a grown man is in the path of his creator on a plane bound for france wrights conclusion is clear and unequivocal it is not possible for a negro to live as a citizen in this country in the year there was still visibly andmore terribly imbedded in the heartinvisibly the poisonous blight of second class citizenship criminals or exiles this was the choice wright offered the american negro a lot had happened to america and to the negro in particular in the two decades during which wright published the three novels his autobiography and five other books four of them concerned with the black mans burden and yet so little of it is really mirrored in the successive novels it appears only by innuendo bigger is a slum negro with little education cross a lowermiddle class renegade intellectual and fishbelly totally middleclass in outlook for the first two there is no escape no exit except death fishbelly looks forward to a pleasant exile it is progress but it is not very much progress and yet the long dream was published in four years after the supreme court had handed down the school desegregation decision two years after the montgomery bus boycott a year after u s troops had enforced the enrollment of negro students in little rocks central high school nowhere does wright show a cognizance of this march of events the increasing legal economic and moral pressure for equality was wright out of touch after all no wright never lost touch with the one crucial truth that continued to concern him the truth which to him is central to an understanding of the racial dialogue and which the white man must heed at whatever cost to his selfimage which the negro must confess at whatever cost to his the existence of bigger for as wright said there are more biggers than i could count and more than you suspect wright had already stated in million black voices the aspirations of the american negro as tersely as they could possibly be stated we want what others have the right to share in the upward march of american life the only life we remember or have ever known men are moving and we shall be with them bigger said wright was trying to react to and answer the call of the dominant civilization he was an american because he was a native son but he was also a negro nationalist in a vague sense because he was not allowed to live as an american bigger then is not just the hero of wrights first novel but his spirit animates the protagonists of the other two and is the subject of the shorter fiction and the nonfiction dealing with whitenonwhite relations bigger is that quality which will not be at rest until the term negro american is no more selfcontradictory no more expressive of inner conflict and tension than englishamerican irishamerican or at the very least jewishamerican and for bigger this country has indeed shown very small progress legal equality the equality of a black man to a white man in their confrontations with private or public institutions which is now dragging fitfully toward some degree of general implementation has been implicitly resident in the constitution since the end of the civil war legal resources however cannot legislate first class citizenship the news pictures of huddled small groups of negro children separated from their white classmates by more than mere distance in tokenintegrated schools tells the story all too clearly first class citizenship is fully integrated citizenship is social equality is social integration this is the call to which bigger and cross and fishbelly respond it is the call to which wright urges the white man to listen for if the negro is beyond the pale of american society if he cannot become equal in the eyes of his fellow man its laws can never serve him equally if he can never be wholly american he must find a new nationality a black nationality and the rising world stature of asia and africa in the eyes of the west has encouraged such identification certainly with the pacifist social movements popularly associated with the name of martin_luther_king jr american negroes had at last passed not as criminal individuals but as a conscious moral group outside of american society finding in gandhian nonviolence a frame of reference to which they could commit themselves without accepting implicit inferiority and yet they had as their goal nothing more than becoming more fully american in white man listen wright ponders why the american negro is so little rebellious and concludes that he is too committed to american values even to rebel that he has to his country a negative loyalty that is a loyalty that works against him but it must be or should be becoming increasingly clear that every rejection in the attempt to move toward full american citizenship is a thrust toward negro nationalism one of the most remarkable features of the negro revolution is the rate at which the center of the movement is becoming alienated from the traditional american modes thus the naacps roy wilkins has yielded the center to rev king who five years ago was regarded by most as an ultraextremist and due in part to the emergence of the black muslims and in particular the militant followers of malcolm_x the center has now moved toward james farmer of core where the tone of protest has sharpened from prayerful remonstrance to a form of aggressively nonviolent terrorism if these are met by further frustrations there seems only two remaining positions neither of them really tenable the first is violent terrorism which practiced by a minority and one comparatively unarmed could only call forth painful repression the other is total nationalism the solution of malcolm_x and the fact that its proposal is totally unacceptable to white america is the ultimate irony of americas racial history for malcolm_x has urged not integration but segregation on a separate but equal basis what has frightened the country in this proposal then is simply that they realize he is as sincerely determined about the equality as about the separation and this includes the equal right to vote to bear arms and to defend oneself what is frightening about this is not that malcolm_x is a reckless or irresponsible man despite an unpleasant candor in expressing his hatred he has neither done nor threatened any specific acts of hostility and has refused to condemn those of others only as a way of saying that given the circumstances the outbreaks were to be expectedbut that given the proposition that a negro will defend his rights with arms if provoked the use of those arms becomes inevitable for this reason because there are fewer and fewer valid positions left for the negro revolution to take it is beginning to takeas in the core rupture with the national organization which took place this spring in new york nonviolent terrorist actions on an increasingly broad range and under less inspired or responsible leadership like the elevator operator the movement will accept suffering not necessarily directed toward any more specific ends than those of critically discomforting white america this was the meaning of the abortive threat of a worlds fair stallin last year and of course it is the meaning of the riots in the northern ghettos which are not so much against overt police brutality as against the covert white brutality that has created this ironic confrontation that is that the only white man with whom these people have any continuous direct encounters at all is the policeman the riots were not deliberately fomented by black nationalists but had there been no philosophy of black nationalism at hand it would have been generated on the spot because during the riots there was only one way the rioters could regard themselves as a subject nation fighting an oppressor they were no longer americans america did not include them it merely ruled them this is why no matter how conservative his politics the negro continues to show a mischievous satisfaction at the intransigence of countries such as red china egypt and cuba or for that matter at the intransigence of an adam clayton powell who aside from the resentment he engenders in his white political colleagues has little to recommend him to his constituency the cynicismand it is not innocencewith which powell is continually returned to congress is the cynicism of despair of those who have no hope of redress from the government and with this as wright noted in the negros admiration of imperial japan before the war comes the desire of bigger to see the white man particularly the american white man embarrassed and humbled before the dark people of the world this is the legacy of slavery carefully preserved by decades of second class citizenship the voice of bigger then is a voice which must be stilled and must if america is to honor its moral commitments be stilled by the undercutting of its justification for this voice of nationalism is a voice of desperation a voice calling to color because the cry to countrymen has fallen on deaf ears if it is not stilled it must seek exile either the private exile of fishbelly or for those who cannot follow him the exile of a nation in sullen and restless bondageblack nation of malcom x it is not a new argument the debate over the role of the writer iin relation to society dbm and his art has raged for generations and there is no indication that it soon will abate certainly in troubled and dangerous times such as ours there will be disagreement over the role of the writer there are those who hold that it is the writers duty to confine his energies to the creation of a work of art for only through such a creation can he justify his existence and also enlarge the worlds vision and there are those who while agreeing essentially with this view of the writers task see the writer as being uniquely suited to illuminate for his time those values which give dignity and depth to human life and which constantly must be defended against assault in this era of the negro revolt certain negro writers have been criticized for their silence on the other hand many critics and some negro writers have made terrible charges against other negro writers accusing them of riding to fame and fortune on the wings of militance writers like frank yerby a resident of spain have been cited as examples of one position and james baldwin who returned from french exile to add violent fuel to the bursting fires of negro discontent is held up as a brilliant example of the opposite viewpoint the argument goes on increasing in its intensity to help the readerand young writerto understand both sides of the controversy negro digest invited some writers famous and relatively unknown black and white to state what they feel is the task of the negro writer as artist on the following pages the writers speak lerone bennett jr an artist in the situation of a negro ie a situation of oppression and injustice in a segregated society which questions the humanity of all negroes whether they peel potatoes or write poems has special responsibilities and special tasks his first task i believe is to break through to authenticity as a man to hack his way through the dense undergrowth of myths which hide him from himself what is involved here is a perilous search for identity which is not by any means the same for negro artists and white artists in order for a negro artist to reach authenticity he must place himself on trial before the whole of western civilization which he is in but not of to undergo this trial in anguish and in joy to go to the end of himself in order to find the beginning of himself to go to the frontiers of man and to become a new frontier as a man and as an artist to make a new beginning and to project new endings to transcend the lies of power and to judge men by human and not by white standards to come to terms with himself and his history to accept himself to accept the color of his skin and the ambiguity and tension of his experience to see with his own eyes and to hear with his own ears and to find new language and new forms to express what he sees and hears to see negro experience within a wider context to relate that experience to the great human themes of liberation and oppression struggle and growth victory and defeat to express himself directly openly honestly and if necessary brutally without a prior check with the white other to emancipate himself from the limitations of the white culture structure and the subtle tyranny of white audiences to stand face to face with life as a man black and comely these i believe are the tasks of the negro artist beyond all that i believe it is incumbent on negro artists to involve themselves in the struggle for the liberation of man artists who inhabit a heaven called art high above harlem and white plains are deceiving themselves by their silences which echo as loudly as their words they are playing a social role serving despite themselves the interests and needs of their oppressors in sum i believe negro artists should cling to the french literary concept of engagementfor the simple fact is that the negro is born engaged and he lies as an artist and as a man if he believes he can disengage himself by adding the word artist to the word negro arna bontemps though writers are traditionally at loggerheads with their society they seldom escape its pressures and this becomes doubly apparent in the case of the negro writer in the united states as long as the society itself remains segregated in any significant areas the inner world of the writer whether negro or white for that matteris likely to reflect this condition and the selfexpression of the negro is likely to seem somewhat different however i do not think we need to worry about such difference i dont think it will necessarily be bad it may sometimes be a blessing nothing in the creative process is more important than being ones self john henrik clarke the negro writer and his people are now standing at the crossroads of history this is the negro writers special vantage point and this is what makes the task and the mission of the negro writer distinctly different from that of the white writer the negro writer concerned with creating a work of art in a segregated society has a double task first he has to explain the society to himself and create his art while opposing it second he cannot be honest to himself or his people without lending his support at least verbally to the making of a new society that respects the dignity of men the negro writer must realize that his people are now entering the last phase of a transitional period between slavery and freedom it is time for the negro writer to draw upon the universal values in the negros experience just as sean ocasey and sholem aleichem drew upon the universal values in the experiences of the irish and the jews in the next phase of negro writing a literature of celebration must be creatednot a celebration of oppressionbut a celebration of survival in spite of it nathan hare the negro writer should be i think a bit more of a rebel since he and his race have more at stake he ought to tackle the very foundations of the society that tramples him and set fire to the false notions that bind in one way or another both negroes and whites some negro writers seek safety in an artforartssake approach they have got the idea from whites that protest is not art and that a negro writer who is a negro first last and always whether he wants to admit it or not should be a writer first and a negro second part of the negro writers job then is to help shape the thinking of negroes themselves to goad them to keener indignation all of this however should reach beyond the bounds of narrow protest against discrimination and aim toward a general revamping of a morally decadent society zack gilbert the negro writer should maintain his individuality his honesty and above all develop his craft and artistic skills without art i i the protest is lost the message unimportant if the message can be put over without surrendering the art good gwendolyn brooks has many times so beautifully accomplished this in her poetry as baldwin has done with the essay and killens with the novel therefore it is up to the young negro writer to voice these things of substance with the highest literary skills possible the white writer however is not exempted because of his broader liberties he has the same obligations to deliver a work of depth and purpose to a sick and controversial society conrad kent rivers the negro writer is his worst enemy we have seen one or two survive the anger of their prose his task is to stomach his individual experience and personal history no matter how much it hurts inside if he can manage this feat then there is nothing left for him to do except to master his craft and to tell the story according to the character of his personal history this is a deathgiving universe time is short i think it takes a full life to weave a full story any writer white or black must be read on more than one level i do not believe that life has a special meaning for any particular sect a good writer spends his words but he cannot squander the good things of life harvey swados i must preface any comment on the task of the negro writer by observing that particularly at this point in american historyit would be presumptuous for any white writer to offer gratuitous advice to any negro writer however once i am asked i should observe that the first task of any literary artist is to write honestly and well regardless of who might be hindered or helped by his work in this sense the task of the negro writer cannot be said to differ from that of his white colleague the main danger for an artist working in a segregated society however is that he may permit rage to degenerate into hate rage has informed some of the greatest masterworks of the ages but hate h as poisonous and selfdefeating in art as it is in politics howard n meyer the special task of the negro writer is to communicate with the submerged masses of his people only a fraction of whom have responded to the challenge of the epochto tell them whatever the form of his art the truth about their condition in its new affirmative sense that the hope of reconstruction of society can now be a reality if they will but awaken howard n meyer a new york attorney is a parttime historian and writer he wrote the introduction to the collier s edition of col wentworth higginsons classic army life in a black regiment and contributes articles to various literary and quarterly magazines his biography of gen ulysses s grant let us have peace is set for fall publication dudley randall in the nineteen thirties richard wright published a blueprint for negro writers perhaps it guided him to his achievement but it may only have misled another writer as each has his own unique temperament education experience beliefs and vision he is not an interchangeable part to be inserted into a blueprint or a machine the commissar of culture no matter what name he masquerades under is avid to seize and manipulate power and is greedy to use the writer in his power game first he flatters and then muzzles the writer we have seen this happen in russia this creature can be recognized by his practice of dictating to others what he believes they should think or write because of this danger the writer cannot be subservient to leaders politicians critics the public or even to his race but must serve only the truth as he sees it and often the truth may be unpalatable to one or all of these in his search for truth the writer may explore the racial struggle or purely personal themes or both since he feels both external and internal pressures whatever his themes his allegiance is not to politicians popularity or power but solely to truth as he sees it by his rendering of truth he will live or die if american negro writers need examples they can study writers of other oppressed peoples since distance gives objectivity to see how they created art which works are living and meaningful or ephemeral and spurious and why william demby american negro writers are suddenly free free from the need to make propaganda free from the need to protest free from the need to dramatize sociological theses these are being acted out in realityin the sitins in the freedom marches in the demonstrations and strikes of protest now american negro writers can explore the uncharted depths of art can weave an identity for themselves and for their brothers exploring the mysteries of identity can be dangerous the rewards for the artistand the society from which he has been spawnedcan be great william demby recently returned to the u s from italy where he had lived and worked for many years author of the little known underrated novel beetlecreek he bids for fresh attention this spring with a new novel the catacombs to be released by pantheon in june gwendolyn brooks the task of the negro writer in any sort of society is the task of every writer to clarify his interior and to deliver thoroughly and only the messages urged by that clarity gwendolyn brooks winner of a pulitzer prize for poetry is author of five volumes of poetry annie allen a street in bronzeville the bean eaters bronzeville boys and girls for children and selected poems plus a novel maud martha she conducts a seminar in poetry at chicagos columbia college ossie davis the task of the negro writer is revolutionary by definitionbeginning inward he must take his consciousness of himself as a negro the specific joy or terror of what being a negro means in a segregated society and he must expand that consciousness exploding outwardhe must make of himself a hammer and against the racially restricted walls of that society he must strike and strike and strike again until something is destroyedeither himselfor the prison walls that stifle him ossie davis a veteran broadway and screen actor is author of the hit play purlie victorious which was filmed under the title gone are the days he is also author of tv scripts and of a new play tailored especially for his actress wife ruby dee his latest movie is the hill kristin hunter beyond saying that the negro writer should try to be as good a writer as he can i can hardly presume to dictate his role he may choose not to be a negro writerthat is a writer about negoesat all i think the freedom to make this choice is ultimately one of the freedoms negroes are presently fighting for but if he chooses to deal with negro materialor to put it more accurately if that is the material that chooses himhe will need every bit of his skill and a thick skin as well for he is bound to be criticizedby white liberals who think he should be more noble by black nationalists who think he should be more angry or by dear genteel aunt jenny who teaches school and thinks lowclass colored people are literally too vulgar for words if in spite of these deterrents the negro writer chooses to express the splendid negro culture of which he is a part let him not neglect the great tradition of white western culture of which he is also a part his task will be to mediate between these two cultures which have been misunderstanding and mis bill gunn his the negro writers task is to be true to whatever it is that compels him to write be it race problems love or the romance of buttoncollecting it should not differ selfconsciously because of race in or out of a segregated society it will differ from those of other writers because his experience is different i should think that anything which distracts him away from his own creative flow like paying too much attention to the publics expectations or a lack of personal discipline could be destructive to the artists individual genius bill gunns first novel all the rest have died was published last winter he is an actor of note a winner of the new york critics award and author of the plays marcus in the high grass produced in and the celebration and the ghinko trees new plays he is writing his second novel nat hentoff the basic task of any writer is to find and be himselfas deeply and wholly as possible for some that finding and growing involves commitment to some kind of social action either directly or through the use of his art as a means of awakening exacerbating or otherwise forcing others to find fzemselves in the context of the society they live in are compressed by or are accomplices of for others finding oneself may mean a retreat in one way or another from that society in aestheticism or nihilism or just plain disgust and of course there is an infinite variety of choiceswhen they are choicesin between but no matter what the choice the man making the choice is inescapably shaped by who he is where he is and the kind of society he is in therefore a negro writer in a segregated societyand obviously american society is still segregatedwill find his search to discover and be himself qualitatively different in its complications and emotional layerswithinlayers from that of a wasp or a jew or let us say from any white who has made a deliberate choice to be an outsider or from a white who has deliberately tried to see the society from below what i am trying to say is that the negro writers task is fundamentally no different from that of any other writer but his means of coping with that task almost inevitably involve perspectives with regard to his society and the ways it has operated and tried to operate on him that may lead to a much more penetrating knowledge of himself in relationship to his society than most white writers in america are likely to achieve from being forced into the role of the outsider he can see more of the whole than can the white writer because he is part of that whole at the same time that he has been exiled from his center what specific role he then takes depends on his particular background capacities temperament and diligence at selfexploration c eric lincoln the fundamental prerequisites of a work of art are two it must be a rendition of what is true it must be beautiful its truth need not be mimetical it need not be a slavish reproduction of some existing quantity but to be art it must interpret accurately some tenor of emotion or some quality of existence its beauty derives from its consistency of form and the relatedness of its parts to each other and to the whole in a segregated society the task of the negro creative writer is no different from that of the writer who lives in utopia an artist he he paints the world he sees the creative artist brings to his work a history of experience through which he sees the world his art is an expression of what he has seen what he reasons and what he imagines if it is good art it will be true and beautiful even when it wrenches the heart and tears at the soul ernest i gaines the writer regardless of his race must write about human nature he must write about mans feelings no man sings all the time or weeps all the time or hates or loves or dances all the time his lifewhether he is a peasant of the society or a member of that societys aristocracyis a combination of all these things the task of the negro writer as well as that of any other writer is to see man and write about him as clearly and as honestly as he possibly can alex haley i see as the negro writers task today the wielding of his artist influences to recast the predominantly distorted universal images of the negro we negro writers certainly are betterequipped than white writers to portray our own race we vastly better knowand were immeasurably more privy to the subject of ourselves plus these where white writers at best can only appropriate negro material the negro writer has a mandatebecause theres no nation or race today considered oppressed or inferior whose pens have created a corpus of great literature since this is the goal of every societys writers id say that essentially anyway our task isnt different from white writers but i think that we negro writers do have today an exexhilarating greater personal motivational challenge than white writers have its the challenge to do justice by all of this formidable wealth of negro material that we sit on top of its subject matter thats practically virginal by comparison with the most of white ethnic material which by now has been pretty thoroughly combed lennox raphael if the writer is honest he can perform his function as an artist and as a human being by facing up to his personal vision the negro writer however has a particular job his trumpet is his imagination and judgment as is the trumpet of any serious writer rather than his skin or the easy quotient of oppression which like a smart whore has mislaid so many negro writers if one is an artist and if one accepts this role as a vocation that is above all a gift then there is no excuse for mediocrity the writer must first of all be writer craftsman and lord of his imagination it is only from this premise that the eccentricities of his skin can be branched out as an advertisement for himself skin whether one is black or white and primarily when one is black must be regarded simply as an advertisement a publicity gimmick ones walking phallus but skin is not ones thinking and one cannot depend on skin if one intends to do battle with every foe in the literary arena the negro writer must understand that society has lent him the role of bullfighter and that in the hands of this danger he must create a thing of beauty which will lend distinction to the struggle of his people in his society there are many bulls and many aficionados but the ring must never be allowed to grow larger than ones talent for this regardless of ones skin can only mean the end of ones strivings the negro writer must learn his craft for it is craft that gives vision beauty subtlety and unhistrionic anger to ones work it is easy to be angry but it is much harder to shape this anger into something that will endure and at the same time impart an aura of humanness to ones life and work william m kelley the task of the negro writer should differ from that of the white writer in that among other things he should be addressing himself to the negro unfortunately the negro is the last person to whom the negro writer speaks so that now both the white and the negro writer address themselves to the white man the negro writer believes that he must tell the white man where its at as if the white man has oppressed the negro for the last years without really being aware of it the negro writer has turned himself into a reverse court jester he comes before the king and on cue tells the king how cruel how evil the king is when the jester is finished the king feels wonderful he is certain that any country with a king so fairminded as to permit his jester to speak to him in such a way is must be a country of justice and equality the negro writer must use his art and art it must be not propaganda to help the negro to find those things that were robbed from him on the shores of africa to help repair the damage done to the soul of the negro in the past three centuries thomas paine did not address himself to the british he spoke rather to the american colonists if he had done otherwise america today might still be a colony ronald l fair when it became apparent to my friends some years ago that i was determined to have my say as a writer those close enough to me to offer advicebeing concerned about the possibility of my having some small degree of successcautioned me not to waste my energies writing about negroes they said richard wright was the only writer who had successfully written about the negro and since i was not richard wright there was no chance of my ever being heard this of course was before the great james baldwin had been heard from well for some reason i listened to them i began a novel about white people i was half way through the novel before i realized that i had sold out myself and my people i had a long discussion with myself on paper of course and concluded that there were enough white writers distorting reality and showing the world a kind of makebelieve totally white america that never really acknowledged the existence of the negro when it dawned on me that if i had not stopped when i did i would have ended as just another tom i was furious i tore the manuscript into little pieces page by page i lit a match to it and watched it bum with all the ceremoniai intensity of an early christian witnessing the last supper i was free for the first time in my life i really knew that i was proud to be a negro and not afraid to shout it i had succeeded in convincing myself that the old belief that negroes could not do what they wanted to do unless they first had the approval of the man was a myth there was just too much that had to be said that couldnt be said by white writers for me to turn my back on it i didnt know what the future held for me as a negro writer writing about negroes but i didnt care because i was free i doubted that i would ever make any money as a writer of this kind of fiction but this didnt matter either because i would be telling it like it is i decided that i should continue on my job and write at night and that i would never be afraid to look a white man in the eye and tell him that he had acted like a barbarian i remember thinking that there must be white people in the world who would like to know the truth about what it is like to be a negro about how the negro feels with someone standing on his head and i was determined to tell them no more polite lies no more biting of the tongue or twisting of truths richard wrights death would mean something because i would keep him in mind and swing away i cannot speak for other writers we are as different from one another as we are from the society that tortures us so however i can speak for myself as a negro writer i realize that mine is only one faint voice among thousands but i must remain idealistic enough to think that my voice will be heard because it speaks the truth i must continually recharge myself with the sorrow and frustration of my people although it is painful as hell because the white man has lied for four hundred years and if he could have his way he would go on indefinitely denying that we exist i am a voice for my people and if i dont speak out they may never be heard by louie robinson a c o b freeman j y looked out across his barren the winding road and the four men coming up it and he let out a heavy sigh first there had been the long dry spell and what it had done to his crops then the store in town where he could get the most credit had gone busted and now this jacob allowed as how it was the lords right to test him but he just hoped the lord knew what he was doing straining his eyes a little jacob tried to make out just who the four men were there was first of all sheriff john holman that figured then there was ben thompson toad thompson called him and the was more or less accurateand his halfbrother will that figured too there wasnt a worse town rumor had it that either one was scared without the other which didnt make much difference since they were always together and to gether they were a terror then there was mr frank dawson that was a surprise mr dawson was the head of the bank not that this meant too much in itself banks didnt let colored people have any money but everybody else in town probably owed mr dawson which meant that he could have something to say about who could get credit where and who couldnt jacob decided that maybe this thing was even worse that he had feared at first every element of the county was against him the four men came up through the front gate and right on to the porch without calling out a greeting and jacob took this to be a bad sign in itself good mornin sheri good momin mr dawson mr ben mr will jacob called out with hopeful friendliness jacob we come out to have a little talk with you the sheriff said his voice was stern matteroffact dashing jacobs hopes well yall come up on the porch and sit down jacob said lamely waving to a couple of dilapidated chairs and the roughhewn railing on the weatherbeaten front porch we didnt come to sit toad thompson said shortly well what did yall come to talk about jacob asked hoping that he sounded properly ignorant you know clanged good and well what we come to talk about toad thompson said loudly its about that daughter of s yourn tryin to go to the state university the sheriff said she aint tryin goddang it shes there toad thompson cut in well shes gonna have to get out the sheriff said we dont intend to have any darkies from buck county startin trouble over there why i aint seen mary lou in six months jacob protested wringing his black workworn hands she didnt tell me nothin about goin to school shes been workin over at andersonville and didnt say nothin to me about goin to school i didnt know nothin about this until yesterday when somebody in town told me it was all in the papers that my mary lou had gone up there and got herself in the white folks college they said it was on the tv and everything but i didnt know nothin about it she didnt tell me she was goin to school jacob was almost pleading when he stopped talking then banker dawson spoke for the first time youve always been a pretty good boy jacob he said softly you never got into any trouble you work out here on this farm of yours and you mind your own business you never get out of your place we like colored people like that it shows those northern agitators that we can live in peace down here but you can understand how a thing like thisyour very own daughter going up there to the state universitymeans trouble jacob bad trouble now you dont want any trouble do you jacob no sir i dont want any trouble jacob answered feeling that truer words he had never spoken well then banker dawson went on what you need to do is get mary lou down here and straighten her out maybe if you get her out of that school and keep her quiet folks around town will accept that as your apology for all this fuss and wont think hard of you i think we ought to let him know whats going to happen if he dont git her out of there toad thompson said menacingly i think he may have to find out that we know what to do with uppity niggers jacob wondered why the thompson brothers were getting so riled up they and none of their kin had ever been to any kind of school so he couldnt see what difference it made to them who was up at that college i think a talkinto is good enough for now sheriff holman said but you aint got much time jacob you aint got much time at all toad thompson added as the four men turned to go will thompson hadnt said a word the whole time they had been there jacob realized but then he figured that wasnt too surprising because he hardly ever said anything usually just nodding his head and grinning while his halfbroth er talked some said that was because will didnt have half his brains some said it was because will had no brains at all but jacob freeman did not have time to dwell upon the content of will thompsons head he turned from the porch and with a feeling of deep emptiness in the pit of his stomach walked inside the old house in the kitchen fussing around the wood stove was his wife sarah at the table sat his oldest son luther who was seventeen and his youngest son simon fourteen well what are yall lookin at me for jacob said defensively yall heard em they said i got to git mary lou out from up there at the white folks school they blamin me for whats happened me and i didnt even know she was goin what are you going to do about it jacob his wife asked eyeing him carefully what am i goint to do about it jacob hollered are you crazy woman the white folks say i got to git mary lou out of there thats exactly what im gonna do no you aint sarah hissed with such sudden quiet force that it seemed that every sound and movement on earth stopped jacob was shocked he had been a bachelor for thirty of his years on gods green earth and in the twentytwo years that he had been married to sarah since then she had never once disputed him now when it meant his very neck she had decided to oppose him jacob looked hard at the small thin pecancolored woman who he had taken from a farmers cotton patch when she was sixteen and made his wife she had been quiet and obedient as a child yet her willowy enticing figure had held a womans fullblown passions and he had loved her in ways that he had never found words to tell her but nownow she stood defying him her eyes hot coals of anger her mouth set in grim determination you must didnt hear me good woman he roared i said damn you jacob freeman dont you shout at me sarah cried as tears tried unsuccessfully to escape her eyes you a big man inside this old rundown house aint you here theres just me and the children to raise your voice to but i didnt hear you out there shoutin at them white folks i didnt hear you tellin them what you was gonna do and what you was not gonna do jacob did not mean to sit down so suddenly in the chair it was just that he was so thunderstruck that he all at once lost control of his legs and had gone plop when he found his voice it did not seem familiar to his own ears have you lost your senses sarah the white folks may i havent lost my senses ive come to my senses jacob and quit tellin me what white folks say i say its time for you to stand up and be a man in front of your sons here why is it always the negro woman who has to advance the race from harriet tubman to mary bethune it has been the negro woman who has had to do it all and in this family it seems like its me and mary lou so jacob realized it had all been her doing behind his back she had been putting these integration ideas into mary lous head and even now simon and luther were sitting there looking at him with what he could only call contempt this is all your fault jacob said sternly youre the cause of all this fuss i am not the cause of it sarah said it is the fault of all the colored men since the beginning of time colored men in africa who shouldnt have sold their people into slavery colored men who shouldnt have let themselves be made slaves colored men who have been lettin themselves and their women and their children be slaves ever since you been readin that stuff in that ebony magazine about where colored folks come from jacob accused i been doin a lot of things sarah told him and one of them is thinkin and ive decided that if the man i was married to was too dumb to see that his children had too much brains to work farms and clean kitchens and wash other folks clothes then it was up to me to do what had to be done do you know what this means jacob asked slowly yes i do sarah answered it means we goin to stand up with our heads high and be able to look our children in the face as long as we live even if that aint too long i told you i was goin and git mary lou jacob said trying to get back his authority then you aint going to eat another meal in my kitchen or sleep another night in my bed sarah said jacob felt a hundred years old it took all of his strength to get up from the chair and walk out of the kitchen he had lived with white folks a long time and he had always done what he was told to do he had gotten along that way but having them down on himmaybe even trying to hurt himwas one thing and having sarah against him was something else barred for life from her table and bed jacob was an old man it was true but he wasnt so old that he didnt appreciate the fact that sarah at thirtyeight was still much of the same female he had married when she was sixteen not the little girl part but that redblooded woman part and for the first time in all of his fiftytwo years jacob considered the possibility that there were some things in this world more important than white folks jacob walked out to the woodshed in back and took down the three shotguns that belonged to him and luther and simon he got some oil and rags and things and walked back to the rear steps and sat down and carefully began cleaning the guns every now and then he glanced back through the kitchen window at sarah and then skyward toward the lord he sure hoped they knew what they were doing autobiographers are presumptuous and adventurous they serve themselves all trussed up for the reading publics appetite and have no way of knowing how theyll be digested still the demands of this literary form can give the autobiographer some guiding for autobiography requires the reporters devotion to facts the novelists sense of narration the historians grasp of the meaningful past and the stripteasers ability to exhibit private matters with taste and art considering the flavoring of autobiographical hors doeuvres dick gregorys nigger dutton is seasoned with too much narration verging towards fantasy and exhibitionism verging towards vulgarity and not enough of the other ingredients to be blunt the book is an emetic and any value in it must be derived from its medicinal rather than enriching qualities you dont digest this book you react to it you react mainly to gregorys conception of his hero himself gregory belongs to what might be called the little golden book school of biography little golden books are syrupy biographies of the childhoods of famous americans in which distorted and invented experiences of the hero as a child are slanted to explain the achievements of the hero as a man these books are geared for the minds of grade school children it is questionable however whether it is proper for an adult to write such a book for an adult audience and about himself with supreme tastelessness and unabashed puerility gregory describes his impoverished boyhood as if he were ordained by godwith whom he professes to have been on speaking termsto become a great and famous man we hear of wrinkled old ladies kindly witches in this tale who see stars on his brow symbolizing success or have visions of him carrying an expensive brown briefcase in an airplane terminal and gregory tells us about a mysterious superhuman force which he affectionately dubs the monster that seeps through him when he appears before a crowd this monster heaved up its head from the morass of squalor humiliation and shame which marred gregorys childhood environment and strengthened the young gregory as he escaped his background by becoming a big man in the public eye whether he is running track politicking in high school telling jokes or fighting for negro rights gregory describes his insatiable need for public acclaim as a result of this monsters influence but gregory is not critical enough of his monster many men including saints have attributed their actions to a forces which transcends them but is gregorys cause a holy one can one equate the monster that compels one to devote himself to a moral cause with a monster that forces one to run his guts out on the track field or to one which justifies hypocrisy in high school class presidency elections or makes one deprive his friends of needed cash so he can rent a night club gregory cant distinguish between monsters he thinks that the monstrous mon ster the child of hunger and shame which makes him a performer first and a man second is the same one which inspires him to expose himself to southern assassins and sacrifice his career as a comic on the altar of negro rights gregory in short confuses the monster of the devil with the monster of the spirit the compulsion to perform with the necessity to lead one hopes that the motivation which girds gregory when he fights for civil_rights is not so ambivalent as nigger leads one to believe during the first two thirds of nigger the reader is bludgeoned with fairy tale morality and insufferable conceit egotism overrides ethics and it is not until gregorys wallet is fattened that he begins to show some awareness of the feeling of others but even the rich dick gregory doesnt seem to be entirely aware of why he does things this is a stiff charge but doesnt come by way of character assassination the pattern of gregorys actions from child to man reveals him adapting whatever talents he has or manipulating any situation to play a role that will please those he feels to be his superiors but often hurts those he considers at least his equal the role itself hardly seems to matter it can range from a farinabuckwheat role to that of a social hero but it is always a performers role which avoids exposure of the real human being that is why gregorys childhood is shrouded in fiction that is why gregory explains his rise from rags to riches as if some mystical force animated him that is why he refuses to make clear connections between the degradation of his boyhood and his awkward scramble for money fame and at this time power and that is why i suppose he couldnt wait for a little golden book biographer to cononize him in the candy store of american fe noses of many negro children are roughly pressed against the outer pane it hurts some more than others it ennobles some and rots others some get in and some dont dick gregory got in and the fact that he seeks to change the stores interior makes him loom larger than the common contented man is his stature the result of selfinflation bigness of characteror both john woodford
would you want one of them to marry your daughter james baldwin made one of the sharpest observations he has made in his short illustrious life one sunday over television when he stared long and hard at john kilpatrick southern genteel aristocrat from old virginia and stated r i matteroffactly youre not worried about me marrying your daughter youre worried about me marrying your wifes daughter ive been marrying your daughter ever since the days of slavery in the whole body of negrowhite dialogue which has collected for over a hundred years this bugaboo about marrying mister charlies daughter is the non sequitur to end all non sequiturs indeed it would be ludicrous if white americans had not made into a subjective reality that was historically an objective irrelevance the fact of the matter is the american negro is the most multicolored people on this planet and not because old black joe married missy ann or because uncle tom raped little eva so let us try to put some of these myths to rest once and for all during slavery old massa kept his white wife on a pedestal by throwing aunt jemima down on the big house bed or the trips he took down to the cabins to rape aunt hagars defenseless younguns so that while old missus was withering on the vine like a raisin in the sun the kindly master was likely to be sowing black oats and making heaps of yaller chilluns along with his son and heir and those who worked for him and thats how the american black race became so many colors from coalebony all the way across the spectrum to blond and pinkish white frances anne kimbel a famous english actress who married a slaveholding georgia plantation owner describes in a letter to a friend a conversation she had had with sophy a slave it was not an unusual conversation within the context of the southern slavery system but it serves to demonstrate this aspect of that peculiar institution sophy went on to say that isaac was her son by driver morris white who had forced her while she was in her miserable exile at five pound almost beyond my patience with this string of detestable details i exclaimedfoolishly enough heavens knows ah but dont you knowdid nobody ever tell you that it is a sin to live with men who are not your husbands alas elizabeth what could the poor creature answer but what she did seizing me at the same time vehemently by the wrist oh yes missis we knowwe know all about dat well enough but we do anything to get our poor flesh some rest from the whip when he made me follow him into the bush what use me tell him now he has the strength to make me or lend your ears to mary boykin chestnut a great white southern lady speaking of slavery as she knew it god forgive us but ours is a monstrous system a wrong and an iniquity like the patriarchs of old our men live all in one house with their wives and their concubines and the mulattoes one sees in every family partly resemble the white children any lady is ready to tell you who is the father of all mulatto children in everybodys household but her own those she seems to think drop from the clouds the mother of my maternal grandfather was thirteen years old when my grandfather was born notwithstanding the fact that he was born more than a decade after slavery kindly masters had apparently not given up their slaverytime prerogatives young master old masters favorite son raped my greatgrandmother when she was twelve and he was a gay blade of twentyone needless to say the young cutup did not make an honest woman out of my greatgrandmother that is not the way things were done in those days evolving out of this mongrelization of a proud and pure race there grew a people who came to be designated as negroes mulattoes quadroons or octoroons the dictionary is very helpful and enlightening on this subject accordingly an octoroon is a person having oneeighth negro blood the offspring of a quadroon and a white do i hear you ask but what in the devil is a quadroon a quadroon is a person who is onefourth negro the offspring of a mulatto and a white and a mulatto is the offspring of parents of whom one is white and the other a negro now let us find out what a negro is a negro is a person having more or less negro blood so you see after all the rigmarole an octoroon is a negro a quadroon is a negro a mulatto is a negro a negro is a negro is a negro is a negro any questions in many southern states one drop of black blood in your white veins makes you an american negro we black folk are indeed a powerful race of people i mean we really left our imprint on the nation and now it must be stated that although old massa or young massa for that matter never married the young black saplingofalass whom he had got in a family way he very often gave preferential treatment to her and his progeny his and hers were often allowed to play with the masters legitimate children the young bucks wore young massas handmedowns and sometimes the young heifers inherited the young missys last years prettythings they were allowed to clean old massas boots and sometimes lick them in the bargain thus was an aristocracy of color established which in many instances still persists the more you resembled the folks in the big house the better off you were you were a house nigger and you came to be contemptuous of field niggers the toilers and the sweaters who were mostly pure and black just like theyd come from mother africa but you were also contemptuous of yourself because you hated that part of you that wasnt like the master race and deep down inside you thought of yourself and others like you as bastards even though you were the bastards of the privileged you looked at yourself through the eyes of the big house people who thought of you as bastards notwithstanding with your white blood you were better off than the pure blacks working the fields of cotton thus literary myths were also created even by such formidable and wellmeaning stalwarts as harriet beecher stowe the myth that only mulatto niggers were sassy and militant and hard to control because of their white blood which naturally responded negatively to enslavement and pure blacks were meek and docile and childlike and hardworking though they were lazy and had to be driven or so the scripts of the black myths read always written by white writers but what they failed to explain was the pure blacks of the harriet tubman and nat turner ilk and all those other black rebellious souls great harriet tubman little black woman moses of her people who escaped slavery via the underground railroad but was not satisfied with her own freedom she couldnt sit still till the south was free she went back south deep down into egypt land nineteen times with a price on her head dead or alive and she led more than three hundred slaves to freedom a rifle always at her side she was the greatest underground conductor of them all her boast my train never ran off the track and i never lost a passenger and old nat turner black and strong and mighty in his righteous anger insurrectionist whose religion was freedom a religious fanatic in the great tradition of toussaint louverture and gabriel prosser denmark vesey or old john brown of bloody kansas neither could this script of myths explain those black folk who staged slowdowns all over the old plantation south when they broke the hoes and plows and other farming implements accidentallyonpurpose but the hegemony of color was established and persisted it was established by the establishment and for the blessed establishment it was a part of the great brainwash every negro was taught that the closer you were to white the better off you were in the eyes of the man the white man that is and the white mans eyes were the ones that mattered it was in him the power resided he spread the table where there were highclass crumbs for the gitting so the octoroon looked down upon the quadroon who looked down upon the mulatto and all looked down upon the low man on the totem pole who was hopelessly and helplessly black and had no one to look down upon so good hair and bad hair and high yaller became a part of the language desperate negro mothers massaged the noses of black babies trying to mold them into thinner and narrower shapes the endless futule admonitions dont poke out your mouth itll make you grow to have big ugly lips dont drink coffee itll make you black the myths of abnegation black folks study evil a black gal sleeps with her fists balled up i grew up in this kind of culture steeped in selfhatred and yet somehow our selfhatred was not as deepseated as might be imagined somehow despite the great brainwash we loved ourselves and loved each other i remember madame walkers hair straightener and i recall the aroma of burned hair and vaseline even now my mind makes pictures of tired hands and straightening combs and bleaching creams and for us boys the pomades the slickums with which we plastered our poor heads the stocking cap in which we slept all night long then up south in new york and other up south cities the process discovered to straighten black mens hair and so the conk came into vogue though it did not catch every black mans fancy it was probably at that time that many black men began to see the ridiculous lengths to which we had extended ourselves in order to resemble the master race yes old massa really started something but at this point in time and space we are ringing down the curtain sure there were negro churches in the south even in my time where a man with a black face had better not set foot unless he was the janitor there were negro colleges which had quotas for those with very dark complexions and in places like charleston south carolina or washington d c some of us were antinegro and colorconscious to a degree that bordered on sickness but we are ringing down the curtain notwithstanding the formidable debrainwashing job before us we black folk are ringing down the curtain in the west indies even to this day old massa oftentimes had thirty and forty mulatto children borne by ten or twelve black women in many of these cases though mister charlie hardly ever married any of them he oftentimes had at least one of them living with him in the big house and others stashed out vying for his favor the offspring of such situations more often than not rejected their true mothers out of hand and basked in the sunshine of their benevolent great white fathers to give the devil his due though for the life of me i cant think why i should old massa often treated such offspring more or less as his own children they came to make up the managerial class on the plantation and when the great white father passed on the plantation often went to his mulatto children this progressive paternalism has created a color caste in much of the caribbean the lines of which are drawn far sharper than any to be found in the usa many west indian mulattoes even today regard themselves as colored and look upon black west indians as negroes even niggers or darkies and obviously a lesser people yet in spite of this the establishment would have us believe that the entire struggle between black and white in this country has its roots in the determination of the whites to hold the line and maintain the purity of the races and the sanctity of the southern womanhood while the black man lives only for the day when he will catch miss anne with her restrictions down and that all else is verbiage and hypocrisy civil_rightsthe right to vote the right to work the right not to be lynched all the slogans about freedom and justice and equalityare merely part of a black master plan to get the black man into the white womans bed so he can mongrelize the races it is a peculiar fact that marrying whiteys daughter is always the first line of defense set up by the southern white man against the black yet it appears nowhere in the bill of particulars set forth by the black man in his case against the white establishment examine for days monthsyears if you willthe records of the naacp of core the urban league or sncc and you will find in none of their varied programs one single slogan about the right to marry mister charlies daughter historically it has always been a smoke screen set up by the white establishment to becloud any just demand of black folks its overall aim has been to maintain the status quo to keep the negro in his place at the bottom of the economic ladder and incidentally to keep the poor white near enough the bottom so that both of them would be shackled forever together in bondage to the southern way of life the poor white oftentimes had nothing save his vaunted whiteness to distinguish him from the black man just beneath him and what easier ruse than to convince him that his whiteness was in jeopardy that the black man wanted only to bed down with his white women to destroy his whiteness thus the black mystique had its humble beginnings as an economic and political expediency in order to carry out the grand design for exploitation known as the southern way of life you had to deny the black man any social or sexual equality because the alternative was to admit to the world and to the poor white southerner that the negro was not a beast but a man like any other man but if you kept him an animal obviously you would not be expected to invite him into your home to break bread at your table and eventually to marry your daughter or even grant him certain inalienable rightsto vote to hold office to work other than as a beast of burden to enjoy life liberty and the pursuit of happinessbecause they were not endowed him by his creator but a mystique is never static in order to maintain it you must improve upon it to the myth of the animallike sexual obsession of the black man you must add the myth of great sexual prowess he is generously equipped for the sex act like a stud horse and equally tireless yet there is this too about mystiques eventually everybody believes the myths both the victims and the victimizers the mythmakers become the victims of their own propaganda so that when whitey the last of the great myth makers comes face to face with his victim the black man he really believes he stands before his sexual superior there is yet another dimension to this portrait is it not possible that the white man sees his own lust reflected in the black mans eyes a guilt constructed out of centuries of playing the role of sheik in the great white harem where black men were eunuchs and black women were concubines and though number one wife was always white she was merely a figurehead a wife and mistress in name only the black man a eunuch no longer looks upon all this and wonders has the great white harem made loveless all of white america have americans become a people anxious to be loved but incapable of loving has the black mystique developed a feeling of impotency that borders on a sexual inferiority complex and does it not stand to reason that this has left the white woman disinterested she was never a free soul in the harem she too was one of the exploited the myth about the black mans sexual prowess has undoubtedly made her more curious than she might ordinarily have been about the forbidden is it really true is he really as formidable a lover as they say he is is it any wonder that the white man lives with a builtin nightmare of his own construction he is afraid of retributionfrom both sides having historically been the exploiter of both women and black folk economically socially psychologically and sexually the two might even band together against him this may explain why the white woman seems to have less trouble than the white man in shedding her racial prejudices generalizations are dangerous but even among young liberals and progressives the white male appears to have a much harder struggle i have studied young folk gathered in an office to get out a mailing for a civilrights demonstration more often than not the white girls mingle easily and with little or no selfconsciousness they will very usually put their heads and shoulders together with the black youth intent on getting the job done whereas you will often notice young white boys equally as dedicated and sincere much more selfconscious perhaps unknowingly they are watching for the interplay real or imagined between missy and young black joe it is the nature of the sickness of this society no soul is left unscathed the question about one of them marrying your daughter is of course a gratuitous insult to every white woman in this nation it is also very revealing of the state of mind of most of the white males in this country how came you to this abyss of insecurity where you shamelessly imply that your daughters come freedom will all dash lickety split and leap into the nearest black mans bed you have let your anxieties run away with your imagination after all marriage is a contract entered into freely by both parties that means that nobody can marry your daughter unless your daughter wills it and by the same token your daughter cannot marry a single one of uncle toms grandsons unless the grandson too wills it you and i in the final analysis do not cannot and should not have a damn thing to say about it i remember the summer when i was sixteen years old and worked at a hotel in my home town of macon ask any black bellhop you ran scared to death most of the time say they rang for room service in suite you knew that room service meant any service the traffic would bear so when you reached the door you hesitated sometimes made the sign of the cross it was not unlike moving out onto the hollywood freeway swallowed hard and knocked knowing that once that door opened anything could happen the door finally swings back and there stands the white woman eternally aimed at your poor black head like a loaded rifle she can be in varied degrees of dishabille even like lady godiva sometimes without her horse standing there as if you do not exist as a man desexing you with her eyes though you suspect at the same time that she may covet you so you stand there sixteen years old feeling your age and knowing your place tonguetied and perspiring hating this white woman and yet somehow feeling a strange kind of pity for her then the gruff voice from the other room tell the nigger to bring the stuff in here lucy belle but before you could get yourself together he comes stumbling naked toward the door hey boy what you looking at a white woman like that for you hate yourself for saying what you have to say im not looking at anybody sir no sir you calling me a liar boy no sir i just mean you were mistaken you turn to go the hell with the tip where you going boy bring that stuff on into the bedroom youre in the bedroom now nigger ever since you been in this suite you aint been able to keep your eyes off a miss lucy belle no sir you are mistaken sir whats the matter you think she ugly no sir i bet you got a great big tool all right what you reckon lucy belle leave the boy alone george henry there were two or three incidents like that per week with variations but somehow you got through the summer with your manhood and your sanity intact when i remember that summer and think of all the black men who have been lynched legally and otherwisethe scottsboro boys the martinsville seven willie mcgee and emmett tilli am certain that some white women must shudder at the way they have let themselves be used against the black man they have been the justification for every evil ever perpetrated in the name of southern womanhood white women must know they have been used and abused historically they still have very few rights that a white man must respect white women have prerogatives of inferiority and they have learned to live with them in this the white mans world some even look upon them as privileges the feminine mystique is as tricky as the black mystique and after all is said and done the white woman settles too for the masters leavings she eats much higher on the hog than black folk but the choicest morsels are still left for old massa there was a time when white and black women declared a common cause many of those in the suffragette and womens rights movement were also rabid abolitionists women like ernestine rose and many others frederick douglass the great abolitionist and exslave also made common cause with the struggle for womens rights he saw no contradiction is it any wonder that old massa lives with a growing horror that one day his victims both black and white might join forces a guilty conscience produces an inordinate amount of worrying the afromexicans to say that mexico is a land of wonders artistic archeological and scenicis an obvious truism there live few with soul so dead who have not thrilled to an orozco mural the antiquity of chichen itza or the surreal beauty of popocatepetl by moonlight with its art history and cultural heritage mexico is a land that fairly begs for a traditional lost civilization a la james hilton and the writer has encountered more than one american who has gone home regretting that the mexican catalogue of wonders was more one of objects than of persons ruins paintings and volcanoes are fine butlets face it there is nothing that grips the popular imagination like the promise of a community of lost humans surviving in a remote shangrila well i have news there does exist in mexico a lostor to put it more accurately completely overlooked civilization a culture so atypical so alien and so different from anything americans associate with mexico that it seems like an importation from another continent and another world its members are not as might be supposed descendants of aztecs or mayans undiscovered by the conquistadores and living as they did in montezumas day they are rather people of pure negro stock who presently inhabit a region of mexico that resembles the land of their origin in topography climate and as we shall see many other respects where does all this fit into the traditional ethnic concept of mexico as an indospanish country as opposed to say cuba or the dominican republic where the ethnic strain is afrospanish the answer is simply that the traditional view is absolutely correct and mexico is a spanishindian country while one encounters persons with negro blood in such gulf ports as tampico and veracruz this is true of gulf and caribbean port communities everywhere what confronts us here is in effect a black republic in the heart of mexicoa microcosm of africa set down in the middle of a spanishaztecmayanzapotec culture so purely african is this enclave that one is as unlikely to encounter whites indians or mestizos within its boundaries as in such places as accra or lagos how does this phenomenon affect the mexican image civilized americans of course reject the discredited stereotype of all mexicans as peons slumbering in the sun such types do exist but so does the mexican who flashes credit cards graduated from an american university and jets to new york to clinch big deals but the truly unknown mexican unknown the writer discovered to many mexicans themselvesis a man whose ethnic roots are african rather than spanish andor indian and who lives in what is essentially an african community where is afromexico geographically it is a rectangularshaped area miles long and miles wide straddling the border between the two southern pacific coast states of guerrero and oaxaca it is bound on the south by the ocean and runs as far north as the halfruined city of ometepec once a goldmining center but now fallen into decay the african enclaves western extremity is the guerrero village of heuhuetan in the east it stops at the mixed afroindian town of pinotepa in oaxaca although smaller than long island afromexico offers an incredible diversity of topography and climate along the coast is a steamy tropical jungle region of mangrove swamps and coconut palms but less than five miles inland you find yourself on a plateau among the approaches to the towering sierra madre del sur this is cattle country sparselytreed and enjoying a temperate climate characteristic of the african veldt africa in miniature go to the seaside village of tecoanapa and youre on the tropical guinea coast then travel less than miles to the hill town of cochpan and you find yourself in the invigorating uplands of kenya as interesting as the areas geography is its history how is it that a community of negro africans comes to be found in mexico the enclaves inhabitants are descendants of negroes who escaped from a fleet of contraband slave ships bound for acapulco during colonial times under laws of the spanish crown veracruz was the only port authorized to receive slave shipments but a number of illegal attempts were made to smuggle negroes into acapulco acapulco now an international resort but then new spains chief pacific port serviced the gold mining center of ometepec and san luis acatlan and it was believed that negroes were hardier than indians and better suited for backbreaking labor in the mines the fugitive slaves to their great good fortune found themselves in a terrain almost identical to their homeland taking to the hills and swamps they waged intermittent guerrilla warfare against soldiers of the spanish viceroy sent out to capture them this state of affairs continued until mexico achieved its independence in and all slaves were freed the africans remained unmolested until the latter part of the th century when they were herded into settlements by a germanamerican adventurer from pittsburgh named johann schmidt schmidt who called himself don juan smith in mexico ruled over the area as a local tyrant until he was overthrown by the revolution of with the downfall of schmidtsmith the negroes set up a virtually selfgoverning community and this is the situation that prevails to this day although the western border of afromexico is less than miles from acapulco the enclaves existence is virtually unknown to the tourist throngs that invade the resort at the present time a modus vivendi exists between the mexican government and local authority in the region with the tacit understanding that federal intervention is kept at a minimum to make one point perfectly clear the african enclave can in no way be described as a ghetto or segregated area mexico is free of racial discrimination and persons who choose to leave the area are absorbed into mexican life at every level including intermarriage those who remain do so voluntarily and out of preference for their own way of life due to factors of geographical and cultural isolation estimates vary as to afromexicos present population the most widelyaccepted figure is excluding persons of mixed negroindian or negrospanish blood who are found all along the costa chica a coastal strip running miles between acapulco and puerto angel oaxaca i have mentioned the amazing diversity of topography and climate that exists within this minuscule area no less striking is the diversity one encounters among its inhabitants affirming the principle that personality is developed by environment rather than by such a nebulous concept as race afromexicans can be broken down into three distinct subculturesurban coastal and mountain the urban group consists of people born and raised in the area who have since chosen to join the mainstream of mexican life such integration has meant pulling up stakes and moving to the big citythe metropolis in this case being acapulco negroes mulattoes and lobos persons of mixed negroindian ancestry form a considerable percentage of the resorts indigenous population and the african influence creates an ambience completely atypical of mexico one that suggests rio or havana far more than mexico city or guadalajara the majority of these displaced negroes live in hillside communities on the outskirts of town and some of these areaslike la laja and calle ochorecall the favelas of black orpheus the african influence is also reflected in acapulcos music and typically mexican ranchero songs while still popular are given a strong run for their money by such afrocarib rhythms as the merengue or pachanga presence of a strong negroid strain among acapulquenos invariably creates confusion among tourists where do they come from this is a question i have had thrown at me repeatedly and my explanations have usually been greeted with utmost skepticism the idea of a negro mexican defies the american and european stereotype and i have heard afroacapulquenos explained as cuban refugees afroamericans west indians visiting africans and in fact as just about anything but what they actually were of the afromexicans who have remained in their homeland the coast people inhabit a number of fishing villages like tecoanapa in guerrero and corralero in oaxaca terrain here resembles not only the west african littoral but such transpacific locations as fiji new guinea and the solomon islands where the inhabitants though nonafrican are of negroid stock the coastal negroes are skilled swimmers and divers and of the ones who eventually make the move to acapulco many wind up as professional skindivers and water ski instructors yet a few miles inland you wont find one man in who can swim a stroke but it is the hill folk of afromexico who will most actively stir the imagination of lost civilization enthusiasts for the land they inhabit furnishes daily a drama recalling the american wild west complete with ranches brandings roundups and even occasional range wars but if the area is isolated it is far from impoverished as it contains some of the best grazing country and finest herds in the republic such prosperity is reflected in the overall economy and the small town of cuajinicuilapa with less than population has three movie houses an airport and is fully electrified for a community that size this is almost unprecedented in mexico another striking similarity between the region and our old frontier relates to views on crime in these uplands there are only two unforgivable offensesrustling and stealing horses lawbreaking of a nonbovine or equine nature is dealt with whenever possible by the victims family with police strongly discouraged from intervening but rustlers and horse thieves are handed over for quick trial before courts that mete out a merciless justice for example a huehuetan girl of my acquaintance regularly takes friday afternoons off from work to visit her cousin in the acapulco city jail he is in the sixth year of a year sentence with the sure prospect of having to serve out his full term his offense was too serious to warrant consideration of pardon or even parole i inquired as to the nature of his crime and was told that he had been convicted of selling stolen butchers meat regardless of environmental differences both the amphibious coastal people and the herdsmen in the hills have in common a number of uniquely african folkways on the coast as in the mountains village huts are circularshaped constructed of wattle and topped by thatched roofs both coastal and mountain women carry loads and baskets on their headsthis accounts for the magnificent posture of afromexican girlsand babies are carried africanstyle astraddle the mothers hip indian women on the other hand carry babies in a rebozo or shawl the enchanting world of afromexico provides interest for americans of a wide variety of tastes and backgroundsfor the travel writer it is an untapped gold mine out of curiosity i scanned every guide book on mexico i could get my hands on and encountered only onethe revised edition of terrys guide to mexicothat even mentions the region the negro enclave is also an anthropologists dream and budding ashley montagues and margaret meads as they cover the area will find source material to fill a score of scholarly monographs if any remain unconvinced i make the following suggestion on their next trip to acapulco let them invest the round trip per passenger price of a small charter planeand visit either cuajinicuilapa guerrero or santo domingo oaxaca both communities serviced by airfields then let them say that mexico has no lost civilization the negro and the police ew york city police lt thomas r gilligan shot james it powell to death and harlem dissolved into an angry riot the uproar that started there set off a chain reaction that spread to several other cities immediately after the rioting sociologists psychiatrists and city officials set themselves to the task of finding out just how it all got started in the first place one of the reasonsand often the trigger that sets off violence in the streets is the hate and fear that exists between negroes and the police but hostility between the negro and the police is not manifested once a year in spectacularly isolated instances like the harlem riot the feeling is there week after week year after year and it is evident in hundreds of small incidents that do not receive newspaper coverage the u s commission on civil_rights has stated that police brutality is one of the major injustices in america today case histories documented in the commissions report reveal that the civil liberties of negroes in the custody of the police have been flagrantly violated in chief detective pape and chicago policemen broke into james monroes apartment monroe and his wife were wakened and forced to stand in the center of the bedroom while their six children were lined up in the living room pape reportedly hit monroe several times calling him nigger and black boy another policeman was accused of assaulting mrs monroe several of the children said they were kicked and beaten monroe was taken to jail and held on an open charge for hours he was denied the right to call a lawyer he was denied the right to appear before a magistrate he was finally released without any charges being filed against him in in the case of monroe vs pape the u s supreme court rendered a decision which permitted monroe to sue the chicago police department for violating the federal civil_rights act an naacp report on police practices in a large california city contained this case history a police officer went to investigate a complaint according to the naacp he was belligerent and choked one of the negroes to the ground a fight followed during which the officer was hit on the head with a womans shoe twentyfive arrests followed this incident it was presumed by the officers that one of the men involved in the fight knew who had struck the officer with the shoe he was taken to a secluded spot and beaten later booked in city jail and contrary to usual practice no photographs were taken of him lack of restraint by police is shown not only in individual incidents but in confrontations with civil_rights demonstrators as well in princess anne maryland peaceful picketing of segregated restaurants turned into a riot the state police used dogs clubs and fire hoses to break up the crowd of negro students one demonstrator threw acid on the leg of a state trooper burning him slightly several of the students were bitten by the dogs and kicked by police when on the ground fortysix students had injuries ranging from bloody noses to concussions fourteen were bitten by dogs five so badly they needed stitching in new york recently a group of parents demonstrated to dramatize the need for a traffic light near a harlem school their protest resulted in several arrests and charges of police brutality by demonstrators it was alleged that police kicked shoved and struck women and children as they broke up the gathering mrs alice kornegay said that police kicked her in front of the school mrs vonnie jordan president of the schools pta charged that police kicked us and hit us while making their arrests a yearold boy said that the police struck him in the side while he was walking along the street near the demonstration several recent incidents in los angeles illustrate that feeling between the police and the negro is dangerously explosive a policeman was knocked unconscious and windows of two patrol cars smashed by a mob following a high school track meet other policemen were showered with sticks and stones by spectators who objected to the arrest of a youth who had been ejected from the stadium more than officers were summoned before the crowd estimated at was dispersed the next day police officers ambulance attendants and victims of a busauto collision were assaulted by a rock throwing crowd that gathered at the scene of the accident an officer said that rocks cement and bottles were thrown at them as they attempted to aid the injured both these incidents occurred in south los angeles the negro district of that city soon after these outbreaks of violence two negro members of the los angeles city council recommended increased training in community relations for policemen billy g mills one of the councilmen refused to label police tactics as discriminatory but pointed out that he is stopped on numerous occasions by policenot because i am violating the law but because they see me at night driving a car provided by the city william h parker chief of the los angeles police dept blamed the disturbances on social unrest and resentment against all forms of government authority he said we have long been concerned about the tendency to blame the police for the inability of some people to conform to the law but james farmer national director of core said that negro social unrest stems to a large degree from police brutality police do not respect the negroes rights as a citizen so how can negroes respect the police he continued the feeling in the negro community especially in the north is stronger against police brutality than anything else a resident in a negro community after witnessing a fight between white police officers and a young traffic offender who happened also to be a negro tried to analyze the cause of the disorder she said its just they dont have the right approach they dont respect you what are you going to do what are we going to do malcolm_x thought he had the solution he said it is criminal to teach a man not to defend himself when he is the constant victim of brutal attacks it is legal and lawful to own a rifle and louis lomax at a conference on civil equality at pomona college said that the nonviolent negro revolt has just about run its course he said nonviolence is downright unamerican and one of the reasons you dont respect me and you call me boy is that i dont defend myself while lomax did not spell out exactly what forms he thought the new revolution of selfdefense might take it is certain that confrontations between police and civil_rights groups would not be exempt from the extreme militant approach but when malcolm_x advocated the unlawful use of guns he was approving the acts of the lee harvey oswalds of this world when louis lomax derides the nonviolent movement he spurns the obvious gains made by dr martin_luther_king recipient of the nobel peace prize surely it is possible to solve the most difficult problems within the framework of existing law history has proven that the extreme limits of selfjustification and selfdefense can only lead to anarchy many people involved in the study of the relations between the police and the negro feel that the education of the police officer in minority group problems has been seriously neglected they contend that the police have been unwilling to recognize the fact that socioeconomic factors have a direct bearing on individual behavior courses offered the recruit are neither long enough nor intensive enough worse still most police departments stubbornly insist on having police officers instead of trained social scientists teach such courses dr charlotte epstein a social scientist and author of the book intergroup relations for police officers supports this criticism according to dr epstein the men should be given every possible opportunity to come to grips with their own prejudices and learn how to control them in the performance of their duty they should be helped to eliminate from their framesofreference all the stereotypes all the misconceptions about racial religious and nationality minorities they also need thorough grounding in our concept of lawnot only in specific ordinances but in the meaning of the law the spirit of the law the extension of the law to the everyday relationships of men dr epstein also says in addition to study of group prejudices and law they need some broadening in other human relations concepts for example their responses to the problems of homosexuality are so personal and emotional that they undoubtedly interfere in their impartial dealings with homosexuals their attitudes toward college students artists bearded men and toward women need exploration and understanding what must not be overlooked is a thorough investigation of the relationship between race and crime covering the many misconceptions extant concerning this relationship lack of proper grounding in the social sciences is one reason for hostility between negroes and the police but there are other reasons as well during the s the negro population had a net increase of percent while whites increased percent at the end of the fifties for the first time in history more than half of all negroes were living outside the south with the greatest increase in the far west seventy two percent of all negroes now live in urban areas as opposed to percent white in spite of these increases in population and a knowledge of the potential explosion that comes with them city governments have been reluctant to allocate more money for improved police training methods for accelerated recruitment programs or for policemens salaries huge urban complexes such as new york los angeles chicago and detroit have let slums grow unheeded have allowed and sometimes encouraged de facto segregation in schools have done too little too late about fair employment practices have seen their crime rate rise year after year and then have professed to be shocked when their police force has to cope with race riots but the vast majority of citizens must along with their city officials accept part of the blame intellectually we know that the police are necessary but emotionally we wish just to be left alone since we do not want to see or hear or know the police the problems that are particularly indigenous to law enforcement agencies no matter in what area do not touch us we are reluctant to call the police if a neighbor has broken the law we think twice about offering a policeman help if he is in trouble we utter lofty sentiments about the sacredness of law and order and at the same time we reject those who are sworn to protect that law and order although the reasons behind conflicting feelings are very different white sentiment about the negro closely parallels that felt about the police the majority of white americans advocate equal treatment for all but emotional uneasiness about the negros drive for equality often tends to negate what whites know intellectually is legally and morally right according to a newsweek magazine survey whites feel by a margin of that negroes are moving too fast twotoone are against lunchroom sitins fivetothree are against picketing and are against liedowns in front of trucks at construction sites resistance is greatest where negroes are trying to cross in large numbers into working class communities especially those of immigrant descent in the recent presidential primary in wisconsin gov george wallace of alabama received percent of the vote he received a strong vote from labor while his heaviest democratic vote was among those of polish descent an naacp float in a st patricks day parade in south boston bearing the slogan from the fight for irish freedom we must fight for american equality was bombarded with rocks beer bottles and cherry bombs in seattle washington a fair housing ordinance was turned down by a vote despite heavy support from church and civic leaders and on november rd californians passed proposition which if not declared unconstitutional by the courts will nullify virtually all of californias fair housing laws perhaps the negro and the police are singled out for abuse by a disgruntled white populace because they are both so obvious the policeman with his uniform the negro because of the color of his skin both are effectively isolated both are harassed both are at one time or another spat upon and when two such alien groups are backed into a comer it is inevitable that they should turn and snarl at each other a substantial portion of negro charges that the police are hostile to minority group aspirations is dismissed by many as hysterical mudslinging by an agitated people but john milner professor of social work at the university of southern california and until recently a parttime teacher of police in human relations problems had this to say i can say that the policemen and women seem to be generally prejudiced against the negro this attitude stems from two major reasons one the police personnel tend to come from lower class or lower middle class families two the police fear the negro and with good reason the need to deal with the uneducated delinquent type who regard all constituted authority with hostility the crime and delinquency rate among the negro population is extremely high and much of the policemans work is taken up with them and to him they seem the major social problem he sees no way to handle them except by control he therefore fears their being given more freedom capitals supplied mr milner goes on to say that i have found this prejudiced attitude quite common to police from all parts of the u s those working in the major cities seem to fear them negroes even more than do police in the smaller southern communities it has always been a point of discussion in my classes whether or not the negro is a subhuman being as some policemen in every class have insisted the negro does not respond in the same way as the white to their use of authority and they see them as a different type of delinquent the police tend to view demonstrations as rowdyism as exhibitionism in its crudest form they think of the revolution as essentially a rebellion against the status quo this strikes a sensitive nerve for the police dearly love the status quo it is their sworn duty after all to protect it the police do not seek sensationalism they do not court controversy they do in fact abhor it one of the policemens fondest and most legitimate desires is to be viewed as a professional man equipped through intelligence training and efficiency to do a difficult job to achieve this goal the police have in the past several years been paying more and more attention to public relations the art of creating a good image is an important part of every recruits training the negro with his noisy attentiongetting ways is threatening to spoil all these efforts he is reviving old cries of police brutality and dumb cop he is creating front page headlines and pictures of police dragging demonstrators off to jail he is then more than a nuisance more than a crime statistic he is in policemens eyes a dangerous threat to a much desired elevation in status occasionally when criticism of police practices in negro ghettos in large cities becomes too vocal the police hold a public meeting to discuss grievances one such meeting was held recently in southern california and although it was well publicized in advance fewer than forty people attended at the meeting no complaints were received the police immediately seized on the lack of complaints as proof that no problems exist but this simple explanation ignores the fact that for over years any desire on the part of the negro to speak out against injustice has been swiftly repressed so if negroes do not come forth to speak out in lawful assembly their reluctance to meet the white man on his own territory should be understandable it is unfortunate that this reasoning which is based on historical fact completely escapes the police it is little wonder then that a large majority of negroes have little faith in citizens committees or biracial councils or in the humanitarianism of the law instead they take to the streets to fight the shadowy ghosts of inequality and they use the same weapons their oppressors have always used against them fear intimidation and violence when negroes do take to the streets policemen are frightened they see themselves as the only thing standing between angry negroes and a complacent white society as such they tend to exaggerate the potential violence of individuals and soon have trouble distinguishing between a peaceful civil_rights demonstration and an angry mob the policeman is the obvious target for hate and a need for violence he is the man who must face and deal with the lunatic fringe the dissident elements who become angry individuals the rioters who strike out blindly at any symbol of authority but the law must not become a club to beat down those who seek to arouse us it must not protect those who seemingly deserve it and oppress those who are the havenots in our society there can be no flexible scale to determine who is to be granted civil liberties and who is to be denied them the great wisdom in the bill of rights decrees that civil liberties are each individuals inherent right no matter what his status or his crime what must we do to ease the fear and prejudice that poisons actions and communication between the negro and the police a predominantly white society which purportedly believes in the dignity of the individual and the sacredness of the law has tried to banish both the necessity of the police and the shame of the negro from its conscious thoughts in a very real sense this society has relegated the negro and the policeman as well to a position of secondclass citizenship worse yet both groups have been placed in a position which for one or the other may soon become untenable we must as citizens as community leaders as members of a minority race or members of a major power structure as individuals and in groups work in courtrooms in jail cells on street comers and in alleys to see to it that a negros rights his dignity and at times his person are protected we must use our influence and our tax dollars to demand that policemen are exposed to more sophisticated and more extensive instruction in community relations and we must somehow convince the policeman that his status and his security are not being threatened by the negros drive to achieve the same goals whether he likes it or not our faceless john doe is involved when a nightstick cracks into someones skull he is involved in the civil_rights movement he is involved in the policemans objectives and his prejudices it is imperative that every citizen realize that this is happening to him it is clear that only this awareness will stir him into taking an active role in helping himself solve this great american dilemma i have not yet read or heard anyone speak of the historical significance of malcolm_x more tragic than his all men die sooner o later was that it was precipitated in the early days of a basic change in his philosophy perhaps it would be more precise to say jelling of his philosophy for his break with the old man elijah muhammad was the change and all that followed until his murder was really a quest for what this sensitive and dramatic angry man knew could be found somewhere in spite of america for me his search was consciously or unconsciously the reclamation of the black mans masculinity sociologically what focus the negro family has had parentally has been for the most part matriarchalthat is centered in the motherfigure the racist critics who disparage the instability of negro family life fail to note that there was no concept of family life in the negro community in the south until just a hundred years ago then following emancipation the leftover evils of slavery some of which are much in evidence today contributed largely to the suppression of the fatherfigure in the already weakened and sometimes broken family circle reconstruction followed by separate but equal and the coupling with antebellum traditions prevented the negro male from becoming a man the only course left was survival by accommodation being an uncle tom the male head of the negro family could defend neither his woman nor his children he was impotent politically and economically he ab solved violence and death without cause or purpose having had to stand by and see his children starved and his women raped the negro man either resigned his manhood or physically fled his responsibility as the only alternatives to sure death the end result of this circumstance was for the negro child to be almost totally dependent upon the female head of the family for strength direction hope whatever children for the last three or four generations have grown to manhood and womanhood under this matriarchal influence necessitated by loss of the negro males masculinity this is why brother malcolm has historical importance as he was symptomatic of the terrible ills that beset our nation domestically he was also symptomatic of the solution to those ills black and white people who regretted and resented the presence of a malcolm_x would have done better to have regretted and resented the society that produced him it must be noted that as malcolm made an impact on society in reciprocal fashion he felt its impact on him how was it that a malcolm_x never appeared on the scene until the nonviolent movement led by martin_luther_king jr had reached thunderous proportions all of the problems have been just about the same for the last one hundred years one who is a thoughtful student of sharp social change can recognize the telltale dynamics of revolution given a martin_luther_king jr there had to be a malcolm_x in earlier days dr_king was considered by most in the national community circa a dangerous wildeyed perverter of religion with demagogic power and obvious communist sympathies whites were not alone in swallowing hard at his extremist tactics enter malcolm_x and dr_king in contrast to the fiery outpourings of malcolm_x a la muhammad necessarily became more palatable to the american scene king the pioneer of a new militancy provokes a response that purports to outking king thus malcolm represented a newly found assertiveness that had lain dormant too long in the minds of men of color casual observers m of the present american scene in race relations mistakenly assess malcolm as more militant and dr_king as less militant when in reality each practiced distinctly different methodologies dr_king by the nature and practice of nonviolence could not be more militant malcolms practice was far less militant than his theory militancy is more accurately measured by how determinedly one pursues and achieves his goals dr_king chose nonviolence as his methodology and has steadily escalated and broadened his attack against the evils of bigotry and prejudice so much so that his work now tangentially is of significance to international affairs malcolms methodology was verbalized as an eyeforaneye in earlier days and softened to selfdefense in later days the goals of both though not always described as such were basically securing a fair shake for the black man in america dr_kings techniques have proved to be not only religious and morally rooted but also practically and realistically productive however charitably one may view the work of malcolm_x the same caliber of results are not evident not everyone can buy the nonviolent stratagems of dr_king and company though i am proud to be counted in his number few precious few can academically and functionally accept nonviolence as a way of life all those who are left are not necessarily spineless or violent there are certainly those like malcolm whose manhood was challenged strengthened by the repeated heroism of men women and children of the deep south in the face of awesome hardships physical and emotional the nonviolent movement in the south broke the shackles from many chained minds in the north through its raw courage alone a malcolm_x a jesse gray a milton galamison had to do something though they would not or could not abide by the discipline of the kingled forces who turn the other cheek to some degree this may explain some character of disconnectedness in the thrust of the negro community in our large urban centers of the north the newfound assertiveness of the negro in the north went off in as many different directions as the personalities through whom it was filtered at some points as in the case of last summers looting and socalled riots its misdirection and lack of discipline degenerated into senseless violence in almost every instance it expressed itself most vehemently at that point in society where the negro male has been emasculated most confrontation with law enforcement officials malcolm brought whitey down front and men who had cowered inwardly and outwardly in the presence of the nameless white face in whose world he moved admired his spunk and grit vicariously through him some negro men got up off their knees for the first time in their lives and touched their manhood as if it were a new christmas toy what am i saying we should make the late mr little st malcolm not at all malcolm was guilty at times of useless illogical and intemperate remarks that helped neither him nor his cause i personally could never buy black nationalism nor could i recommend it even if conditions for black men were infinitely worse than they are but all the world must agree that malcolm had the book on white america and he read it loud and clear for all to hear the press generally more from naivete than from malice wrote malcolm off rather quickly at death almost summarily as living and dying by the sword this was neither a fair or accurate assessment of the late malcolm_x careful study of malcolms preachments particularly after his break with elijah muhammad reveal primarily focus on being problack as versus being antiwhite as he was erroneously described in epitaph a secondary focus was his insistence on the right of an individual to protect the sanctity of his home life and property with arms as over against his newspaperproduced reputation of encouraging black to take up arms against white these are fine shades of differences but absolutely crucial to understanding the historical importance of brother malcolm the current lowbudget movie nothing but a man is the story of another malcolm fictitious yet very real who can be found all over this land dove anderson the main character wasnt looking for trouble or running away from it either his unverbalized goal in this magnificent picture was to be nothing but a man thats what malcolm_x was all about he was the symbol of negro males who though groping have not yet found the answer to how they can be nothing but a man which is really more than enough the emptiness of negro middle class church life i know that it is a hazi ardous mission to un dertake an examina rv tion of the weaknesses qf mjdde dass negro church life accordingly while exercising care and all due moderation in my deliberations i shall also frequently rely on the observations of eminent sociologists and theologians to back up most of my contentions they too have reluctantly come to recognize a growing emptiness in black bourgeoisie church life besides in many ways this analysis is a commentary on white middle class church life after which the negro middle class generally is patterned in fact the most ostensible difference between white and negro middle class church life though there are others as we shall seeis that negro church services usually last twice as long for reasons that will become clear as we go along one reason why negro services last so long is the desire for everybody to have a word and the necessity for welcoming all visitorsbut more about that later a cue to the middle class negro mentality may be found in a comparison of church songs used by lower class negroes and the middle class regardless of what may be said of the lower class at least their songs have meaning in that they symbolize malcontent and a desire to escape their deprivation they at least are bent on going somewhere therefore their songs frequently contain some reference to a vehiclea chariot a train bound for the promised land which will swing down some day by and by and take them out of their misery failing that they plan to walk through that valley or ill fly away on the other hand recent visits to middle class negro churches revealed anthems and such titles as rejoice and be glad and it is well with my soul these symbolize their acquiescence and complacent contentment but before examining in detail the emptiness of middle class negro church life let us look at the background factors to their behavior unlike white middle class individuals many of whom are the children of middle class parents many middle class negro individuals grew up as lower class persons as they move up the status ladder many grow dissatifled with membership in the lower class churches they have known in early life they accordingly switch into churches not identified with the negro others choose a church because of its prestige the faculty of a college in the south where i once taught has been known to join whatever church the president belongs to when they had an episcopalian president most were episcopalians later when they obtained a baptist president most joined the baptist church he attended e franklin frazier found professionals such as lawyers and doctors belonging to two churches one for prestige while retaining membership in a lower class church in order to attract a clientele some other persons retain membership in two denominations because they are reluctant to let their parents back home know they have switched denominations large churches also serve a status value the abyssinian baptist church in harlem is said to be the largest in the united states in many others in the north where migrant negroes have experienced new status gains persons desiring a seat must go long before services begin this is not so much a reflection of mushrooming piety as it is a passion for big churches accordingly many churches overreport their membership and yet these mass churches are characterized by anonymity and a loss of individuality on the part of members in addition middle class negro churches seek to sever their identity with negro lower class churches gibson winters the suburban captivity of the church has pointed out that negro middle class churches often form a buffer against the lower class community they reject the lower class yet they must live with constant reminders of their common heritage and their own recent escape from the southern lower class the aggravation stemming from this fact led one middle class minister to comment that storefront churches merely express pentup emotions and moreover that people of this type lower class church members are in the first stages of insanity vattel daniel writing in the american sociological review reported that many middle class negro christians regard deep religious devotion as synonymous with lower class worship getting happy for example in a black bourgeoisie church is strictly taboo and according to st clair drake in black metropolis a person who admits to being sanctified is immediately labeled lower class thus the middle class has generally become alienated from the lower class churches and their problems what should be the biggest source of mission is ignored meanwhile some take missions to help civilize or christianize africa and even contribute to such funds as white educational enterprises on the other hand during my days as a member of a middle class negro church i sat and watched the deacons escort a middle aged woman who being lower class was responding with oral enthusiasm to the ministers message straight out of the church at the ministers request frazier in the negro church told how middle class negroes have tried to remove identification as negroes from their churches the colored methodist episcopal cme became the christian methodist episcopal there has also been some effort to get the ame african methodist episcopal changed to the american methodist episcopal but the masses rejected the move another sociologist reported as early as that many middle class negroes were severing their affiliation with churches traditionally associated with negroes baptist methodist and joining others with nonnegro identities such as the catholics lutherans and episcopalian thus churches with a majority of lower class members among whites such as the catholics and the lutherans become upper class negro churches in moving up the status ladder some seem to get the impression as they follow whites to the suburbs and where possible into their staid congregations that they also are moving out of the negro race they appear to believe that heaven is surely integrated and therefore the only way to heaven is through the doors of an integrated church they covet white church membership as an earthly symbol of the paradise they perceive accordingly they stage prayins not to mention unpublicized slinkins to gain admission to congregations that have failed to demonstrate true christian ways such congregations have lagged behind the courts and the schools in accepting negroes and have as a group only subsequently begun spouting some sympathy for their negro brethren and their predicament nor have they raised their voices in a sustained fashion on any other major evil of todays world such as war and imperialism we do not expect that middle class negroes who hunger for the white brand of religion will have anything much to say about these issues either but not only is the middle class negro church a caricature of the white church it surpasses the white church in some areas of organized distraction for example the negro middle class church was found by frazier the negro church to be the most materialistic religious group in the united states this is indicated by the competition for finery visible in elaborate buildings and furnishings and in the members struggle to outdress one another at church affairs some persons feel out of place if they are not well togged the bulk of the collection generally goes to the building fund while only about per cent according to benjamin mays and nicholson in the negros church is given to missions education and the like in spite of the emphasis on the erection of grand physical structures many members are found to hedge on giving their share to the collection plate less than half of the reported membership in the negro church were found by mays and nicholson to pay their dues regularly the larger the church the fewer the contributions in relation to the members in that more can hide behind anonymity in the group this gives rise to numerous and complex appeals for contributions in the effort to wring money from stingy members some churches instruct communicants to march by the collection table up front on the assumption that they will be too ashamed to walk by without giving anything this exercise usually follows and complements previous passings of the collection plate some follow the general offering with sacrificial offerings in addition envelopes are often distributed to members and contributions given official credit this is in contrast to the lower class practice of taking collection by merely whipping up the spirit of the members on the spot the emptiness of the middle class negro church also emerges in the formality of their exercises which though similar to that of the white middle class is more intense according to gibson winters in the suburban captivity of the church not only do they require subdued expression of religious emotions with orderliness and uniformity they also frown on verbal outbursts and are afraid to clap their hands even if the spirit should move them to do so i recently noted with interest the admonition in a middle class negro church program enter the sanctuary in silence also whereas songs once were started by anyone so moved now ritualistic monotony is broken only by an occasional standing to accompany the organ in rendering a hymn thus they are adopting the ritualismasanendinitself approach characteristic of white congregations described in morris l wests novel the devils advocate while we do not need to dwell on the antics of negro middle class ministers as i have discussed that in another study see have negro ministers failed their roles negro digest july the emptiness of the sermons of many ministers is apparent the subject of a middle class sermon recently heard was why everybody should go to church while some especially in the south do capitalize on the drama of the negros struggle for equality many label such sermons derogatorily as political speeches many are bent on saving souls instead of the race others would prefer to save members for their churches than to save souls they accordingly spend much time on biblical legend rather than on the worlds current problems this grows in part from a desire to show off knowledge of biblical history learned in white divinity schools the longwinded among them likewise are given to spouting grand theology and yet while they have produced some leaders in the field of race relations they have not according to joseph washington himself a leading negro minister produced any firstrate theologians this is partly due to their opposition to intellectual efforts within the area of religion whereas ministers used to whoop up their audiences to righteousness they now whisper into microphones instead of chastizing members for their wrongdoings in the middle class they now read an assurance of pardon preceding the reading of their prepared sermons this leads to conflicts with their members ruby johnston the development of negro religion found ministers far less tolerant toward emotionalism than church laymen they have accordingly lost some of the rapport between speaker and members who used to indicate approval and spur the minister on in the middle class the minister now appears as a formal lecturer anyone who forgets and says amen will be looked upon with scorn this formality is regarded as progress and culture since middle class church services necessarily are more cold and impersonal compared to the lower class they lose and miss a basic warmth and intimacy many are not even known by their pastors whom they see only on sunday thus the necessity for fellowhip and acceptance in a variety of committees and associations others must complement their associational life with pseudoreligious fraternities clubs and lodges they form hospitality committees to fill an apparent absence of hospitality in addition there is a plethora of interests peripheral to church worship itself there is a proliferation of clubs associations missions fellowships auxiliaries orientation dinners and other recreational activities and organizations to compensate for social maladjustment to city life this is not to mention the various raffles and bizarres to compensate for low contributions already discussed reflecting in part the growing secularization of american society many according to joseph washington confuse religiosity with faith indeed some adopt a cynical attitude toward faith ruby johnston found in a study of persons that of those expressing a belief in god only were warm in their expression and only enthusiastic of those expressing a belief in prayer only were warm and enthusiastic this is not even to mention that some of those who were enthusiastic were no doubt giving lip service to an acceptable folkway in any case many feel that it is necessary only to profess membership without following the dictates of their faith or even attending services religious affiliation is enough for them vattel daniel found churchgoing not important especially for upper class negroes in other churches there is a high turnover of membership with members bouncing from church to church in search of spiritual satisfaction those who attend church services have failed to make any significant contributions to theology in part because they have sat back and gloated over the fact that christ died for us even the famous white lawyer clarence darrow once told a negro congregation to get off their knees and do something rather than rear back and wait to be redeemed in mimicking white religious bodies negro middle class congregations are fast becoming as empty as their coveted model but they will have to go far beyond white religious models if they are going to be successful in promoting high religious ideals jim crow justification sixties style i am just as opposed to booker t washington as a voter with all his anglosaxon reinforcements as i am to the cocoanut headed chocolate colored typical little coon andy dotson who blacks my shoes every morning thus andy dotson went down in american history along with u s senator james k vardaman of mississippi who made that statement in a speech in during his governorship he had expressed an equally strong opposition to educating the negros head and he stated bluntly that negroes would always be only a servant class in mississippiand in all the states ultimately as a member of the mississippi house of representatives governor u s senator vardaman was significantly instrumental in designing establishing and defending a pattern of rigid humiliating and exploitative racial segregation which did ultimately encompass the entire deep southbut hardly all of the union and now this anomalous caste system in american democracy is under incessant attack from many quarters but like any established human institution under attack it has its staunch defenders among those warmly defending segregation are notably most of the white southern clergymen in upholding the racial status quo they are however only acting in a traditional role during the abolition movement the southern clergy stoutly defended chattel slavery as necessary to the continuation of our civilization today dr clayton sullivan a baptist minister of tylertown mississippi thinks that at the present time in the rural south segregation is a social necessity a device to stave off cultural disintegration speaking out saturday evening post april but before the end of his article his present time has merged with the distant future for he sees a complex negro problem that is going to be around for generations to come a further glimpse into southern history which dr sullivan almost completely ignores will better indicate why segregation was devised it should be understood that the establishment of segregation was definitely not the restoration of a social order that had existed before the civil war it was instead a new order of a kind that would have been impractical with the close association during slavery further this new order was not instituted immediately after reconstruction see the strange career of jim crow by c vann woodward in fact there was a considerable period of uneasy respite for the negro people during which negroes shared in the use of public facilities held local state and national offices and served on juries and on the bench for instance in two years after the removal of federal occupation troops from the south negroes in jackson were using hamilton park for picnics and angelos hall for dancesthe same park that white church ladies used for fetes and the same hall that whites used for dances and for democratic conventions for several years most mississippi saloons served customers of both races at the same bar providing separate tables for each race many restaurants served all comers in the same room rigidity in interracial relations came to mississippi later and relaxed relations between the races was more manifest and lasted longer in other states in eight years after home rule had been restored a negro journalist traveled from boston to south carolina with a chip on my shoulder and found the south ahead of the north in relaxed and friendly relations between the races that same year a northern visitor in new orleans was greatly surprised if not shocked by the free and easy race relations there also the period of office holding by negroes was not confined to reconstruction the last negro congressman from the changing south was george h white of north carolina who completed his term in and negroes in large numbers continued to vote in the south on through the nineties negroes were eventually disfranchised by indirection through constitutional trickery that began in mississippi in and ended as late as in georgia ironically one duly elected delegate to the mississippi constitutional convention of was a negro i t montgomery the central purpose of this convention openly avowed but not officially acknowledged was to disfranchise the negro montgomery estimated the new constitution would eliminate negro voters but only whites see from slavery to freedom by john hope franklin in thirteen years after the restoration of home rule mississippi had registered negro voters in she had the respite for the negro people was indeed uneasy negro lynching was proceeding apace during the period of negro voting this summary method of rendering justice reached its high point in when people were lynched roughly three per week and sometimes and in some places negro voters were marched in from a plantation and voted and some of them were often kept away from the polls by trickery or intimidation and some of their votes were often stolen yet their votes in considerable numbers did often count rival politicians vied with one another for the negro vote respectfully addressing a voter as mister so incidentally voting rights not only afforded negroes occasions for a sense of ordinary human dignity but they also exerted a cultural influence upon politicians but if you want to degrade an enfranchised people the first logical step is to disfranchise them after the negro was disfranchised in any state his social abasement could proceed without consideration of political expediency besides negro disfranchisement would stop rival white factions from stealing the negro vote that became a popular argument though rigid segregation in the south was welcomed by many for economic psychological and social reasons it was sanctioned by the old line aristocratic conservative democrats seasoned and skillful politicians only when a political crisis seriously threatened their overthrow hoping to attract northern and eastern industry and capital to the redeemed south they had begun to support the interests of the railroads the big banks and other corporations but the poor whites as well as the negroes needed low freight rates and easy money in order to prosper even moderately for many small farmers high freight rates and hard money led directly to mortgage foreclosures since no middle class as such had yet arisen in the south nearly all of the white population belonged to the small farmer class so in the eighties third parties began to arise to challenge the conservative whiglike democrats as greenbackers independents or readjusters these political rebels made no headway but when the populists members of the peoples party appeared on the southern scene in large numbers in the nineties they posed a real threat to the serene supremacy of the conservative democrats the white populists not only welcomed negroes as members they also gave them positions in the policy making councils of the party the farming whites and the negroes had a pressing common interest that for a time drew them together politically they shared a grinding poverty as one white delegate to a state populist convention expressed it they were both in the same ditch the populists won many local elections across the south populist sheriffs a different breed from the segregationist sheriffs of today were quite common and in their counties negroes generally were treated as fullfledged citizens at least by the sheriffs the populists with the aid of the republicans were actually able to gain political control of one state north carolina to the conservative democrats the prospects of a permanent political union between large numbers of whites and negroes became truly a clear and present danger and when these rebels began to talk about land reform they became an intolerable menace but the democrats had in reserve one surefire weapon which they were now ready to unlimber color prejudice a broad campaign of vilification against the negro people was carried on simultaneously with the disfranchising drive ttiis campaign enlisted the services of the press public forums the pulpit and the authors of books one book which appeared in was entitled the negro a beast or in the image of god lynching was the strongarm part of this campaign to put the negro in his place and keep him there by a blatant and massive appeal to the dormant race prejudice that slumbered unacknowledged if not unrecognized in the frustrated breasts of many populists the democrats were able to wreck the peoples party in state after state the name of the party disappeared from the ballot in tom watson of georgia was the last populist presidential candidate but the peoples party was dead for a quarter of a century watson had fought gallantly sometimes dangerously for negro rights and for populism but in he too climbed on the bandwagon of negrophobia and thus became the antinegro political boss of georgia after the death of the populist party the poor whites in their untutored poverty could at least have the pleasure of looking down upon the niggersthe booker t washingtons along with the andy dotsons but the negroes stripped of political allies were inextricably enmeshed in the relentlessly closing net of cold segregation in its rigid legalized form segregation is chiefly a twentieth century product up to jim crow laws applied only to railroad travel except that georgia alone had some jim crow street cars montgomery did not have separate street car facilities until and before only three states had separate waiting rooms in fact practically all segregation laws were enacted early in this century whites only and colored were twentieth century signs we managed to get along without for decades after emancipation louisiana didnt get around to separating its circus patrons by law until and it was before south carolina law even began to require separate facilities for factory workers in design and operation the new order of segregation was the best available substitute for slavery its central purpose was to degrade the negro people socially exploit them economically and stultify them mentally if it also had the effect of abasing some of them morally that should not be at all surprising for it certainly increased the moral insensitivity of many white people lacking historical knowledge most segregationists view the negro problem simply segregationists are the good guys and integrationists are the bad guys unquestionably there is a tremendous social problem in the deep south but the attitude of the local white power structure is the central obstacle to a rational handling of the problem many in positions of influence and power are still fighting the civil war as the wide official display of the old confederate flag clearly indicates many white people of that region have never fully accepted the emancipation proclamation much less the fifteenth amendment like the late senator vardaman fhey want the negro to be always a servant in order to maintain this de facto servitude the whites have wisely from their view point refused to recognize the negros full citizenship and to allow him to vote likewise they have been prudent in refusing to educate his head an informed and enfranchised servant class would of course vote itself out of servitude in dixie a vestigial sense of personal ownership of negroes which lingers on from the days of chattel slavery often comes out in casual conversation in rural areas a negro whom someone does not recognize is always identified as one of mr broadacres niggers dr sullivan finds an appalling chasm that separates most of the rural negroes from the mainstream of american life but surely he knows that segregation was deliberately devised and designed for the very purpose of separating negroes from the mainstream of american life segregate v t to separate or cut off from others or from the general masswebster the width and depth of that chasm only testify to the tragic success of segregation in a manner characteristic of segregationists dr sullivan reverses the cause and effect relationship he takes the appalling effects of segregation as a justifiable cause to continue it indefinitely that is a pleasing and satisfying way to see the situation for it eases the conscience and neatly shifts the responsibility from the perpetrators to the victims of that dehumanizing social wrong in their everyday language segregationists automatically always exclude negroes from their stream of american life for instance dr sullivan counts them in the population statistics of tylertown but when he speaks of having profound respect for the people of the town he is certainly not talking about the negroes who constitute nearly half of the people in like manner he excludes them when he refers to fellow townsmen mississippians clergymen and southerners such terms of reference are reserved for whites only negroes are only negroes a segregationist would never no never refer to a negro as a southerner white children in dr sullivans opinion should not have to go to school with negroes from impoverished homes which have been abandoned by the negro men do no white children come from such homes and is impoverishment a generally acknowledged social stigma in mississippi which has the lowest per capita income of any state in the union in dr sullivan tries to justify racial segregation on such other grounds as personal uncleanliness superstition and low moral standards but those are human characteristics under certain circumstances in twentythree years of school teaching in rural arkansasa next door neighbor to mississippii often found the same things among whites are all whites of the south now above all these things what about the ones who were once commonly known as poor white trash and whose counterparts are now commonly referred to as red necks or crackers moral standards what about the moral standards of those whites who burn negro churches by the dozens coldly bomb negro children to death and wantonly murder civil_rights workers also what about white citizens and officials who condone such acts and finally what about the morality of segregation itself which is the mother of countless immoralities immorality does not belong exclusively to any particular race neither does morality besides if impoverishment personal uncleanliness and superstition were taken as the standards by which to enforce public school segregation you would have economic class segregation instead of racial segregation and class segregation was precisely what many southern aristocrats expressed a preference for when jim crow railway cars were first introduced but people are not races nor classes either they are individuals and deserve to be treated as such the da y the world came to an end if you havent had the u world coming to an end on you when youre twelve years when it happened to me it scared the living daylights and some of the joy of sinning out of me and in a lot of other ways life altogether lieve ralph mymessed up but if i am to bewaldo emersons i i got dont compensation i guess some good out of it too the calamity befell me back in old and a sinner you we were living on a plantaknow how lucky you are tion in louisiana at the time close to the earth and god and all wrapped up in religion the church was the axis around which plantation life revolved the mother to whom the folks took their problems the teacher who taught them how the lord wanted them to live the chastiser who threatened the sinful with hell in spite of the fact that my parents were churchgoing christians i was still holding on to being a sinner not that i had anything against religion it was just a matter of integrity there was an old plantation custom that in order to be baptized into the church a sinner had to get religion a mystical experience in which the soul of the sinner was converted into christian a christian had to live upright and i knew i just couldnt come up to that on account of there were too many delicious sins around to get into but a world coming to an end can be pretty hard on a sinner the trouble began when my cousin rena came upon me playing in the watermelon patch running like the devil was behind her i was making a whole quarter of mud cabins by packing dirt over my foot in the shape of a cabin putting a chimney on top then pulling my foot out the space left by my foot formed the room of the cabin id broken some twigs off chinaberry and sycamore trees which i planted in the ground around the cabins to make trees some blooming wild flowers that negro digest august i had picked made up a flower yard in front of each cabin it was as pretty a sight as you ever want to see before she came stepping all over everything i let her know i didnt like it real loud but she didnt pay what i said any attention she just blurted out the end of the world is coming saturday you better go get you some religion in a hurry that was on a friday afternoon getting late a picture of hell flashed across my mind but i pushed it back into the subconscious the worlds not coming to an end the confidence i tried to put in my voice failed it quaked a little who told you the world is coming to an end i heard mama and miss daya talking about it just now theres going to be an eclipse sunday you know what an eclipse is dont you i didnt know but i nodded anyhow thats when the sun has a fight with the moon if the sun whips the world goes on if the moon whips then the world comes to an end well they say that sunday the moon is going to whip the sun i wasnt going to be scared into giving up my sinning that easily how do they know the moon is going to whip i asked they read it in the almanac and its in the bible too in revelation it says in revelation that the world is supposed to end this year miss daya is a missionary sister and she knows all about things like that nobody knows anything about revelation my daddy says so i rebutted aint never been nobody born smart enough to figure out revelation since that mister john wrote it hes just going to have to come back and explain it himself she acted like she didnt hear that and reverand davis said in church last sunday that time is winding up she said hes been saying that for years now and time hasnt wound up yet thats what i know hes been saying it for years and all the while hes been saying it times been winding right along and now its just about all wound up that made sense to me and i began to consider that maybe she could be right then that miss daya happened by lord bless you down there on your knees baby pray to the lord cause its praying time i hadnt gotten up from where id been making mud cabins but i jumped up quick to let her know i wasnt praying both of you girls got religion she asked and without waiting for an answer thats good youre both big girls big enough to go to hell you all be glad you all got religion cause the lord is coming soon he said he was coming and hes coming soon and she went on towards our cabin before i could ask her about the world ending sunday rena just stood there and looked at me awhile shaking her head in an i told you so and advised me again to get some religion in a hurry then she ran off to warn someone else although i was a sinner i was a regularchurchgoing sinner and at our church we had a hellfire preaching pastor he could paint pictures of hell and the devil in his sermons horrible enough to give a sinner a whole week of nightmares nobody with a dimes worth of sense wanted to go to a hot burning hell where a red horned devil tormented folks with a pitchfork but id been taking a chance on enjoying life another years or so before getting some religion getting just enough to keep me out of hell i hadnt figured on time running out on me so soon and i still wasnt taking anybodys word about the world coming to an end before asking my daddy about it first but it was plowing time and daddy was way back in the corn field where id already run across a rattlesnake so i figured even the world coming to an end could wait until suppertime i went around the rest of that day with my mind loaded down now i didnt exactly believe that the world was coming to an end out i didnt exactly believe it wasnt either about two years before id went and read the worst part of revelation and it had taken my daddy two weeks to convince me that i didnt understand what i had read which still didnt keep me from having bad dreams about the moon dripping away in blood and a lot of other distressing visions aroused from misunderstood words those dreams were only a vague and frightening memory the friday im talking about and revelation an accepted mystery yet things like that have a way of sneaking back on you when you need it the least i got to supposing the world did come to an end with earthquakes and hail and fire raining down from the sky and stars falling exactly like it read in revelation and supposing the devil got after me and took me to hell like folks on the plantation said he would and supposing hell really and truly was as horrible as the preacher said it was the way the preacher told it in hell a person got burned and burned and burned and never got all burned up and died he just kept on burning burning burning with supposing like that going through it my mind was really loaded down i figured there was no use talking to mama about what was bothering me because that miss daya had stayed at our cabin for over an hour and i was sure she had convinced mama that the moon was going to whip the sun it seemed to me like it took daddy longer than ever to come negro digest august home it was the friday of council meeting at the church and daddy a deacon had to be there i knew he wouldnt have much time to talk to me before hed have to leave out for the church so i started walking up the turnrow through the fields to meet him when i finally saw him riding towards home on his slide i ran to meet him daddy always hitched a plank under his plow to keep the plow blades from cutting up the turnrow when he came home from plowing the fields the plank which we called a slide was long enough behind the plow for him to stand on and ride home pulled by his plow horse whenever i ran to meet him hed let me ride home with him on the slide daddy i said as soon as hed put me on the slide in front of him and geed the horse to go on is the world going to come to an end sunday i dont know honey he replied why do you want to know i told him about renas prophecy that really tickled him he laughed and laughed like that was the funniest thing hed ever heard i laughed a little too though i didnt get the joke in it theres always somebody coming around prophesying that the worlds coming to an end he said after hed laughed himself out folks been doing that ever since i was a boy they were doing it when my daddy was a boy when my granddaddy was a boy aw theyve been doing that for hundreds and hundreds of years and the world is still here dont you ever pay any attention to anybody that comes around telling you the world is going to end baby but aint the world ever going to end i wanted to know yeah but dont anybody know when only the lord knows that why the world might not end for another thousand years then again it might end tonight we just dont know tonight you mean the world might end tonight sure im not saying it will but it could a person never can tell about a thing like that but if you let that bother you why youll be scared to death every day of your life looking for the world to end youre not going to be that silly are you aw shucks no i lied i was that silly right then and there i got to looking for the world to end right there on the spot like anybody expecting a calamity i decided to sit up all night that night but mama made me go to bed my room was full of the plantation night the darkest of darkness before daddy returned from church mama put out the coal oil lamp and went to bed the lazy old moon was on its vacation again there was no light anywhere not a speck although my eyes couldnt see anything in that awful dark my mind had always been very good at seeing things in the dark that werent there i got to seeing how it was going to be when the world ended the whole drama of it paraded right before my mind then my imagination marched me up before the judgment seat to give account for my past sins and i tried to figure out how much burning id get for each offense counting up all the ripe plums and peaches id saved from going to waste on the neighbors trees neglecting to get the owners permission the fights id had with that sassy little catherine who lived across the river the domino games id played for penny stakes with my sinnercousin sam the times id handled the truth careless enough to save myself from a whipping and other not so holy acts i figured id be in for some real hot burning while i lay there in that pitch black darkness worrying myself sick about burning in hell a distant rumbling disturbed the stillness of the night so faint that at first i wasnt sure id heard it i sat up in the bed straining my ears listening sure enough there was a rumbling far away the rumbling wasnt thunder i was sure of that because thunder rumbled then died away but this rumbling grew louder and louder and louder a slow moving terrible loud rumbling that was to my scared mind the earth quaking the sky caving in the world ending i got out of there i got out of there fast i didnt even think about being dressed only in my nightgown or the awful dark outside being full of ghosts and bogeymen and other horrors i just ran the world is ending the world is ending run run for your life i shouted a warning to mama and i just kept on hollering as i ran down the road past the other plantation cabins the world is ending the world is ending run run for your life doors opened and folks came out on the cabin porches some holding coal oil lamps in their hands theyd look at me in my white nightgown running down the road as fast as a scared rabbit then look up at the sky rumbling like it was caving in and a few of them hollered something at me as i passed by but i couldnt make out what any of them said i might have run myself plumb to the ocean or death if daddy and some other deacons hadnt been coming up the road on their way from church daddy caught me he had a hard time holding me though the fear of the devil and hell was stronger in me than reason i was dead set on escaping them daddy had heard my hollering about the world ending as i ran down the road towards them so he kept telling me thats just an old airplane honey the worlds not ending thats just an old airplane making all that racket when his words got through the fear that fogged my mind i calmed down a bit airplane id only heard about airplanes never had i seen one or heard one passing by daddy laughed you were just about outrunning that old airplane and keeping up almost as much racket he pointed towards the sky look up there you see its gone now see that light moving towards town thats it those old airplanes sure have scared a lot of folks with all that racket they make i looked up sure enough there was a light that looked like a star moving across the sky the rumbling was way off in the distance going away slowly like it had come and the sky was whole not a piece of it had caved in i broke down and cried because i was so relieved that the world wasnt coming to an end because id been so scared for so long because id made such a fool of myself and just because daddy pulled off his suit coat and wrapped it around me to hide the shame of my nightgown from the deacons after id had a real good cry we walked home as we walked up the ribbon of road bordering the plantation on our way home i felt a new kind of happiness inside of me the yellow squares of light shining from the black shapes of the plantation cabins outlined against the night made a picture that looked beautiful to me for the first time even the chirping of the crickets sounded beautiful like a new song id never heard before even the darkness was beautiful everything was beautiful and i was alive i felt the life within me warming me from the inside a happy feeling id never had before and the world was there all around me i was aware of it aware of all of it full of beauty full of happy things to do right then and there i was overwhelmed with a desire to live really live in the world and enjoy as much of it as i could before it came to an end and ive been doing so ever since a major event in cultural annals will take place in april when the first world festival of negro art opens in the west african nation of senegal always a rich

a dus after the demonstrations the arrests the trials and the negotiations the city administration reluctantly agreed to desegregate the buses but the ku klux klan threatened to picketand the citizens group to boycottthe buses and jones editor told him to ride one and get the story jones entered a bus and took a seat at the back so as to have a good view of all the passengers the bus was passing through a negro area which encircled the downtown district almost half the passengers were negroes there was no tension but an air of expectancy in the bus jones realized that it was up to the negroes to integrate the bus the whites were not going to sit in the back which bore the stigma of being the worst place strange he thought in a train or an airplane the jim crow place was the front while in a bus it was the back the negroes were proceeding to integrate the bus a couple got on and sat down directly behind the driver and there were others scattered through the front and the middle they avoided sitting next to whites they sat next to each other or took vacant seats as the bus passed through skid row a little nondescript negro man got on he was the sort youd see and never remember he wore nondescript clothes and had nondescript features which youd forget as soon as you saw them he peered around for a seat saw one next to an elderly white man and sat down in it the man had been hogging his seat sitting almost in the middle perhaps to discourage any negro from sitting next to him and the new passenger had to sit half in the aisle to get more room he slid closer to the old man he did not move over but turned around and stared angrily at the negro the negro kept on pushing and leaned close against him he glared at the little man with the most virulent hate in his thin face and pale blue eyes that jones had ever seen even jones was seared with the malignancy of it hell he thought that look is enough to melt a brass monkey will that little fellow have enough guts to keep on apparently he did for he kept on pushing vigorously and pressing close to the occupant all at once the old man yielded and jerked sideways and pressed stiffly against the window his face jammed against the glass as if he were trying to move as far as possible from the hated presence of the negro well that little fellow had the nerve not to give up jones thought even though the old man is hating his guts for sitting next to him hurrah for you little man but the little man seemed not to enjoy his victory he squirmed uncomfortably on the seat he peered around furtively and after a couple of stops he scampered to the door and skipped off the bus a duncolored little mouse so timid and insignificant looking that you only half glanced at him and forgot him as soon as you saw him the old man remained in the same position jammed against the side of the bus with his face pressed against the pane he must have asked the driver to call his stop for two or three blocks farther on the driver called a street loudly and looked in his mirror at the man when he did not get up the driver walked back to him and said heres your stop he did not answer and the driver touched his shoulder bending over him he touched him again then jerked back his hand and stared at it it was red with blood jesus christ he said the man is dead the other pathfinder fall the movie and tv thrillers depicting a man galloping on a fast horse lariat in hand none has ever shown a negro in that role yet in the real life of the old west a negro youth rode on one of the most famous and fastest rides on record lariat swinging his name was jacob dodson and he rode with fremont the pathfinder on the latters remarkable ride from los angeles to monterey during californias critical days of a ride on which fremont and his two companions covered miles of rugged country in actual riding hours dodson was chosen for that ride because of his skill with the lariat though only years of age he had been with fremont for four years on two great exploring expeditions to the far west in a band which included such well known frontiersmen as kit carson and thomas broken hand fitzpatrick dodson had taken part in the perilous crossing of the sierras in the winter of and in many another adventure with that band of many nations americans delaware indians french voyageurs canadians and germans which lieutenant john charles fremont assembled to chart the west for the united states government in fremonts party of men had turned from exploring to seizing california from mexico in the mexicanamerican war then going on fremont held southern california with a title of provisional governor and headquarters at los angeles while general stephen kearny held the north at monterey with only a handful of americans under his command and uneasy as rumors of impending revolt flew about fremont felt an acute need to confer with kearny but was loath to leave his post for long with characteristic imagination fremont hit on a novel method for a daring fast ride north choosing as his companions his devoted friend don jesus pico a superb horseman and the equally devoted colored man jacob dodson each of the party had three horses nine in all the riders changing mounts riding on one and then another the six loose horses ran ahead without bridle or halter when wanted for a change say at a distance of twenty miles they were caught by a lasso thrown either by don jesus or jacob who in his long expeditions with colonel fremont had become as expert as a mexican with the lasso as sure as the mountaineer with the rifle equal to either on horse or foot and always a lad of courage and fidelity according to an account in the national intelligencer of washington d c on november it was at daybreak on the morning of the nd of march the intelligencer report continues that the party set out from los angeles the way was over mountainous country with no other road than a trace and many defiles to pass particularly the punto gordo made by the jutting of a precipitous mountain into the sea and which can only be passed when the tide is out and the sea is calm the towns of santa barbara and san luis obispo were the principal inhabited places on the route the most usual gait was a swinging gallop the first day they ran miles passing the san fernando mountain and other mountains the only fatigue complained of was in jacobs right arm made tired by throwing the lasso and using it as a whip to keep the loose horses to the track the next day they made another one hundred and twentyfive miles passing the formidable mountain of santa barbara and counting the skeletons of fifty horses which perished upon it the previous christmas when fremont and the california battalion had passed that way heading south in a raging tempest at night san luis obispo was reached the home of don jesus where an affecting reception awaited fremont he was detained until ten oclock the following morning taking a breakfast of honor and receiving the visits of the inhabitants here the nine horses from los angeles were replaced by fresh mounts proceeding at the usual gait that day don jesus became fatigued after seventy miles and proposed a halt in the valley of the salinas for safety from marauding indians they chose a secluded spot off the trace but their repose that night was disturbed by a stampede among the horses not due to indians but to white bears the bears were considered dangerous fremont reached for his pistols but don jesus restrained him scaring away the bears with some loud hallowing in spanish the bears went off but sleep went off also says the account in the intelligencer and the recovery of the horses frightened by the bears building a rousing fire making a breakfast from the hospitable supplies of san luis obispo occupied the party till daybreak when the journey was resumed eighty miles and the afternoon brought the party to monterey the return ride to los angeles was covered in the same way says author f s dallenbaugh in his fremont and and fremont and his two companions rode into los angeles after leaving there a total journey of miles over rough country in actual riding hours by the use of horses one of the most remarkable rides on record for speed and distance the famous ride from ghent to aix immortalized by the poet browning was barely more than the least of these eight days of fremont another biographer of fremont cardinal goodwin says if any one of the three deserved more credit than the others it was the negro dodson whose skill with the lasso kept the men provided with fresh horses jacob dodson was a freeborn negro whose family worked in lifelong service for the family of fremonts wife the bentons at the age of he was nearly sixfeet tall and strong and active as he had watched fremont prepare in washington for his first expedition in he had begged to go along fremont took dodson as his personal servant but the youth so quickly learned the ways of the frontier that he outgrew his classification from the first he proved his mettle fremont leaving washington for the west was traveling through the pennsylvania mountains in a stagecoach with dodson charles preuss a mapmaker for the expedition and fremonts family the driver trying to pass a long freight wagon overturned us into a gully fremont related and the coach lighted on its roof jacob who was on the box was at the horses heads before the coach reached the gully and the wagoners men prevented further harm from the frightened animals dodsons name occurs a number of times in accounts of fremonts explorations fremont encamped on the shore of the great salt lake in september with a small select group of eight and reduced to a diet of roots while awaiting supplies related that for supper we had yampa the most agreeably flavored of the roots seasoned by a small fat duck which had come in the way of jacobs rifle next day the party explored the island in the lake now known as fremont island during the fremont partys desperate crossing of the snowcovered sierras in the dead of winter fremont chose dodson as his companion to reconnoiter ahead of the main party down the west slope of the range fremont relates in his report of a journey and that night he tells we encamped on the headwaters of a little creek where at last the water found its way to the pacific the night was clear and very long we heard the cries of some wild animals attracted by our fire and these strange sounds had something pleasant to negro digest august our senses in this region of silence and desolation next morning fremont and dodson followed the icy surface of the creek till it grew wider so that fremont was satisfied we had struck the stream on which mr sutter lived he was correct they had found the silver fork of the american river three weeks later on march an advance party of eight including fremont carson and dodson arrived at sutters fort in what is now the city of sacramento genial captain john sutter must have looked with wonder upon the emaciated ragged men he met that day says morgan estergreen in his kit carson a portrait in courage they had just accomplished something which he would have sworn could not be done crossing the sierra nevada range in the depths of winter but that they had done so without loss of human life must have astonished him even more the poet john greenleaf whittier celebrated fremonts achievement in his poem the pass of the sierras so capable were the men of fremonts party said his wife jessie benton fremont later that every man was a captain a diorama of fremonts group arriving at the fort is on display at the sutters fort historical monument in sacramento dodson appears as the fourth figure from the front of the party j n recent years a great deal of publicity has been given to educational occupational and economic gains of negroes in the united states viewed in absolute terms these gains since the beginning of world war ii have been impressive for example the median years of school completed by nonwhites years old and older more than per cent of whom were negroes rose from in to in in only per cent of nonwhite adults had completed high school whereas per cent had done so in the quality of negro education also improved substantially during this period in only per cent of employed negro workers were in whitecollar or skilled manual occupations by almost per cent were employed in such work the median wage and salary income of gainfully employed nonwhite males increased threefold in constant dollars from in to in all evidence indicates that educational occupational and economic progress is continuing substantial though these gains may be they have not been sufficient to forestall negro restiveness expressions of negro discontent if not discontent itself increased steadily although slowly from the end of world war ii to the early s and in there was an almost explosive increase in negro protest activity the discontent that prompted this protest grew in large measure out of such conditions as segregation of public facilities housing discrimination and inequitable treatment of negroes by police but it was also due to dissatisfaction with the rate of progress in the basic spheres of education occupation and income and to a high rate of negro unemployment during a period of unparalleled prosperity a major reason for negro dissatisfaction with recent gains is that white gains have also been large and therefore there is still a sizable gap between negroes and whites although most negroes lack precise knowledge of this gap they perceive that it remains large and several recent trends have sharpened the negros perception of his relative disadvantage and made him more prone to measure his condition against that of whites for instance skilled and whitecollar occupations and good education have given many negroes a better vantage point from which to judge their relative condition and negroes who have moved from allnegro to interracial social circles have often experienced a decline in relative status and a heightened sense of deprivation more casual and stylized contacts such as in the classroom and on the job have had a similar effect on the experiencing of relative deprivation increased travel and greater exposure to the mass media of communications have also given negroes more knowledge of the life styles and consumption patterns of middleclass white americans and have widened the disparity between negro aspirations and attainments therefore if negro aspirations are to be satisfied and negro discontent stilled there must be a marked closing of the gap between negroes and whites not merely large absolute negro gains the prospects for such a closing in the near future are not good unless the convergence of negroes and whites in education occupations and income is greatly accelerated an appreciable gap will remain throughout the lifetime of most negroes now living this can be seen by projecting recent rates of convergence at the to rates of change in the relative standing of negroes they would attain equality with whites in education long before they would attain equality in occupation and income but even the education gap as indicated by the ratio of nonwhite to white median years of school completed would not close until the year and the income gap as measured by the ratio of nonwhite to white median family income would not close until negro males would become proportionally represented in most intermediatelevel occupations within a few decades but would not attain equality in some upperlevel occupations for centuries negroes are considered to be proportionally represented in an occupation if the percentage of negroes is the same in the occupation and in the total labor force in a few occupationsincluding physicians and surgeons and managers officials and proprietorsnegro representation did not increase at all during the s and therefore equality cannot be projected at any rate the projected dates for proportional representation in a few selected occupations are as follows these projections are not predictions they merely say that if the rate of progress in the recent past were continued it will take a very long time for negroes to catch up with whites negro income and occupational gains are likely to accelerate so that income equality and roughly proportional representation in the upperlevel occupations will be attained in less than the time indicated on the other hand negroes almost certainly will not gain educational equality with whites by the above projected date of a conclusion we reach from an analysis of data on educational attainment by age since most people do not receive formal education after about age but will live and influence the educational statistics for many more years educational equality in the total population probably will not be attained until four or five decades after it is attained among young adults and the educational gap between negroes and whites in this age range from through remained substantial in at the recent rate of change the gap will not disappear for this age group for three or four decades nearly a century probably will pass before there is equality in the total population in addition to the gap in the quantity of negro and white education there is a vast difference in the quality of education the average year of negro schooling is far less than the equivalent of the average white year in terms of the skills and knowledge that result from it in many localities negro pupils average only as well on scholastic achievement tests as whites two or three grade levels below them although there is no good overall measure of the difference in quality we can be fairly certain that it like the gap in years of school completed is slowly closing there has been appreciable desegregation of schools and colleges in the border states during the past decade and the southern states have at least improved the physical facilities of their negro schools in an attempt to lessen pressure for desegregation however it is not likely that the gap in quality of education is closing as rapidly as the gap in quantity de facto segregation based upon residential segregation has increased recently in some northern and western cities and the predominantly negro schools pervaded with a lowerclass culture and usually poorly staffed and equipped almost invariably offer inferior opportunities to learn and stimulate less incentive to do so although there is now little overt discrimination against negroes by northern and western colleges and universities negro college students handicapped by poor backgrounds and limited financial resources are highly concentrated in institutions with low academic standards even so a large percentage of them do not fare well in competition with their white classmates and almost per cent of the nonwhite males who complete one year of college never complete four the comparable percentage for white males is less than it seems therefore that some difference in the average quality of negro and white education is likely to remain for some time after the gap in years of school completed is closed true educational equality is probably more than a century away even if recent favorable trends continue and are accelerated by the belated efforts of governments and foundations to correct longrecognized deficiencies there is still considerable discrimination against negroes in employment and in rates of pay but such discrimination has been declining rapidly since no overall measure of discrimination is available one cannot determine the exact rate of decline but if the present rate continues discrimination may virtually disappear within a short time except in isolated black belt areas of the south if this is so the occupational and income gaps will close as soon as educational equality is attained employment opportunities are already opening more rapidly than negroes can become qualified to take advantage of themespecially in some professional and technical occupations in which a scarcity of qualified personnel of any race makes it impractical for employers to discriminate or in which conspicuous employment of negroes is considered good public relations by the corporation government agency or university since there is more discrimination in most other kinds of occupations especially in the skilled trades discrimination remains an important obstacle to negro advancement the craft unions of the skilled building trades for example use well established techniques of nepotism and maintain an artificial shortage of workers thus effectively obstructing the hiring of negroes among the potential workers however low average negro occupational qualificationsthe result of centuries of past subordinationare now a greater hindrance than current discrimination in most occupations the persistent income gap the slow but steady closing of the educational gap and the more rapid decline in discrimination have not led to a convergence of negro and white incomes the reason is a growing gap between the incomes of well educated and poorly educated workers regardless of race for instance in males with only one to four years of formal schooling had a median income per cent of that of males with four or more years of college whereas by this percentage had declined to underlying this change was a widening of the income gap between unskilled workers and professional technical and managerial workersa change growing from automation and other technological developments which increased demand for the highly trained and decreased demand for the unskilled and untrained a much larger percentage of negroes than of whites are still poorly educated and unskilled and the decline in the relative status of these negroes almost completely offset the economic advancement of the minority of negroes who became well educated the widening of the chasm between the opportunities and economic conditions of poorly educated and well educated workers is continuing and perhaps accelerating as a consequence negroes must gain steadily on whites in education and occupational status merely to stay the same distance behind in income there is likely to be enough automation during the next decade or so to make it hard for negroes to keep up and the income gap could widen appreciably the impact of automation any widening of the income gap will necessarily impede negro efforts to catch up in education and could postpone the attainment of educational equality well beyond the projection we give above and any slowing of the convergence of negro and white educational status will in turn tend to widen the income gap consequently the imminent prospects of widespread automation give great urgency to efforts to improve negro education and occupational qualifications if negro education is not improved rapidly enough negroes as a whole are faced for many decades of underprivilege and inferior status after the discrimination that has kept them down for so long is practically eliminated as automation replaces discrimination as the major force keeping negroes near the bottom of the social heap negro efforts to attain equality must change the battle against discrimination may soon be won but if negroes try to impede automation their efforts will be futile even labor leaders who feel their unions have much to lose are fighting delaying actions and playing for time and concessions they do not think it possible to obstruct automation for very long the most rational future strategy to raise negro status would be a program of uplift and selfimprovement necessarily with the massive support of government foundations and all kinds of educational institutions from the standpoint of negroes a shift away from emphasis upon protest to such a program may not come easily negroes are marshalled to fight discrimination they increasingly focus their hostility upon whites and they can release their pent up hostility in protest activities they will find it hard to turn their attention upon themselves and settle down to the long arduous and unexciting tasks of uplift whites whose consciences are being eased by the elimination of the more flagrant forms of discrimination may not readily give the sustained support and cooperation needed for an adequate program of negro uplift not many whites are likely to feel responsible either for the technological changes that are lowering the economic status of the poorly educated or for the past discrimination that has left negroes concentrated in this downwardly mobile segment of society in short neither recent trends in negro status nor the potentialities of the methods now being used for negro advance lead us to expect a rapid closing of the gap between negroes and whites only a massive program of education job retraining and occupational upgradingon a scale far greater than any program now proposed by negro leaders the federal government or any organization concerned with negro improvement can save the majority of negroes from many more decades of inferior status such programs of the presidents war on poverty as the job corps and operation head start are a step in the right direction and not a small one but much greater efforts are needed upon picking up dr mordechai kreinins israel and africa a study in technical cooperation columbia i was impressed with the price of the book i immediately became interested in what the publishers thought was contained within the pages appendix included that would demand such a price here is what i found the book is about rather specialized and technical problems without all of the weightiness of technical and specialized language it is not intended for general reading but the general public can read and understand it it is written by a scholar who displays his scholarship through the manner in which he simplifies rather than complicates the subject matter the substance of the book revolves around the ways and means in which israel can aid africa in the latters struggle for economic and social growth but more than that it gives reasons why israeli aid and assistance has certain advantages over aid from other countries as well as the negative aspects that may also exist for example he points out that aid from israel does not mean that the recipient country is getting involved in the power struggle between east and west there is an element of kinship due to the fact that both africans and jews have had tragic pasts there are several more aspects that make it most desirable for africans to get israeli aid but the one that holds the greatest import as i see it is the fact that africans who come to israel for study tours and conferences see the political and social leaders often roll up their sleeves and get very much involved in manual labor the aversion that the african leader often displays for manual labor has two very real foundations first the old tribal and traditional customs have the women doing most of the manual labor the man reserves his energy for the essential task of hunting second under the colonial powers it was the undermen not the leaders who performed tasks of manual labor it is natural then that the african leaders should want to continue in this tradition and fashion but what africa needs is everv available ounce of talent it has to apply itself to the problems facing i it and when the most talented men are reluctant to pitch in for fear of doing something beneath them then it is advantageous for them to be exposed to any system that will help to alter this unfortunate trait in the african makeup perhaps none of the above is really very original startling or sensational but it is useful and compiled in a logical easy reading style it makes interesting reading for those who have an especially strong interest in african development africa must emulate israel in certain crucial areas of improvement many of these are very candidly but gently pointed out the book bears the mark of a scholar and that is rare in these days of mass production of books the confederate general of the title is not a character in this book by richard brautigan a confederate general from big sur grove press but is supposed to be the great grandfather of one lee mellon who meets the narrator jesse on a spree after he has hit a rich queer on the head with a rock and has taken his car his watch and his money later jesse visits lee in his primitive cabin on big sur and the rest of the book is taken up with their attempts to find food money tobacco and lays the reader of this book is reminded of an oldtime vaudeville comedian who feels the audience is getting bored and who says damn whereupon everyone laughs only this time the performer says damn damn damn damn damn damn damn damn so often that there is no response mr brautigan uses so many fourletter words that they become as meaningless as the circumambient profanity of the army he seems to write whatever comes first to the top of his head and what comes out is sometimes meaningless sometimes inane and sometimes a nice simile or metaphor the characters are zany like those in comic strips the book is froth and like the fiction of ladies magazines is to be read in a summer hammock or in bed when you cant go to sleep and then be forgotten in the black anglosaxons marzani munsell sociologist nathan hare carries on a contention begun several years ago by the late e franklin frazier black bourgeoisie essentially it boils down to a conviction that assimilation into american life has cost the middle class negro his racial identity rendering him a cheap sterile and selfdespising imitation with an approach reminiscent of the late dr fraziers personal anecdotes hearsay erratic news items dr hare examines his subject from several points of viewthe mimics the imagemakers the cultured the supercitizens etc if this is supposed to provide dimension it simply doesnt come off for the book is singularly shallow undocumented and often embarrassingly distorted it has taken what may be an interesting subject of investigation and given it the depth and scholarship of a gossip column in a chapter titled the exiles for example the author states because they failed to gain equality as members of a race they seek to abolish that race integration becomes synonymous with disintegration of the negro they operate on the pathetic assumption that the sooner they forget that they are negroes the sooner the whites will also this raises all kinds of interesting questions among them whether or not there is such a thing as a preexistent american negro culture and whether terms like negritude and blackness which presumably link all negroes together in some sort of mysterious bond even wedding them to distant africa have any validity instead of answering the questions however dr hare devotes the entire chapter to a series of gossipy tidbits describing how horrible it was that a certain dancer quit langston hughes stage revue in objection to its title black nativity and condemning althea gibson for insisting in a magazine article that she not be referred to as a negro tennis player many of his observations are indisputable as when he bemoans the middle classs conspicuous consumption antiintellectualism etc others are patently absurd when a group of howard university coeds confess they were thrilled at shaking hands with robert kennedy dr hare at tributes their enthusiasm to his kennedys whiteness he becomes so enamored of his theme that he extends it to include middle class negro speech eating habits and even the kinds of names parents choose for their offspring but as sociologist oliver c cox points out in a rather stabilizing introduction as a population either negro or white moves from lower to middle class status it surrenders one subculture and takes on another thus it should not be conceived of as being cultureless and rootless in the process the culture of negro americans is not an immemorial heritage of the race but rather a version of western culture and that romanticized folk tradition so mourned by the frazierhare school of commentators was and still is a largely illiterate extremely inefficient instrument of modern life it is not an ideal toward which negro americans can be expected to reverthamilton bims cycle of indebtedness exploitation and desperation is repeated each year within yelling distance of major centers of culture and the twentieth century like miami philadelphia new york and other eastern seaboard cities the other outstanding feature of the book is that it is exactly what the foreword and introduction state it to be it is the migrants own storya story that needs telling this report is rather an amplification of the migrants own faint cries they are cries of bitterness resentment unhappiness the futility of existence cut off from the rest of humanity wright has done just that he has amplified and articulated the cries of the migrant worker so that their voices have been heard in the highest places in the land thankfully there is now just the faintest hope that more legislation will join the little that is already on the books to help the migrant worker extract himself from the quicksand of exploitation but equally as important is the fact that as senator harrison a williams states in the introduction it is heartening to know that courageous reporters like mr wright still serve as active gadflies to americas conscience his moving plea should be read by every american with a recommendation from such a high place that drips with obvious truth is there need to say morebrooks johnson there will never be another mississippi summer project the conditions of a state crippled by a ravaging history together with the idealism of the young people who chanced death to open its closed doors is captured in letters from mississippi mcgrawhill edited by elizabeth sutherland damn it i dont want to go i just want to know the best way to do it written from the oxford ohio training camp in june is typical of the almost frightening honesty contained in the letters and excerpts written by the summer volunteers although the amazing introspection of the students is the heart of the book the book is also a complete catalogue of the summer project from oxford to the magnolia state to the atlantic city convention and back to their northern homes the reader journeys with the students mississippi life through the eyes of those who became mississippians for a summer is shared with the reader and the reader also shares the letter writers abounding love for humanity and equally abounding hatred of evil in reading letters from mississippi one perceives the difference between the sympathy of the liberals and the empathy of those who chose to explore the depths of life while experiencing the taste of death the letters provide heretofore unpublished insights about bob moses he forced you by what he said and by his manner of saying it to want to partake of him to come to him he was not in any way outgoing yet when he spoke you felt close to him the young man who was largely responsible for the creativity of the summers endeavor one is reminded that these students led a nation last summer forcing it to see its crimes their spirit challenges the more cynical among us their concern is captivating and however despairing one might be letters from mississippi makes one recognize that the nation has produced at least one group of young people who are somehow larger and greater than the nation much has been written about the students sacrifice last summer in getting to know them one is aware of an even larger sacrifice that this nation will have to make if their idealism is not to be in vain
sixyearold phyllis wearing bright ribbons on her s braided pigtails and with the weariness of defeat over her entire countenance walked heavily up the front steps ignoring the ecstatic approving collie who bounced around yelping gleefully over her return home omitting a greeting she blandly announced the teacher doesnt love me she never lets me win a star a star it seemed was the symbol of success twelve years before abel had returned home literally carrying his broken heart in his hands they say they wont play with me because im colored in between those two beginnings don who was enrolled in a nursery school in pasadena that strove for acceptance of all races had no words he simply developed frequent abdominal pains before time to go to school i had no answer for abel but loud expressions of anger and recriminations for those who rejected him my answer to dons problem was to lie awake at nightand worry in both cases my reactions were of no value to my children nor were they of value to me because i felt so frustrated and helpless i was not prepared to meet the needs of my children in these unhappy situations when phyllis first announced the teacher doesnt love me i had no preconceived logical reply the answer just came and then grew until it was something of an answer it grew big enough even to give some support to the older children i answered the teacher doesnt have to love you shes paid to teach thats her job i am aware that children need love and approval in order to perform to their greatest capabilities but i am also aware that they are not always going to receive this love and approval hence they need to be prepared to function without it i have not seen fit to tell my children oh yes your teacher loves you youre just imagining that she doesnt i have told them that some people are prejudiced that these people cant help this maybe because theyve been taught that way some adults are indifferent to the needs of other people many other unhappy adults and children express their unhappiness by hating people but some people are warm affectionate and happily enough full of love for you and for other people it is my belief that children of negro and other minority groups should be prepared at an early age to cope with prejudice the current practice as i now see and remember what we did as parents is to send them out into the world defenseless just as we bundle them up to protect them from the cold we should also take some thought about protecting them from the ravages of hate a cold disappears with a few days care but if hate is not explored by each one it may take a person twenty thirty or forty years to know in his heart theres nothing wrong with me while some others may live their entire lives without ever having had this shocking revelation it may be that this kind of understanding would be of more immediate value to the sensitive vulnerable child however it is possible and highly probable that prejudice can have adverse effects on the most outgoing welladjusted child if the exposure is consistent and direct enough these children need an earlier exposure to the fact that hate is a human weakness that all people are capable of hating other people that the objects of hate need not be hateful that the hated need not be haters and that before and after youve been called a name youre still the same person with this understanding our children would grow to feel less depreciated would be less adversely affected by nonacceptance and would gain some freedom to pursue the business of attaining their full potential prejudice and hate are not going out of style we need to show our children what prejudice is and help them to perform in spite of it i offer these suggestions as aids not cures the cure will come gradually with the gradual disappearance of hate show the child ways in which outside adults are like the child himself explore these facts together tell them that teachers are human many teachers probably like ice cream cookies and candy better than spinach carrots and squash they probably would enjoy more fun and less work say to your child teachers cry sometimes by leading the child to think of a teacher as being a fellow human rather than some kind of supernatural being as children often think you help him to take a more tolerant attitude toward the teachers shortcomings children are most forgiving creatures show the child ways in which outside adults are like mother father aunts grandparents and so forth sometimes you might remind him we dont listen to what youre saying to us or we are not patient with you were thinking of adult things we have our special friends that we like very much and other people that we dont like and sometimes we hate people well other grownups are like that too explore with your child the many races of people in the world with their various colors features sizes customs beliefs likes and dislikes have him understand that no matter how painful race hate may be to him he is not the only object of hate name other groups of people living in the u s and the world who are living under circumstances similar to ours point out some of these people bodily if they are in your neighborhood it may be that your child has such classmates show him pictures of the different peoples in the world lead his thinking in terms of the great varieties within other species of life help him to reach the conclusion that he is not unique in being different tell the child of countries where he would be in the majority point out these places on a map of the world of course he cant comprehend a map but he has faith in your knowledge help the child to think about the different kinds of jobs that people do he can name the mailman the milkman policeman storekeeper and many others explain to the child that people are doing these jobs for pay in order to provide necessities for themselves and their families and that many of them might not like the jobs they have just as you dislike washing dishes or doing your chores some teachers may not like their jobs either whether or not we show wisdom in what we say to our children about race and prejudice we should talk about it too often in our inability to find reason in unreasonable circumstances in our desire to prevent pain for ourselves and our children we deny by silence the existence of prejudice and thus unwittingly become allies in the frustration of our own children well what about not winning the star i agree with the child that lack of love may be a factor in his not winning a star then give him some other ways of looking at it maybe there are children who need the encouragement more than you do or maybe the teacher thinks that you can do better at the same time i would be sure that the child is getting his work done not falling behind when the hope for approval and the enthusiasm for learning are lost help him with his work if you can and if you cant tell him i never heard of that and then find someone who can give him the needed assistancea classmate a neighbor a paid tutor visit the school get to know the teachers brave the cold atmosphere of the school somehow after all your child is doing it every day give overwhelming approval at home for every conceivable accomplishment from shedding of a baby tooth to the highest achievement have a place to display certificates awards commendations pictures a child should be told before he leaves home and mother that he might be called nigger and black he should be rehearsed in what to answer if you are called nigger you can ignore it or say my name is mary or im tommy if you are called black you can answer its all right to be black or so what then you might also tell him you know you might also be called names like crybaby fraidycat skinny or fatso dont fail to remind your child that he too might be guilty of name calling sometimes even the same names that others call him a child who has not been subjected to name calling during his preschool years will be particularly open to this form of attack even though he doesnt understand it i reasoned with phyllis like this if you are called a broom or a dustpan do you become a broom or a dustpan or do you remain phyllis the child will accept this reasoning while this does not negate the unpleasantness of being called a name it does bring it into a different perspective there are those who might contend that this doesnt happen here in seattle that there is no need to prepare a child to face prejudice here such people do not know the child may not be called a nigger or black but he may be excluded from play birthday parties and other social functions and theres going to be the adult who looks through him or just cant ever be sure whether its mary or kathy they all look alike you know on this matter i sympathize with the adult who deals with many children for short periods of time but it is a different matter in a preschool or lower elementary grade where it is so important to a child that you know his name the teacher of our oldest son in a second grade class with two negro boys and twentythree white children was from september to january unable to distinguish between the two negro boys until i went to the school to tell her which one was which teacher prejudice can be so subtle that a child has no words to relate it to you there is beauty in our race that we fail to recognize oftimes we are so preoccupied with the beauty of other races we overlook or minimize the beauty of our own naturally our children admire the beauty of their white friends and classmates very often that admiration is mutual our children need this pointed out to them take your child to the mirror and show him his own beauty as you shop attend pta meetings church comment on the beautiful negroes that you see your child will see them too dont allow him to grow up feeling that only whites are beautiful encourage and lead the child to identify with his own race this can be done without interfering with a childs preference for friends children as well as adults need friends of all races but most of us need the security that group identity offers use your own methods the adults in our family have a strong preference for negro friends and associates our children too seem to have this inclination we subscribe to negro publications buy recordings of african and negro artists negro dolls and stories attention is always called to pictures and news stories of noteworthy or famous negroes we patronize negro businesses or those that employ negroes even when it is less convenient to do so invest in success rather than its symbols as low income workers we should spend more money for our childrens health and education less for cars lavish furniture and clothes true you cant go into a shop and buy good health or a degree but developing and carrying out an educational program not merely a public school education which provides for additional skills training and experiences costs money takes time and thought a child needs more than a facade of status he needs emotional security a truly adequate person may have less need for acceptance believe in something and give your child something to believe in whatever your faith or lack of faith a child needs guidance he should not be abandoned to wander around in a maze of conflicting ideas give him something to begin with he probably will do some thinking of his own later in life we are christians we take our religion seriously we teach it in our home and strive to live by its principles i personally believe that the time will come when each individual has a need greater than he or his parents can fill he will need god much of this will be of small comfort to the very young child but he will be strengthened by knowing that you understand and care and that there is love and approval for him at the end of the day as you sharpen his awareness of the complexities of the human being and his own beauty and worth and help him to develop you lessen the probability of his accepting the implication that he is of less value than other people he will be of course keenly aware of injustice uncomfortable in nonaccepting situations but he will also be aware that the evil is in the system not in his race but after you have done all that is humanly possible to help your child through these devastating unhappy experiences there will still be the nights when you walk the floor and cry and curse and pray by all means do not let such things discourage or silence you the race problem is our problem in amer ca the excellent special august edition of ebony spoke comprehensively and eloquently of the white problem in america in its thesis that it is the white man who must change his attitudes and actions kb rather than the black man if racial problems are to be solved that the white man must change his attitudes and actions toward negroes far more drastically than he has even in the past few years is undoubtedly true but it is an oversimplification to imply that it is the white man only who must change it is neither the white problem in america nor the negro problem but rather our problem in the special august ebony issue mr john h johnson editor and publisher said we as negroes look at the white man today with the hope that our effort will tempt him to look at himself more thoroughly with a better understanding of himself we trust that he may understand us betterand this nations most vital problem can then be solved with the help of negro prodding in various ways the above process is taking place in american white people president lyndon b johnsons confessions to his own past limited sympathy for negro people and their problems is typical of newly acquired insight by many white people i know that i am constantly revising my attitudes concerning negro people as i read more of their writings and get to know myself better in the process hoyt fuller editor of negro digest and i had a frank and spirited correspondence this past summer concerning some aspects of our problem like the woman convinced against her will i am of the same opinion still regarding the particular issues we were discussing and i have no reason to believe that mr fuller succumbed to my arguments nevertheless mr fuller caused me to do some serious soul searching since white and black people approach our problem with different biases i usually preach one way to white people and another way to negroes trying to get each of the two groups to understand and to help the other therefore what i am writing here for a preponderantly negro audience does not reflect accurately the efforts i make to awaken white people to their responsibility in seeing that negro people have full freedom rights and privileges what this article purports to do is to speak frankly as a white man concerning how i react to certain negro attitudes and actionsin other words to reverse the process of which mr johnson spoke i have reluctantly come to realize that any claim of friendship on the part of any white man for negroes will be greeted with a good deal of open or covert scepticism by many individuals in the latter group also my motives and insight will be suspect by many negroes merely because i am white but those who are willing to listen may gain some new insight concerning themselves as well as the white man from the pen of one who really believes he is a genuine friend of the negro whether i am a genuine friend even a patronizing or naively ignorant friend can and will be questioned and perhaps rightly so but surely there is something for negro people to learn in listening to one who believes that the future of our country and of all individuals in it depends upon a deemphasizing of color and race many people with good motives are seemingly willing to set up one group of standards for negro conduct voting job qualifications etc and a more stringent one for white people in an effort to change a situation that has always been just the opposite i too am among those advocating this present course but i do so with fear and trembling for the longrange good of american black and white people alike justice and understanding demand this temporary venture into what is basically unjust and discriminating but if freedom can be easily and permanently gerrymandered even in a necessary cause and if in the process black and white people become increasingly isolated behind chauvinistic racial barriers the future freedom and happiness of american individuals in any race is doomed therefore my estranged negro brother regardless of whether you accept or reject my friendship or however you judge me and what i feel and say i shall not add still one more indignity to what you have had to endure by condoning attitudes and conduct in you that i would condemn in white men if any individual among you indulges in racial hatred or breaks the laws of decency necessary for civilized law and order i shall oppose his harmful attitudes and actions even while understanding the social forces which made it easy for him to be that way all my adult life i have opposed injustice by white men to black ones in spite of threats social ostracism and damage to my professional status i did so because it was right i did not do so to create a reversal of injustice and to support a climate of hatred and distortion it is growing more apparent to me that while the long range future with its options to continue racial differences and return either good or evil for evil belongs to the colored races of the world the immediate future of the negro in america is somewhat clouded by growing resentment on the part of many white people who have at least in recent years been advocates of negro causes since history indicates that as any oppressed people unless checked gains privileges it becomes less satisfied and demands more and more even to the point of oppressing its former tormenters i think we can reasonably expect more and more violence and racial hatred in our country but somewhere along the way enough people of both sides must love their brothers with different skin colors no matter what provocations occur until loves slow but permanent healing force extinguishes the devastating fires of hatred only thus can a meaningful and longcontinuing american civilization grow out of the compounded injustice and intolerance of the past we white people need your help james baldwin writing to his nephew in my dungeon shook accurately points out this need the really terrible thing old buddy is that you must accept them and i mean that very seriously you must accept them and accept with love for these innocent people have no other hope one constructive way to lessen tensions is for black and white people to curtail the tendency to overstatement which alienates rather than converts no matter how much temporary comfort such overstatement gives to its partisans for example the play in white america as i experienced it was in spite of its basis in fact and its powerful impact a preachment of hate and distortion which lessened its effectiveness the past is bad enough distortion of it primarily through significant omission is however a dubious way to bring a better future preaching of hate and violence is not likely to bring one friends and stable supporters it does cause one to wonder about motives i for one am not going to support unworthy means to achieve worthwhile ends no matter who sponsors such means attacking our countrys image in a biased way can seriously damage the future america with so much hope for the negro all negroes may yet come to regret the image of our country created by some overzealous advocates of negro causes granted that the image of america created by white men is probably far more damaging than anything any american negroes can do is hardly a good reason for negroes to cut off their noses to spite their faces the destiny of american negroes and whites is basically the same and this fact should not be minimized by either race finally i should like to say to my negro brothers that while i am fully aware that ones environment does limit his development it is high time that poor environment no longer be used as an indiscriminate shield to excuse unworthy conduct klansmen and those who shield them are the products of their environments too but they are nevertheless morally responsible for their attitudes and actions as they will someday soon be held legally responsible why should klansmen be condemned and negro violence and lawlessness excused the negro is winning his fight why should he place himself in a morally indefensible position that will only hurt his cause of course a primary burden also falls here on the entrenched white race to share its power and privileges in continuing the effort to create the best possible environment for people of all races and classes incidentally this burden is also a responsibility of negro upper and middle classes far more than is generally recognized privileged class indifference to the psychological and material needs of others is not limited to white people the only difference between us is color and time will take care of that difference in conclusion my negro brother i pledge to you that i am going on fighting for your rights in spite of actions and attitudes by some of you which make that task more difficult i however shall criticize you when you are wrong and expect your criticism in return for my shortcomings in a free exchange that is fitting for free and equal men about a year ago i learned a good deal about uncle tomism in the united states i was returning from a weekend in saginaw a town in central michigan the greyhound bus on which i was riding was filled with many types of people for a while i enjoyed watching the people and wondering where they were going and why they were going and where they had come from then almost suddenly i became aware of the apparent lowerclass situations from which most of the passengers seemed to come both socially and economically the bus was racially desegregated although there were no colored to the back signs most of the negro passengers moved to the back anyway they were typical lowerclassed negro travelers they carried what seemed like dozens of suitcases and shoe boxes filled with food the women were fat some had four or five children hanging on to their shabby coats the children screamed and ran up and down the aisle the mothers in voices twice as loud yelled to the kids shut up yo mouf the caucasian section of the bus was equally revolting the women were equally as fat equally as loud and had an equal number of children following them instead of the southern negro dialect they spoke with a hillbilly brogue instead of shoe boxes they had brown paper bags filled with food for some reason however they maintained an air indicating that they were the bus elite passengers being negro myself i was embarrassed by the conduct of the negroes and disgusted at the actions of the whites boarding the bus i almost automatically took a seat at the front there was no other passenger to share the double seat and i was well content my contentment was shortlived however a negro man in his thirties stepped onto the bus he attracted my attention because he had no suitcase or shoe boxes he searched the back of the bus for an empty seat and failed to find one although there were several empty seats nearer him he walked back to the front of the bus to sit with me his action left me somewhat peeved and i gazed out of the window to avoid any efforts he might make toward conversation the bus proceeded the children were wild and loud the mothers were louder and wilder the fathers just sat there and ate sandwiches from the shoe boxes or the brown bags after a few minutes the man sitting next to me handed me a copy of jet magazine he didnt say a word i didnt look at him as i told him i had already seen the magazine my efforts to maintain silence didnt work however he told me his name and said that he was going to detroit most of the passengers were he said he had lived in michigan all his life and had never been out of the state he talked on and on about his family and tried to get me to reciprocate i answered his questions vaguely and briefly and eventually he caught the hint that i was not in a conversational mood from his short oral autobiography i learned two things he was not very bright and he was obviously uneducated by this time all the seats were occupied the bus stopped in a small town and three men boarded one of them was a negro he walked to the back of the bus without hesitation and stood among the bulk of the negro passengers the other two stood near me at the front the new passengers fit in well with the negro and white stereotypes already on the bus one of the white men standing was obviously uneasy at having to stand he shifted his weight a countless number of times his eyes gazed up and down the aisle as if a seat would appear magically i sympathized with him but as the minutes passed his attitude altered and soon i was waiting for something drastic to take place it happened he said to the man standing with him some of these niggers ought to git up and giv us a seat my mood immediately switched from sympathy to hatred mr johnson didnt react that way however with instant humility he attempted to rise and give mr hillbilly a seat almost instinctively i thrust my arm in front of him to keep him from getting up mr johnson thought for a minute and realized that he was not obligated to give up his seat mr hillbillys pale face turned red and his eyes stared in anger i experienced a strange peaceful feeling the other passengers only stared the bus continued the children continued to scream and play in the aisle the women screamed louder than the children and mr hillbilly continued to stand my timid fellow passenger is one of the few oldfashioned uncle toms who still hang on to their secondclass citizenship with strange humility although he had never been out of the state of michigan he is one of the people former mississippi governor ross barnett was talking about when he said per cent of our nigras are not interested in racial integration negroes never express a desire to see their children mingle with white children in public schools it is factual that some negroes have voiced these opinions but it is dubious that they really believe it centuries of meek dependency have taught many of these negroes to say to white people what they think white people want to hear these people have been labelled by the negro community as uncle toms they are the people who are guilty of slavishness in their demeanor especially toward white authority for uncle toms the supreme court decision caused no rejoicing those of little education were slow to grasp its significance and many who did were afraid that efforts to secure equal rights would cause them to lose their jobs and therefore their only means of making a living harry golden editor of the carolina israelite and author of several books on minority group discrimination says that uncle toms are silent and meek because they fear accusations of treason to denounce the cause of legally enforced segregation is a form of treason to southerners said golden the truly noble people of the deep south are silent because the worst crime in their culture is treason golden cited in his book mr kennedy and the negroes a situation in mississippi in which a ne gro had been charged with rape he was kidnapped from jail and lynched even though many people knew who the lynchers were they were never brought to trial why golden explains that the mississippians would not betray their oath to white supremacy they would not speak treason uncle toms are the negroes who are not necessarily afraid to betray this oath but are themselves dedicated to it through years of servitude and brainwashing golden goes on to say that as late as the s a few of these uncle toms placed ads in the paper saying noticei am not a member of the naacp occurrences like this are rare today my friend on the greyhound bus is rare too the social revolution has caught most old uncle toms and has converted them through a growing pride in the fact that their race is handling its own revolution and winning big by the majority of negroes in the united states were conscious of the injustices and degradation of segregation and all its tragic and uncomfortable results each sitin each demonstration each new civil_rights legislation has strengthened the willpower of servile negroes this new strength has made moderates of some of the former toms and militants or leftists of others today uncle tom has a new identity the name applies to anyone who thinks there is the least measure of goodwill toward the negro cause within the white community an uncle tom is any negro who seeks to convince his people that progress and justice can be achieved in lawful and orderly protest according to militant negroes negro civil_rights leaders are among the many advocates of nonviolence who have been labelled uncle toms when dr martin_luther_king jr received the nobel prize last year there was widespread fear that he would lose his position as the modernday moses of his race and be branded an uncle tom however king has managed to keep his primacy in the eyes of the negro public his several jail sentences along with his continuation to march and demonstrate with his people have secured his position as a leader of the struggle in a sentence he follows his own orders he risks his life there is nothing uncle tomish about him dr_king summarized his feelings and the feelings of the negro public when he said to american whites we will match your capacity to inflict suffering with our capacity to endure suffering we will meet your physical force with soul force we will not hate you but we cannot in good conscience obey your unjust laws we will soon wear you down by our capacity to suffer and in winning our freedom we will so appeal to your heart and conscience that we will win you in the process james farmer national director of the congress on racial equality core once said if an individual is waging a militant struggle if negroes are convinced he is concerned about their interests rather than his own he wont be called an uncle tom farmer however was not as lucky as king he could hardly get these words out of his mouth before he was stamped an uncle tom by the militant negro community there has been much speculation that malcolm_x was shot down because he had become an uncle tom as a black muslim and later as the leader of the black nationalists malcolm_x was the epitome of militancy however when he began to confer with other civil_rights leaders and when the word nonviolence entered his vocabulary some felt that he had crossed the line toward uncle tomism negro leaders are involved in a painful dilemma they must convince negroes that they are interested in the cause while maintaining rapport with the nonnegro community this latter function is an essential responsibility of negro leadership militants say that this rapport is immaterial that basic rights exist and should be taken by force if necessary they say that they can fight the negro revolution without white hypocrites and footshuffling black white people this militancy has sprung from the emotions and feelings that prevail in ghettoes where hope is trapped out and despair trapped in these people have heard too many promises of jobs housing and education and not enough results one example of growing militancy is a budding organization in the midwest called uhuru swahili for freedom uhuru is primarily a student organization but it attracts scant but multiplying numbers from the professions its members have taken militancy to extremes according to nonviolent standards in detroits recent effort to host the olympic games a crosscountry marathon race from los angeles to detroit was staged by local track stars as the last runner approached the finish line a crowd gathered to greet him and sang the star spangled banner uhuru representatives burst out into catcalls and boos they screamed to the negro trackman run on uncle tom the group theorized that the olympics would only benefit the white community and the white businessmen and that any negro advocate was defeating the negro cause in favor of white supremacy uhuru like other militant organizations springing up all over the country wants results about the only thing that will quell their fire is freedom or as they say it uhuru quito or freedom now if vicepresident hubert humphrey is exemplary of the growing sympathy of american whites there is no need for extreme militancy or extreme servility within negro ranks the vicepresident recently summarized what he and civil_rights leaders believe to be the prevailing opinion on civil_rights let me say simply that i am aware that different civil_rights advocates have widely varying opinions on the degree of gradualism acceptable in their fight for equal rights and oppotunity and on the means to achieve these goals my own position is that nothing less than total assimilation of the negro into our political and economic life is acceptable this country cannot countenance two classes of citizenship there are a great many decisions which go into the purchase j f i g of a new car and of great importance is how you are going to r i ii pay for the car sure shop for the best deal and satisfy your tbaiirfs self that you have the classiest car on four wheels but dont overlook financing and insurance costs it is not uncommon for car buyers to save or by shopping for financing and insurance before they buy some people have saved as much as first consider financing seven out of ten persons finance their car purchases it costs money to borrow just how much it costs depends on where the borrowing is done where are some of the places that will lend money or help make a loan there are auto dealers who have arrangements with finance companies finance companies themselves credit unions and banks even your insurance agent who often works with different banks to help get the lowest financing costs so he can keep you as an insurance customer is a prime contact when you are looking for money to buy a car insurance companies like state farm mutual even have car finance plans under which their agents direct customers to banks that will lend money to customers who are acceptable credit risks how much do rates vary between different lending institutions and in different parts of the country a university of chicago survey of nine cities disclosed for example that in new york city dealers finance charges ranged from to while banks offered money with gross finance charges the equivalent of about vi per year of the original balance this means a new yorker financing on the purchase of a new car would pay from to to finance his purchase through an auto dealer it would cost him to get a bank loan to make the same purchase a difference of between and on finance charges only and thats on new cars as hillel black says in his book buy now pay later rates for secondhand cars are invariably higher for old used cars rates may range from to per cent true annual interest why the big variation basically its because of the difference between an interest rate and a finance charge many people think these two things are the same but they are not an interest rate is the rate charged for borrowing money the rate varies depending on where the money is borrowed bank loan company credit unionwho borrows it his credit rating collateral general financing statushow much is being borrowed and for how long in any event the interest rate is regulated by law a finance charge is something else again it is an amount of money added to the price of an item when that item is paid for over a period of time in effect it is simply a second price for an itemthe price the buyer agrees to pay when he buys on time thus a car may have two prices a cash price and a time price the gap is called a time price differential an important point to remember is this finance charges sometimes are not regulated by law this means the person charging the time price is free to charge whatever the traffic will bear fortunately the buyer is also free to shop around for the best deal no matter where the buyer gets his money he should bear in mind that the more he borrows and the longer he takes to pay it all back the more it costs him so to cut the cost of borrowing or financing to a minimum he should make as large a down payment as possible on his car and pay the loan back as rapidly as possible knowing this it should be obvious that a low down payment with months to pay isnt always the best deal it may look tempting after considering the capital required to equip an entire business operation but it will definitely cost more these days increased competition is causing many auto dealers to cut the price of their cars and thus their profits to a minimum but they must make a profit somewhere to stay in business one likely spot is on finance charges when this occurs its the result of a mutually beneficial arrangement between an auto dealer and a finance company the auto dealer turns over his customers financing business to the finance company and he in turn gets a fat slice of the profit the following scale of rates available through a major national finance company operating in the midwest is an example of one such setup these figures were elicited at congressional hearings and show the amount the customers pay and how much of that payment is returned to the auto dealer a prospective car buyer residing in hillview illinois obtained figures from the auto dealer showing for the unpaid balance of the car plus financing charges and deductible collision insurance he went to his insurance agent who made arrangements at a local bank he paid more as a down payment and was able to save the overall sum of so much for finance charges insurance rates are regulated by state laws but yet they vary from company to company so once again it pays to check with both auto dealers and insurance agents the preceding example illustrates one particularly important area of insurance credit insurance the type of insurance itself is important because it assures the borrower that if anything should happen to him his family would not be responsible for the unpaid balance and that the car will belong free and clear to the heirs however the amount charged for credit life insurance varies a great deal sometimes it is included with the cost of the bank finance charge as was the case in the example given the important thing is that you must be aware of the cost it should be also noted that in some instances the rebate situation that exists between auto dealer and finance company on finance charges also exists between auto dealer and insurance company for instance the chairman of a large finance company admitted before a congressional subcommittee that his company gets a commission from its insurance company on all the insurance its dealers sell what does all this mean to the prospective purchaser it means that his initial shopping trip should be just thata shopping trip and not a buying expedition he should leave his check book home and take along a paper and pencil instead then as he visits assorted auto dealers banks finance companies and insurance agents hell be able to write down the figures each quotes this lessens chances of being left with nothing but a jumbled memory of facts figures and percentages when the shopping trip is over first stop should be an auto dealer where the buyer should decide what kind of car he wants make model extras a list should be made of what accessories or extra each dealer offers so as to get a real price comparison next several dealers should be visited to find out the going price on the particular make and model the car buyer is interested in if there is a car to be traded in the buyer should first find out the cash price of the car then the price with trade in this will show exactly what is being gotten for the used car and sometimes it will pay to place an advertisement to try to obtain more than the amount being allowed for the trade in the next thing is to think about insurance and financing when shopping for financing the buyer should get both percentage figures and dollars and cents figures with respect to insurance the buyer should find out just how much coverage is being obtained for how many dollars if he is buying from an auto dealer with what company will he be insured is it reliable does he know others who are insured with that company if so are they satisfied if after checking and being satisfied about these items the buyer de cides to buy the auto with an insurance and finance package from the auto dealer he should get the dealer to make out an itemized list of just what is being bought and the price of each item auto extras taxes insurance and finance charges then he should make sure that this total is the same as was quoted at the time the dealer made the sales pitch where the dealer quotes a monthly payment figure for the entire package the buyer should find out how many of these payments he is obligating himself for by the signing of the contract and he should then multiply the monthly payments by the number of months and again check to see if that figure is the same as was previously quoted it may sound simple but better business bureau records are full of the sad woes of people who did not do this one official of the chicago better business bureau estimates that if car buyers would merely multiply the total number of months to be paid by the amount of the monthly payment about of the complaints the bureau receives would be eliminated the story is told extreme but true of a man who looked at a car advertised for and asked how much the monthly payments would be he was told per month and feeling that he could afford such a moderate payment signed a contract without first reading all of the clauses what he did in fact sign was to pay per month for a total of months all in all a total of for the car all of the foregoing can lead to only one conclusion when you are shopping for a car shop examine the facts compute the interest and insurance charges watch what you sign make sure all of the pertinent parts of the contract are filled in before you affix your signature failure to do these things can cause financial loss and disappointment instead of the intended satisfaction of a sound investment among the children of the very poor survival must take precedence over every other consideration but current motivational theory tends to downgrade immediate and physical motives it turns its eagle vision instead like a rising young executive on goalstriving statusseeking and planning by such elite and middleclass standards the poor must be said to have little or no motivation under a grant from the national institute of mental health we have been studying a large st louis housing development inhabited almost exclusively by very poor negroes we middleclass observers have noted the pronounced tendency of the tenants toward randomlike and unrealistic behavior their attitudes toward space time objects and persons lack our patterns of organization lack our predictabilityeven sometimes seem to lack sense to us how do they seem to the project dwellers themselves after more than a year of field work with about fifty families we have the strong impression that they are well aware of the differences for instance they make a strong distinction between cp colored peoples time and wp white peoples time according to cp time a scheduled event may occur at any moment over a wide spread of hoursor perhaps not at all they believe however that in the highly organized world of the whites it occurs when scheduled the housing project is so isolated from the social and economic life of the city and the white community that the occupational classes of the census bureau scarcely apply to it the tenants work as domestics or in the nooks and cracks of our economy employment is uncertain pay is poor resources are scarce yet unemployed men talk of jobs they do not have and the women in this city of women speak of husbands dead fled or who never existed illusion is thus a way of life young and old spend money they do not have for expensive clothes and cars people with no power and status brag of influence and position and concentrate on getting the better of each other the illusion of middeclass success settles invisibly over them thus a white school teacher working with negro children remarks that they are not interested in solid accomplishment but only in showing off obviously such shortcutting must interfere with learning and with facing school and life realistically casting out the poor and the negro from white society has resulted in a social life so saturated by illusion that the fancy soon becomes the only possible achievement disorganization and a life of fit into the social dynamic of the school room to create educational underachievement the children of disorganization cannot create classroom organization and the teacher can only work with those who have somehow managed to acquire enough of the necessary motivation often we have seen a harassed teacher working with a very few children in a class and trying to ignore the disorder and uproar the others are creating here are some notes made in one such sixth grade classroom with both negro and white children the teacher was leaning over pauls desk helping him with arithmetic irv and mike were watching alice was talking to jane and joan to edith nearby alan ed and tom were pushing and shoving tom got out of his seat made a wad of notebook paper and tossed it into the air several times tom and ed suddenly slammed their desks shut got up and walked out noisily lila and alice followed alan grinned at the observer waved his hand and said hi the teacher took no notice this process of partial withdrawalwhereby the teacher simply withdrew to those few students she could handlemay occur anywhere an individual tries to cope with a disturbed environment i have also seen it in mental hospitals it reflects not so much the relationship between authority and client but the total social situation in school pupils have the choice of building status either with their teacher or their friends to many reputation among friends may be much more important the pressure of peergroups is very strong and selfdestructive status choice can occur in any such conflict between the demands of authority figures and the demands of the group what usually tips the balance toward teacher and selfpreservation is a measure of hope in the future disorganization can tip the balance the other way this is especially true if the disorganization has unique attractions for the children in integrated classrooms the approval of white students may become so attractive to negro children that they gladly risk official displeasure punishment or failure in coeducational classes attracting the attention and getting the approval of the opposite sex can become much more important than teachers dirty looks all such split situations introduce disturbing and competing elements students can make status choices that ruin their whole future lives very very poor children both by feeling and understanding lack the structure on which conventional education can build their background does not have the elements of order necessary to achieve their homes are crowded full of disturbance physically and personally disorganized they do not operate on schedules that pay much attention to school concepts of time they lack both belief in achievement and fear of no achievement when thirty to fifty such children are a class supposed to be run by one teacher disorganization must result from it the teacher in sheer selfdefense may select only those elements suited to her taskshe will teach those considered teachable and let the others go but even the children most willing and able to learn are under tremendous pressure from their classmates to give up and join them by pleasing the teacher they can buy success in a vague and distant future only at the probable expense of making their present life lonely unhappy and even dangerous the poor motivation of the lowachiever is not therefore a demon somehow arising from and locked up inside himself but one effect of a whole sea of pressure and pain which has surrounded him since birth and in which he himself seldom knows why he gasps the missing ingredient but why all this disorder illusion and destruction does it come about because as some moralists believe the poor lack an essential fiber so that they tack and waver in the wind against which we advance this view is actually not far wrong the poor do lack a fundamental vitamin that we others absorb with the smell of food with the promise of gifts at christmas with plans for graduation they lack the essential strength of hope hope is not a simple nutrient it goes straight to the heart of organization and makes it work among lower animals organization occurs largely through inborn genetic factors with man things are not so direct and the word culture has chosen to designate the complex learnings that determine his behavior but culture varies between societies and even between groups within societies for the middle and upper classes in our society achievement and security are major determinants they organize behavioror our behavior is organized around them they act as carrots the fear of their opposites failure and insecurityacts as a goad when people do not see success and failure as we do their behavior will appear to us random and purposeless and we disapprove of it but those who cannot hope for achievement or security can have no concept of the organization of behavior through time toward goals the culture of the middleclass itself has been superficially charted how for instance does the middleclass handle hope time and the self achievement depends on hopeand hope rests on time some time in the future we hope to achieve something even to say billy has stopped wetting the bed means that desired change has occurred through time billy used to wet the bed but does so no longer but the parent with no hope can have only partial understanding of his childs having stopped bedwetting he can have no fruitful concept of the conscious movement through time toward desired goals relative to large social goals his actions are undirected flight from death though the poor have little hope for life they do not wish to die according to comparative suicide rates they have less taste for final voluntary quietus than any other class therefore they concentrate on those factors that keep them alivenowthat make direct obvious and strong contributions to present life the culture of the very poor is a flight from death in this setting the very disregard of common methods of looking at things and objectssuch as how to arrange a housecan become institutionalized a way of life such disregard in objects we call disorder in behavior we call it randomness martin heidegger in being and time relates the perception of self to existence through time when people think of themselves they seem to say he argues that is the way i was this is how i am now and in the future i hope to be something else these perceptions of self have past present and future and it is from them he believes that we conceive time they presuppose change during time movement from what used to be to ward what will be self must therefore exist at least partly as a function of time it must include organization through time but what happens to a person who has no expectations or hopes for himself or his children his behavior having neither background nor direction is disorganized what is left of him in the irreducible ash the survival selfthe flight from death the survival self has no real sublimation or higher displacement nothing but physical lifein a very limited but very intense form the survival self must concentrate on those experiences which give it continual and vivid reassurance that it is aliveheightened perhaps and smoothed by drugs or alcohol it must literally keep feeling its life sociologists of middleclass background contemptuously refer to this state as hedonismliving for pleasure it is notit is flight from death the famous second law of thermodynamics states in paraphrase that disorder within an isolated system can only increase life is not pure physics but there is a useful parallel consider a middleclass neighborhood or suburb it is not an isolated system its members go out into the community and the community comes in at the door and the mind the resources of the community are known to and used by it and it is subject to steady cultural and economic stimulation which it in turn affects the interaction brings adjustment and reg ulation the disorder or randomness entropy in the language of physicsis low the slum or lowerclass housing project does not have access to these sources of support and stimulation a paradoxor vicious circleexists because of their disorganization and lack of hope the very poor cannot or do not get to the major sources of economic and cultural stimulation and their disorganization and hopelessness came in the first place from lack of access to these resources cut off from hope stimulation and change the poor neighborhood is an isloated human thermodynamic system and its disorganization can only increase many middleclass selves are also in flight from death but they are trained to look at life through the lens of achievement sustained by hope and expectation and they can fly along this pathperhaps even to greater achievement this sustenance is not available to the great majority from the slum and housing project our conclusion then must be that hope is a boundary it separates the free from the slave the determined from the driftingand the very poorest from almost all those above it a corollary conclusioneven more surprisingfollows time space and objects exist for us only when we have hope short of reforming his world how can we stimulate the slum child to greater school achievement certainly it will not be enough to merely improve teaching methods and curricula we must improve the school as a social system some proposals are in order building up perceptions children whose central milieu involves so much disorganization and disorder cannot master mathematics or any other discipline involving order and direction i would urge that these children be given preschool training in which the basic perceptions that other children acquire without apparent effort be deliberately taught for instance a child must learn fundamental shapes and categoriesinsideness and outsideness roundness straightness flexibility rigidity transparency opacity motion in a straight line motion in a circle rocking motion and many other basic perceptions a child should have this perceptual competence before he starts school calming down poor children often come to school unfed after wretched nights torn by screaming fighting bedwetting often they cannot sleep because of cold and rats they come to class hungry sleepy and emotionally upset to start routine schoolwork effectively at once is impossible i propose that teachers be specially trainedas they are in the youth development project of the greater kansas citymental health foundationto deal with such children and that they breakfast with them in school the school should of course furnish the food perhaps out of government surplus school breakfast would accomplish two things it would feed hungry children otherwise unable to concentrate adequately on their work and it would bring teacher and pupil together in an informal and friendly atmosphere associated with satisfaction before the strain of classroom constriction and peergroup pressures dictate that teacher become an enemy it is essential therefore that the teacher be present a program like this suggested by me in kansas city brought about immediate and sharp improvement in attendance behavior and in schoolwork the more the teachers know about the emotional management of these children the better expansion of participation the frequently proclaimed immediate goal of instructionmore personalized attentionis especially important with lowachievers this can be done by reducing class size or by increasing the number of teachers the extra teachers if not as highly qualified as the regulars should nevertheless be trained and familiar with the lessons they can be substitutes teachers in training or even members of the domestic counterpart of the peace corps whenever that is established they should be able to help with routine tasks with keeping orderand with seeing to it that each child very poor children need hope in has more time attention care and order to achieve so do those who opportunity to learn work with them contemporary african art has been the subject criticism and among its critics is the man often called nigerias best known and most outstanding artist ben enwonwu paintersculptor the art of africa has never been the same since the arrival of europeans says the yearold ibo who achieved fame in his first love sculpture sculpture which i did not study under anyone else but my father and which comes naturally to me is my favorite medium says the artist although his father died when he was only an infant of four enof much wonwu recalls carving with him his father an engineer who in retirement turned sculptor was also his first model bom july at onitsha eastern nigeria benedict chuka enwonwu who prefers to be called ben carved his own toys as a youngster and recalls his mothers discomfort over his littering the grounds with chips after cutting bamboo and egbo as he fashioned the reverend fathers and fashionable ladies these along with the toy motor cars houses schools churches and government offices he sculpted constituted the little world he created a world he chose to call man labeling his activity useless his grandmother attempted to dissuade him but young ben was persistent she soon left him alone when she observed that i was obsessed with this preoccupation says mr enwonwu speaking of those early days of creativity tivity of he adds man was the daily acan absorbing daily activity i did not in fact know what an artist was or what makes up an artist hence my development in the various directions of recreative activities in which what was primary was to mould a world of my own in which my creative exercises centered while attending the holy trinity roman catholic school in onitsha young bens artistic interests continued he began modeling tea cups and saucers of clay and tracing mango leaves he carved in elmwood and indian mango and it was during this period that he began exploring the possibilities of alabaster and bronze scholarly as well as creative he was transferred at the age of to the government college at ibadan nigeria still colonialized at that time his talent was encouraged and he proceeded to the government college at umiahia where he graduated in the college immediately hired him as art master and at mr enwonwu was on the brink of a fame that is now internationally acclaimed subsequently promoted to the position of art instructor he traveled from school to school in eastern nigeria starting art classes all the while developing and nourishing his art his first oneman exhibition was held in benin early in but the initial boon in a career that would soon soar was a oneman exhibition in lagos in december of the same year this showing resulted in his being sent to oxford university in england under the cosponsorship of an english businessman and the nigerian government he studied at the slade school of art and in received the diploma in fine art from london university mr enwonwu did postgraduate work in social anthropology and ethnography and in was made a fellow of the royal anthropological institute the berkeley galleries was the scene of his first oneman london show and was followed by a presentation at heals mansard galleries the year concluded with an appointment as art advisor to the nigerian government which made the year indeed a big one for mr enwonwu as art advisor he was instrumental in setting up art schools throughout nigeria his duties included inspecting the teaching of art and lecturing he frequently junketed to europe to keep abreast of developments in art but he also devoted ample time to his still ripening talent although his works began gaining recognition in the united states in the late forties it was in the fall of that he first visited this country under the auspices of the harmon foundation on october he opened with a oneman show at howard university and won the warm approval of washington art lovers following his success at howard mr enwonwu journeyed to boston with his works and appeared at the schweitzer foundation festival an exhibition at roosevelt house in new york sponsored by hunter college was the next stop for the visiting artist at roosevelt house mr enwonwu displayed his exhibit of oil gouache and water color paintings and wooden sculptureshe is considered to be one of the few living expert wood carversand especially fascinated patrons with his painting of olisa the god of gods olisa described by mr enwonwu as powerful and calm in his wisdom was painted from recollection of stories his grandmother had told him his american tour in high gear mr enwonwu set off for exhibitions at vassar college syracuse university and bennington college his tour included two lectures at new york university and lectures and art discussions at adelphi college on long island and at other schools returning to nigeria he continued work in the civil service and oneman exhibitions which took him to the capitols of europe the fifties brought many awards and commissions attesting to his increased recognition in mr enwonwu became a member of presence africaine at paris and attended the conference on world negro culture two years later the same year he carved the statue of the risen christ for the university of ibadan chapel one of his principal works he was awarded the insignia of mbe member of the british empire for his contribution to nigerian art and culture the famous bronze piece called anyanwu which was hailed by the late sir jacob epstein as symbolizing the rise of african countries towards nationhood was produced by mr enwonwu in the year of nigerian independence today it adorns the entrance to the nigerian museum one of the highlights of the enwonwu career came in when he was given a studio in buckingham palace to carry out the commission from the nigerian government for a bronze portrait of her majesty queen elizabeth ii the highly acclaimed work now can be viewed in front of the nigerian senate chambers the bennett prize of the royal society awarded to one person every three years for the encouragement of arts manufacturing and commerce for the commonwealth countries was presented to ben enwonwu in the sculptor to whom art has been a lifelong dedication recalls as a dark period beclouded with the cultural problems of nigeria he insists that culture and the artist were denied the proper priority during the quest for political freedom and direction the artist was forgotten as nigerianisation of the civil service began says mr enwonwu art became a thing to be used as a convenience rather than a necessity for the projection of the nigerian image in spite of the dark period the artist continued to work in president nnamdi azikiwe sat for him in london and he created a statue in bronze two years later in torino italy mr enwonwu sculpted a second statue of the nigerian president one of the more popular of his numerous murals is located in the nigerian ports authority building the mural was painted in holland in cultural missions to india germany and ghana occupied much of and has been a busy year for mr enwonwu the inspection of nigerian foreign missions took him to london bonn and rome and in the spring brought him to this country once again new york and washington were included on this cultural mission for the ministry of external affairs projection of the nigerian image a phrase that owes special homage to mr enwonwu was at the heart of the mission the artist seeks to promote the nigerian image through the decoration of our embassies with nigerian works of art he says that the mission was a success but adds that due to the influence of tribalism on the arts in nigeria ministerial authorities concerned with the promotion of art and culture would rather assign the responsibility for projecting nigerian art abroad to young and inexperienced administrative officers mr enwonwu expects that these young officers will represent his country at the world festival of negro arts to be held in dakar senegal next spring even though the festival was first discussed in nigeria in my studio between president leopold senghor and myself while the senegalese president was on an official visit to nigeria nevertheless the sensitive artist looks to the future he plans to establish a private art gallery in lagos for the purpose of promoting evaluating and developing the right kind of aesthetic attitude and philosophy of african art the art gallery might necessitate his resigning from the civil service but mr enwonwu will be able to recall glowing years in the service of his country as art advisor the gallery will be named omekaodigwe enwonwu in memory of his father it will says enwonwu tackle all the problems of cultural art and so the imagination that flowered in youth flowers in fame that which was called useless activity became genius magnified by depth spirit and endless energy a man an artist recalls his lifetime and remembers his early inspiration and alas pursues his early love malcolm_x was a great man few recognized his greatness when he lived some have come to recognize it now many will be compelled to recognize it in the future but with the publishing of the autobiography of malcolm_x grove press no matter how one has thought of him there is no longer an excuse for the ignorant belief that malcolm_x was the devil incarnate who deserved his violent death and whose absence makes the world a better place after malcolm_xs murder carl rowan an american of african descent who was at that time director of the united states information agency expressed dismay at the foreign presss clamorous attention to the murder of an unschooled black man in harlem as the creature of the politicians who had presented him his job rowan assured the world that malcolm_x represented no more than a tiny minority of the negro population of america and then scornfully holding up the clippings from newspapers throughout the world he continued all this about an exconvict exdope peddler who became a racial fanatic i can only conclude that the need to inform world opinion is even greater than we in usia thought it to be think of that incident one american black manhonored by his nations journalists and promoted to public office by the president of the united statesdenigrating a fellow black american who was excoriated by his nations press men and considered unworthy of the serious attention of the political and economic leaders of the united states that incident was a dramatization of the bitter black paradox the american dilemma which black man will finally become honored in this country the black man with some intelligence but little vision allied with those whites who would falsify the truth about this country in order to maintain the artifice of a good image or the black man who refuses to perch precariously on the horns of the race racist dilemma who faces the horns grapples with evil even if it means his death carl rowan or malcolm_x which one do you think will go down as a hero of his times before you decide do what mr rowan did not dofind out the truth about that exconvict exdope peddler no man has more acutely described and analyzed the existential political social moral and spiritual plight of a victimized people than has malcolm_x in this book no man has painted a truer picture of the afroamericans life style from midwestern farmlands to the suburbs and ghettos of big cities no man has thrown the segregationists bigots and hypocrites lies back into their teeth with greater intelligence wit defiance bravery and inflexible honor than did malcolm_x in his life and in this book no man has so irrefutably demonstrated that the race racist problem of this country should not be restricted to the reasonable speed of leadfooted american justice but rather exposed to the moral conscience of the rest of the world through open discussions in the united nations his life was full of changesfrom farmboy to high school dropout and on to zoot suits burglary dope taking dope peddling racketeering adultery and prison and in prison the crucible in which american society ritually burns out the residual dignity of its outcasts malcolm_x became converted to a new way of life through elijah muhammad of the thenobscure nation of islam and from that day on he was inflamed with the desire for knowledge and power to help his fellow black americans no man has risen from his societys dunghills to shine with more purity of purpose to scorch the blinking eyes of those who would not see a nation continually perpetuating a racist crime and to illuminate the paths of retribution more brilliantly than did malcolm_x no man can tell of a profounder transformation and growth of intellectual social and moral consciousness than does malcolm_x who addressing students and faculty of harvard university gazed out a window at a house which served as his hideout when he was big red a burglar no man has been more foully maligned in his own country even by his own people but more warmly admired and respected and honored by enlightened statesmen and citizens of africa the middle east and many other countries than malcolm_x he was an angry man but a kind one and he foretells his own death in this book with neither selfpity nor conceit nor malice no mans life is like anothers but the lives of some men men uniquely endowed with intelligence courage honesty and moral vision and fittingly present during a critical moment in history acquire a transcendent significance to all who survive them malcolm_x was such a man that is what makes the autobiography of malcolm_x a book which must be read especially by the colored people of the world for unlike many other afroamerican spokesmen especially literary ones malcolm_x does not write with a white audience in mind near the end of his life when he went to mecca and became elhajj malik elshabazz he no longer embraced racial hatred or separatism yet he realized that the whites of the western nations might not readily give up their delusions of superiority and habits of oppression and he saw that only through the unity of colored peoples can there begin the transforming of an evil world to a better one not until black americans realize that it is the murder of malcolm_x and not of john f kennedy which will prove to be the most untimely and tragic death of this century not until that time will black americans nity as malcolm_x didjohn woodbegin to rise up in strength and dig ford three years ago just lll before my anthology hhl beyond the blues was hh published i gave a lecs turerecital of and about poetry by afroamericans on bbc british broadcasting corp radio in london england among the fan mail following that broadcast was a particularly interesting letter because in the name at the bottom of the page i recognized the author of a novel about neonazis in presentday southern germany about that book the author himself wrote in a later letter lightweight stuff but not unthinking and i use these facts as an introduction to the man who said in that first letter to me as a writer and a liberal amer ican southerner i was most interested in your fascinating talk on american negro poets last friday are there any anthologies where these poets works may be found i was particularly taken with the verses of county cullens spelling which you read now in the almost years during which i have delved into the poetry of afroamericans and the many years of astonishment at the americans ignorance of the riches rejected and wasted countee cullen was one name that used to come to the fore even in the minds of very badly informed citizens of the usa here was the moment for me to say yet do i marvel i marvelled also at the writers use of capital letters which i have left as originally written so i wrote my liberal american southern colleague a note thanking him and giving him a list of then available anthologies especially recommending langston hughes and arna bon temps the poetry of the negro which was published in doubleday and was for many years the source of information on our subject together with countee cullens own excellent anthology caroling dusk published by harper in i also mentioned alain lockes the new negro published in by boni in new york the negro caravan selected by sterling a brown arthur p davis and ulysses lee which appeared in dryden press that i thought would do for a beginners reading i enclosed a copy of eric walrond s and my selection of negroamerican poems black and unknown bards the package was rewarded with another letter from the recipient black and unknown bards arrived this morning and i have been dipping into it i find the poems for the most part almost unbearably good the underlining is mine rep and i mean that literally one gets the impression that the only really good modern poets who have something worthwhile to say and say it decently and with force are negroes an impression which i find distressingly poignant i am quoting my liberal american southerner at such length another startling paragraph from his letter is still to followbecause he voices honestly the same things about which critics have been beating about the bush for decades in fact his remarks reveal the true reasons why other writersliberal or unliberal northern eastern western or southern americans have kept the afroamerican poet outside the mainstream of american literature not because nonwhite americans cannot write but because they can and that is the distressing thing this ability this genius these qualities which make negroes men among men artists among artists in a world which does not want to recognize these truths it is as simple or as complicated as that the appreciation of art is an entirely subjective matter tastes in art are subject to fashion subject to socioeconomic circumstances to trends of the time and in the final analysis it is the consumer who decides whether he likes the article or doesnt art to me is something that awakens within me a specific sort of awareness if a picture a poem a piece of music any artistic product does this i call it art that is to say i myself decide whether or not something is art no objective criterion exists that applies to the ordinary man as well as to the professional critic the awareness which i mentioned before we may best compare with love if i meet someone who arouses in me that definite yet inexplicable awareness i say that i love that person when i am seized with this emotion the word beauty comes to my mind but in their essence love and art have nothing to do with beauty a poet need not write about beautiful pretty or glamorous things to create in his reader that specific awareness either his work appeals to me or not that is the dilemma of the art critic he must judge what he adores or abhors and he must share his emotions with others american critics almost without any exceptions have until very very recently been nonnegroes the vast majority of them have not yet learned to see afroamerican writers as just writers the critics consider subject matter first when it concerns that specific group of creative artists in the same way as concert critics used to speak of the negro contralto or the negro tenor before they gave fair criticism to the artists vocal and especially professional achievements oddly enough in the field of the performing arts the prejudiced mind worked the other way round negroes were supposed to be good singers by right of birth consideration in respect of their training and professionalism did not enter into the critics reviews and there we are on the same level as still prevails in respect to literary criticism it is remarkable that my letter writer does see the tremendous qualities of negro poets that he does feel the power and impact of their work that it arouses in him that specific awareness but he cannot love and that i am deeply sorry to state is perhaps the clue to the entire problem of the negro poet and his judges ray durem said it so painfully true i know im not sufficiently obscure to please the criticsnor devious enough imagery escapes me i cannot find those mild and gracious words to clothe the carnage blood is blood and murders murder whats a lavender word for lynch that makes me sit up all right that does give me that specific awareness and it shocks me as it must have shaken many a critic however without the ability to love that critic will not call ray durems poem art i i i right through the long history of negro writing in the united states critics in certain periods recognized a limited a very limited number of poets all of these responded to the preconceived idea of the negro all of them represented some aspect of the negro stereotype and i am audacious enough to maintain this situation is still with us to a large extent only specialists and there are preciously few of them would know that black americans have contributed to the countrys formal poetry i use the term in contrast to folk poetry as early as miss lucy terrys account of an attack by indians in and that jupiter hammons evening thought in was the first published poem by a negro the first afroamerican of whom american literature takes note is phillis wheatley an able poet but certainly not a militant or raceconscious lady miss wheatley kidnapped from africa at the age of eight sold into the ownership of the liberal and religious john wheatley became a genteel late eighteen century young lady and as a poet modelled herself on pope and milton unmistakably she had talent and craftsmanship although she allowed her teachers and society to remake her completely she sacrificed her personality to the wish to be one of them no wonder that white america wasand isready to accept that good intelligent grateful african girl she died free impoverished of tb at the age of none but the minute band of experts knows lyrical and freedomloving moses horton or daniel payne or charles reason or ann plato or alberry whitman or sincere tender militant frances ellen harper or any other negro abolitionist poet the one america does know is paul laurence dunbar but what part of his work have the white critics accepted the dialect poetry of course dunbar was a master of it of course his lyrics sing out his people live his cornbread smells most appetizingly but dunbar was not a southerner his mother was and she taught him the regional language nor was he a man of the country dunbar wanted to live by his pen his own people were still largely illiterate and those who could read and write didnt have the money to buy books so his audiencein fact his customerswere white america and to please them to make them sit up and listen he deliberately chose the kind of poetry that made him famous in their world for their sake he wore the mask that grins and lies as he himself wrote in dunbar we have another good negro who presented himself as a stereotype although he left the world a magnificent heritage of four novels a great number of short stories and hundreds of nondialect poems when he died at the age of the next in that short and very slim column of dark americans who made it in general anthologies occasionally appear in school textbooks and whose names more than just people with wayout interests know is james weldon johnson poet essayist collector of spirituals author of a book that shook his epoch the autobiography of an excolored man editor of the book of american negro poetry with its daring introduction on the negros creative genius and what of his work do we find among specimens of negro poetry a word i hate anyhow theres poetry by negroes but theres no negro poetry neither white nor red nor yellow the creation and god stepped out into space and saidim lonely ill make me a man now isnt that cute arent those coloured folk simpleminded arent they religious too i just love to hear them sing theyve all of them such beautiful voices ad lib do they taste the poetry of those sermons no they dont do they sense the tenderness no question about it they see the odd primitive adorably childish preacher rolling his eyes toward heaven for their entertainment thats why the creation has made it do those who acclaim it know the great james weldon johnsons other work you bet they dont i even know negroes who dont realize that lift every voice is his poem and the songs magnificent tune his brothers then comes the harlem renaissance scores of names tons of talent one of those who then was a youngster has really made it langston hughes now called the dean of negro writers a man whose work has been translated into practically every living language have a look in anthologies of american poetry comb through books of poetry for american secondary schools and what do you find mother to son dont misunderstand me i like the poem its a remarkable piece it communicates with people of many nations and races but that mother is as white america expects a good negro a hard working slaving woman who just wants her boy to be good too and carry on she doesnt protest seewe all know thats how negroes live they actually enjoy their lives that way colored folk dont really want to live otherwise thats how they are the scope of this article does not permit me to carry my point too far i could easily apply it to prose writings too from richard wright to james baldwin the critics of negro writing extract from it that which they have all the time expected they judge by way of subject matter not by general literary standards if there are any or by their specific awareness because there is no level of individual communication other than the mentioned negative one because there is no love my listener and letter writer knows that and it frightens him listen to him again will your new anthology beyond the blues include the poems in this one black and unknown bards i rather think it would be better to leave out any spirituals as this is the sort of thing one expects from negroes and although charming is not startling anymore whereas the poems have a great impact part of which is the fact that they are not at all the sort of thing one associates with negroes my correspondent may get some more shocks when he discovers that many of those charming spirituals were in fact coveredup songs of protest i told him so in my reply and a few things more for instance that negroes are not curios but human beings with creative abilities perhaps not better certainly not worse than others but at least on a level with the rest of the human race blindness to that simple statement is the very root of that disgusting attitude of the critic toward negro writing some people on this earth are as mari evans says in her poem fling me your challenge incontrovertibly and most magnificently black some of these also are poets writers of all the world will express best that which is truly theirs that which they experience so deeply so painfully whether it be love or hatred that it wants to press itself out of their system almost like in childbirth the german poet goethe meant something which also affects negro writing as it affects all writing of all times when he said you cant get rid of what is truly yours even if you were to throw it away he also wrote poetic content is the content of ones own life and his compatriot philosopher schopenhauer put it like this style is the physiognomy of the mind and a safer index to character than the face or the colour of ones skin rep authors or editors are only human and human beings like praise recently my anthology beyond the blues was praised by a famous critic for being the best anthology of negro verse ever published however i reject praise that was given for the wrong reasons in the same way that critics of past generations liked the work of negro stereotypes or as they interpreted the works in terms of their own minds which were unable to see negroes other than as stereotypes the presentday critic will acclaim black authors who make the reader forget they are black again it is the subject matter that counts first not the writers artistic ability the new trend is as bad as the old prather davis p forced himself not to f limp as he followed his mother out of the elevator across the lobby of the crowded police station his right knee was throbbing like a toothache from his many falls during the demonstration and he could feel warm blood snaking down his leg he was ten years old and he was hot tired and hungry he swallowed hard and hurried after his mother who cut a path through the milling demonstrators and sternfaced policemen to his left he saw a group of singing clapping demonstrators being herded through a revolving door into the police station the singing washed over him and he paused that thing in him which had settled down while he had been upstairs in juvenile detention now began to rise again it started in his stomach whirling about and rose to his throat choking him slowly he started toward the demonstrators but after a few steps his mother grabbed his hand and led him firmly out of the building going down the street prather frowned he wished his mother wouldnt hold his hand and lead him like he was a child but the hard tapping of her heels and the straight set of her shoulders made him hold his peace he glanced up at her face and seeing the tight line of her mouth he knew that just one more straw and either hot tears or hot words would pour from her so ignoring the pain in his knee he quickened his pace he heard the shrill blast of a policemans whistle and up ahead he saw a policeman in white gloves directing traffic a sleek sports car zoomed by and his eyes followed it lovingly a black police van turned the corner and from inside it he heard demonstrators singing and clapping again that thing started churning in his stomach and rose to his throat he tightened his hand around his mothers fingers and thought about this thing in his throat that choked him he choked from it whenever he heard his brother a philip who had been named after that big pullman porter man and who had come home this summer from fisk with a beard talk about civil_rights and freedom and the l a dodgers he choked from it when he played checkers with his father in the evenings after supper and when his father would tell him about the different cities to which his railroad waiters job had taken him before that accident two years ago had crippled him for life prather remembered when his father used to bring him presents he would rush to his father for it but his father would hold it high in the air he would have to climb upon a chair then onto his fathers shoulders before he could reach the present his mother would stand by nervously telling his father to quit the foolishness but his father would laugh and say let him learn to reach and today during the demonstration that thing had choked him with a philip holding his hand he was marching and feeling good when the confusion began the police had come with horses and water hoses and swinging billysticks somebody shoved him and he fell skinning his knee he scrambled to his feet looking for his brother but a philip had disappeared he heard people screaming and praying and horses hooves ringing and fire hoses swishing somebody was shouting over a loudspeaker and cameras were flashing and popping suddenly he was slammed to the pavement lights blinked behind his eyes and air gushed from his lungs as he lay with the world spinning about him someone lifted him and carried him to a police van now this thing was still in his throat as they reached the parking lot his mother let go of his hand and fumbled in her purse for the car keys finding them she turned inspecting him silently her eyes large and luminous then slowly she held out her arms the thing in his throat expanded and burst he ran crying into her soft arms letting the sweet rose smell of her wash over him the boy walked down the hill past the mess hall and into the valley he wore indian moccasins shorts rolled neatly half way up his thighs a white tshirt and a sailor hat pulled down all around through the trees ahead he could see the calm water of the lake a woodpecker knocked overhead and he stopped to locate it in the tall pines it was redheaded a big male moving clockwise around a tall pine about two thirds of the way up the cicadas were sounding their greek chorus and he could hear the crows cursing the fish hawk over the lake he moved towards the beach past the thick ivy on the valley floor to his right he stopped at the rail fence hed helped build a few summers ago and looked at the lake it was a mirror no breeze to ripple its surface the wooden pier moved out into the water its lshape reflected in its surface then the flash of a fish leaping for a bug far out in the lake and the smooth surface was broken he walked to the board with the name tags hanging on it and moved his tag from the section marked in from among the tags of the members of his troop to the section marked out hanging it on one of the hooks at the green painted symbol of canoe number three the boy walked to the racked canoes stepped out of his moccasins stooped and came up under number three a long old towne painted green he stood between the gunwales and shifted until he was at the balance point then straightened letting his legs lift it the canoe balanced on his hands he walked to the waters edge and into the lake until the water was at his calves then aware of the eyes of the younger scouts who stood at the fence he pivoted half a turn to his left and allowed the canoe to turn over of its own weight lowering it to his extended left thigh he fed the bow into the water hand over hand lowered the stern gently to the sand and walked to the rack of paddles selecting one that came just to his chin he picked up a kneeling pad that he had filled with kapok and sewn the winter before and returned to the canoe pushing it into the lake as he stepped into it and knelt at the stern thwart the boy let the canoe glide the paddle across the gunwales as he moved past the sailboat it was a sixteen foot marconirigged sloop broad of beam and with a center board well suited for the long narrow lake he had furled the sails well that afternoon he would sail again tomorrow later that evening there would be the annual songfest in the mess hall after dinner scouts from the four camps at the lake miles to the south had hiked north to hear them theirs was a singing camp and they were famous for it they sang everywhere on the trails in the dense woods when hiking around the camp fires in the mess halls in their boats and their tents at night his own troop was one of the best they might win the prize again that night for the second consecutive year the boy loved to sing and he looked forward to the evening he hummed one of his favorite songs as he jstroked lazily across the lake then he shifted his right leg from a kneeling position braced it against the side of the canoe in the racing stance digging in hard with the paddle picking up the beat the canoe leapt forward and he stroked hard until the water surged past and he began to sweat he rested the paddle across the canoe and looked astern at his wake and the whirlpools left by his paddle marring the surface of the lake he was proud of his skill on the waterfront as a swimmer with the canoe and rowboat as a life guard and in the sailboat the camp had opened a new world to him one not bounded by the dirty streets and alleys of chicago he stroked slowly toward the shallows at the other side of the lake the turtle hunting grounds watching the fish hawk circling sedately high above ignoring the crows as they divebombed him the crows offered no threat as long as he was healthy and the hawk knew it tomorrow the boy would bring two of the younger scouts across in the canoe to catch the turtles that swam and sunned in the shallows but today he wanted to be alone in the gathering dusk on the quiet lake the lake dropped off suddenly at that point and the turtles depended on the depths close at hand for protection but by keeping the canoe between the turtles and the deep water forcing them to swim parallel to the shore a wading scout could approach them from the rear reach into the water and capture them for the menagerie already full of snakes turtles and toads and frogs the boy would watch from the canoe as the younger scouts waded after the turtles and tell them when they were chasing a snapper they didnt know yet how to recognize the snappers or how to grab them without being bitten the snapping turtles were mean and often refused food in captivity so he let them swim into the depths of the lake he reached the shallows and watched six turtles scurry to the deep water he followed the shore to the end of the lake and then turned back towards camp it was time to return to his tent get his uniform from beneath the mattress where his body had pressed it the night before and shine his moccasins in time for the singing he let the younger scouts rack the canoe and then walked up the hill toward his campsite everywhere he could hear the scouts singing eager for the evenings music they were a singing camp later after the singing had finished still full of the songs and rhythm he walked from the mess hall with the crowd into the darkness of the michigan woods but he didnt return to his campsite he was still excited from the singing and he hoped their guests from the lake to the south had enjoyed it the scouts at the four camps there were from chicago too he had been to the camps there the year before for the ceremony initiating him into a higher order of the scouting fraternity he had noticed the difference in the facilities the cabins had raised concrete floors wooden sides and screening electric lights and hot and cold running water in the wash shed at each campsite at his own camp they slept in tents with wooden floors with no screening with kerosene lamps and washed in the morning in the icy water from the pump at the rustic wash racks they had built themselves they made their own mattresses from muslin to be filled with dried leaves or pine boughs or slept on the bare canvas stretched between the short springs of their bunks but their scoutmasters told them that theirs was a real camp and that they were better scouts for having to rough it and the boy believed it was true the singing had been good the best in his five summers at camp it had gotten better with each song and there had been the contest for the prize between his troop and their traditional neighborhood rivals they had not won but the voting had been close and then the two of them had sung three songs together the last a driving swinging spiritual and they had rocked the entire hall he still felt the song and although he knew that there would be more singing at campsite around a camp fire he walked on he wanted to talk to the visitors it was a black moonless night and he could not see very well coming from the mess hall which had been brightly lit with coleman lanterns but he could see the path marked with whitewashed boulders a group of scouts walked ahead and he joined them hi the boy said to one of the scouts how did you like the singing wonderful wonderful he replied it was just great its my first year in camp and everyone said how good it would be but it was even better my scoutmaster is right those niggers sure can sing there was light ahead at the entrance to the camp and the boy didnt want the scout from the camp to the south to see his face he stepped to the side of the path and allowed the group to move ahead and strangely he wasnt angry only very sad somehow he walked back to the hill and the path leading to his campsite he could hear them singing his troop and their rivals singing together the boy halted on the dark path halfway up the hill listening in the midst of the tall pines and big oaks the singing came to him filtered by the trees he stood there alone and listened then walked up the path and into the clearing of the campsite the two troops ringed the fire some sitting on the logs around it others on the sand he looked for the flag of his patrol the fox patrol and saw it stuck in the sand in front of the right members of the patrol the boy moved into the light of the fire and toward the flag he saw his friend in the midst of and waved there was a breeze stirring they would have good sailing tomorrow he sat on the sand crosslegged next to the flag and listened awhile then he began to smile as the song filled him yes he thought as he sang he was right yes we can sing history masks the faces and emotions of black men and women who lived in this racial wonderland the record burns with their presence but the record is strangely silent on their reactions and the reactions of their white colleagues the record becomes far less silent at the hands of a diligent historian in confrontation black and white johnson publishing co inc from which the above is quoted lerone bennett jr writing in his lucid style fills more voids in this nations black and white experience than have previously been filled in any one book about a nation where the popular use of history has served to defend an ugly past maintain an evil system and to avert radical change the author writes there is no need really for us to continue to play the dreadful games of the professional race relationist the game of education we must educate negroes the game of appropriation we must improve the cultural standards of negroes the game of technique it is a very complicated problem we are not now nor have we ever been playing those games the game we are playing is racism mr bennett uses history to relate precisely what brought about the game and in bringing us from jamestown to selma he explains the creation of the game and the ramifications that led to the present conundrum he delves back into history and reveals the words and actions and reactions of those both black and white whose very lives and decisions are key links to an understanding of modern reality in racist america the author cites quotes from the past that relate to the present with almost frightening accuracy and relevancy one example is found in the words of georgia white supremacist henry grady we have no fear of negro revolt already we are attaching to us the best elements of that race and as we proceed our alliance will broaden the latter thought being as true a prophecy as ever uttered in this country the need of white americans to dehumanize black americans is examined closely by mr bennett who writes slavery did not spring from racism racism sprang from slavery the concept of race was a direct outgrowth of the slave trade deliberately invented by an exploiting group which needed a theology to maintain and defend privileges founded on naked force a need arose for justification of that which could not be justified by any theory in western thought confrontation black and white includes what is perhaps the most objective account of negro leadershipits successes and failuresto date including an examination of the shortcomings as well as the brilliance of men such as frederick douglass w e b du bois asa philip randolph and martin_luther_king in addition to these known leaders the author reveals the significance of lesser known men such as martin r delaney perhaps the first major american negro nationalist prior to the civil war and richard allen an early th century black man who recognized the necessity of power it is difficult to single out the books most significant contribution but students of negro revolt and protest will note the authors filling many voids of the forties in dealing with this period bennett the historian excels at his forte and casts light on a darkness that relates with great import to the movement of the fifties and sixties in doing so the author places in true perspective the role of a man who perhaps more than any other negro leader has been bypassed in terms of his significance and influence regarding the current surge of black americaasa philip randolph bennett the historian excels throughout the book and in a conclusion he calls uamerica face to face bennett the writer reveals not only amazing perception and insight but also the courage integrity and sheer audaciousness that is perhaps primary if one is to tell the truth about this country in no uncertain terms the author assesses the roles of americans who are in a race here between white hysteria and negro despair between fascism and democracy between america and america we must make revolutionary changes at every level of our lives we must first of all abandon our frames of referencesall our frames of reference are vitiated by racist assumptions mr bennett insists that negro leadership must awaken the sleeping millions and he suggests that to do so is a challenge no national organization with the exception of sncc and the black nationalist groups has addressed itself to in a serious and sustained way he tells us that the only choice we have left is between an orderly confrontation and a disorderly one writing about the fifties he refers to a new breed of artists who came forth with a new frame of reference and a new sense of respect for themselves men and women like lorraine hansberry leroi jones john killens frank london brown hoyt fuller ossie davis miles davis ruby dee oscar brown james baldwin but such a list is incomplete if one fails to include a black historian from clarksdale mississippidavid llorens those negroes over might remember when robert penn warren one of the highlypraised group of southern writers which included allen tate back in the thirties and forties was saying in print that negroes were inferior human beings and that they would be better off to accept their lot and stop all the agitating and striving well this very same mr warren published a book this year called who speaks for the negro random house and while he failed to answer his own question he let it be known that he hasnt changed his own stripes merely covered them over a bit mr warren used a tape recorder and went out interviewing negroes as high as roy wilkins and as low as an allbutilliterate black farmer in louisiana and it is plain that mr warrens favorite nigras were mr wilkins and the farmer mr wilkins for his great good sense and the farmer for his comfortable oldfashioned humility mr warren reserved his most blistering comments for the late malcolm_x and the redoubtable james baldwin which is par for the course and naturally all the yearend literary guides have selected mr warrens who speaks for the negro as one of the best books on the subject published durasserting that the murderers consider themselves and are widely regarded as patriots william bradford huie in lives for mississippi wcc writes this murder was no ordinary outrage committed by one human being against another and therefore against a state it was part of the continuing war between mississippi terrorists and the united states of america once this is understood comprehension of what happened may become easier thus the above statement best explains the authors theory regarding the murder of james chaney michael schwerner and andrew goodman in neshoba county mississippi during the summer of the author proves himself a talented journalist and the result of his intensive researchespecially regarding the planning of the execution is a book that is quite informative mr huie also admits to hating what the white supremacy terrorists are doing to negroes to the south and to the united states butdue in part perhaps to his outrage with his native souththe authors theory seems to relieve the nation of its responsibility for the fate of the three young men huie often refers to the terrorists believing that they were striking a blow against communism by murdering the three civil_rights workers and he cites the influence of southern politicians the cooperation of the mississippi police and the complicity of the community mississippi in arriving at his conclusion that the killers believed themselves patriots this reviewer would argue that responsibility for white mississippi rednecks fear of communismfear strong enough to make men kill cannot be confined within the borders of the magnolia state or for that matter even within the south in june of last year liberal illi nois senator paul douglas told a delegation that journeyed to the capitol to appeal for additional federal protection for the summer project of which i was a member of his fear of communism in connection with the summer project in his words you must remember that there are those who would choose to use you as sacrificial lambs on our return to oxford ohio only a few days after chaney schwerner and goodman were missing members of that same delegation who were scheduled to leave for southwest mississippi natchezmccomb were briefed by john doar of the justice department mr doar advised that we refrain from entering that area of mississippi because even we are afraid to go in there and i remind you he represented the united states government a government that sends men to their death and kills men in foreign lands under the guise of protecting freedom but pleaded helplessness in the face of protecting the freedom and the lives of civil_rights workers northern mayors and newspapers have consistently made accusations of communism when assailing local movements in their cities granted mr huie probably did not have access to all of the abovementioned insights but i think they relate not so abstractly as one might like to believe to the reality of what happened in neshoba county if we have created a climate whereby men pull triggers on innocent victims and think themselves patriots the entire country is guilty in the minds of many white men both north and south communism and niggers have become one and the same huac many northern politicians many northern newspapers and other national institutions as well as mississippi authorities have contributed to this dangerous paranoia if mr huie is to have us believe that these men believed themselves patriots then i would suggest that he deludes us by saying the men who planned and committed this murder thought they were acting not against the state of mississippi but for mississippi against the united states such a statement makes them mississippi patriots perhaps the murderers believed themselves exactly that but if we are to call them patriots the truth of our national life today forces us to call them american patriots the author informs us that the killers were after schwerner the jewboy with the beard and that chaney and goodman were just unfortunate victims perhaps that is correct but in discussing the nations reaction to the tragedy he fails to mention that this reaction was based on the fact that whites were murdereda fact which says something significant about this nation of which mississippi is a part in spite of much speculation and many missing linksunderstandably so in this case lives for mississippi is a book worth reading but like most books written by white men about the problem it is incomplete mr huie quotes a speech made by cores david dennis at a memorial service for james chaney in meridian mississippi and words from mr dennis speech best sum up this reviewers reaction to both the tragedy and the authors theory and im going to tell you deep down in my heart what i feel right now if you go back home and sit down and take what these white men in mississippi are doing to us if you take it and dont do something about it then god damn your souls david llorens
on a spring morning in a reporter from the washington press walked up the long lane of stone steps leading to a spacious home in the d c suburbs bent on seeing frederick douglass although born a slave douglass had become the most prominent negro of the nineteenth century having behind him a notable career as an abolitionist orator a newspaper editor and a holder of such high public offices as marshal of the district of columbia and recorder of deeds for the district as the reporter neared the douglass home he heard tones from a violin coming closer he detected the tune and the tunesmiththe starspangled banner played by douglass himself after presenting his card the journalist stated his business what was mr douglasss opinion on the suppression of the negro vote in the south putting down his bow the negro leader spent the next hour discussing democracy in america the way the negro was treated said douglass in essence was a standing reproach to the principles upon which this republic was founded at the end of the interview douglass picked up his violin and again struck up the starspangled banner he liked to play it so he told the departing newsman this episode was full of meaning like other colored citizens douglass loved his country and he was stirred by the appeal of america as the land of the free how inspiring to live in a nation in which liberty and justice were the birthright of all but did such an america really exist not completely and no one knew this any better than darkskinned americans and so from the beginning they have been in the vanguard of those who wished to make their country as heroic and libertyloving as it has been pictured in patriotic song and story to help make america a beaconlight this was the great enterprise to which colored americans gave their devotion their notable efforts are reflected in a living record that has become a mighty tributary in the stream of american history their contribution dates from their first landings in the new world for they did not come emptyhanded in their ancestral homelands along the bulge of africa they had attained a stable order of civilization in their government the african political systems all operated under elaborate codes of law whether clan state village state kingdom or empire in tribal life the innumerable societies and social organizations were in the main established on the principle of equality thus when the african arrived on the shores of the new world he brought with him a sense of justice and a tradition of abiding by the law from africa too the transplanted native brought his art forms and handicraft skills tribal craftsmen were highly proficient in weaving pottery and carving in wood ivory and bone african craftsmen had been first to work in iron and gold metal forging being one of their oldest arts these natives from across the atlantic were among the earliest arrivals in the newly discovered americas indeed from onward they accompanied the spanish explorers on their voyages of discovery when balboa first stared at the pacific he carried colored workers in his train cortez used negroes in his conquest of mexico one of them found some brown grains in his rations and planted them thus becoming the pioneer grower of wheat in the western hemisphere the most renowned of the negroes who accompanied the conquistadores was estavanico who in led a party of spaniards and pima indians in search of the fabled seven cities of cibola estavanicos travels took him into presentday new mexico and arizona and thus paved the way for the spanish occupation of the southwest negroes also accompanied the french explorers in louisiana along the mississippi valley and in the great lakes area chicagos first permanent settler was jean baptiste pointe de sable a mulatto originally from haiti whose deed inspired the wellknown quip by the pottawattomie indians the first white man in chickagou was a negro when in john c fremont pathfinder of the west began a survey of the oregon trail his official party had in its number a colored volunteer eighteenyearold jacob dodson of washington d c the tradition of negroes accompanying explorers was to extend down to matthew a henson who on april stood at the north pole to witness robert e peary take the stars and stripes and plant its staff in the ice once in the new world the men from africa were given tasks to do in the beginning there were forests to be cleared highways to be constructed artillery to be hauled and boat timber to be lugged over the mountains after the english colonies were established beginning with jamestown in the negro was employed in the north as a farm hand mechanic and skilled laborer in the lastnamed class were those who practiced silversmithing goldsmithing and cabinetmaking in the south the negro was employed mainly in producing the staplestobacco indigo sugar rice and in the nineteenth century cotton slave labor however was put to other uses than agriculture and domestic service in the old south the slave had a virtual monopoly on the mechanic arts skilled slaves commanded a high price the plantation required a certain speciality in labor houses must be built agricultural implements must be manufactured and repaired clothing must be made for these and other needs of the plantation many trained slaves supplied their skillsamong them the carpenter mason wheelright plasterer weaver shoemaker seam stress tailor and upholsterer distinctive among the skilled slaves were the ironsmiths whose work may still be seen in the balconies grilles and lampbrackets of the homes in the old french quarter of new orleans while most of the colored workers were slaves there were many who were not in a year before the outbreak of the civil war there were nearly half a million free negroes in the united states this was about one ninth of the total negro population and it was nearly evenly divided between the north and the south but free or slave the labor of the colored man created king cotton and added greatly to the store of american mechanical skill contributing also to the economic development of the united states was the inventive genius of its colored people at the end of the eighteenth century norbert rillieux of new orleans invented a vacuum pan that revolutionized sugarrefining methods jo andersons competent assistance enabled cyrus mccormick his owner to bring to perfection the first practical reaper in a few years later lewis temple of massachusetts invented the singlepiece toggle harpoon thus enabling whalemen to multiply their catch from the fertile brain of granville t woods came nearly a score of new devices in telegraphy electricity and air brakes in the eighteen eighties elijah j mccoy a contemporary of woods produced a lubricating cup which was widely adopted by railroads and oceangoing ships in the same decade a year old colored mechanic at lynn massachusetts was granted a patent on a machine to last shoes this invention writes a recent biographer of jan earnst matzeliger was to revolutionize an ancient industry and help significantly to lighten the burden of human labor all over the world no less noteworthy than the colored mans economic contribution to america was that of his war services the patriotism of the negro has been well testedhe was never a summer soldier whenever america has been engaged in a war he has offered his services a runaway slave crispus attucks was the first patriot to shed his blood on the eve of the revolutionary war attucks was buried from historic faneuil hall a monument which stands at the scene of the boston massacre commends him and his four comrades in martyrdom long as in freedoms cause the wise contend dear to your country shall your fame extend in the war of perhaps the most important single action in which negroes participated was that of the colored militia who shared in the famous battle of new orleans the only land victory won by americans commanded by major general andrew jackson these more than men of color marched to battle singing their own war song go forward grenadiers he who is dead requires no ration in the civil war negroes enlisted under the union flag of whom gave the last full measure of devotion but soldiering was not their only contribution in the north and in the confederacy the brawn and sweat of black men went into many a fortification and gun emplacement one of the many colored women who worked for the day of liberation was the famed underground railroad conductor harriet tubman who served as spy scout and war nurse in world war i more than negroes bore arms four colored regiments were awarded the croix de guerre in world war ii a quarter of a century later the first casualty of the united states armed forces was a negro robert h brooks of sadieville kentucky who was killed in the philippines the day after pearl harbor in the korean war the colored soldier served in racially mixed units for the first time in significant numbers since the revolutionary war this drumming jim crow out of the armed services was a step which improved the fighting efficiency of americas armed forces a report issued from the office of the assistant secretary of defense entitled integration in the armed services and dated january made this significant statement thorough evaluation of the battletested results to date indicates a marked increase in overall combat effectiveness through integration through his direct participation in every war since the declaration of independence the negro has substantially contributed to the defense and maintenance of his country another contribution of his one of a different kindis what might be called the gift of the spirit of its many manifestations the one which has made the greatest impress on american culture is the negro song the most remarkable of the songs are the spirituals products of plantation churches conducted by colored preachers these songs sprang up spontaneously they served as a safetyvalve being the negros side of what happened to him but they were more they were remarkable for their power of feeling power of imagination and power of expression of the nearly of these spirituals perhaps two of the most familiar are deep river and swing low sweet chariot the spirituals are americas only folksong and they now belong to the world of negro origin also are many american work songs negroes who followed the sea improvised boat songs and rowing songs the rhythmic tunes of swarthy stevedores served as a laborsaving device in stowing cotton hoisting sail or casting anchor becoming part of the sailormens stock of songs as they gathered the harvest in the fields colored toilers sang to ease their tasks these plantation strains were destined to survive in railroad and hammer songs like water boy and those clustering around the fabulous john henry using such typical language as this old hammer killed john henry but this old hammer wont kill me with the coming of the twentieth century the vocal music of the negro was diverted into the field of entertainment from negro folksong came another outflowering that of ragtime this music with a ragged time to it was given a twist in theme in and the result was the immortal st louis blues composed by w c handy one night as he sat in a tavern on a levee street in st louis after ragtime was rebaptized as jazz and it quickly swept the country its influence soon spread to europe where it aroused the enthusiasm of serious musicians and composers jazz is on its way to becoming the music of the world wrote belgian musicologist robert goffin in the rhythms used in negro vocal music were much like those used in negro dance from plantation dances such as the juba came the minstrel show with its series of peculiar shuffling steps one of the colored minstrel men was james bland who before he reached twenty had composed carry me back to ole virginny now the state song of the old dominion the dance patterns of the minstrel show gave their stamp to the cakewalk and then later to the charleston the big apple and a host of others the influence which the negro has exercised on the art of dancing in this country has been almost absolute concludes james weldon johnson a student of negro culture just as americas music and dance reflect a negro influence so do this countrys behavior patterns into the channels of the american spirit the transplanted african has infused his zest for living carl g jung the great swiss psychologist has noted the negro influence on our daytoday behavior what then about american laughter writes he in rhetorical question what about the boundless noisy sociality the pleasure in movement and in stunts of all sorts the loosejointed walk the negroid dance and music it would be difficult not to see that the negro has affected american behavior another negro quality which has become a national trait is the ability to adapt oneself to a society that is never staticthe old order changeth yielding place to new the american negro writes melville j herskovits is characterized by that resilience toward new experience which in itself is a deepseated tradition of africa such a resiliency well might be the key to tomorrowone who is accustomed to scanning new horizons is not likely to be chained to the fixed assumptions of a day that is dying civilization writes lewis mumford is the neverending process of creating one world and one humanity for such a new cosmopolitanism the american negro is fitted by his physical characteristics his interculturalist background and his resilient spirit if as wyndham lewis suggests the united states has become a human laboratory for the manufacture of cosmic man if van wyck brooks can speak of the planetarymindedness of the american people and if harrison smith can maintain that this country is now producing the first world man then the negro in our midst may claim a modest share of influence this recital of the role of the negro has left out much but it may indicate that the choicest heritage of this land includes the contributions of its sable sons and daughters to the making of america they have given their best and their all the negro finally has played a unique role as a mirror for america a test of this countrys ideals a sort of spiritual barometer from the beginning his presence has raised an important question would america become an oligarchy of the skin or a land of equal justice under law colored americans by and large have never doubted what the answer will be i know of no country where the conditions for the development of liberty and humanity are more favorable than here in the united states so spoke a former slave who was destined to hold positions of high honor in the government of his country and who liked to play the starspangled banner on his violin on a hot day in august a prominent politician entered the white house and paused in the presir office it was dark joseph t mills wrote later and there in a corner i saw a man quietly reading who possessed a remarkable physiognomy the man awed judge mills i was riveted to the spot he said adding i stood and stared at him he raised his flashing eyes and caught me in the act i was compelled to speak said i are you the president no replied the stranger i am frederick douglass it was an honest mistake frederick douglass was in washington to see abraham lincoln he was not the president but under different circumstances he could have been he had all the giftspresence passion bearing brilliance all the gifts save one he was nonwhite coloran accident of birthbarred him from the highest prize but it did not prevent him from becoming one of the most remarkable men of that or any other age born in the lowest position in society douglass emancipated himself and became an orator an abolitionist an editor a politician a seer and a prophet bom brown and hungry in a society that forbade slaves to read he lifted himself by his own efforts and became one of the great names of an age that abounds in greatness for years from to he was in the forefront of the fight for human freedom during this period he laid the foundation for the negro protest movement although he died years ago frederick douglass is as current as yesterdays headline one hundred and ten years ago he was staging sitins on massachusetts railroads one hundred and six years ago he was leading a fight for integrated schools in rochester new york one hundred years ago he was denouncing hypocrisy and fraud with prebaldwin fury if there is no struggle he said there is no progress those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground they want the rain without thunder and lightning they want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters this struggle may be a moral one or it may be a physical one or it may be both moral and physical but it must be a struggle power concedes nothing without a demand it never did and never will men may not get all they pay for in this world but they must certainly pay for all they get more important than the eloquence of douglass words was the eloquence of his life frederick augustus washington bailey he assumed the name douglass later was born in february on the eastern shore of maryland he never knew his father who was rumored to be his master and he only saw his mother five or six times slavery he said once abolished both fatherhood and motherhood as a child he knew the brutality and degradation of slavery he knew hunger and pain and he saw his aunt and other negro men and women whipped till blood ran like rivulets down their backs a stroke of luck sent douglass to baltimore md where he learned at an early age that knowledge is power his mistress wanted to teach him the alphabet but his master forbade it give a nigger an inch he said and he will take an ell learning would spoil the best nigger in the world listening thinking dreaming frederick came to the conclusion that words were weapons he hid dirty pages in his pockets and when no one was looking he extracted the pages and spelled out the magic words later while still a slave douglass learned that power has its limitations this was an extraordinary discovery and it changed the whole course of his life it happened this way he refused to buckle down to his master and was sent to a professional negrobreaker who specialized in destroying the spirit of slaves who would not submit to the slave regime the negrobreakers name was edward covey and covey was good at his trade he worked douglass until he was ready to drop from exhaustion and whipped him until he bowed and smiled but wormsand slaves and negroesturn one day douglass tells he turned and made a desperate last stand the two men grappled to an indecisive draw covey stalked off and never afterwards touched douglass from this incident douglass drew a moral which he applied to many situations after he gained his freedom he is whipped oftenest who is whipped easiest four years later at the age of douglass escaped from slavery in he borrowed a sailor suit and an officiallooking paper with a big american eagle on it grabbing a train he traveled to new york flashing his eaglestamped paper as he went three years later he joined the phalanx of negro and white men who were waging an intense cold war against slavery white abolitionists like william lloyd garrison and free negroes like charles lenox remond were in the forefront of the movement but they did not have the firsthand knowledge that douglass had and their speeches lacked his concreteness and fire douglass on the platform was a sight to see he was a goodlooking man tall wellbuilt with olive skin and a halo of hair worn long and au naturel in the african style his physical presence moved people so did the rolling thunder of his voice by turns humorous dolorous and indignant he transformed his audience to slave row a master mimic he could make people laugh at a slaveowner preaching the duties of christian obedience could make them see the humiliation of a black maiden ravished by a brutal slaveowner could make them hear the sobs of a mother separated from her child through him people could cry and curse through him people could live slavery white men and black men william wells brown said had talked against slavery but none had ever spoken like frederick douglass within a few years douglass was a household name he traveled to england ireland and scotland was feted by ladies lords and earls his reception was so warm that he was tempted to remain abroad but in an eloquent farewell speech at london tavern he said i choose rather to go home to return to america i go turning my back upon the ease and comfort and respectability which i might maintain even here ignorant as i am still i will go back for the sake of my brethren i go to suffer with them to toil with them to endure insult with them to lift up my voice in their behalf to speak and write in their vindication and struggle in their ranks for that emancipation which shall yet be achieved by the power of truth and of principle for that oppressed people so turning his back on ease comfort and respectability douglass returned to america for almost six years he had labored in the garrison vineyard now he stepped out on his own in he started publishing the north star in rochester new york from that year until the abolition of slavery he was in the forefront of the abolitionist ranks in an age of danger and doubt douglass and other black abolitionists came to grips with dilemmas which lie deep in the negros heart douglass asked the old and insistent question how can i sing the lords song in a strange land the answers revolved around the traditional trilogy ballots bullets or bibles and iagos injunction go make money the followers of william lloyd garrison condemned complexional institutions negro churches lodges schools newspapers and conventions the garrisonians also abandoned political action and advocated a campaign based on passive resistance and moral force after douglass favored ballots if possible and bullets if necessary he was an opportunist on the issue of complexional institutions he demanded complete integration but if circumstances made this impossible he unhesitatingly recommended special institutions at stake here was a bitter issue of power douglass was an independent man who felt uncomfortable in a subsidiary role he demanded a share in the generalship of the movement in a statement reminiscent of toussaint louverture he said no people that has solely depended on foreign aid or rather upon the efforts of those in any way identified with the oppressor to undo the heavy burdens ever stood forth in the attitude of freedom douglass believed that he and other black abolitionists could make a positive contribution by proving that negoes were active rather than passive cogs in the antislavery machinery he said that the man who has suffered the wrong is the man to demand redressthat the man struck is the man to cry outand that he who has endured the cruel pangs of slavery is the man to advocate liberty it is evident that we must be our own representatives and advocates not exclusively but peculiarlynot distinct from but in connection with our white friends douglass famous fourth of july speech is a good example of the passion and brilliance he brought to the antislavery cause speaking at rochester new york on july he indicated every structure of power in america what he asked to the american slave is your th of july i answer a day that reveals to him more than all other days in the year the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim to him your celebration is a sham your boasted liberty an unholy license your national greatness swelling vanity your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless your denunciation of tyrants brass fronted impudence your shouts of liberty and equality hollow mockery your prayers and hymns your sermons and thanksgivings with all your religious parade and solemnity are to him more bombast fraud deception impiety and hypocrisya thin veil to cover crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages you boast of your love of liberty douglass continued your superior civilization and your pure christianity you hurl anathemas at the crowned headed tyrants of russia and austria and pride yourselves on your democratic institutions while you yourselves consent to the mere tools and bodyguards of the tyrants of virginia and carolina you invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad honor them with banquets greet them with ovations cheer them toast them salute them protect them and pour out your money to them like water but the fugitives from your own land you advertise hunt arrest shoot and kill you glory in your refinement and your universal education yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nationa system begun in avarice supported in pride and perpetuated in cruelty you shed tears over fallen hungary and make the sad story of her wrongs the theme of your poets statesmen and orators till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against the oppressor but in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the american slave you would enforce the strictest silence and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse douglass dared to make the ten thousand wrongs the subject of public discourse week after week year after year in the crucial decades before the civil war he went up and down the north warning preaching pleading he and other negro abolitionists played a major role in shaping the crisis which led to the civil war during the civil war douglass prodded the famous slow coach at washington long before lincoln perceived it douglass was saying that the war was a struggle to give america a new birth of freedom long before lincoln saw it douglass was saying that the negro was inextricably involved in the root cause of the war and that the war could not be fought or ended without coming to grips with the meaning of the negro and the meaning of america after the emancipation proclamation was issued douglass turned his fertile mind to the problems of reconstruction he demanded ballots for the freedmen and land and said with impeccable logic that as one learns to swim by swimming the negro must learn how to vote by voting four things he said were necessary the right to the cartridge box the ballot box the jury boxand the knowledge box when the north reneged on its promise and turned the freedmen over to the tender mercies of their exmasters douglass was merciless in denunciation in he denounced the negros socalled emancipation as a stupendous fraud a fraud upon him a fraud upon the world america he said had abandoned the negro ignored his rights and left him a deserted a defrauded a swindled and an outcast manin law free in fact a slave in this period douglassdespite his denunciationbecame an elder statesman he was named marshall of the district of columbia and minister to haiti but he continued to press the claims of negroes he had one foot in the grave on the day a young negro student came to him and asked mr douglass what shall i do with my life the old warrior pulled himself up to his full height and his eyes blazed with the fury of his youth as he said agitate agitate agitate on a cold gray day in february the great agitator slumped to the floor in his mansion at anacostia heights washington d c and went to that peace promised all men the legislators of several northern states passed resolutions of regret and the legislature of north carolina adjourned for the day to mark the death of the greatest negro produced in this country at his funeral in washington john hutchinson sang the abolitionist song his brother jesse had dedicated to douglass vll be free ill be free and none shall confine with fetters and chains this spirit of mine from my youth have vowed in god to rely and despite the oppressor gain freedom or die a few days later the negroes of americus ga held a meeting and voted to contribute to a national fund to erect a monument in douglass honor no people these maids and laborers and cottonpickers said no people who can produce a douglass need despair what does douglass say to us today what can we find in his life to nerve us for the trials in this hour first of alland this is very importantdouglass was a man in the deepest and truest sense of that muchabused word today when there are so few menblack or whitewe need the nobility of his example douglass knewand we need that knowledge today that to be a man is to be precisely responsible he knew too that manhood is founded on selfrespect and selfesteem frederick douglass did not doubt himself nor did he apologize for his place of birth or the color of his mothers skin he reminds us at an hour when many need reminding that the man who knows who he is and where he is going can move mountainsand mississippi frederick douglass was a man and he was a sensitive man he did not isolate himself from the masses wherever he went the negro went with him he bitterly criticized free negroes and there were manywho were indifferent to the antislavery cause free negroes and slaves he said were chained together and would rise or fall together middleclass negroes who shun and despise lowerclass negroes today would do well to remember his words his mission he said was to stand up for the downtrodden to speak for the dumb and to remember those in bond as bound with me another quality in douglass life that speaks to us today is his commitment douglass was committed he acted wherever he was he sought out the struggle and involved himself in it and he was persistent life in this age was not easy for a white agitator it was impossible for a negro douglass was roughed up by proslavery thugs his right hand was broken he was thrown down steps but he took his knocks and stood his ground it was difficult in this age to find a hall that would let a negro abolitionist use its facilities in rochester new york once douglass took his stand under a tree and began addressing five people by the time he varmed up he had an audience of five hundred frederick douglass was persistent and he was catholic he was a universal man and he refused he said to allow himself to be insensible to the wrongs and sufferings of any part of the great family of man he fought for womens suffrage free speech poor barefoot ireland and the chinese and he opposed flogging in the navy monopolies and capital punishment i base no mans rights he said upon his color and plead no mans rights because of color my objection to slavery is not that it sinks a negro to the condition of a brute but that it sinks a man to that condition douglass realized however that individuality is universality he realized that a man is most human when he is most himself and he made no apologies for raising inconvenient questions when he was rich in honors and money he accepted an invitation to speak in ohio but he warned the sponsors that he did not intend to bite his tongue negroes he said still need the help of all who can say a word in their behalf if i come to you in july i shall bring the colored man with me finallyand this is most importantdouglass was militant he not only told the truth but he also lived it he refused to accept segregation and discrimination he assumed that every door open to a human being was open to him and if turned away he made an issue of it when asked to leave a jim crow car he would refuse to move the conductor usually called assistants who would drag douglass out of the car along with several seats he always managed to hold onto acceptance and transcendence growth and commitment universality and militancy these qualities in douglass life are relevant to our present situation they also explain why mary church terrell considered frederick douglass the greatest of all americansperiod and exclamation point today on the nd anniversary of the emancipation proclamation frederick douglass is central to the negros struggle for as robert hayden has said when it is finally ours this freedom this liberty this beautiful and terrible thing needful to man as air usable as earth when it belongs at last to our children when it is truly instinct brain matter diastole systole reflex action when it is finally won when it is more than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians this man this douglass this former slave this negro beaten to his knees exiled visioning a world where none is lonely none hunted alien this man superb in love and logic this man shall be remembered oh not with statues rhetoric not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone but with the lives grown out of his life the lives fleshing his dream of the beautiful needful thing romes negro emperor only negro ever to sit on the throne of the caesars that his brief reign was completely eclipsed by the infamy of both his predecessor and successor the ruler macrinus followed was caracalla an insane mass murderer under the delusion that he was alexander the great the bizarre creature who succeeded him was caracallas illegitimate son incredible heliogabalus an effeminate teenage boy given to practicing weird religious rites and wearing womens clothes for a clearer insight into the life and career of macrinus it would be useful to comment briefly on the times in which he lived in ad the year he came to power rome was in a state of decline able vigorous emperor septimius severus had died in ad and left his two sons caracalla and geta as coemperors but the following year caracalla treacherously murdered his brother and seized power for himself it was the beginning of a grisly reign of terror twenty thousand romans were butchered for the sole reason that the tyrant suspected them of having been friendly to his brother combining extravagance with cruelty caracalla stripped the treasury and levied heavy taxes to finance his wars of conquest ironically some historians have praised him for issuing the famed edict granting roman citizenship to all freeborn citizens of the empire but caracalla was not motivated by altruism roman citizens are liable for taxation and new sources of revenue were forever needed to feed the tyrants ambitions in the last years of his reign caracalla became completely deranged obsessed with the fantasy of being a second alexander he decided in to emulate his idol by conquering the persian empire he attacked the persians in the spring and by late fall had driven deep into the persian kings domains but he failed to win a decisive victory the persian army no match for caracallas legions waged a scorched earth and guerrilla warfare campaign and by the beginning of winter the romans were exhausted from pursuing a phantom enemy deciding to resume the offensive the following spring caracalla set up winter headquarters in the syrian city of edessa it was during this period of relative idleness that caracallas madness began to show signs of getting out of control always contemptuous of roman institutions he now surrounded himself with a picked bodyguard of the most ferocious barbarians in the empirewild men from the scythian steppes and scottish highlands who dressed in animal skins and painted themselves blue a savage himself caracalla far preferred their company to that of more civilized persons it was in early april of that caracalla made the insane remark that sealed his doom turning to one of his bodyguards he casually observed that rome was rotten to the core and their peoples would have no trouble taking the city any time they wanted to the silence that followed was a silence of death the lunatic words were heard not only by the barbarians but by four of the emperors top advisers these were admiral marcius agrippa two tribunes of the pretorian guard named apollinaris and nemesianus and the pretorian prefect himselfmarcus opellius macrinus as pretorian prefect macrinus was the second most powerful man in the empire and he now decided that rome could only survive by ridding itself of a destructive psychopath who had lost the last shred of his reason the man selected to assassinate caracalla was julius martialis a soldier who bore a grudge against the emperor for reneging on a promise to make him a centurion the murder took place on april while the emperor was on his way from edessa to nearby carrhae to worship at the temple of the local fertility goddess noticing that caracalla had dismounted to relieve himself martialis came up behind him and struck him with a small dagger the tyrant died instantly and his assassin outlived him by no more than minutes being despatched by a javelin hurled by one of the furclad scythians in the emperors bodyguard the next few hours were crucial for the plotters for all his cruelty and madness caracalla was tremendously popular with the barbarians who made up the bulk of his army pampered and ridiculously overpaid with funds looted from the people of rome they had never had it so good and determined to wreak bloody revenge for the loss of their murdered hero the situation forced macrinus to report to a desperate ruse martialisthe only man who could give him awaywas dead the barbarians had no indication of the extent of the plot so macrinus and his fellow conspirators quickly feigned grief and ordered caracalla buried with the highest honors taken in by the plotters show of mourning the soldiers held a meeting to select a new emperor the issue was never in doubt as pretorian prefect macrinus was now the most influential citizen in the empire the legions quickly acclaimed him and the senate on hearing of caracallas death lost no time in following suit on april of a d four days after the tyrants death an african negro became sole ruler of a domain that reached from the atlantic to the caspian and from scotland to the nile opellius macrinus was born in ad during the reign of marcus aurelius his birthplace was the city of caesaea in the roman province of morocco since moroccothen as now was a racially mixed area what historical evidence is there of macrinuss negro origin apart from the incontrovertible evidence of busts and bas reliefs attention should be called to the fact that historians of the roman era continually refer to the emperor as a moor today a moor is simply a citizen of morocco and the designation could include persons of widely differing ethnic back grounds such as browneyed oliveskinned arabs or blueeyed redhaired berber descendants of vandal invaders but to the ancientsand to writers and historians of a period reaching from antiquity to the th centurythe word has another connotation and was nothing more than an oldfashioned term for negro so it is safe to assume that when such ancient roman historians as dio cassius aurelius victor and the authors of the scriptores historiae augustae speak of macrinus as a moor they do so in the same sense as does shakespeare when he speaks of darkskinned othello as the moor of venice as macrinus was of humble origin little is known of his early life somehow he received an education as a lawyer in his native city and was apparently active in litigation involving estates since he first came to rome to take a position as estate agent for fulvius plautianus a powerful figure who served as pretorian prefect during the reign of septimius severus plautianuss career came to an unhappy end in ad when he was convicted of graft and put to death for a while it looked like macrinus would share his patrons fate but he was saved by the intervention of fabius cilo caracallas tutor who went to the emperor and assured him of macrinuss innocence severus a stern but fairminded man who detested orruption interrogated macrinus at length and was so favorably impressed with the african that he not only spared his life but gave him the post of traffic superintendent along the flaminian way under caracalla he held several appointments as procurator territorial governor and was finally promoted to the allpowerful position of pretorian prefect and it was this post that served macrinus as a springboard to sovereignty over all of rome macrinuss first task as emperor was to clean up the mess left by caracalla and in doing so he won nothing but praise his initial act was to release a number of men under sentence of death or serving terms of life imprisonment after being found guilty of impiety toward the dead tyrant in most of these cases the alleged impiety consisted of nothing more serious than making slighting remarks about caracallas vaingloriousness or delusion that he was a second alexander along with sparing the lives of these condemned men he restored their inheritances and estates which had been confiscated by the greedy tyrant macrinus also won favor by his modesty so much in contrast to his predecessors megalomania when a grateful senate voted to strike huge silver and gold images of the new emperor he declined the measure on grounds of economy and decreed that no silver image be made of him weighing over five pounds and no gold ones of over three pounds although caracallas memory was detested in rome the soldiers continued to revere him and macrinus did not yet feel safe to attack the fallen despot openly yet in subtle ways he began to downgrade him pleading reasons of economy he threw down a number of caracallas statutesparticularly those made of precious metalsand restored the gold and silver to the treasury then he admitted first privately and then publicly that the war against the persians had been caused by caracallas ambition and lust for glory this statement caused some grumbling in the ranks but his popularity in rome rose to new heights also to macrinuss credit was the tactful manner with which he disposed of a problem created by the presence of caracallas aged mother julia domna widow of the respected severus suspected macrinuss complicity in her sons death and rashly gave vent to her feelings abusing the new emperor in the bitterest terms but macrinus disdaining to take action against a now defenseless old woman sent her a kindly message of greeting and allowed her to keep all her wealth and estates julia domnas rashness was perhaps prompted by the fact that she knew she was dying anyway a sufferer from cancer of the breast she succumbed a few months later of all macrinuss actions there is probably none that won him more praise than his attitude toward the corps of professional informers that infested rome despising the unsavory breed he coldly refused to publish any of the incriminating documents they kept sending him or forward them to the senate for action the emperors enlightened and civilized spirit was also apparent when he was administering justice to persons accused of serious crimes three senatorsmanilius julius and amenianushad been found guilty of causing the death of a provincial lieutenant governor through giving false testimony but macrinus instead of putting them to death merely banished them to islands he explained his refusal to execute the guilty men on grounds that we should be found doing ourselves the very things of which we accuse them as a civil administrator macrinus was an outstanding success unfortunately his success did not extend to the military sphere shortly after coming to power macrinus as an essential measure cut the soldiers pay back to levels that had been established by severus caracallas reckless extravagance had almost ruined romes economy and macrinuss action was not only statesmanlike and courageous but absolutely necessary but the barbarian soldiers knowing nothing of economics raged against the pay cut and in some garrisons there was open talk of revolt this unhappy situation played into the hands of a dangerous enemyartabanus king of the persians resentful of caracallas aggressions artabanus in the fall of attacked the demoralized romans near the mesopotamian village of nisibis and inflicted a decisive defeat on them with this victory the persians regained much of the territory lost to caracalla and morale in the legions sank to an alltime low low army morale caused by the pay cut and the defeat at nisibis paved the way for events that led to macrinuss downfall the rebellion against the emperor broke out on may th of ad at emesa caracallas former winter headquarters leading the uprising was an unlikely quartet composed of three women and a yearold boy the women were maesa julia domnas sister mamaea and soaemis her two daughters and youthful heliogabalus soaemiss illegitimate son by caracalla soaemis was married at the time of her sons birth to an elderly priest named varius avitus but there was no secret about the boys paternity for one thing avitus died of old age shortly after the boy was born second soaemis and caracalla were known to have been lovers and third there was an astounding physical resemblance between caracalla and heliogabalus in a clever propaganda move the women stirred the emesa garrison to revolt by parading heliogabalus up and down the city walls and then exhibiting likenesses of caracalla to accentuate the resemblance between father and son the barbarian soldiers seeing a nearreincarnation of the tyrant they adored eagerly raised the standard of revolt and declared heliogabalus emperor when macrinus heard of the rebellion he ordered julianus a trusted local commander to suppress it but his troops who had been promised lavish pay increases by the rebels mutinied and put julianus to death a similar fate overtook basilanus the governor of egypt who was known to be loyal to macrinus the revolt was spreading and macrinus who was as popular in rome as he was unpopular with the pampered barbarians who had served with caracalla appealed to the senate for support the senate promptly responded and fresh troop levies were sent to the emperors headquarters at antioch on june of ad the two armies clashed near a small village some miles from antioch in a battle that was to decide the fate of an empire unfortunately for the people of rome macrinuss hastilyrecruited conscripts were no match for the seasoned veterans who were fighting not for a cause or ideal but for the return of their privileges overwhelmingly defeated macrinus barely managed to escape the battlefield with his life yet he refused to give up hope shaving his beard and disguising himself as a common citizen the emperor made his way from antioch to the city of chalcedon on the bosphorus site of modern istanbul it was macrinuss intention to return to rome rally the senate and people and organize resistance against the rebels with the capital as his base but this was not to be the emperor was arrested in chalcedon by aurelius celsus a prorebel centurion taken inland to the province of cappadocia and slain by another centurion named marcianus taurus diadumenianus the emperors yearold grandson was also put to death at the time of his murder macrinus had ruled exactly months on hearing of the emperors fate the senate bowed to the inevitable and recognized heliogabalus as emperor in the four years that followed rome sank to its lowest ebb as the office once held by augustus trajan and marcus aurelius was occupied by a simpering teenager who worshipped outlandish gods wore womens clothes and openly consorted with male lovers had macrinus lived in the heyday of romes greatness he might wellwith his brilliant mind and enlightened spirithave gone down in history as one of the great caesars instead it was the misfortune of this littleknown african to live in a period of decay and to have his reign sandwiched in between those of two of the most loathsome tyrants in history by the third century ad the cancer that killed rome had taken root too deeply and macrinus cannot be blamed for failing singlehandedly to arrest the decline of an empire the contribution to history of romes negro emperor is that he was able during his month reign to bring a brief interregnum of tolerance and sanity to a civilization headed pell mell for suicide as the white man tells the time it was about three oclock in the afternoon and as he kept count of the rising and setting of the sun it was the th day of june many long knife pony soldiers had ridden up the narrow valley from the south and only a quick amassing of his warriors and their brave deeds had kept the soldiers out of the village the hunkpapa sioux leaders medicine had been good sitting bull had watched while the young men faced the skirmish line across the valley with pride in their valor he watched the white soldiers break their formation and retreat to the apparent safety of the trees along the river under the onslaught of the combined sioux and cheyenne defenders the great sioux was surprised when the soldiers fled this position and hotly pursued by the warriors rode wildly back towards the south the fighting was nearly a mile away now and some of the squaws and other noncombatant indians had ventured from the village in search of loot or perhaps a soldier gun left behind by the fleeing troopers keeping close to the cottonwoods on the west bank of the little big horn sitting bull rode towards the place where the fighting had been the heaviest others from the village were ahead of him he observed several women and two old men who were busily stripping the clothing from a soldier who had died there as he watched he was brought quickly to attention by a womans startled cry that rose from a spot at the timbers edge about yards ahead the alarm brought sitting bull at a brisk trot come quickly a wasicun sapa he is still alive the hunkpapa leader dismounted and strode quickly to the scene wasicun sapa was the sioux term for black white man and sitting bull discovered that the object of the squaws wrath and attention was indeed a black white man and the only negro he had ever known the man known to the sioux as azimpi was barely alive he had been struck in the back just below the right shoulder by a rifle ball and upon emerging the bullet had torn a gaping wound in his chest the front of his buckskin shirt was soaked with blood one of his boots was missing and sitting bull could see additional wounds in his leg and foot the great hunkpapa medicine man knelt beside the dying negro and as their eyes met they conversed briefly in the sioux dialect with a quick motion of his arm sitting bull dispatched one of the women to the river for water she returned with a dripping shawl the famous sioux squeezed water from the cloth into a polished buffalo horn cup that he carried at his belt and placed the cup at the lips of the dying man azimpi drank briefly smiled painfully at sitting bull and slumped over dead sitting bull explained tersely to the bystanders he was once one of us i knew him as a good man his woman is a sioux and she will mourn as will the women in our camp tonight there was no more to be said sitting bull remounted and rode back towards the village when he had departed the sioux women quickly stripped the buckskin clothing from the negros body and one of the old men carried away a wide brimmed white straw hat the depredation ended here apparently out of respect of sitting bulls friendly gesture to the dying man they refrained from mutilating his remains and vented their fury by hacking up all of the other bodies found nearby the above order one of many issued by general george armstrong custer in preparation for his campaign against the hostile in dians in was a prelude to the final adventure in the life of isaiah dorman passed over by historians and nearly obscured by the deeds of more flamboyant characters who helped to shape the west dorman stands distinguished as a member of his race who gave his life in service to his country during this hectic post civil war period little is known of his origin there are no known photographs of him it is said that he was known to many roving bands of sioux as early as tribal history indicates that a large black white man was well known and well received in their villages this is borne out by the fact that dorman was known to the indians as azimpi or teat in the guttural sioux tongue the word azimpi meaning teat or nipple sounded much like isaiah traveling with a horse and a pack mule the good natured negro roamed unmolested in the land of the sioux his freedom was his prized possession and he sustained himself by small scale trading and trapping early in dorman perhaps weary of the roving life or possibly not wanting to be caught up in the seething turmoil that was brewing between red cloud and the whites along the bozeman road ventured into the minnesota country here he took as a wife a young santee woman of inkpadutas band later that year he presented himself and sought employment at fort rice near the present day bismarck in the dakotas with his wife he dwelled in a small cabin at the fort he became known to the officers at the fort as a jovial and easy going individual and completely courageous and trustworthy dorman had supported himself by working as a woodcutter for the post trader but when the post commander and quartermaster learned of his knowledge of the territory and his ability to travel among the indians he was slated for better things on november he was hired by lieut j m marshall to serve as a mail carrier between fort rice and fort wadsworth he made the mile round trip only once that year but was to make it and others many more times during the years isaiah also supplemented his income by cutting wood for the trading firm of durfee peck and for major charles e galpin at the standing rock agency on september he was hired by capt henry inman to serve as a guide in the field for the military escort that accompanied the northern pacific railroad engineers in a survey that year he received per month for this employment a handsome sum in this era upon completion of this duty and by order and authorization of the commanding general of the department by special order dorman was hired as post interpreter at fort rice at the rate of per month he received this salary until february when an overall cutback and reduction in budget caused all civilian employees of the military to be reduced in pay from that time isaiah received but per month he still supplemented his income by cutting wood for the durfee peck branch at fort rice due to his size and rugged strength it was said that old teat could cut a cord of wood faster than his helper could stack it it is interesting to note that dorman was a parttime employee of durfee peck this firm operated by e h hicks durfee and campbell k peck with headquarters at leavenworth kansas enjoyed what was practically a monopoly on the indian and military trade in north dakota south dakota and montana during the years under contract they supplied cattle hay lumber and wood to both the military installations and indian agencies bonded to the government in the amount of each year their bond was not accepted in and they were out of business it was not a failure of the firm to fulfill its obligations to the interior department but its failure to play ball with the corrupt grant administration particularly the presidents younger brother orvil who was pocketbook deep in attempting to grab a share of all of the trading post business in the territories general custer was fully aware of the graft and the grant dealings on the frontier and made it known very publicly that goods earmarked for distribution to the reservation indians in keeping with treaty agreements were finding their way into private markets the result he alleged was that the deprived indians were starving and becoming hostile and in turn fleeing the reservations his allegations were no doubt true however the flamboyant general failed to take them through channels and instead published them through one of his many magazine articles this resulted in custer being hailed before an investigating committee headed by chairman heister clymer custer spoke his piece grants wrath fell directly on his long blonde curls this was on march just five days earlier campbell k peck had testified in regard to the same graft that had put him out of business durfee peck was defunct custer was relieved and faced suspension the trading firm never recovered and it was only through the intervention of general alfred h terry who always appeared to be in everyones good graces that custer was restored to duty and allowed to lead his command on the expedition acres of words have been written about custers march into the valley of the little big horn and of the fate that awaited him there it is known that in addition to the enemy that he faced there were those who followed him who were twice as treacherous his civilian scouts and both interpreters isaiah dorman and fred girard were of his own selection following the issuance of special order isaiah dorman was hired officially by lieut harry j nowlan who at the time was regimental quartermaster of the seventh cavalry his pay of per month started on may isaiah was about years old at that time to him the expedition was not one of war against the sioux but a chance to again see the west especially the land of the absoraka or crow this to him was a vacation from his long confining duties at the fort at about noon on june and shortly after leaving the crows nest on the divide between the rosebud and the little big horn custer divided his command shortly thereafter custer and the troopers in his battalion rode into historic oblivion for some reason both interpreters dorman and girard were assigned to the reno colunm with orders to charge the indian encampment from the south acting under orders issued previously the interpreters stayed close to their commander to be near at hand if they were needed acting under the same orders were the leading scouts both white and indian the adjutant and the trumpeter they all made up a mounted mobile command post this was fine on the charge up the narrow valley and when major marcus a reno formed his command in a skirmish line across that valley at the time they was in close proximity to the great indian camp but when reno was pressed by the hostiles or thought he was being pressed and ordered a retreat to the timber along the west side of the little horn this closely grouped entourage presented an excellent target for the multiplying hostiles their fire was concentrated here chief white scout charlie reynolds was killed a well placed hostile bullet splattered the brains of custers favorite indian scout bloody knife in major renos face two enlisted men were killed instantly adjutant lieut benny hodgson was wounded a later wound was fatal and isaiah received his mortal wound reno hit the panic button and after shouting several confused commands fled back up the valley with the remnants of his command at his heels this wild flight that was later deemed by major reno as a retreat to a more strategic position resulted in dorman and other wounded being left to the mercies of the hostiles thanks to recognition by sitting bull dorman probably fared better than the others prior to the famous cheyenne warrior wooden leg related to his friend and biographer dr thomas b marquis that he had viewed the body of isaiah dorman at it lay in death wooden leg stated that all of dormans cloth ing had been taken but that his body was otherwise unmolested he had not been scalped or cut up like the others who fell nearby this was on june or in the morning of the day following his death there is no reason to doubt wooden legs story as all of his stories of the battle have been proven fairly accurate it is true that when troopers under the command of generals terry and gibbon came to the relief of major reno one day later the scene had changed at this time it was discovered that dormans body was considerably mutiliated this depredation was probably the parting act of an uninformed squaw or of some cheyenne who was not familiar with dorman no marker has ever been erected over dormans grave he was probably buried at the spot where he fell at the time of his death there was due to dorman for his services rendered to the expedition after a lengthy search it is my opinion that this debt was never paid it would have been indeed ironic if it had been allotted to dormans sioux wife it is also ironic that the only reference to dormans color was made by major reno in his report of the battle reno perhaps out of ignorance when penning his report did omit isaiahs last name the entry is followed by the words o a great many americans white ones in particularit seems that the negro has only of late seen fit to protest his position of inferiority in america he has shed himself of submission and taken to militant protestation however the fact of the whole business is that the negro has always in one way or another protested his unequal treatment in america protest is not something that is a unique product of the present active generation of american negroes it is true however that protest by negroes has never achieved the magnitude of the present effort but it is nevertheless important that the present activity be seen as not unique it is important for at least three reasons the present activity can be better understood in terms of a historical perspective on protest confusion and in some cases resentment of the white community can be at least tempered by its elucidation and the negro himself it seems to me may be better equipped to carry on the fight with the knowledge of its existence the rather general belief that the negro passively accepted his position as slave and later as second class citizen is hardly the case lets for a few minutes take a brief look at protest throughout the history of the negro in america probably the earliest vestiges of protest can be seen in the resistance of the negroes to becoming slaves many rather than become slaves according to john hope franklin in his book from slavery to freedonri took their own lives mothers for example are reported to have killed both themselves and their children others refused to eat and starved rather than become slaves this of course was not the case with most but even after becoming slaves many fought running and harassing battles with the slavemaster bloody battles were fought between the negro slave and the white master insurrections were perceived by whites as a constant threat in the south especially where the slave population was close to or greater than the white population franklin reports many slaves ran away indeed this practice was so widespread that both federal and state legislation was enacted to aid their recovery fleeing says franklin was one of the most successful forms of resistance the slaves devised another form of resistance probably the most dramatic was found in the slave insurrections revolts and conspiracies to revolt began with slavery and persisted until slavery was abolished the last being reported in in henrico county virginia under the leadership of gabriel prosser and jack bowler more than a thousand slaves conspired to revolt they were however exposed by one of their members denmark vesey a slave who purchased his freedom in led probably the most dramatic of all slave conspiracies over a period of several years he prepared for the revolt gathering weapons and men his movement was aborted by an informant and many of his men were killed the estimates of the number of negroes involved ran as high as in south hampton virginia the insurrection of nat turner led to the death of more than white families in less than hours and a pitched battle with state and federal troops in which more than slaves were killed in the operations of the maroons a group of runaway slaves fighting a guerrillatype war with whites terrorized an entire area these groups were a constant source of harassment to the white community and served to lure many slaves to their ranks resistance also took the form of work stoppage and subversion such as destroying crops property and animals the impression of the slave conveyed by such vehicles as the stephen foster musical commentary was far from descriptive of all slaves historians of the negro have carefully documented the slaves resistance to his status of course many negroes fought in the civil war slaves ran away from the plantation to join the union forces more than negroes had enrolled in the union army by the end of the war they saw action in every theatre of operation during the civil war the operation of the underground railroad and the tremendous role of figures such as sojourner truth and harriet tubman are further testimony to the degree to which the negro resisted and protested his station in america so effective was miss tubmans efforts that a reward of pounds was offered for her head in maryland negro protest did not abate substantially with emancipation with the passage of the jim crow laws in the late s the plight of the negro especially in the south became almost intolerable race riots in both the north and the south occurred during this time the voices of men like frederick douglass were constantly raised in opposition to the treatment of the negro the great migration of negroes from the south is likewise indirect testimony to his protest the character of negro protest took on different dimensions in the th century very early it assumed two divergent directions harold w cruse has stated that negro protest since emancipation has been split with one group directed toward integration and the other antiintegration from this point of view one can construe the booker t washington movement as at least initially antiintegrationist it is important to note that the washington movement although at its inception called for separation had as its ultimate goal the inclusion of negroes into the mainstream of american life washington felt that negroes through uplifting themselves could assume a position of such great value in american society that the problem of civil_rights would correct itself hence he advised brains property and character for the negro will settle the question of civil_rights the best course to pursue in regard to a civil_rights bill in the south is to let it alone let it alone and it will settle itself washington was scathingly criticized by that wing of protest ideology which held that the immediate granting of civil_rights was the only way to realize equality this group was led by w e b du bois who claimed the negro could never improve his position gain political and social equality without fullscale civil_rights immediately for years washington and du bois were engaged in controversy one of the most dramatic in american history now the essential character of this debate centered around the manner in which the negro was to ultimately achieve if at all full participation in the mainstream of american life both of the protagonists were protesting the negros position but they disagreed as to the nature of strategies and tactics to be utilized contrary to popular belief the washington movement was in a broad sense a protest movement du bois very early in the s issued a call for negroes to ban together and present their demands for freedom behind a united front in his statement du bois said the time seems more than ripe for organized determined and aggressive action on the parts of men who believe in negro freedom du bois and other prominent negro men met the following summer and formed an organization known as the niagara movement du bois speaking for the movement articulated its aims we claim the right of free men to walk talk and be with them that wish to be with us we want the constitution of the country enforced we want our children educated between and race riots of extreme violence occurred arousing concern in the entire population three people mary w ovington william e walling and henry moskovitz organized a conference on democracy and the negro the conference took place may out of this conference to which booker t washington was not invited grew the national association for the advancement of colored people many of the members of the niagara movement joined the naacp others declined to join because they felt the organization was not bold enough in program the naacp ultimately grew it is commonly known to a position of top leadership in the negro fight for civil_rights it has however of late been seriously challenged on several fronts for its leadership position the parallel development of the national urban league greatly enhanced the negros struggle for economic advancement especially in the urban areas late in the second decade of the s there arose a movement of such great magnitude that it has never been rivaled in size by any other effort since the universal negro improvement association under the leadership of marcus a garvey became the rallying point for millions of negroes garveys plan was to establish in africa a state to which all american negroes could migrate he felt the negro would never achieve equality in white america and should cease trying and direct his efforts toward establishing an autonomous state in his fatherland garvey lauded everything black and preached a gospel of fierce race pride he captured the imagination and support of millions of negroes and everywhere his name was a household word garveys program was opposed by the naacp and a running battle ensued ultimately ending in the naacps petition to the justice department that brought about garveys conviction in a federal court imprisonment and later deportation garveys strident militancy was a legacy inherited by the black muslims who likewise advocate separation of negroes from white america unlike garvey however the muslims lay claim to territory in america the religious superstructure of the muslims is a characteristic somewhat different from the garvey movement there is little doubt that the present activity in the negro community is a result to a large extent of the success of the naacp and similar protest groups the supreme court decision of may reversing the separate but equal doctrine contributed directly to the development of a more militant character of negro protest the story of developments such as tent city the tuskegee gerrymander the little rock school integration birmingham montgomery albany and others are so recent and widely publicized as to need little comment the same is true of organizations such as the student nonviolent coordinating committee the southern christian leadership conference congress on racial equality and others nor is it necessary to elaborate on such people as martin_luther_king ralph abernathy chevine king and others their stories are a part of the experience of most americans i should however say something about a different kind of protest as exemplified by robert f williams in union county north carolina robert f williams for sometime maintained a standing army in this county by army mean a fully armed detachment of men he fought armed skirmishes with the ku klux klan and state officers the last of which forced him to seek sanctuary in havana cuba williams feels that a militant stand and the willingness to fight will hasten final positive results for the negro negro protest has not been relegated solely to an area of action on the part of organized groups one can see it in the writings of many negro novelists richard wrights books especially the long dream the outsider and black boy smack sharply of protest ralph ellisons the invisible man is a classic work of protest in my own evaluation of course these writers do not exhaust the list of protest writers on the current scene james baldwins prolific pen has raised him to prominence in this vein his recent book the fire next time should be read by everyone interested in this problem in another vein poets have long cried out in protest of the condition of the negro one finds the entire panorama of protest illustrated by the writings of negro poets paul lawrence dunbar for example wrote i know how the caged bird feels in his poem sympathy or a crust of bread a corner to sleep in a minute to laugh and an hour to weep in ie langston hughes writes beautiful is the night and beautiful are the stars and beautiful are the eyes of my people james weldon johnsons poem now known as the negro national anthem typified another kind of protest on a more vociferous level claude mckay wrote if we must die let it not be like hogs hunted and penned in some inglorious spot while all around us bark the mad and hungry dogs making a mockery of our accursed lot if we must die let us nobly die and for their thousand blows strike one deathblow in a different light the development of jazz represents an aspect of negro protest more recently the development of funky jazz is a reaction on the part of negro musicians in all the history of the negro throughout his stay in america is replete with instances of his protestations they have as has been indicated been sometimes loud sometimes subtle sometimes strained and sometimes clear at imes gentle and at other times violent at times legal and other times illegal but they have been and continue increasingly to be in existence inasmuch as protest is in existence today i feel that i should address myself to the character of the present activity let me first address myself to the organizations presently working to secure civil_rights specifically the naacp it is my acceptance that for sometime now the naacp especially the chapters in the north has been complacent the rather dramatic successes of the legal arm of the movement it seems has lulled the general membership into an erroneous sense of wellbeing in addition the naacp has tended to become a classrelated organization by this i mean that the victories achieved through its operation have for the most part made very little if any difference in the life of the great mass of negroes at the bottom of the social class ladder their efforts have been most beneficial to the middle and upper class negroes additionally the leadership of the naacp has been drawn from the ranks of the middle classes and their program of reform has articulated the needs and desires of the negro oriented to white middle class values it is it seems to me the lower class negro who bears the brunt of the differential race treatment he is the one who is the victim of police brutality of the ghetto mentality of discrimination prejudice and in many cases a victim of the prejudice of middle class negroes now the great breach between the general negro population and the naacp was no more dramatically displayed than in the rapid spread of the sitin movement these movements occurred without the sanction of the na acp although the naacp legal department later extended its support as a matter of fact the sitin demonstrators in nashville were advised against this kind of activity by the naacp early in the confederate authorities organized a brigade of free negroes called the louisiana native guard colored to supplement the small number of militiamen who were the only force available for the defense of new orleans against an impending attack by a union fleet commanded by captain david g farragut and a union army under major general benjamin f butler nominally the native guard comprised only volunteers actually most of its members were virtually drafted when the confederate troops evacuated new orleans just before the city was occupied by general butlers army of the gulf these reluctant volunteers allowed themselves to be cut off by the union forces to which they quietly and gladly surrendered during the summer of butler became aware that the confederates were hopefully planning a counterattack upon new orleans since he had only about effective troops he rightly feared what might happen particularly if the confederates could secure the help of an ironclad ram capable of clearing the mississippi river of the union navys few gunboats when butler found that he could not hope to obtain any reinforcements from the north he decided as he put it upon africa for assistto call ance with learned former this purpose in view he the names of some officers of the louisiana native guard and invited them to meet him at his headquarters these men were asked if they would be willing to serve in the army of the gulf and if they could induce other negroes to do the same all of them answered yes to both questions fourteen days later on august a regiment of a thousand men was organized within a couple of months two more regiments of infantry and two batteries of artillery had been enrolled according to joseph t wilson a member of the louisiana native guard and author of the black phalanx half a dozen regiments could have been formed in the same time if arms and equipment had been available for them the officers of the original or confederate native guard had been negroes up to and including the rank of captain the field officers of the first regiment organized by general butler were white men the colonel and lieutenant colonel of the second regiment were white the other officers were negroes both negroes and whites were chosen on the basis of ability alone as officers of the third regiment the two batteries had to be officered by white men because at this time no negroes had had any experience as artillerymen at first the existence of butlers native guard regiments was not officially recognized by the federal government but they were in fact the first negro regiments to serve in the union army during the civil war if general butlers orders probably issued with his tongue in his cheek had been strictly followed only free negroes would have been enlisted in the louisiana native guard which was unofficially known as the free colored brigade however nobody inquired too deeply about the background of a promising looking recruit and many selfemancipated slaves joined it butlers example of informally enlisting negro troops was again to cite wilsons the black phalanx followed very soon by every officer in command and by the time the presidents emancipation proclamation was issued there were not less than negroes armed and equipped along the mississippi where in the course of time they often fought against their former masters when robert frost was on his tour of russia after an exhausting visit to a russian school he came back to the reserved section of his hotel dining room catching sight of a table of arabians and a table of chinese he turned around and went back to his room and ate there thats a bad prejudice of mine isnt it he said this incident reported by franklin d reeve in robert frost in russia reveals an aspect of frostwhich is different from the public image of the genial philosophical sage of american poetry frosts letters in the recent books the letters of robert frost to louis untermeyer and selected letters of robert frost also give views of a different facet of his personality some of the letters reveal the frost familiar to the public he talks brilliantly of poetry he shows a delight in words characteristic of a poet the letters are full of puns and plays on words the letters also disclose what is not so well known to the public and round out and humanize the picture of the man there was tragedy in his family life he was often melancholy and without confidence in his poetry he was suspicious jealous of his fame and shrewd in furthering his poetic career one of his plays on words was on the name of the negro poet and critic william stanley braithwaite he wrote im not very angry with you for what you did to breathweight only i wonder if hes worth your pains perhaps he is we were taught that we must try not to look down on anyone the man whom he called breathweight was influential in the renaissance of american poetry in the early decades of the s as poetry critic of the boston transcript he helped to bring the new poetry to the attention of the public by weekly articles by fullscale book reviews and by an annual summing up of the years work in the field with his anthology of magazine verse for he was the first to publish a yearly anthology of verse in the united states the series continued until with a final volume for containing the best poems of that year and a selection of the best poems in the seventeen previous volumes this series helped the reputations of poets and increased the reading of poetry many poets and poems that later became famous were chosen and poets were proud and excited to be included braithwaite also suggested to publishers the idea of yearly anthologies of short stories and of plays two series which are still in existence today claude mckay quotes a negro historian on braithwaite the most remarkable writer of negro blood since dunbar is william stanley braithwaite who as a writer is not a negro mr braithwaite has by his literary production and criticism his poems his annual publication the anthology of magazine verse demonstrated that the negro intellect is capable of the same achievements as that of the whites when claude mckay was coming into notice he sent some poems to braithwaite who wrote to him that his poems were good but that except for two of them any reader could tell that the author was a negro he advised mckay because of the overwhelming prejudice against anything negro to write and send to the magazine only such poems as did not reveal his race mckay did not take braithwaites advice his own expression was too subjective and personal for him to write without conviction and anyone who read him could tell that he came from a tropical country and was black in her memoirs golden friends i had poet margaret widdemer tells of a party given in honor of braithwaite notable poets and literary persons were there but no negroes she says that she felt too much effusion in the praises given him a sense of strain because of his color it was in the period of braithwaites achievement and influence that frost first met him he called on the critic in boston in his correspondence he shrewdly fed braithwaite facts about himself which could be used in an article later he invited braithwaite to visit him would you come up about now dont you think we could kill a week walking and talking in braithwaite selected some of frosts poems for his anthology frost wrote i shall be honored if you will use the poems in your book honored enough if you will use two honored beyond dreams if you will use three braithwaite used birches and the road not taken frost wrote about the book i havent read braithwaites g d booki got one of the children to read it for me and tell me about it all that saved the fat obstacle from the worst fate that overtakes paper was your name and mine on the flyleaf in a letter written as if coming from someone else to himself frost said love is a kickshaw and dalliance naught but give you a field like poetry that calls to the pulling of wires and the manipulation of ropes to the climbing of every black reviewers back stairs for preferment and you frost are there with a suitcase in both hands thus in spite of braithwaites fostering of american poetry his promotion of frost and his determination to avoid anything that smacks of negro he is referred to as polluting the letter so that frost breaks off and starts over on a fresh sheet young negro writers who are pondering the question of identity can learn from braithwaites experience hie hated the tourists h and times like now out hoeing the corn that would have to see him and suellen and the kids through the winter sourness would rise up in his stomach at sight of the big outof state cars slowing down so that the smooth faces with bright and eager eyes could seecould look their fill arel english walking in the dust scrabbling in a rocky field a man with shuffling step with dull eyes knowing these things to be so knowing them to be eternally so arel english forever doomed to scrabble in a rocky field hoeing corn plodding along in the dust yet must somehow find a standard of comparison so he too in his own mind could feel superior and it was times like now with the big cars whizzing down the dirt road that he was apt to lay down his hoe seized with the sudden notion to go down to little jims cabin and sit a spell the same cabin where he had sat for as many years as he could remember back and where his pappy had set for as many years before though the cabin did not then belong to little jim but to his pappy big jim best friend ive got his own pappy used to say sitting on the wide board porch in the est rocker brought out from tk dark interior of the cabin for the occasion best friend ive got aint that right big jim and big jim sitting solid on the top step would wipe at his black face with a bandana reckon as how thats so mr english reckon as how thats so those were the good days with the dust soft underfoot and the skin of his own hands so pale against that of little jims as they tussled like puppies in the field those were the days with little jims mammy stepping out onto the porch now and again to call out mind yourself now little jim and dont get rough then would come the glasses of lemonade and the cake or the cookies or even the pieces of fried chicken with himself and his pappy eating on the porch without ever crossing the sill because even a puppysize boy knew better than that knew it without asking with a bom understanding that it was one thing to sit on a niggers porch and another to step into his house like the way you didnt wonder why big jim and little jim and his mammy sat back while you were eating and drinking waiting until you were walking the dusty road back home before they took their fill of course now a man grown walking that same hot road to that same cabin painted now with curtains at the window and a plot of grass where once was a broomswept yard but still for all of that a niggers shack now you understood what you once simply knew you understood that the lord had made things to be as they were he had made those that were to ride in the big cars and those that were to walk in the dust and he had made those that were to sit back while a white man ate and drank as he walked the stones of the road burned through the soles of his shoes and the folds of his shirt clung wetly to his back a shirt wet thus dried and wet again so that now the smell of old sweat was strong and rank arel english walking in the sun a man with burning jeet and sweaty shirt a man with rock hard years behind and rock hard years ahead a man who would never have enough of clean shirts or ride in a big sleek car walking thus he suddenly threw back his shoulders and quickened his heavy step ahead around the next bend was the familiar end of his journey that cabin painted now but for afl of that a niggers cabin just nothing but a black niggers cabin and all the paint in the world couldnt do nothing to change that by god within sight of the cabin he slowed his pace walking leisurely chewing a stalk of grass stripped from a clump alongside the road he could see little jims kids most grown now like his own playing baseball in the stubble field alongside the shack and he thought of the bright summers when he and little jim played thus and of the day when little jims mammy called out sharply little jim it aint fitting you should call a young white gentleman arel remember now and dont you forget its mr english i want to be hearing you say he did of course forget that is but not often and soon it was like it had always been little jim and mr english he wondered if that time had come for his own and little jims young ones but he likely wouldnt know unless by chance because while he had loved more than anything on earth to tag his own daddy to the cabin of big jim his own boys could not be driven to come along with him why would we want to do a crazy thing like going down to that niggers shack with you and because he couldnt rightly say never having wanted to ask such a question of his pappy he let it pass quelling the vague unease that this abandonment of the old ways brought about by telling himself that there was no figuring a young one and no need to try he walked now down the narrow lane to the cabin and up onto the smooth worn boards of the porch little jim he shouted im here from inside the cabin the quick light steps of little jims wife and the door flung wide he isnt here jims gone he pulled up the wicker porch rocker and lowered his bones into its familiar curves ill just sit and wait a spell ella mae he cant stay away forever without he has a bite to eat and its getting on now to that time of day ella mae looked at him she looked him right in the eye i dont know when jim will be back maybe not all night or all the next day or even the day after that bees droned above the climbing rose trellised between the supporting posts of the porch it was the same summer sound that hed heard for as many years as he could remember back but today puzzling on the never before boldness of that eyetoeye look the lazy summer hum in the roses took on a different sound a lonely sound like the loneliness of thinking about things that had once been but could never be again things like the way watermelon tasted when you were a kid things like the cool scrunch of grass between your toes when you would tumble out of bed and step into a sunshine world that was all your own standing there then listening to the old familiar sounds he pushed back the lonesomeness with the hard common sense he always took pride upon he pulled himself up out of the chair and spoke kindly to ella mae well ellamae i reckon youll be wearing out the bend in the road watching for little jim to be coming round it which brings to mind you didnt say where it was that little jims gone to she tossed her shining black head i didnt say but i dont at all mind doing so jim is taking part in a sitin over at trentonville this time there was no fancying no mistaking plain nigger uppitiness he wanted to smash to pound to grind the grinning face into the boards of the porch it was only the immense sadness that such a thing as this could ever come to pass that kept him standing there bound yet to the past by a chain he could not break the door slammed shut and he was alone arel english a man with burning feet and sweaty shirt in his ears the lonely drone of bees only sound now left o f summers past slowly he turned slowly he walked back down the lane back down the road stepping to one side as the big out of state cars slowed up to look with bright and eager eyes then speeded on their way once more like an animal he walked head low suffering dumbly nowhere in his mind the words to explain this thing that had come about hed heard talk of course down at the store or when hed meet up with one of the neighbors down the road and on the radio too times the battery had a new charging but such talk belonged to places far away such a thing as piney creek niggers in a sitin was so far beyond the reach of common sense that he hadnt paid it no real mind at all now and as soon as this was clear in his mind he walked with lifted head and quickened step now it was once more like in the days of his greatgrandpappy when a man must fight for the ways that was rightly his he crossed the stoop of his house and walked into the kitchen suellen was there and a couple of the girls whining words at him as he passed but he paid them no more mind than he did the flies that buzzed round his head in the thick and sticky heat he crossed to the far end of the room where by the fireplace hung his squirrel rifle oiled polished deadly it fit into his arm as neatly was as much a part of him as the muscles that covered his bones walking back through the kitchen and onto the narrow path leading to the big road he gave brief thought to the fact that never had he managed to own a whole runnable car a motor with no axles to fit a body with some vital inward worn past repair but never a car that could carry a man to where little jim was at a sitin over to trentonville but the lord gave man feet to walk upon and unfalteringly he turned his in the way that they must travel the walk to trentonville was long and though his mind was working now as clean and neat as the trigger on his gun he was standing at last on the crowded corner by the trentonville courthouse at a loss as to where to turn not knowing behind which of the brick and concrete walls little jim might be concealed then from among the strollers on the far side of the street the couples young and old walking slowly looking into the lighted windows of the closed down stores from among these men and these women he picked out the neat blue uniform of a city police a police who should know where this sitin was a police who by god instead of mincing along the walk like a dandy at a wedding should with drawn gun be seeking out the enemy preserving the order that the lord meant to be on an earth where he put the birds and the beasts and the blacks and the whites and those meant to ride and those meant to swallow the dust of those behind the wheel a policeman prancing in glittering shoes and sharp pressed pants while niggers turned the world topsideto and black wenches slammed doors in the faces of their betters a fool this police but surely with the sense to turn a man in the direction he must go he crossed the street he opened his mouth to speak the opening coming ahead of the choosing of just the right words so that he was standing there so still silent when the city police spoke to him reaching out at the same time to touch the coldly shining barrel of the gun dont you hillbillies know better than to go parading the streets with a rifle in your hands arel english white male who by god put on his pants one leg at a time the same as any other man standing now on this corner knowing that for all of these things he is still as the lord made him to be a walker in the dust a man who will now shuffle his feet look down at the concrete and whine i dont aim to cause no trouble a cunning man a man who knows it was the lords own hand that stayed him from blurting out the true purpose of his mission and caused him to say instead i dont aim to cause no trouble i just brung this old rifle in town to get the barrel blued and im right now on my way back to where i live up piney creek see that you get moving we dont want no disturbance around here from the likes of you arel english a man to speak meekly no sir a fawning grin you wont have no disturbances from me he was pleased it wasnt the first time a man had to bow down before he could stand up straight and hed handled it well that he had hed find this sitin then theyd see who was the likes of who black niggers needing to be put in their rightful place and cowards in law suits who made light of honest whites but as the hours and the miles passed by the pavement became hard beneath his feet an unfamiliar hardness trying to a man accustomed to the familiar rocks and dust of his own dirt roads and the brilliant windows with nowhere a spot of restful dark and the people the staring people in cars walking standing just standing staring tourists all and in all the world nowhere a soft chair nowhere a soft voice to say everything is fine mr english just as fine as it can be he walked until there came a time when the lighted windows were farther between less brilliant illuminated by single fly specked bulbs and these people whom he now saw standing and walking were not tourists these were kinfolk walkers in the dust though their feet might never know other than the harshness of a concrete walk and now for the first time he felt close to that for which he searched behind one of these paintscarred doors up one of these unlighted alleys was where he would find them dark figures plotting destroyers of order here was where he would find them here was where he would find little jim and for the first time that day his heart swung high his grip on the rifle tightened and he thought once more of the lilylivered cop who had touched the barrel of that same gun in scorn a cop too craven to do his duty so that a man hillborn must pick up his own weapon to see that justice be done he might too expect some trouble from such a meeching city cop as this but it wouldnt amount to much couldnt amount to much because no matter how you sliced it they was still niggers just niggers why he could remember his own pappy sitting on the back stoop smoking his pipe and talking take jess harkins he was a real outlaw six men he gunned down in his life not counting niggers of course not that he himself exactly held with that little jim used to be as good and as honest a nigger as ever drew breath and he used to like little jim he surely did and the thought of having to gun him down with no more count made of him than if he was a dog didnt seem right somehow but a man did what he must and in those days of which his pappy spoke a man knew too where he stood and he stood there by god with no damned foolishness about equal rights in a world the lord had plainly set up to be as it was on he walked and now he came to a place where there were no lighted windows at all vast buildings warehouses and factories and machine shops stood darkly silent and his footsteps alone echoed into the night somewhere he had missed somewhere behind was that for which he sought doggedly he turned and turning saw beneath the light reflected from a comer post a nigger black as the ace of spades a big buck carrying in one hand a flashlight and wearing a uniform and pinned to the pocket of his shirt by god reflecting the glow of the street light a badge not a star like a sheriff or a city police wore but a badge no mistaking that arel english male white taxpayer and great greatgrandson of a piney creek taxpayer standing now at close to midnight on a lonely city street seeing what hed always known was just tall tales and not really so at all seeing now with his own eyes a nigger with authority pinned to his shirt this then was it calmly he raised his gun and his voice was sharp as the crack of a bullet you boy come here he came moving easily speaking softly are you crazy put down that gun oh his little tin badge had gone to his head all right arel english looked close read the word security guard and he a man grown wanted to weep that such a thing as this could come to pass he liked niggers wasnt little jim the best friend he could have had as black as the pit of night and if it would do any good at all hed say now just put aside that badge boy and those uppity airs youve taken to wearing with it this was what he wanted to say and the surety that it would be no use brought hot tears to his eyes so that as his finger tightened on the trigger he could only fire blindly at an enemy nameless faceless and without form arel english standing now alone a chill in the marrow of his bones standing with useless rifle knowing now knowing at last that it would do no real good were he to fire thus ten times ten straight into the heart of little jim arel english walker in the dust standing alone in a quiet street listening for a soft black voice listening to hear the words everything is fine mr english just as fine as it can be i has long been my contention that if white america knew the true facts about the negro and his place in american history as contrasted with the diabolical myths of the stereotype negro and his happiness as a slave under kindhearted masters for whom he gladly labored and sweated from sunup to sundown in the cotton fields of the southland and sang jubilee and folk songs into the late hours of the nightsuch as white america and negroes too are taught in american text books if america learned from their school books of the negros remarkable contributions to american freedom and progress from accurately recorded history books in american schools the american conscience would be stirred and awakened by this powerful moral imperative the security of america rests upon our actual knowledge of the past events that have occurred in our land and the enlightened use of this knowledge in constructive thinking about our plans to create a better life for all americans in the future this becomes all important today in connection with the implementation of the wide benefits to be derived from the new antipoverty program recently enacted into law the rejection in teaching such myths and caricatures mentioned above is supported by the best of current historical scholarship the degrading of a whole race of people the negro by such derogatory references is attributed to the deference of textbook publishers to the special sensitiveness of the southern market what a pity that a whole race of people americas largest minority of souls must suffer this disgrace to appease the benighted vanity of the most backward section of america the total national strength of america is directly related to the maximum of unity of all classes and races in america whatever their color religion ethnic origin or nationality background it is therefore clear that to degrade one group at the expense of all others is damaging to the general welfare of all america to solve this problem is to promote the general welfare of americaand each group cultural democracy is an important inescapable corollary of political and social democracy and it involves an open door and the full acceptance of minority contributions and for the full recognition of the minority contributors one of the most important projects which the negro must support perhaps second only to the long and bitter battle for civil_rights which now appears as far as the written law is concerned as a fait accompli is to correct the mind of the average american child and adult about the place of the negro in american history and his contributions to our history as a nation and at the same time to destroy once and for all the myths and stereotypes that haunt the life of the american negro many of these myths and stereotypes were in the most part figments of the white mans imagination created by propaganda and maintained as a balm for a guiltladen white psyche dr elias blake jr of howard university has written with great clarity on this subjectsee journal of negro historyapril on the subject of the negros singing and dancing and his socalled irresponsibility dr blake says negroes did sing a lot but song was a physical life saver and a codified weapon against a deadly power structure they did dance but as a diluted expression of a former african cultural heritage which was brutally destroyed in all its major aspects there was irresponsibility but as a clever device to escape back breaking labor one of americas greatest historians and the leading authority on the history of the american negro was dr carter g woodson who after authoring singlyand in collaboration with other distinguished scholarsmore than scientific works on the negro died in washington d c on april born of former slave parents in in new canton virginia he suffered all the hardships and privations of one of several children in a tenant farmers family he left virginia at the age of and went to work in the mines of west virginia after obtaining the degree of litt b at berea college in kentucky in he taught school in west virginia in the philippines the high schools of the district of columbia and later became dean of the school of liberal arts at howard university his search for more knowledge led him to the university of chicago where he was awarded the degree of ba in and ma in he then studied at the sorbonne in paris his superb work in research on the history of the negro in america was accomplished during his two years of study at the doctoral level at harvard university where he was awarded the phd degree in following years of foreign travel and further research he became convinced that among the scholars of the world and more sadly among negro scholars and students of history the role of his own people in american history and in the history of other nations cultures was being either ignored or deliberately misrepresented he therefore delved deeper and deeper into the neglected past of the american negro he founded with others the now famous and world recognized association for the study of negro life and history asnlh in september with headquarters in washington d c it is one of the great honors and pleasures of my life that dr woodson whom i knew from my childhood and deeply respected urged me during my student days at harvard when he visited frequently as guest lecturer and summer visiting professor to establish a philadelphia chapter of this association this i did in and became its first president this chapter under the present leadership of miss edythe h ingraham a supervisor in the philadelphia school system is one of the leading branches of asnlh in america at present as a member of the national executive council of the association it is my task with a board of distinguished historians and educators to see to the furtherance of the great historical objectives of its late highly respected founder the president of the executive council is dr charles h wesley noted educator and president of central state college in wilberforce ohio the secretarytreasurer and editor of the informative an widely read popular monthly negro history bulletin is dr charles walker thomas a noted scholar and professor of history at howard university washington d c the editor of the scholarly quarterly journal of negro history founded in january is dr william m brewer an eminent scholar in the field of american history and the history of the negro in the cultures of many nations of the world the journal has never missed a publication date an impressive volume handsomely printed and bound and acknowledged to be the first and last resort of scholars throughout the world for accurate historical data on the american negro and his influence in the social political and economic history of america slavery as we all know had its beginnings in america when a dutch trader landed his vessel with twenty native africans in jamestown virginia in these humans the robust survivors of a much larger number who left the shores of africa two months earlier were sold as slaves to the virginia planters stories of their huge size their strength their friendly nature and quick acclimation to their new surroundings are now well known neither time nor space will permit a full discussion of the growth of this blot on the morals and conscience of the civilizations of europefrom which continent trading vessels were sent by the dutch the spaniards the french english and portuguese to the east and west coasts of africa in the commercial exploitation of human lives they invaded peaceful native villages and captured by force and violenceand if that failed by corrupting their own tribal chiefsdefenseless men and women these frightened people were torn from their children and loved ones and driven off in chains to slave vessels within these vessels many hardly seaworthy this human cargo was crowded into pens like animals to make the hazardous six to eight weeks voyage across the atlantic to a completely strange and unknown land it hardly need be said that records show that rarely more than half the human cargo survived this dreadful passage the earliest and perhaps the most renowned negro scholar of all time who scientifically and painstakingly studied and recorded this subject was the late great philosopher essayist historian and critic dr w e burghart dubois who died in at the age of in his monumental and scholarly book suppression of the slave trade edited by him when he was rogers memorial fellow at harvard university from which institution he earned his phd degree in dr dubois with painstaking analysis supported by records from the house of commons house of lords archives of various state governments in america as well as studies of treaties between various foreign governments relating to the slave trade says while the exact proportion of the slave trade to america can be but approximately determined records show that from to ships left africa with a cargo of negro slaves and after losing on the passage were delivered to america and that slaves were brought to america each year from to later this figure rose to per year the census of showed slaves in the united states dr dubois in this well documented book gives the accurate slave population in each of the states in colonial america including the new england states unfortunately little is known of the descendants of these unwilling migrants to our shores by the school population of america and as it follows by their parents certainly the american school books tell us virtually nothing except that the leading negroes who have risen to a place of prominence in america are booker t washington frederick douglass sojourner truth the great oratorabolitionist and marian anderson only recently have they added the name of dr ralph j bunche american history books never tell of the negro soldiers and negro sailors who fought in the civil war it goes without saying that these books geared to the sensitiveness of the south never mentioned the heroic deeds of the trusted slaves who defying death harbored the women folk and children of their masters who were at war and saved many families from death and the tortures of war nor says dr woodson in his volume negro makers of history no american school book tells its students that negro soldiers and four negro sailors won the congressional medal of honor for bravery and valor during the civil war nor do they tell us of the free negroes in the united states at the time of the signing of the emancipation proclamation on january more than half of whom were in the south and thousands of whom were successful businessmen in both the north and south nor do they tell us of the prominent role of the negro runaway slave crispus attucks in americas first birth of freedom this exslave then living in boston was the first american to defy and the first to die in the revolutionary war he repelled the british infantry on the boston commons in the famous boston massacre on march it was the shot from attucks rifle that sparked the flames of the revolutionary war which ended successfully six years later in victory for the rebellious states and their union into the great nation that is ours today there were at that time one million negroes nor does history tell of the former slaves who fought under general george washington during the revolutionary war nor does history tell of the negroes who rushed to the union army immediately after lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation and who saw active service many of these men were killed and wounded and in addition to these fighting soldiers another negroes served as military laborers and served with the naval units of the north few if any of the history books tell the american students that in the postbellum or reconstruction period twentytwo negroes served in the congress of the united states and two of this number served as united states senators from the point of view of current history this is interesting to note because these two negro senators were from mississippi they were senators hiram r revels and blanche k bruce who contrary to the writings of southern historians were well educated cultured and highly respected gentlemen who left scholarly records in this great legislative body of equal current interest is the fact that three congressmen were from alabama benjamin p turner james t rapier and jeremiah huralston all of whom served in the rd and th congress in addition every state of the solid south saw negroes in both houses of their legislatures and in many of the cabinets of the state government during this period the highest state office to which a negro was elected was that of lieutenant governor of louisiana this honor went to the honorable p b s pinchback who for a time served as acting governor of that deep south now hardcore segregationist state on the whole these men all of whose biographies and pictures appear in dr woodsons negromakers of history were easily the equals of their white associates in congress and the state house many of these officials exceeded in training culture and talent that of the vardamans and the cole bleeses of those daysand would rate head and shoulders above the talmadges of georgia and the eastlands of mississippi of today as a single illustration senator hiram r revels of mississippi a native of north carolina the first of his race to serve in the senate was born a free negro he went to illinois and graduated from the famous knox college in that state he taught high school in indiana illinois missouri and kentucky he later studied for the ministry and began his church career in baltimore maryland when the civil war broke out he organized two maryland regiments and himself volunteered in the union army as a chaplain after the war he went to mississippi to establish churches and made his home in natchez he entered politics and was elected alderman in later he entered the race for the united states senate and was elected senator from mississippi in it was paradoxical and providential that the man whose seat this respected brilliant negro took was none other than the former presi dent of the confederacy jefferson davis the first appearance of this tall handsome negro in the senate chamber for confirmation was a moment of great drama and excitement it took two full days of heated debate on the floor of the senate before the senators agreed to seat this new member finally they gave in and seated the gentleman from mississippi by a to vote erroneous myths passionate and vicious dogma and hate have unfortunately taken the place of historical fact and calm analysis hopefully we feel that the struggle of the negro to overcome the nations moral lag is now reaching the twothirds of the american population whom we like to think have not cared simply because they have not known i too like martin_luther_king have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed and that the moral scurvy that has nauseated the intellectually courageous white americans for all these long years will be a thing unknown in the not too distant future carter woodson had an awareness of the need of the negro to know himself and of the selfsufficient sophisticated white man to know his america better he was exceptional perhaps unprecedented he made negro history irresistibly attractive indeed classically respectable his dissent from the orthodox teaching of the history of the became woodson the herobecontribution of various racial and cause his dissent from orthodoxy ethnic groups in america was will become the majority opinion heresy but woodson the heretic of historians tomorrow in those long ago days lagos was an insignificant trading post and the center of power trade and commerce in this part of africa was benin city the flourishing trade of benin affected every town village and hamlet for hundreds of miles around it and was in part responsible for the crisis of kabbo the crisis began on the fifth night of the war with umia village the war was not going well and the services of every man of kabbo were required all the men were at the war camp except segun this was a criminal act of treasonable proportionsparticularly since segun had ignored two messages ordering him to report to the camp hence on this night the horrifying third warning appeared this was a detatchment of men from the camp who surrounded the evaders house torches in hand ready to burn his house to the ground only once before in the history of kabbo had the third warning been necessary that was in the war with eyo village when osagie did not show for the fight but when faced with the flaming torches he fell on his kness bathed his face in the dirt and begged for forgiveness and a chance to fight after joining the camp he fought more bravely than any other warrior and returned to kabbo with three human heads to his credit the six men at seguns house held their torches menacingly ready as their captain issued the final order segun son of bata he shouted loudly authoritatively and ceremoniously kabbo is at war join us at the camp having said this he awaited seguns response the men relaxed on the torches somewhat expecting segun to prostrate himself before the captain as osagie had done thereby relieving them of the responsibility of using the torches but instead segun stood statuesquely in front of his house fearless before his tormentors and gave the response that created the crisis this war is unjust i will not join when the captain recovered his composure he gave the predictable order burn his house down the five men with torches approached the house slowly and hesitantly at first shocked by their part in what was obviously a new script in the making and then they burned the house down the dry thatched hut made a high flaming inferno and when the blazes reached their peak the captain and his men returned to the war camp segun stood and watched his house burn the light of the fire silhouetting his tall frame and broad shoulders he gave the physical appearance of the man who gets things done yet he made no effort to save a single belonging he just watched remorseless and determined to persist in this overpowering conviction and as he watched the final flames die out he knew that this was not the end of the ordeal but rather the beginning the war lasted another week after some fierce fighting the villagers of umia were subdued and the warriors of kabbo were victorious once more as some of the war captains had expected the booty gained in the victory was richly rewarding the goods cattle and slaves were divided among the victorious warriors as was their custom and all of kabbo then turned its attention to the nasty affair of the segun case in kabbo trials of cases and disputes could be heard and decided anywhere from the lowest bush shed to the kings court the highest court excepting the kings was called the council of ogodis this court was convened only in cases of high treason and when the death penalty was expected so as to spare the king of such gruesome decisions the court was composed of five ogodis keepers of the kings conscience each dressed in an ankle length white robe with his identity hidden behind the large carved wooden mask covered with long dry grass skirts under the chin the net effect was to give the appearance of a ghost with a black wooden head and footlong beard the five of them carried beaded walking sticks that set up a nerveracking jingle as they moved about the court of ogodi was always held in an open clearing in front of the shrine of agboho a roomsize hillside cave the shrine of agboho was the repository of all wisdom and only the ogodis ever entered it was said that if any other person entered he was beheaded by the spirit of agboho and his or her body was buried in the cave with this went the secret of agboho which was the true identities of the five villagers who adorned the masks and became ogodis woe unto anyone who ever referred to an ogodi in court by his true name for this was taken as proof of their having entered the shrine which was the only source of such knowledgesuch offenders suffered the same fate of one who had physically entered on the day of seguns trial villagers gathered at the site hours before the court would convene the place was as noisy as the market with everyone arguing the merits of the casesome defending segun others damning him then at the deafening sound of the cymbals from out of the shrine signifying the ogodis were about to come out the crowd hushed and the silence was as pervading as the sound at this signal the oldest man in the village who acted as an overseer to the court rose to announce the opening of the court be civil be quiet be dumb he shouted repeating the traditional court convening speech for his sixtyfifth time let the cougher conceal his cough let mothers quieten their babies let everybody close his mouth the cord that binds humanity is broken the cord which ties friendships is cut the cord of family and relations is broken the big men now will tie up the broken cords and if anyone disturbs them in this work of reorganizing such disturber will be seriously dealt with the moment he finished the loud cymbals from the shrine clanged again and then from the mouth of the cave came the ogodis at the first sight of them every man women and child in the audience dropped to his or her knees touched the ground with the forehead and remained in that position until the last ogodi walking stick ceased to jingle signaling that the ogodis had taken their seats on the five stools placed immediately in front of the shrine to the left side of the ogodis sat two men the kiri chief of war staff who would act as prosecutor and the captain he dispatched to summon segun to the war camp to the right of the tribunal sat segun the defendent and bisi his lifelong friend and now his defender the leading ogodi opened the session as in tradition by pounding his cane against the ground pointing his finger at the kiri and shouting who are you at this cue the sitting kiri bowed low till his face rubbed the ground and answered i am the dirt at your feet fatheri am the shell of your lowliest kola nut it was the tradition that one pleading a case before the court should present himself in the humblest of terms hopefully gaining favor of the court through such flattery after all the humble remarks were finished he identified himself as the kiri of kabbo and speaker of the people in this dreadful case the leading ogodis next standard question was do you know me as if this established the impartiality of the court you are beyond knowledge father the kiri explained i can not know you with the prosecution formally introduced the leading ogodi now turned to segun and bisi stamped his cane and shouted who are you segun respectifully touched the ground with his forehead and answered i am segun son of bata this was the first time in the history of the court that a defendant did not humble himself before the ogodis chills of horror swept through the audience some of whom expected the leading ogodi to behead such a brash offender immediately without benefit of a trial after some hesitation the leading ogodi asked do you know me then in the same cool and dignified manner segun answered i do not know you the leading ogodi turned again to the kiri and his captain and asked what is the complaint against this man father the kiri began his case i am the kiri of kabbo this man next to me is my captain and that man he pointed at segun is an ablebodied man of kabbo it is the honor and glory of every man of kabbo to fight in defense of hearth and home and the country that gave him birth in the recent hostilities against the wild beasts of umia who slaughtered a son of kabbo without provocation this man endangered the success of our mission by refusing to fight of this i accuse the leading ogodi then turned to segun and bisi and asked who will defend this man father bisi began his defense i have fought in two wars with this man seguni know he is no coward and if he refused battle it was because of serious mental reservations and these reservations ought to be considered it is true that he refused to fight in the campaign against umia so let us hear his case with this introduction bisi proceeded to review the case from seguns point of view some zealous war captains of kabbo came to know about the strangers in benin called whitemen who were paying fabulous prices for common slaves these hawks of their day contrived a crisis with the village of umia over the justified killing of a kabbo village bum for the sole reason of enslaving its population and making themselves a large profit from the sales after presenting their case bisi reminded the court that kabbo had always honored men of integrity and that the implications of this case went far and beyond the fate of one man at this point and for the remainder of the trial each ogodi would take turns in questioning the complainant and the defendant until they were satisfied that they had all the facts then they would retire to the shrine to make their decision only the leading ogodi would again appear to announce the verdict the first ogodi inquirer asked the kiri was this a just war father the kiri began his reply kabbo has never gone to war without the sanction of the oracle the oracle of kabbo was consulted and gave its blessings no war blessed by the oracle can be unjust then you the same ogodi said to segun why did you say this war was unjust father segun began we have farmed the land next to the village of umia for ten years without conflict the umia farmer who slew this son of kabbo said the kabbo man ventured without authorization onto his property raped his junior wife and took some of his prized yams he said he slew the man on umia land but that the kabbo war captains who reported the incident dragged the body over the boundary to kabbo land in order to distort the truth of what happened this umia man said that he showed the trail of tracks and blood to a kabbo farmer but at the hearings on this incident the kabbo farmer was forbidden to testify though offered an opportunity to rebut the kiri would not reply to seguns statement so the next ogodi began his questioning you he shouted at segun why do you think the war captains would want to wage an unjustified war with umia father we all know that umia is weaka defenseless prey we also know about the whitemen in benin who are paying high prices for slaves since they have come to this land wars amongst tribes and villages have increased fourfold it was previously our custom to take from the defeated village only sufficient slaves to fill our own labor shortagesbut now we take the largest number of slaves possible for sale to the whitemen of benin this is why the war captains devised this war with umia we have always sold slaves to other tribes the ogodi commented so why is it so bad to sell slaves to the whitemen when we have sold slaves to other tribes in this region we have known what the fate of those slaves would be segun answered we knew for example that any slave who is brutally treated by any master may appeal to the masters king and if his allegations are proved he may be set free we also knew that the children of a slave mother are born free and will share in the inheritance of that household equally with the masters children but when we sell slaves to these whitemen of benin all we know is that they are loaded on huge ships that are swallowed by the sea we know no more you have stated before this day that dealing with this whiteman would lead to kabbos destruction the third ogodi said to segun how can this be so father this whiteman will never be satisfied until he has brought us all under his controlperhaps by buying us few by few one from another he will make us his serfs he will boss our land he will take our crops at this point there was hooting and sarcasm throughout the audience this man must be mad some said a few white men defeat the mighty kabbo another asked we are men we are strong we are powerful the ogodi told segun so how will a few whitemen do this to us father we are men and we are strong segun explained but their weapons are more powerful than ours surely you have heard what they did to the village of alero when it refused to pay their taxes the time is short before they will advance to menace kabbo ha ah this is nonsense the ogodi shouted back at segun many in the audience joined him in a vitrolic slandering of the defendants name when the leading ogodi finally restored order to the court he motioned the other ogodis to follow him back to the shrine as they began to leave their stools it became apparent to segun that i what they were about to deliberate on was not the merits of his case but the question of his sanity i am not sick segun shouted as the last ogodi disappeared i am not sicki am trying to warn you then when he looked around at the audience almost all of them were pointing to their foreheads with their right index fingers the gesture meaning that he was insane ogodi deliberations frequently lasted all night and many spectators would stay until the early morning hours to hear the life or death decision but this decision took only a few minutes they decided that segun was insane tradition forbade them to take the life of an insane man for this would bring a terrible curse to the village so they decided that instead they would sell segun into slavery so it fell on segun to suffer the horrible fate he had risked his life to condemn before day the following morning segun was bound and gagged for the forced march to benin he along with the slaves from umia had his arms closely drawn together behind his back by means of a cord tied tightly around just between his shoulder and elbows the gag consisted of a wooden bit forced into his mouth and tied around the back of his neck a chain supplied to the warriors by the whitemen in benin connected the knots in the gag to the arm cord and chain tied him to the slaves in front and behind him in this manner the long line of slaves would make the journey to benin bisi seguns unsuccessful defender and lifelong friend stayed with him right up until the bit was shoved into his mouth the last thing segun said was i am not afraid i am not bitter though i know i will never see this land again i still have the feeling of coming back bisis last words were you will come back for i met a warrior who has taken many slaves to benin and he has seen white men who left with slaves come back to benin you will come back too segun i know you will come back two hundred years later the village of kabbo was still pretty much the same as it had always been there were lots of explanations given for kabbos stagnation some said it was because none of the britishbuilt roads came to kabboothers said the village was permanently cursed but for whatever the reason everybody in modern kabbo was convinced that now kabbos stagnation would end and they would soon be catching up with lagos and accra this was because the peace corps was coming to kabbo the peace corp they were told would not only teach their children but they would also lead the village in a general uplifting community development scheme there would be new roads more sanitation better housing and more effective farming methods this was the reason why the whole village turned out for the saturday morning feast to commemorate the arrival of the very first peace corps volunteer the first volunteer was to be james thomas thomas was born in alabama and was tall with broad shoulders and gave the physical appearance of the man who gets things done at the first sign of the jeep grinding up the little muddy bush path from the main highway the children ran to the picnic grounds shouting he is here the american is here with this notice all of the villagers including its first citizen the yearoldmr okeke called old man okeke behind his back adjusted their robes so as to look their best they were ready and beaming when the jeep pulled up amongst them and thomas got out after a slightly embarrassing moment of surprise and silence old man okeke reached to shake thomas hand with one hand and placed his other hand over the blabbering mouth of the child that stood next to him the child was saying ah the american is black after the handshake old man okeke made a toolong welcome address then offered thomas the heart of the roasted lamb thomas had been told that the honored guest always got the heart of the cooked animal and was expected to eat it with vigor to show his appreciation thomas munched heartily on the lamb heart wishing he could have had old man okekes leg of lamb instead and thinking through the speech he was expected to make at the end of the meat course of the feast when it came his turn to speak thomas said mr okeke citizens of kabbo i am delighted to be joining your village and i am confident and hopeful that our association will be mutually rewarding instead of indulging in a lot of tmproudtobehere platitudes thomas continued i think id prefer to tell you why i joined the american peace corps and why i came to africa first i joined the american peace corps because i have an overriding concern for the fate of my fellowman as thomas went on to spell out his concern for the fate of others old man okete who stood next to him became visibly nervous he kept fidgeting and looking at the ground never into the face of the guest i came to africa thomas went on because i have a special personal interest in africa as you can see he added humorously pointing to his black skin my forefathers came to america from africa i can not tell you from what part of africa he came but it could have been from any part it could have been from right here in kabbo as incredible as that may seem with that last statement old man okete really started shaking most of the villagers thought it was just his oldage nervousness but dr williams kabbos schoolmaster knew better thomas ended his speech old man okeke shook his hand again this time not looking thomas in the face then the old man left the grounds dr williams overtook him a few yards down the path what in the world was wrong with you then he asked old man okeke what made you so nervous old man okeke paused that young man he answered that black american i can not stand to look him in the eyes for it strikes terror in my soul what are you talking about williams asked he says his name is thomas old man okeke explained i would not expect you youngsters to know this but thomas is the englishmans name for tunde you know what tunde means it means coming back and im sure this is no accident of names i still dont know what youre talking about williams admitted ah old man okeke scoffed you young people only have book sense and no knowledge of your own history youll call it juju but i have a mysterious sense of knowledge it is related to this black americans coming here and it makes me terribly upset many many years ago segun of kabbo was sold into slavery and he promised he would return oh boy williams laughed you old people with your juju your superstition and your mysterious knowledge all thats a bunch of nonsense he declared then he laughed his way on back to the picnic in the halcyon days of vaudeville dancing especially tapdancing was considered a major form of entertainment to some extent it still is but with the death of blackface coonshouting and cakewalking the hoofing art contracted a sickness which some people believe will eventually lead to its unfortunate demise the graveness of the situation concerning individual dancers of today can best be seen by the lack of star performers on stage screen and television not since the heyday of bill bojangles robinson has there emerged a dancer who could begin to approach the popularity of that great artist he left a bountiful legacy to his profession but apparently he left no heirs such performers as sammy davis jr george kirby john bubbles peg leg bates and the nicholas brothers are still kicking up their heels but the truth is not one of them is considered a star dancer davis is alleverything kirby is a mimiccomic bates is considered by many as being over the hill and both john bubbles and the nicholas brothers are struggling along the comeback trail actually bigtime dancing began to get sore feet following world war ii whereas in prior years hollywood was turning out movies starring the likes of marge and gower champion gene kelly fred astaire ginger rogers the nicholas brothers and the four step brothers they now ceased to do so the movie kingdom like stage and television turned to mass choreography and a limited amount of modern dancing however when one recalls old fashioned dancing the renowned bojangles commands more attention than any other dancer in history it is an unchallenged fact that no dancer before or since has possessed a virtuosity comparable to his when bill first started in the business he was part of a team cooper robinson within a very short time however he ventured out on his own as a song and dance man with a few jokes thrown in for variety it was through a stroke of luck that he stumbled upon his bread and butter forteone day while performing at the palace theatre in new york city bill sauntered down the steps to acknowledge some friends upon returning to the stage he adlibbed a jig up the steps and the maneuver brought down the house from then on stair dancing was in and so was robinson eventually he occupied the position of being the greatest dancer in the world and in short order he was beckoned to hollywood in the early s he appeared in films such as dixiana the little colonel and many others in the s he starred opposite lena horne in stormy weather and few will forget his roles with americas darling of the era shirley temple by sheer artistry he broke through the wall of racial discrimination into the bigtime kings presidents mayors and statesmen applauded him without ever having had a formal dance lesson himself he became the teacher of every dancing great in the u s indeed he was the hero of the humiliated the protector of the poor and the codifier of hoofing his status as an entertainer testified to the stamina and persistence with which he and other members of the negro race reached for stardom through the clouds of jim crow i make music with my feet he once said and the millions who thrilled to his deft dance steps readily agreed as could be expected there were those who claimed that bojangles was an uncle tom maybe so but there are those who still say the same things about louis armstrong and this is without doubt an absurdity critics are correct when they say that looking for militancy in both men was and is respectively like looking for tigers in africa but not everyone has to be a dr martin_luther_king to be of service to racial justice both men were simply products of their time robinson was a tap dancer and an entertainer satchmo is a trumpet player and an entertainer thats all they ever were and thats all they ever wanted to be it is gratifying to know that they won their war with success irrespective of the weapons with which they chose to fight in armstrongs opinion bojangles was a showman without parallel he even confesses to copying some of his idols style which anyone who has ever seen louis in person knows what bill did and what louis does is not toming but entertainment seventyone years of age at the time of his death in bojangles spent a large portion of his life attempting to make others happy it is a matter of record that he died broke but it is also a matter of record that he died a legend perhaps there will someday be a successor to his title but not soon times have changed too much for example when robinson was a boy it was quite common for youngsters to dance on street corners and in alleyways but not any more nowadays they stand on street corners and sing rock n roll songs according to one dance expert the metamorphosis began to take place when dancers who for the most part were underpaid and underrated in vaudeville turned to other careers on the stage many of them switched to singing be cause it offered them the chance to reap overnight riches and fame on the strength of a single hit song shortly afterwards records became the rage and hoofers left their specialty in droves by now vaudeville was on its death bed talking movies and radio had not only robbed the circuits of their stars but most of their customers too theatres all across the country began padlocking their doors and this proved calamitious for youthful dance aspirants without the showcases with which to polish and perfect their art they lost interest in dancing as a profession and sought out other fields of occupation however there is still a ray of hope that hoofing can be rescued currently there are thousands of high school and college students across the country who are enrolled in dance courses and there are thousands more being trained in professional dance institutions but almost all of them are involved in modern dance or jazz dancing the forms promoted by martha graham katherine dunham pearl primus and talley beatty to them tapdancing and all its relatives is as archaic as the old twoaday routines at the palace and is therefore a lost art still in a sense they are preserving this art form and who knows their children might some day restore it to its proper place in the culture a wind of change came to dancing when john william sublett better known as john bubbles of the old buck bubbles duo hoofed his way into new york rather than reinterpret known dance steps of the day bojangles style he undertook to reexamine basic premises and in the process discovered what later became known as rhythm dancing his architectonic approach to movement received widespread recognition and gained him universal acclaim but not as much as robinson bubbles says a member of the four step brothers was one of the greatest dancers ever to place a shoe in a rosin box there were many things he could do that bojangles couldnt and bill would never accept any of his challenges but as far as im concerned robinson was the epitome of dance his steps were like poetry in motion robinson and bubbles were not the only big negro dancers in vaudeville others included worth thompson the five hot shots the three joints of rhythm the three lightnin flashes ford marshall and jones and the five cotton club boys they were experts in such styles as the clog cane toe softshoe adagio and neat song and dance during their peak years each group earned from to a week per man but then came the bad days and salaries were slashed almost to nothing in some instances stage managers made more than musicians and stage hands took home more money than dancers it was inevitable that something had to give at the present time there are only three dancing groups that are able to draw more than mere breath at the box office they are the three rhythm kings the nicholas brothers and of course the four step brothers but things are so bad only the step brothers work the major supper club route with any degree of regularity they are on the road weeks out of the year and they command a fourfigure salary somehow they have managed to survive for years and according to a spokesman they hope to be around that many more but how long will oldfashioned hoofing be around can anything be done to save it from extinction some experts say yes and others say no but all agree that dancing will never enjoy the popularity it once knew because the art like an evicted tenant has lost its house and homevaudeville there is a diminishing passing as clouds in the air of things that once were but now are not here for they passed there were adam and eve living in the garden without any evil fear or doubt then a snake came with an apple in its mouth and eden passed when it rained forty days and forty nights without stopping noah thought the water would never stop dropping but the flood passed hitler in munich drunk from many beers swore that nazism would last a thousand years yet it passed there was a time when men stood blinded by a cotton curtain for that curtain blotted out all light they lived and struggled in that dreary darkness and all their lives were long and lonely nights but that time passed the light of freedom now shines through the cotton curtain once men were blind but now they see though their struggle has not yet ended the dreary darkness is no more and their lives are not the long lonely nights they used to be for the nights are now brightened by the flame of desire and the fire of determination to be free and that flame and that fire has once again lit americas torch of liberty and as that torch brightens the night as the darkness recedes well find that not only the suppressed but also the suppressors themselves were blind for no man can lower a curtain around anyone else and remain in the place where darkness falls without being blinded himself there was a time when men rejoiced because they were freed from the chains but their rejoicing did not last very long for they found that after the visible shackles were broken other chains were welded invisible but just as strong and that time passed like the visible shackles of long ago the invisible chains are falling men have felt the weight of those chains and found that weight appalling for chains cannot imprison the hearts and minds of men nor can they bind the desire for freedom and bring it to an end those chains cannot withstand the pressure of men who want to see america become the true home of the brave and land of the free yet as the shackles lose their strength as the links weaken and wane the welders of those shackles will find that they too were bound by the chains for the man who chains another man must remain at hand to see that the shackles are not broken and therefore neither man is free there was a time when a man dreaded the approaching tomorrow as he gazed back on the fears of a fading yesterday he wondered if those fears would diminish in the night or if tomorrow would renew the horror of yesterdays fright that time too has passed today a man does not stand depressed and forlorn as he glances back at yesterday and toward the approaching morn though many fears are still with him as he stands in the twilight hour those fears will give him the desire and strength to fulfill tomorrows vows and those vows will be renewed each day until that coming night when all america will look backward and forward and find no need for fright and as a man goes forth each day to fulfill the vows he has made hell find that those who caused his fears are themselves afraid for the man who causes others fear is himself touched by the blight of fearing that the others will someday rise above their fright there was a time when it appeared that justice could not move forward that she stood blind and bewildered in a strange and foreign land it seemed as though she was bogged down in the mud of segregation and in the muck of mans inhumanity to man that time also passed the mud and muck has finally parted justice has at last taken a pace out of the depth her journey may indeed prove to be a long one but even the longest journey begins with a single step and her journey will lead far beyond the cotton curtain it will erode the invisible chains it will eliminate the fears and end at a place where america can face the world without shame and as justice begins her journey the entire world will see that america is willing to follow her to the place where all men are free now perhaps the picture will change in the minds of men who saw the eagle come forth with chains rather than an olive branch in its claw there were those times but a tide has come and washed them all away and riding high on the crest of that tide is an idea whose time has come the idea is freedom and the time is now america is being given the chance to show that the statue who stands with a torch in her hand has the right to stand near our shore but let not the tide stop with the washing away of old times let it also wash clean the conscience of our country may that cleansing enable each american to see that the good ship united states was built and launched by all our hands may we all look over the helm and across the bow and see that our ship now floats on a current which can lead on to greatness and glory for passage of the civil_rights bill has given america a finer hour on the stage and her citizens now have new roles in another different drama and when god and historians look back in judgment i am certain they will find that the drama ended in brotherhood and not blood hat is all this fuss over names one of our out standing negro writers wrote a book all about nobody knows my name many negroes contend they do not know who they are or where they came from originally i have news for them i am white and i dont know where i came from either what is more i dont really care i cannot live on the reputations of my ancestors and something tells me if i snooped around in history too much id find some ancestors i might be a little ashamed to acknowledge oh sure i could brag that back maybe a couple hundred years ago more or less two brothers came from virginia and settled in kentucky i might stretch the truth a bit and say they established productive plantations in the commonwealth but not only were the plantations productivesoon their descendants were scattered all over kentucky there was just bound to be a horse thief a card sharp a seducer or a moonshiner somewhere in the lot perhaps worse and how can i be sure how the original two brothers obtained their money to start their propagating so you can see i am not too eager to dig up my ancestors so to speak on the other hand where did those two brothers come from before virginia some folks like to brag that their ancestors came over on the mayflower now ive heard tell how there were a lot of petty criminals on that boat so you dont know who you are i am not sure either the best way i can figure it is that i am mixture of english irish and scotch not the liquid kind with a maiden name which is also chinese according to a couple chinese friends who had the same name and where did the ancestors come from before they got to england ireland and scotland i havent the faintest idea i dont care one thing i know and this is the only important thing to me i am an american i was born here i hope i shall die here we cannot stand on the deeds of our ancestors so my grandfather was wounded in the civil war or my uncle was killed in world war i they may have been heroes but not me i have no medals for bravery no purple hearts i am not brave i am a coward all i have done for my country is pay a few taxes and try to be a law abiding citizen it is not the name we use that is important but what we do with it make that name glow dont hide your light behind an x the black muslim says hate the white devil he enslaved us that is true he did search your history books and you will see that white men enslaved white men and in some cases black men enslaved black man was it not the man from galilee who said let he who is without sin cast the first stone hate is cancerous hate causes ulcers on my small salary i cannot support an ulcer sometimes it is hard to love our neighbors but we can begin by trying to understand them glory be i just thought of something suppose i find an ancestor who was a real rascal say old col jim dandy challenged the marquis de fantastic to a duel down in new orleans over the honor of a beautiful creole maiden or was it a quadroon what wonderful material for a short story eh sherlock of course all names will be changed to protect the innocent excuse me please i must do some research and the old colonel x held his head high and his shoulders straight as he stepped off the required number of paces he turned on the signal took steady aim and fired his adversary fell mortally wounded under the big oak tree colonel x approached him with dignity looked into his paintwisted face and said to the dying man nuthin personal suh i liked you but you should never call a member of a respectable old suthern family a carpetbagger suh then he walked away into the setting sun
more than years ago abraham lincoln addressed himself to the duties of free men and free women in an age of rapid social change we cannot escape history he said the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation these words were spoken a hundred years ago but they cut to the bone of our current dilemmaa dilemma which cannot be solved without the help of free individuals who stand up to the challenge presented by the men women and little children who are sitting down in the marketplace we stand today at a forking point in the american experience we are in the middle of a nonviolent social revolution that goes to the heart of our meaning as a people the social revolution speaks to usas individuals and as community leadersand we must respondas individuals and as community leaders if we are to make an effective contribution to the continuation and the strengthening of the democratic way of life the national urban league is the lengthened shadow of men and womennegro and whitewho rose to the challenge of their times the baldwins the hayneses the woods the joneses and the grangers made a great contribution not only to the negro but also to america and the urban league tradition of interracial affirmation is maintained today by the youngs and the steegers and the thousands of other americans who are reminding us of the holy dream we were to be for more than a half century the urban league has hammered away at the wall that distorts the personalities of both negro and white americans we stand on a new plateau today as a direct result of the efforts of the league and other organizations but much work remains to be done our citiesthe chief area of urban league service are threatened today as they have never been before millions of americans are fleeing the central city in a white panic and millions of negroes are being tossed and turned by the cold black wind of despair the demonstrations in the streets are reflections of a despair rooted in figures cited by a prominent american who said the negro baby born in america todayregardless of the section or state in which he is bornhas about onehalf as much chance of completing high school as a white baby born in the same place on the same dayonethird as much chance of completing collegeonethird as much chance of becoming a professional mantwice as much chance of becoming unemployed about oneseventh as much chance of earning a yeara life expectancy which is seven years less and the prospects of earning only half as much malcolm_x didnt say that whitney young didnt say it james baldwin didnt say it john fitzgerald kennedy said it in a special message to congress and the statement contains a tremendous challenge to every individual american what can we do about this challenge more meetings more conferences i think not it seems to me that we will not make any real progress in this area until every individual assumes a personal responsibility for race relations in america in his book the ordeal of power emmett john hughes spoke of the cleansing anguish of responsibility and decision one of the great problems in all areas of american life is the lack of individual responsibility and commitment too many people say let george do it too many people are reluctant to take personal responsibility for hard decisions in the arenas of life they control the challenge we face today cannot be solved solely by education law or time but it cannot be solved without them we need law we need education we need time but most of all we need dedicated individuals carrying out the duties of free men and free women in their neighborhoods and offices free individuals negro and whitecan make a real contribution to american democracy by challenging the distorted images that blind us to racial and social reality the biggest stumbling block to interracial peace in america is the distorted negro image that poisons communications at the very roots millions of white americans react not to negroes but to their image of negroes an image that has always been out of date and out of focus an indispensable prerequisite for racial progress in america is the abandonment of the traditional american error of confusing the negro image with the individual negroes who enter into our lives there are negroes of every conceivable description of every shape and size and color there are negro millionaires and negro paupers negro phds and negro policemen and a strong negro middleclass which has grown by more than per cent in the last ten years there is a tendency in america to put negro facts and white facts into separate compartments there is poverty and then there is negro poverty there is immorality and then there is negro immorality and the two things are almost always interpreted by different lights millions of american negroes for example are poor but so according to president johnson are to million american whites at this crucial hour there is a desperate need for adequate understanding and precise interpretation of the negro in human terms we suffer in america from a distressing lack of communication between negroes and whites i am appalled by the large number of businessmen and professional people who have never known a negro as a friend and who have never exchanged home visits with negro couples white americans can make a real contributionto themselves and to americaby crossing the berlin wall that divides us i would also urge a special effort to grasp the disadvantages of negro americans a disproportionate number of negroes are members of lowerincome groups where among all people crime and social disorganization flourish more negroes than whites proportionately are on welfare rolls because they cannot find gainful employment because for years they have been the last hired and the first fired for too long now we have barred negroes from employment and condemned them for idleness for too long now we have barred negroes from the best schools and condemned them for illiteracy we must make a special effort to provide better educational and employment opportunities for negroes this effort will pay off in less crime less delinquency less maladjustment smaller tax bills and larger wholesale and retail revenue we can do these things and create garden cities for all americans if we abandon ghetto images and confront the human beings behind the myths that blind this is a task that recommends itself to both negroes and whites negroes have a responsibility to tell americans the truth about their lives and their aspirations in many areas they must take the first step in initiating a dialogue between real individuals who confront each other in truth in responsibility and in trust there is a similar need to upgrade the image of the white man millions of american negroes have never known a white man who was not insulting patronizing or exploitative we must make an immediate effort to stop the increasing polarization of american life based on the negative image of men who approach negroes with negative attitudes this will take deeds as well as words more negroes must be exposed to fairminded whites and fairminded whites must take the lead in debunking the widelyheld view that most white americans have a linein their hearts or in their neighborhoods beyond which they are not willing for negroes to go this whole problem of images negative and positiveis a responsibility of individual men and women as community leaders we must take the lead in redefining the negro and the white image in the process we will create an image not of the negro or the white man but an image of the americanneither white nor black jew nor gentile the urban league has made a great contribution in this area by insisting on interracial cooperation the league has exposed thousands of negroes and whites to sensitive members of the other race more importantly the negro community through the league has received a positive image of whites and negroes working together for the advancement of all people the urban league approach is as sound today as it was years ago there is an even greater need today for conciliation negotiation and preparation we need organizations to open doors but we still need an organization to prepare men to enter the doors and to negotiate with the men who open and close doors the league will play an even greater role in the years to come for what is at stake in the social revolution is the urban foundation of our urban civilization we have reached a point in america where we cannot continue business as usual the first order of business in america today is the salvation of the american city and the american city cannot be saved if we do not face the challenge and the opportunity of the urban negro there has been a great deal of comment recently about the tactics of different organizations most of the comments i think miss the basic point no army is composed entirely of foot soldiers men have different gifts and different insights some men are not fitted by instinct temperament or training for the front lines but we have a right to ask them to fight somewhere every individual ought to be involved at some levelif not on the firing line then at the conference table if not at the conference table then in logistics or supply giving money attending meetings holding up the right arm of the steegers and the youngs this campaign must be deepened and extended it will be necessary to interpret the negro to the white man and the white man to the negro but it will also be necessary to act to know and not to do an old proverb says is in fact not to know negroes today are judging men by what they do and not by what they say it is no longer possible to buy negroes off with token appointments and token commitments it is no longer possible to buy them off with rhetoric a deed is required in the italian film general della rovere there was an interesting scene that dramatized this whole problem of individual responsibility it was during the german occupation of italy and the nazis rounded up a group of people in a frantic effort to crush the resistance movement some of the people caught in the dragnet were members and leaders of the resistance but some were not the officer in charge tried to identify the resistance leaders and failed so he decided to shoot them allleaders and innocent bystanders on a cold morning the men were taken to a room to await their execution one man cried out in anguish im innocent i didnt do anything a resistance leader approached him and said you didnt do anything the man said no l didnt do anything the resistance leader said i dont understand our way of life was being destroyed minds were being warped babies jews christians and old men and women were being killed and you didnt do anything the man replied no i didnt do anything the resistance leader declared if you didnt do anything then you deserve to be shot what are you doing minds are being warped babies are dying jews christians and old men and women are being humiliated degraded and excluded what have you done to be human in this crucial age is to be precisely responsibleand no man can avoid the hard claims of responsibility by not acting this fight in the final analysis will be won or lost not by organizations although organizations are needed not by conferences although conferences are useful not by study groups although study groups serve a purpose not by tens and twenties and fifties but by individual men and women accepting responsibility for unpopular decisions in their neighborhoods offices clubs synagogues and churches we must not deceive ourselves we act now not for the negro but for america not for civil_rights but for the city not for love but for economic salvation and the preservation of the democratic way of life the road is not so rough as it once was no longer will chained men walk it to their dusty deaths no longer is it suffused by the dense air of suppression or overshadowed by hopelessness and despair for the road has wound up from the valley of depression to a mountain a summit of hope and it leads on to the peak that we seek to attainfreedomfor once forever and for all and on this mountain the air is so much sweeter the light is brighter and each dawn brings another ray of hope here a man can have a dream and walk with head held high for he knows that his dream will come true by and by he knows that his people have been unwilling actors in an unworthy play but he also knows that the curtain of justice is descending on this improper stage this struggle in which we are engaged began long ago we are continuing a journey that started long before they who began that struggle are now all gone and the first step of that journey was taken before you and i were born in our past there are those who pointed out the way and who led us through the darkness to the dawn of this new day the things of which they dreamed are now being accomplished by our race but it was their dreams and labor that led us here to this high place now let us pause for a moment as we stand here at this summit and look down the path stretching back away from us can you see the rocky road winding down into the depths where once we walked in a desolating smog can you see the rusty chains laying in the dusty plains where men struggled and threw their shackles off look at the pitfalls that were missed at the barriers that were climbed and at the crossless graves scattered along the way can you see where the dust has settled in spotssome wet some redfrom the blood and from the tears that were shed as you gaze down the path do the winds from the past bring ancient sounds to your earsthe anguished moans the tearful groans and in the wake of freedom the cheers do the winds bring the sounds of the hopeful songs that were sung and the faithful prayers that were prayed the hope in those songs and the faith in those prayers fired the torches that lit the way for those who guided us down that rocky road to this mountain we stand on today the view from this mountain shows that old rugged road its traps and treacherous pits its hazardous surface and dangerous curves that wind through the dark ness unlit after viewing that road is it strange that we marvel at the strength of those who led us this far who gave their lifework and their lifeblood so that we could reach this place where we are for it was those old leaders and workers who blazed the trail that led us up from the deep and who gave their strength hope dreams wishes and prayers to you and me they who gave us all those things who counseled us as we walked by their sides are the ones we now thank for bringing us here and for being our old guides not only statesmen like frederick douglass or educators like mary mcleod bethune but also the ones who labored and sweated in fields in the burning sunthe ones whose names will not be mentioned by the men who write history but whose gifts will live forever in the hearts of you and me though the old guides have left and are leaving the things that they passed on will stay with the young leaders and workers who fearlessly stand up today for when you see a young woman sitting passively in a stream of curses abuses and threats do you wonder whose words laid the foundations for her pillars of patience and strength as she sits there with tears in her eyes withstanding degrading taunts whose patient old voice comes to her from the past whispering the lord is my shepherd i shall not want does she still hear the voice that she heard as a child the voice that quieted her cries that gave her faith and diminished her fears when she went down to be baptized water from a fire hose knocks a young man down but he rises to come forward again his body is kicked and beaten but his courage never wanes when men on horses come with cattle prods and when dogs come with slashing teeth the young man falls back but advances againfor him there can be no retreat what makes him push on in the face of such oddsfire hoses maddened dogs and men on horses with prods as he struggles does he remember a man who lifted him up with calloused hands and talked to him as a child could it be the words of that man which now give him courage to stand and demand the rights and freedoms that were never given to he with the colloused hands and when that young man enters schools which he never could before do you think of those who gave him the ways and means to reach those doors which old guides gave up so much and yet were so very glad to do without so he could acquire the things they never had who fed and sheltered that young man until he went forth to learn and who waited and watched through many long nights praying for his return the price those old guides paid so he could enter such places is symbolized by their calloused hands and the wrinkles in their faces those are just a few of the things that will endure throughout the years from the old guides we received other gifts too numerous to recount here but every one of the gifts that they handed down to us will be remembered cherished and held in sacred trust and the old guides who are with us now as the peak of freedom nears stand honored by all of us during their twilight years for today the guides are changing we now float upon another sea where those who were helped now help and where those who were led now lead the ones who sacrificed so much to see this moment come can look at the fruit of their labor and tell themselves well done as we stand on this mountain humble thanks we offer to those old guides who gave their all in enabling us to climb this mountain side and we raise grateful voices in a prayer from our hearts and minds to the old guides who are not here to witness this great time how to bring out the best in tour children is your child making the most of his abilities or not doing as well as you know he could without even mentioning report cards to him you can help him improve his marks and more important establish learning habits which will benefit him all his life the way to do this is to establish a climate of learning in your home for according to a study financed by the u s department of education children achieve more in school subjectseven mathematicsin a flexible spontaneous atmosphere where their viewpoints count the study called project was first carried out at the university of minnesota researchers compared two teaching methodsone formal remote cutanddriedthe other flexible spontaneous and personal teachers who used the latter approach used some of their classroom time discussing the childrens personal interests viewpoints and experiences who watched last nights television documentary what did they think of it who read of a certain new development relating to the subject in this mornings newspaper what was their opinion of such a government policy or what reasons could they give for such a state of affairs in this climate of learning the student was encouraged to seek knowledgenot forced to receive it weve been criticized said one educator who favored this approach for not getting tough but which sounds tougher letting the student grow up and test the consequences of his teachers ideas or showing the student to develop and then test the consequences of his own ideas your own home can be a place where a student is encouraged to seek knowledge too the editors of colliers encyclopedia suggest the following tips to help you create your own home climate of learning take some adult education courses yourself millions of adults are going back to school learning everything from french cooking to symbolic logic and childrens grades improve when they see that their parents regard schoolwork as a worthwhile leisuretime activity not a horrid chore use games to help him learn word games are fun for the entire familyand help the schoolage child improve his vocabulary and his spelling to increase a young childs facility with numbers play games like dominoes or bingo if hes having trouble remembering multiplication tables make or buy flash cards rash cards are also available to help children learn foreign languages as for scientific kits games toysthere are enough of them on the shelves to solve any parents christmas problemsand give the kids a head start in this scientific age in addition you can invent your own games one family plays expert one evening a week the members of the family challenge each other to become experts on various topics each one is given minutes to look up his topic in the encyclopedia after which he tells the family what hes learned give him the basic equipment the minimum home reference works are a dictionary and an encyclopedia a world atlas is also helpful the encyclopedia is not only valuable as a reference aid for school reports and homework assignments but as a source of lifelong interests a child fascinated by a brief article on chemistry may be stimulated to do further reading on his own a boy or girl who had never liked reading may turn over a new leafand then another and anotherafter finding an entry on a subject which interests him in selecting an encyclopedia that school children will use look for clear lively language an abundance of pictures and mapsand most important of allthe most uptodate facts you can find give books for gifts the child who loves to read has a long head start for life and you can subtly encourage the love for books your childs teacher can recommend fiction fact books and biographies tailored for his agegroup and his skill in reading especially those that dovetail with topics being studied in school provide him with books relating to his special interests a boy who finds the classics a bore may devour books on automobiles or outer space put the tv set to work television can be a help not a hindrance to school workif your family watches all available documentariesand if you keep an encyclopedia and a world atlas handy during the show encourage him to use his school knowledge allow him to show off his arithmetic by doublechecking grocery tapes keep gas and mileage records when you travel show him you value books and learning praise him when he achieves and dont laugh at him when he tries to use a new word and mispronounces it help make your home a climate of learningand help junior make his mark why negro leaders lack power for more than twenty years some social scientists have been predicting the civil insurrections oneway riots that leapfrogged through northern cities last summer their social barometers were activated by fairly obvious and widely familiar causes for example police brutality in every case illfeelings fostered by general oppression overcrowding unemployment social discontent the slowpaced civil_rights struggle social dynamite comprised of unemployed and frustrated youths loss of faith in the integrity of white people and established authority the growing worldwide insurgence of oppressed races and in the words of the swedish social scientist gunnar myrdal a growing realization by negroes that peaceful requests for their rights are not getting them anywhere why then was little or nothing done to remedy these conditions before or after riots my hypothesis is that the white men of power who of course have a vested interest in blindly diminishing the signs of revolution more about that later have had the inadvertent aid of negroes themselves particularly our leaders how has this occurred broncobusting leaders item negro leaders were booed down whenever they sought to speak out in restraint against the negro crowds one philadelphia leader was hit on the leg with a brick for his efforts just as a broncobusters job is to tame and corral unruly stallions the new breed of negro leaders it would seem have the function of riding herd on mass negro rebellion they manage with the help of the white press and politics to get in front of negro rebellion then call moratoriums until the end of the current political campaign or whenever it may suit the fancy of white men of power preferring to negotiate rather than demonstrate they have in the recent past called off the worlds fair stallins the christmas boycott and by editing speeches and other means watered down the march on washington from lieins and civil disobedience a la gandhi their professed messiah to little more than an ov ergrown parade of jolly vacationers who climaxed matters with a grand and glorious dream affirming loyalty to the belief in ultimate justice from white america rev martin_luther_king jr who along with roy wilkins the washington post reports was called in to dampen the march on washington also was brought in by new york city mayor robert wagner over the heads of local leaders during the harlem riots however rev king core leaders naacp officials and others with a mind to halt the rebellion were conspicuously powerless white people dictate your policy one heckler yelled to core leaders being booed down similar reactions were met by such responsible leaders as an exprizefighter in philadelphia a disc jockey and a famous comedian it appeared indeed that as malcolm_x and an ebony editorial have observed negroes in the northern slumsif they ever had anyare fast losing faith in the efficacy of nonviolence as the answer to their troubles conference table revolution another general pattern was a belated effort by white powerwielders to pump up as leaders negroes who before the riots had been largely ignored except for an occasional grant for launching some study or pilot project they were eagerly placed on ad hoc committees for postmortem analyses and rehashing of the problem sure enough uncle tomism was the order of the day the harlem committee or jury of twentythree that reviewed the charge against the white cop who lit the fuse for the riot contained two negroes one a goldwater backer who unanimously freed the policeman of all charges made by eyewitnesses an naacp leader decried phony militancy and asserted that some white people in childhood had it rough too others preoccupied with token concessions and a peaceatanyprice philosophy took to the conference table however this is customary after any negro uprising violent or nonviolent as is also the stage when frightened negroes and their leaders quickly become again all teeth graciously smiling to let whites know that all is forgiven lowrating the rioters item during the harlem riots a policeman stood on a street corner and yelled through a bullhorn why dont you go home a negro standing in the crowd yelled back were at home this is our home baby the policeman had been trapped as were negro leaders in a propaganda line to undermine the respectability of the rioters to defame what some negroes call lowrate the character of the participants the technique was namecalling rioters were labeled outsiders as if local groups of negroes could not rebel on their own other names given included extremist elements the lunatic fringe hoodlums professional agitators agitators approved by whites are called leaders some said that the black muslims had a hand in the riots except in localities where black muslim leaders themselves quickly joined the jittery bandwagon of negro leaders going on record that we do not believe in violence black nationalists and of course communists also were blamed for the riots in order to defame them even wayward youth came under fire despite the fact that youths first got the sitin movement underway and not so much was made of the welloff white youths who rioted at hampton beach new hampshire and seaside oregon then there was the fact that only a small percentage though they numbered often in the hundreds and thousands had taken an active part even so this is as good a record as the passive resistance movement has mustered on spontaneous occasions and a survey conducted by a professional polling firm found that eight out of harlemites had never taken part in a nonviolent demonstration but negro leaders while gleefully approving the above namecalling and defamation added factors such as goldwaters nomination wine liquor and the waning number of white liberalsanything to evade criticism of the white power structure one group of ministers a full month later even took a second look at a chance to pounce on personal sin and called for a mass turnout as a silent christian witness to indicate their opposition to the riots and their affirmation of faith in the status quo others avowed that negroes were forfeiting their moral suasion and negroes of all varieties rolled their eyes toward high heaven poked out their lips and alleged ttiats a shame set us back years disgraceful to the colored race and the like along with whites some negroes were known to call it uncivilized behavior this said at a time when the worlds greatest modern civilizations are preoccupied with the preparation of mass war on a scale that makes the riots seem microscopic item leftists black nationalists and cultists were seized and raided often on tips from negro bigwigs on grounds that a couple of butcher knives an old rusty pistol and say a couple of beer bottles were found in their headquarters this despite the fact that the rioters even if organized were largely unarmed except for bricks and such readymade ammunition the arrests represented another technique what students of public opinion and propaganda call propaganda of the deed where no verbal statements are given but a deed is used to publicize the propaganda intended the tracking down of alleged culprits conveys the idea that the riots were ignited by no just grievance and were simply willfully stirred up for nothing by deranged or irresponsible individuals item during the riots signs appeared in store windows such as this store owned and operated by black men and reportedly in the case of a chinese gentleman me colored too although defamers of the rioters clung to the factor of looting as the basis for the riots looting was selective restricted on the whole to white stores besides the rioters did not merely loot they also pulled fire alarms in some cases broke windows and overturned trash cans this is in the fashion of the boston tea party during the american revolution and suggests that while looting may have been a factor for some participants it was overplayed by the white press and negro leaders this was designed to keep the riots distinct from a civil_rights quest in the public mind civil_rights leaders were anxious that their organizations would not be hurt but they unwittingly played into the hands of the white men of power who do not wish to recognize or let the world know that the denial of negro rights was the chief factor but even the first riot in harlem grew out of a demonstration against the police force over the shooting of a negro boy by a white heavyweight policeman after a white custodian turned the hose on the boy and said he was going to wash the black off him also nonviolent groups held rallies and demonstrations but merely ran out when the slum negoes who thought the ranting middle class leaders actually meant business got a bit out of hand if i had known this was going to happen one turncoat leader moaned i wouldnt have said anything both groups violent and nonviolent were striving to demonstrate discontent not merely being unruly the civil_rights tie also is apparent in the fact that groups of negro teenagers between the intermittent flareups in harlem for example gathered on street corners and sang we shall overcome and similar civil_rights songs they previously had gone to the police station to protest but were blocked out by five policemen who locked their arms and refused to listen killers must go they shouted police brutality must o the semantics of revolution although a perusal of the literature on the french revolution notes striking similarities to the summer riots and the public reaction they provoked there was a curious endeavor by many to write off the revolutionary aspects of the riots this was accomplished by way of a suspicious exercise in semantics peaceful picketing and boycottingmethods used for centuries by nonrevolutionary labor unionslong have anxiously been labeled the negro revolution this technique allows negroes to believe that they are carrying on a revolution in order to keep them from really revolting likewise meek compromising though bellowing conservative negro leaders are widely hailed as militant i believe that the sitins when not corralled by sellout leaders and the riots are part of the beginning of the second stage of an emerging revolution rex hopper from a study of social revolutions throughout the history of the world has divided them into four typical stages the preliminary stage of individual excitement and unrest the popular stage of crowd excitement and unrest the formal stage and the institutional stage the second stage which we may now be undergoing is characterized by the spread of discontent and the contagious extension of the several signs of unrest the riots that spread from harlem to brooklyn rochester jersey city elizabeth and patterson new jersey philadelphia kansas city and chicago loss of faith in their leadership on the part of the repressed group and the emergence of conflict with the outgroup in any case many of the aspects present in the riots and public reaction were as we said apparent during the french revolution there was in both selective looting and the ruling groups and the rioters own bourgeois allies similarly shouted bribery resorted to namecalling and set about track ing down conspirators instead of removing the social grievances it is only a conspiracy of silence and wishful thinking that lead white men of power and their colored henchmen to ignore the revolutionary aspects of the riots while trying to shame negroes back into complacency they prefer to use their armed superiority and scientific propaganda to restore the situation to a semblance of tranquility ignoring the devastating problems behind the riots if they were in hungary tossing molotov cocktails at russian tanks says an ebony editorial white america would consider them heroes if they were in cuba defying castro white america would be saying the government should be sending help but be that as it may if the forces behind the riots are not soon removed the rebellion will again be ignited and exploded perhaps more resoundingly next time for as kenneth b clark psychology professor at the city college of new york said recently with reference to the riots i dont know whether the average negro leader can ask his race to be moderate any longer this was the year when the negro struggle for equal rights moved out of americas alleys and into its main streets from mississippi courthouses and bronx lunch counters to the united states senate it was a noisy year but on a sweltering sunday last summer a handsome methodist minister rose in the pulpit of his newly assigned church in tucson arizona to deliver his first sermon to a congregation of strangers and with his soft carefully clipped syllables began an inspiring episode that earned scarcely a headline for the rev wilbur r johnson is a negro and his congregation is white as he spoke that first morning police cars cruised outside the pueblo gardens methodist church in answer to cowardly telephone threats that the church would be bombed if the new minister conducted the service but no bombs exploded and each sunday pastor johnson stands in the same pulpit on legs ravaged by polio and preaches to approximately the same congregation he faced last summerexcept that average attendance has risen nearly per cent as the objects of an unprecedented experiment mr johnson his family and the members of the little church knew that many eyes would be on them during their first year together not only methodists but leaders of other denominations were interested in bishop gerald kennedys bold plan to integrate a church beginning at the altar on june without advance warning the yearold minister was reassigned from an allnegro congregation in compton california to pueblo gardens less than two weeks later he had moved his wife and two school age daughters into the tucson parsonage we hardly had time to think about it recalls one church member two years earlier the congregation had voted overwhelmingly to accept any minister sent by the bishop regardless of his race but so had other churches and by last summer the vote was nearly forgotten many expressed open shock at the bishops choice at first i was worried when some members disappeared admits mr johnson even before he arrived in tucson more than a dozen people threatened to leave if he showed up but show up he did and within a few weeks all but one family had drifted back the fears of one parishioner that the little cinder block church would suddenly be overwhelmed with new negro members proved groundless in fact to several lay leaders the only disappointment of their new ministers first year was that no more than two negroes came forward to join the church they are the only two now on the rolls pueblo gardens is a white neighborhood of modest homes and many children nearby is a tidy negro community the parish boundaries include both areas but until last year the negroes declined repeated invitations to worship with their white neighbors this appointment was not made purely on the basis of race nor was it merely a token of the churchs belief in civil equality said the rev dr chilton mcpheeters superintendent of the tucson district of the methodist church in clarifying the controversial assignment frankly i recommended the appointment to the bishop in the hope and belief that the right minister would place the pueblo gardens church in a better position to serve the total community apparently he was right mr johnsons success was confirmed this summer when bishop kennedy who heads the southern california and arizona conference of the church granted the wish of both the minister and his flock and reappointed him for another months because it is in an admittedly low overhead part of town pueblo gardens has more than its share of struggling young couples and oldsters living on meager pensions both groups have special spiritual needs to be met by their pastor if by now people in all circumstances could not turn to me as their minister then i could have failed says pastor johnson allowing himself little room for shortcomings through its trial the parish has remained one of the leading small churches in the tucson district and continues to lead the districts other congregations in per capita giving if only the whole world could see how things have worked out here in pueblo gardens i think it would be much easier for people everywhere else said one member who admits she was skeptical at first while he sees his first duty as that of spiritual leader of his church mr johnson is not silent on matters closer to earth than heaven and hell a longtime member of the national association for the advancement of colored people he heads the tucson chapters labor and industry committee which fights job discrimination and he is active in all naacp activities i was raised in california not alabama or mississippi and unlike many of my race i did not have a chip on my shoulder by the circumstances of my birth and upbringing the minister explains but where i see wrong i must fight it and today i see wrong everywhere i look i cannot be a docile uncle tom the only fullfledged racial skirmish to mar tucsons progressive record on civil_rights resulted last fall when mr johnson and three other ministers two of them white walked into a small downtown restaurant and ordered hamburgers they were refused service and civil_rights pickets soon were marching outside the eatery after nine days the owner capitulated and agreed to serve hungry patrons without regard for their color but pastor johnson was not among the first to test the agreement instead he had embarked on a threeday fast and prayer session for the conversion of alabama governor george wallace and in protest against the bombing of an alabama church in which six little negro girls were killed as seen by the minister the racial problems confronting both pueblo gardens and the nation are the same and do not involve skin color as much as they do cold economics white people are not as afraid of having a colored family move in next door as they are of losing money on their own property as a result he observes and there are peopleboth black and whitewho are willing to capitalize on this fear and line their pockets at the expense of society he doesnt like the words but what mr johnson is talking about is the unscrupulous practice of block busting by conscienceless realtors who use scare tactics to force property values down for their own advantage after my appointment several pueblo gardens residents were approached by men who offered to buy their homes the minister reports for a bargaining lever they used the thinly veiled threat that droves of negroes would soon follow me into the area and knock the bottom out of the real estate market the same tactics were used over several years to destroy two nearby neighborhoods one is now a slum and is fast becoming tucsons biggest problem from the police standpoint and mr johnson has seen identical forces at work gobbling up california neighborhoods lashing out one morning at block busters and slum lords the quietly exciting preacher declared greed and hate know no racial bounds and it is up to us here in pueblo gardens to prove that christian understanding also transcends that barrier and is even stronger so far the people of pueblo gardens have shown staunch stuff three negro families beside the johnsons live among nearly white families but they are there not as the unwanted guests of fear and prejudice instead they came because they wanted and could afford to move to a pleasant section and they are among the first to work to keep it that way a minister who is unafraid to carry his convictions to the pulpit with him mr johnson is esteemed by fellow clergymen as a spontaneous speaker who rarely loses his point in too many words but between sermons a parish pastor finds more intimate proving grounds for his faith than the pulpit the bedside of a dying parishioner or the kitchen of a woman on the verge of destroying herself because of family problems makes a sterner challenge than talking to a hundred or so sunday morning sleepy heads though he admits there have been anxious moments in his first year mr johnson reports no outright rebuffs by his congregation during house calls hospital visits or other duties during the very early days i could never be sure what filled the gulf between the altar and the pews the negro minister recalls it is a lot easier to accept someone at arms length than it is to have him baptize your baby marry your daughter or bury your mother looking back he sees his first funeral as an important milestone in the year in this day of constant agitation and hypersensitivity to questions of race some people expect fireworks every time a white man and negro get together in the same room this may be true when you are talking about angry mobs but when the equation is reduced to two individuals the battle shifts back to their minds where it is won or lost on merit not blinding prejudice his words come after a year when he has won many such parlor battles as mr johnson predicted both he and pueblo gardens have drawn enthusiastic support from the cynics and scoffers who no longer respect a church that does not deal with life and wrestle with the issues of the market place his popularity sprang quickest from young people since his arrival a large number of college students from the nearby university of arizona have bolstered the list of regular worshipers though many of the churchs older members were slower to accept their new minister others were willing to meet him more than halfway despite special hardships one woman crippled and living out her final days in a small rest home happily welcomes his weekly visits but once he leaves she becomes the butt of sneers and gossip i am proud to shake his hand every sunday and to welcome him into my house declares a brave merchant who has been taunted kidded is the word he usesby several customers but i just let them talk he says stoically and i havent lost very many of them in tucson as in four previous assignments mr johnsons ministry is shared by his family often mrs johnson appears with her husband on hospital visits and house calls she is active in womens auxiliary work sings in the choir teaches sunday school and coaches the junior choir the couples two daughters gayle and karen adapted to their new environment and made friends quickly they too play an active role in the church and it is partly for their sake that mr johnson hopes for a long stay in tucson the whole family is fond of the wonderful friends we have made in tucson said mrs johnson after the first year but we would still be outsiders if we had just stayed in the parsonage and come out only once a week for sunday service the darkskinned minister adds sitting in his office one thinks back to missionaries trudging through black africa with a cargo of christianity now the faith of christ also comes in a brown earthen vessel he announces all of christendom finds itself embarrassed by the fact that it has been preaching for many many years the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man but now the churches find themselves lagging behind social and civic institutions in practicing the concept of equality for all men the danger to the christian church today is that it may be passed by the rest of the world we cannot continue to exist as a fancy little social club the negro is knocking and he is coming in he can come in lovingly or he can come in violently but he is coming in there are too many of us to be hanged burned or shot sometimes when he talks mr johnson sounds like a man who has known hate and violence all his life but he has not his early life in pasadena was almost devoid of racial strife the pain of his upbringing was inflicted not by brickbats but by a teenage bout with polio that left his legs weak and skinny providence is the word used by the minister to explain his life probably i would never be able to be here today if i had been raised in mississippi i am too much a fighter he declares surveying history mr johnson points out that the sidebyside relationship between negroes and whites has always been an intimate one we have fought beside you and you have made our women sleep beside you now all we ask is the right to sit beside you in a restaurant or on a bus and to share your voting booth lion of malawi the great ngwazi pmmr i kamuzu the lion of jbwlimalawi on july he b jrfeljre came into his own as prime minister of the independent state of malawi known for the last seventy years or so as the british protectorate of nyasaland he is dr banda one of africas best known personalities widely revered for his courageous and successful battle against the now dead central african federation and sir roy welensky he was born in of peasant parents in the kasungu district of nyasaland fifteen years after the establishment of the british protectorate there his parents called him kamuzu meaning little root because his mothers barrenness was ended by a root given her by a medicine man he was educated at the livingstonia mission of the church of scotland and adopted the name hastings after a missionary he admired in he set out to walk to south africa with typical nyasa zeal for betterment he travelled miles for nearly a year through bush country in search of better educational opportunities he worked for eight years on the rand goldfields and studied at night schools after hearing a lecture by dr aggrey the famous viceprincipal of achimota in the gold coast the man who also inspired nkrumah he decided in to travel to the united states for the next fifteen years the tough struggle to educate himself continued he went to high school took a degree as bachelor of philosophy at chicago university and qualified as a doctor at meharry medical college in nashville tennessee he helped pay for his schooling by working as a sunday school teacher during a recent visit to the us someone who was with him at chicago found a picture of the young banda in a college photograph a remarkably handsome man sporting a straw boater and sent it to him he went on to britain in and in took his lrcp in edinburgh to enable him to practice in british territories as a doctor this was the time when he became an elder of the church of scotland the next few years he practiced in london but he was also at the centre of the struggle for african self determination and his surgery at aylestone avenue kilburn not far from the west african stu dents union hostel in maida vale became a place of pilgrimage for all nationalists it was here that he formed his close association with kwame nkrumah and it was from here that he led the campaign against the central african federation after he had learnt from his close correspondence with his people of the deep opposition to the federation when it was proposed in in federation was finally forced through although in the summer of nyasa opposition had found militant expression but after federation was a reality the opposition collapsed dr banda decided to remain away from his people until there seemed a real chance of victory he continued work for a while longer among his white patients in kilburn one woman spoke of him thus that wonderful doctor with so many patients for years he tended everyones troubles we knew then he was a great man and then in he moved to ghana he set up practice in kumasi and abjured politics events in ghana between and cannot have escaped his attention however not only was there the rapid move towards independence but he must also have witnessed the worst period of political violence in ashanti his ties with ghana already strong were firmly cemented during this period in there was increased pressure for him to return from many quarters in nyasaland henry chipembere now a minister wrote that the country needed a kind of saviour a man of about fifty or sixty an intellectual with a character combining nationalism with honesty self denial and a spirit of cooperativeness and in the spring of he returned to london his mind made up it was one of the most sensational homecomings of modem times as far back as he was thought of as the great leader and when he actually materialized the excitement was tremendous this was the miscalculation of the british about banda they believed that because he had been abroad for so long he was out of touch and would have no popular support after all he could not even speak the language he had to address crowds in english but his absence had made him into a messiah so when he did return and discovered a taste for oratory and the knowledge that the people were behind him the initiative was all his although at first thought of as a moderate the feeling he stirred in nyasaland against the stupid federation particularly after he had returned to ghana for the allafrican peoples congress of december was bound to lead him to a direct clash with the colonial administration and the federal authorities which came in the state of emergency of march when he and many others were detained the massacre plot he had allegedly planned was convincingly disposed of by mr justice devlins report of later that year it was this plus the way banda had shown the unmistakable opposition of nyasas to federation that persuaded the macmillan government that the federation would have to end this more than anything else will ensure for banda african immortality the man called in to break the federation was significantly a scot iain macleod who still retains the close links he established then with banda the rest of the story is well known the release from prison the successive constitutional conferences the overwhelming victories in elections with his success in the battle against federation some thought dr banda mellowed but in fact he had always been a warm generous personality he was never as some of his enemies tried to make out a racialist his many years abroad showed that it was only the federation that roused his ire that presented the man with a challenge his present policy is to keep as many europeans as he can because malawi needs them even at the risk of offending some of his own party and as with kenyatta malawis europeans have mostly accepted bandas good intentions although some hostile propaganda mostly emanating from salisbury has tried to make out that all is not well in malawi the remarkable solidarity of all his people behind banda has made this one of the most stable of african states tribalism virtually does not exist they think of themselves as nyasas or rather now malawis he is free from ostentation and neither smokes nor drinks he had already ordered cuts in ministers salaries including his own even before independence autocratic he undoubtedly is with a will of his own and strong dislikes notably journalists and sir roy welensky but he is also a realist and quite prepared to sign a trade agreement with southern rhodesia because malawi exports labour and maintain close links with the portuguese because malawi depends economically on the beira railway if it is in the interest of malawi ill even have the devil as an ally this then is a remarkable new phenomenon on the african scene of all malawis and their traditional wanderlust has taken them to many parts of africa the most famous is also the one who will spring the most surprises from west africa usually as a sequel to the eternal question what do you think of this country negro americans are wont to ask the african what do you think about us those who have already been misinformed about the answer to the latter question will usually say i have been told or i understand that you people do not like us u the reply that the african makes to such a comment varies with the particular african the nature and extent of his previous association with negro americans his experience or inexperience in dealing with such questions and the relative formality or informality of the occasion on which he is called upon to make a statement whatever the situation and whatever the nature of the answer he strives to give he is heard with the utmost attention it is usual for part of his audience to be disillusioned by the explanations offered the rest may shake their heads in disbelief and go away with their misconceptions all the more fortified the number of times many friends of mine and i personally have encountered this question is simply alarming people are forever asking is it true that you people do not like us in homes at parties making speeches to colored groups and every time we meet people for the first time it is bound to come up negro americans are very anxious to know what africans think about them they would like to know how closely akin to them the africans feel they like to be reassured that africans sympathize with them in the social injustices they suffer most unfortunately however many of them have already reached the conclusion that africans in this country want to have nothing to do with them this is a most regrettable misunderstanding and it is often discussed by africans and negro americans among themselves and whenever the two groups meet it is my opinion that the issue which could easily have been disregarded as insignificant has grown to serious proportions by being discussed a little too frequently with hardly any attempt by either side to understand or tolerate the position of the other discussions which should aim at ironing out the differences often degenerate into sessions of recrimination and counterrecrimination perhaps the greatest fault of which either side is equally guilty is a tendency to treat isolated incidents as empirical evidence leading up to a generalized conclusion such extrapolations or projections are usually unjustifiable and misguided an unfriendly encounter between a particular african and a particular negro american is not considered simply as a case of two individuals failing to get along but must be misconstrued as proof of the fact that africans and negro americans do not get along in general after such an encounter the african goes home and tells his friends the negro goes home and tells his friends and theres one more evidence that further strengthens the misconception what we are all apt to forget is that people are people and as such will always have their differences africans differ among themselves so do negro americans even twins have their differences physical mental and emotional when a negro american asks an african if they are the same and the african says no he only means that he is an african and the negro is an american when africans refuse to be referred to as negroes they mean no offense to the negro american they are not trying to disown him they just want to dissociate themselves from the derogatory undertones of the word negro so whereas negritude is a bond binding all of us together and should therefore foster good relations it is at the same time too much to expect that just because negroes and africans have a common distant ancestry every african and every negro american should get along always and everywhere this isnt the case and will never be my intention in this article is not to traffic in the controversy but help bring it to a conclusion i hold no brief for either side though i have to admit that as an african i may not be able to divest myself completely of all of my own personal or national biases it is only fair to state that there have been faults on both sides and there have been areas of great misunderstanding where we have not taken time out to appreciate or tolerate the position of the other side africa is a huge continent so huge in fact that most people do not realize that the congo though one of the larger of the fiftysix countries that make up africa is about onethird the size of the united states africas two hundred million people though they have the common inheritance of being more or less dark vary considerably in culture traditions social outlook and the extent to which they have been affected by the colonial domination of europe nor can negro americans be placed all in one class the varying tinge of dark color in every one of them is not enough to nullify the differences in background social status parental upbringing and so on first let us consider the african in all probability he is a student in his early twenties his financial situation varies he is not the son of a tribal chief or a village head as the popular misconception goes but one can say that in the african context his means and accomplishments are above average some africans are urbane and sophisticated others may be quite rustic this varies with their countries and their background but they have all been schooled in the rigid and petty formalities and social conventions of europe and while being african their manners may bear the trade mark made in great britain or made in france thus they may be seeped in class consciousness intellectual snobbery apt to despise or sneer at whatever they consider downgraded they know who should not say what to them are not prone to be casual but are rather selective in making friends the differences cited above are not offensive per se what very frequently gives offense is the fact that some africans may be unduly supercilious or overbearing in attitude their peculiar flair for being prim and proper all the time is often irksome their airs of superiority make people want to cut them down to size they often strut around giving the impression impression of much travelled and widely read in the wrong places these are of course faults some africans mistakenly use the norms to which they are accustomed as yard sticks against which social practices here must be judged this is topsyturvy many africans refuse to adapt and persist in what may be considered outlandish behavior from the american point of view for example they wont do uncle willie or the monkey and keep talking of such things as the waltz and the quickstep eccentricities turn them into squares it is needless to say that the african student does not regard himself as a square he may not be hip according to the standards of those around him but his selfesteem is overriding he has no desire to compromise on his attitudes or what he believes is proper a certain class of negro americans fondly refer to themselves as bad or as tough cats in truth the african despises the average tough cat they consider his type of sophistication cheap and secondgrade to a more genteel and suave type of sophistication on account of these rivalries many young negro americans dislike the african they accuse him of trying to act cute or to act like white people the african on his part remains despising snobbish standoffish unwilling to become hip or to identify with this particular group i remember on one occasion a fellow student said to me why dont you take off those sillylooking things and get dressed he was speaking of my agbada he drove me to the brink of madness if you africans think you are so cool why didnt you stay over there why did you come here i have heard people say again and again some negro americans go to the extent of establishing an analogy between our relations and those of the twelve sons of jacob in the bible in any case one thing is sure before he or she comes here the african is eagerly looking forward to meeting the negro american in fact that for him is one of the major differences between studying in europe and studying in america but as the saying goes to travel hopefully is sometimes better than to arrive in seeking directions on a busy new york or chicago street the lost african naturally finds identity in the negro and is instinctively inclined to ask him for directions this may not always be the best thing to do he may receive the first jolt of disillusionment later on during his stay in this country he may discover some of the lower classes of negro americans at what he may consider downgraded behavior things like making a nuisance of oneself making noise or drawing unnecessary attention to oneself for the african this is a serious factor he suffers a let down on the long run he may be forced to the conclusion that such niggerly behavior is part of the reason why some white americans despise negro americans the thought fills him with disappointment and resentment there is an old african saying that he who befriends a chicken smells of fowls dung therefore the african student may start to dissociate from this class of negro american and find another identity for him self i have some personal experience in this field in birmingham alabama last summer while trying to be friendly to two negro boys i was robbed of at home in nigeria i wouldnt have been found so close to such boys as to let them get my money in the short scuffle that followed the police arrived and i was arrested for affray and disorderly conduct and spent the night in jail while generalizations are dangerously misleading one can still say with a fair amount of certainty that it is the lower or middle class negro that is apt to dislike the african or think that the african dislikes him he belongs to a subculture into which he has been forced by this inequities of american society in his group and among his own he is tops an established or aspiring tough cat and he conforms strictly to the edicts of his group wherein lies his dignity pride and self esteem he too is guilty of expecting everybody including the african to conform to the norms of his own subculture one of the first impressions i got after i arrived in this country three years ago is that many young negro americans have an inferiority complex about their color they owe nothing to it except the social injustices and discrimination they suffer they just want to be americans and it looks like the africans here remind them of something they would rather forget i am not exactly sure to what extent this inferiority complex is true but suffice it to say that it does exist one other factor in the misunderstanding is that africans and negroes are not always partners in suffering discrimination at least in northern us the african is apparently better received than the native negro american his airs of selfassurance good manners his robes and his farfetched accent very often unlock doors which may be explicitly or tacitly barred to negroes the reason for this is that all americans are anxious to show every visitor the goodness that is in their country they want the visitor to carry away nothing but the best impressions for this reason and because africa is playing an ever increasing role in the cold war white americans are more prone to accept the african before the negro american this is the irony of american life a negro once asked me do you think that the white family with whom you are staying would play host to a negro boy from say mississippi this was a question i was afraid to answer at that particular time though i wouldnt be now not at least in the case of this particular family on account of his socalled acceptance by the whites the african may be suspect or disliked by the negroes by his association with the whites he appears like a deserter of the negro cause who has abrogated his kin in preference for their persecutors a common misconception is that whites usually tell africans not to have anything to do with negroes they are unjustly accused of telling the african that he is not the same as the negro and must keep away from him this is as false as it is unfair in my opinion any white who is willing to entertain an african in his home could hardly be accused of negrophobia there is of course the story told of an african who sat beside a white couple in church the couple got up and moved to another pew after the service they came to the boy to apologize they had discovered that he was an african they even invited him to dinner in their home such is the irony of life in america in any case it is only fair to say that many wellmeaning white amercans find it easier to make their break with the african who is a foreigner and therefore bears no personal grudges against them once in a while one may meet an african who has been overwhelmed or taken in by the immensity of the cordiality extended to him by whites such an african may falsely reason that if whites are willing to extend to him such fair treatment when he the african is the epitome of blackness and negritude the negro must be to blame for the discrimination he suffers such africans are very few and will probably be found among the new arrivals most africans realize that the problem is deeper than that from the explanations offered it is obvious that in some instances the african has failed the negro while in others the negro has failed the african visiting africans can perhaps afford to be a little less condescending in attitude they could try to be a little less censorious of the negro but rather strive to understand him and his unfortunate social position in america on the other hand negroes should seek to know the african better while i have met or heard of some negroes whose knowledge of african history and current african politics would put me to shame i still maintain that such negroes are few most negroes know very little about africa except for a few impressions picked up from tarzan movies perhaps in the past the negro has had no reason to want to know about africa but the past is now past perhaps they were afraid of being disappointed at what they might find out in conclusion i would like to say that the biggest problems are a mutual ignorance of the others viewpoint and a lack of adequate communication it would be nice also to remind negro americans that africans of this generation are proud and selfassertive proud of themselves their continent their culture and their inheritance any negro who is explicitly or implicitly ashamed of our culture or considers his or her negritude a bane rather than a boon is hardly worthy of our friendship the audience is subtly invaded from the moment the curtainless play begins the spirituals pull you into the church where you become a part of sister margarets sermon against sin the invasion grows in intensity becoming less subtle as the characters peel off layers of protec tive covering to finally expose their pitiful nakedness you are carried along to this precipice you too are unclothed the play which packs this tremendous wallop is the amen corner by james baldwin produced and directed by frank silvera veteran actor of years on the stage and screen the play opened last march at a miniature workshop theatre in los angeles the robertson playhouse and was the vehicle silvera used to introduce his theatre of being a new concept of acting amen was an instantaneous success life termed it important a smash hit margaret harford in the los angeles times noted that amen corner is a play with no chip on the shoulder but rather a searing ache in the heart no boiling bitterness only the devastating despair and loneliness of people who have mismanaged their lives john g houser in the los angeles heraldexaminer felt that the play will mark baldwin not only as the top negro dramatist of our time but as one of our finest ranking with tennessee williams and arthur miller international fame too has come to baldwins first drama written in produced unspectacularly at howard university then buried in a trunk until silvera resurrected it a men has been invited to represent the united states at the vienna festival next summer sharing honors with the moiseyev ballet from russia the comedie frangais from france and the royal ballet from englandan unprecedented honor for a little theatre production after playing to delighted audiences for seven months in los angeles silvera took his cast to san francisco in september for a limited run before opening in new york in november the play revolves around sister margaret minister of a small storefront church in harlem brilliantly played by actress bea richards sister margaret left her husband ten years before the play opens and s obsessed with keeping her yearold son david the church pianist from reentering the world which to her is synonomous with sin margarets destitute musician husband luke reappears dying from tuberculosis determined that david shall have a chance to live his own life luke tells his wife i wont let you make david safe david wants to play jazz like his father but feels guilty about deserting his mother and the church in the meantime the congregation has decided that since margarets husband is upstairs dying in his sins and her son is fornicating in the wilderness she is no longer a shining example to guide them into heaven they set about to snatch the church from her beneath the surface of the story is the desperation of the negro who is born into a world of confusion and chaos luke tries desperately to maintain his dignity and man hood in a society which seems dedicated to his psychological castration david is symbolic of a multitude of negro youths who are raised in a matriarchy which subconsciously tends to channel active masculinity into feminine passivity margaret of course is trying to escape the agonies of living through religion she inoculate herself with the holy ghost not in order to expand her awareness but to quarantine herself from the outside world she forgot that jesus whom she calls upon so frequently said i have to die so that you may have life and have it more abundantly she accepts instead the moral ethics of the puritans who confused sex with sin renounced joy and glorified suffering to expiate guilt margaret tells luke that their sin was that they were too happy when their second child is born dead she feels this is punishment for their happiness luke asks her what did we ever do to be punished except be born poor but in her sorrow margaret rejects her husband and seeks solace in the lord i had to find me a hiding place she said luke bitterly resists accepting the church as a substitute for life when margaret wrestles with him on his deathbed to give his soul to god he tells her i aint gonna come crawlin to the lord now making out id do better if i had it all to do over aint gonna go out screaming against hellfire it would make me nothing but a dirty drunken man didnt do nothing but blow music and chase women all his life i aint gonna let it be like that you know that aint all there was to it luke dies and david leaves home to join a jazz band life has thrust itself in again upon sister margaret in her loss she wails with dawning terror somewhere i must have done something wrong this confession assaults the audience like an admission of its own guilt thinking of her misdirected love for the lord margaret tells her sister maybe luke needed it more maybe david could have used it better in the end the trinity is complete her son and her husband are gone and she is dethroned from the ministry but with the loss of the church margaret finally discovers what it means to love the lord it aint in all the singin and shoutin she tells her faithless congregation it aint in the reading of the bible it aint even in running all over everybody trying to get to heaven to love the lord is to love all his children all of them everyone to suffer with them and rejoice with them and never count the cost v baldwin explains that the price sister margaret pays for running from life to religion is the loss of her individuality she has to lock her femininity up in a closet in order to protect her son it is easier for a woman to embrace religion as an escape mechanism because she is passive by nature baldwin states but to escape from a society which constantly menaces him a man demands more action than the passivity of a church unable to retaliate against the threatening society the man vents his rage and frustration on himself in selfloathing and upon other members of his race in the seemingly senseless saturday night violence and when we stop hating ourselves baldwin added we can swing too far in the other direction we can experience an excess of bitterness for society but excesses can be corrected this is better than calling ourselves a zero and having nothing to begin with unwinding backstage after one of her emotionally shattering performances as sister margaret bea richards a slender dark woman whom one critic called pure africa confessed after my first rehearsal i cried really i was frightened i wanted to pack my bags and run back to new york silvera kept insisting that i go down into myself back to those hidden areas which i had forgotten existed or ever were but i didnt want to go back those areas were too painful that was why i left there in the first place then when i said that line somewhere i must have done something wrongsuddenly i was transported back to africa somewhere lord between here and there i had done something wrong it was like peeling off layer after layer of myself it was the most excruciating human emotion i have ever felt i had gone back into the beginning of my being and i was frightened yes i leaped years right back to africa its unbelievable what a tremendous loss our people have sustained it was so strange but i knew that this was the me i was forced by society to bury it is somethting to peel off all those layers she concluded vj and how does director frank silvera accomplish sending his actors back to their source he does it by speaking to them in his barely audible ponderous voice about his concept of the theatre of being for the past years silvera has played more caucasian mexican and indian roles on the stage and in the movies than he has negro parts last year he was nominated best actor of the year on broadway for his role in the lady of the camellias he created the role of john pope sr in a hatful of rain in which anthony franciosa and ben gazzara played his sons he directed and starred in the players ring production of arthur millers view from the bridge a member of new yorks famed actors studio he conducts an actors workshop in los angeles and previously directed one in new york silvera explains that the negro has long been denied his being he has not seen his image not on the stage not in movies not on television so he has been acting as if he were not in the picture but being cannot forever be suppressed what you are seeing is the negros bursting forth into being he is finding his image and showing it to the world and to himself this play goes beyond the stanislavsky method of illusion which portrays characters as if they existed amen is a play about a group of negroes not as they are thought to be like not as they would like to become but as they now are this is the essence of the theatre of being these characters are not as if we bes silvera who turned down a starring role in the hit play the deputy in order to direct amen continues bea says in the play somewhere i must have done something wrong in those words there is remorse and grief i tell her to be grief where does grief live where was this grief born after she did the scene a few times i told her no thats not where it is go deeper you know where that moment is you know where the pain the grief the guilt is go back further inside yourself and find it its all there it was born in africa it was born when you sold your mother into slavery now when she says itsomewhere i must have done something wrongi hurt inside the audience hurts because she takes us right into the experience with her she is being the remorse the grief the guilt the play is shattering silvera says because it allows a being to be hollywood and television are theatres of nonbeings for years ive played a mexican general a beverly hills banker a french gentleman but ive never been allowed to play a negro i dont mean a stereotype a pitiable person afflicted with color i mean a real man being is what the negro has been denied vrc the cast of amen are all members of silveras workshop and they all bes bob decoy turns in a sensitive portrayal as luke the dying horn player equally as effective and moving is john perrow as the guiltridden son a fine lusty performance is delivered by academy award nominee juanita moore almost stealing the show is isabelle sanford as the hyprocritical spinster whom no man has ever touched thank you jesus whitman maoy is also an accomplished scene stealer as a church elder veteran stage actress maidie norman is regal as margarets loyal sister and josie dotson evokes pathos as a young mother who cant understand why god in order to make her bow her head has put two of her babies in the graveyard all of this is spiced with fine musical direction by frank wilson and a compact efficient set designed with brilliance by vantile whitfield but it is bea richards as sister margaret who receives glorious hosannas from each and every critic a theatregoer paid her the supreme compliment when he said in the beginning shes just a plain black woman but in the end shes beautiful beautiful amen is not a satire on religion it exposes the falsity and subsequent penalty for confusing shallow amens based on fear with spiritual understanding based on true brotherhood as one character said if you dont love your brother who you can see how you gonna love god who you aint seen the church figures prominently in baldwins writings he admits now in retrospect that david represents him baldwin a minister at quit the church at seventeen and then left home he explains he entered the church in the hope it would make his preacher father love him but it didnt work out that way he says perhaps the universality of the amen corner which appeals to negro and white audiences alike can best be explained by the universality of its author what i have to understand baldwin says what we all must understand is that the facts of life are the same for everyone but the details are different we get all hung up in the details what we have to know about another person is that he suffers the same as we do of shakespeare james baldwin recently observed he saw as i think we should that the people who produce the poet are not responsible to him he is responsible to them that is why he is called a poet the remark was included in an article for the london observer in which the american author expressed deep regret at the traditional and stylish exodus of us writers to europe the writer as baldwin sees him is far too dependent on his environment where he was born grew up the language that he speaks to expect of the continentor any foreign retreatany magic solution to his ageold fight with society quite the contrary the really serious writer who would create as well as criticize who would exult in life as well as analyze can expect only barrenness and frustration in an alien climateone for which he has neither understanding nor feeling the point as regards shakespeare at least is well taken the eminent bard was anything but removed from his time its daytoday trivia its often absurd institutions and what a time elizabethan england producer of shakespeare bacon marlowe and jonson nevertheless has to go down in the books as among the crudest most banal epochs in western development yet here is shakespeare as businessman as landowner as amiable country squire contentedly going his way among the simple townsmen the farmers the merchants here is the father of hamlet and julius caesar partaking of pleasures cultivating friendships worthy of any innkeeperor as a modern counterpart any rotarian that he was able to bridge the gap however between art and as it were antiart has to attest solely to some fortunate and rare facet of shakespeares own individual temperament it cannot i think be used as an explanation or a condition of what he achieved as a poet to accept that proposition would be to deny the tragic example of countless wouldbe innovators through time immemorial who lacking shakespeares wellroundedness and toughness have fallen mournful victims to adverse and limited social climatesclimates that treated with neglect and stupidity their fledgling efforts at expression to accept that proposition would be to overlook the many sad casualties even today who despairing of contact of communication of comprehension even have sacked the contemplative role for some feebler more socially defined calling for indeed society is responsible to the poetin a way that only the most developed and sophisticated civilizations have ever understood and accepted why one has only to note the example of france the last three centuries or so an environment that has nurtured a vastly inordinate flowering of art and ideas including baldwins own within its studios and cafes and missionlike salons on the other side of the coin it is invariably america that is singled out as derelict america as every college sophomore knows is the actual epitome of societys neglect of the poet terms like wasteland babbittry and mammon have become almost synonymous with this muchlampooned land of the brave the truth is that the nation as a whole has matured considerably over the last several decadesin this one respect at least not so however with that distinct subculture referred to as negro america it is in fact perhaps fair to say that among negro americans taken as a society the twentieth centurythat weird exciting twentieth century of books and expresseshas not yet arrived that we are right now going through a cultural stage experienced by mainstream america more than half a century agoa stage characterized notably by mental dullness stolidity and prudishness now the word prudish would on the face of it seem the last to seriously describe the american negrothat bigcity epicurean that thoroughly emancipated bon vivant that hipster but i refer to intellectual prudishness which really has little to do with jazz and lovemaking the latter being furthermore a talent usually projected onto the hipster for people react to appearances i refer to prudishness of the mind of the intellectual faculties and its ultimate horrible result the death of the spirit a long time ago the novelist william faulkner in a somewhat fuzzy defense of the plantation cautioned southern negroes to beware of that twentieth century north the warning went unheeded as well it should have but in entering the twentieth century the negro has as faulkner perhaps guessed been cheated that is he has shared or been allowed to share only that which is absurd in its societythe automobile the televisionand has remained totally untouched by that societys one redeeming virtue a growing if belated exploration of the world of ideas for what actually are the values of current negro americana what does it hold important significant imitable well very much like the white mans puritan grandfather todays negro american and i speak of him as an entity which class notwithstanding he ultimately is places a grossly exaggerated premium on visible achievement among negroes it is generally that constituent who commands power or owns property or is conspicuously up and doing who takes the prize intellectually it is he who is most accommodating who operates on planes that are familiar to the crowdreinforcing its foolish doctrines rationalizing its preposterous mythswho is said to have contributed in short it is that constituent who fits into one of the neat categories the society of puritans has designed for itself and puritanlike defies contradiction who enjoys respect that luckless sinner who does not fit and who is hence unable as it were to render a reasonable justification for his existenceis either dismissed as different that final coup de grace or viewed with actual hostility these are to be sure quite universal conditions at work anywhere and anytime there is a newly emerging or in our case retarded social order even europe that quite definitive culture had its burghers but with us the lag is particularly lamentable living as we do among all the vestments of culture anthropology excuses any retardation in the event of isolation wanting of contact anthropology cannot answer for the american negro sociology perhaps can but that for later all this adds up to nothing short of tragedy in the classic sense of the term for it is blind unconscious and therefore needless even at the best of times in the best of climates the writers role is a staggering one not only must his craft be mastered he must somehow manage to relate his often unique mental and emotional experiences to audiences who normally couldnt care less this sounds despairing but it isnt really assuredly the marriagethe true marriagebetween writer and reader is a rare incident indeed as writers anywhere can testify but the marriage can take place what is needed is a socially recognized common ground a mutual frame of reference an identifiable and stylish language of dialogue in contemporary negro america however there exists absolutely no such language this dearth pervades the entire subculture as true of the college campus as the backwaters of the society i can recall the frustration of a prominent negro novelist as he recounted a conversation with a professor of english at a small southern college she didnt know who sartre was he plainted had never heard of him to that experience i can personally add a wealth and not all on the campuses the endless taverns for example that dot a city like chicago yield little in the way of dialogue that would stimulate even the dimmest imagination let alone ever nurture a samuel johnson for interchange is a most precious thing to the contemplative role that priceless giveand take of ideas of emotional experience so characteristic of continental creative life in the black mammon it is simply not to be attained is not to be approached my novelist friend and others like him too often are forced to fleefor contact for sustenanceto that very white community they so often attack and upbraid this is sad but necessary for that writer is rare indeed who can claim a really meaningful relationship in the american negro community who is judged and reacted to on terms that are important to him he is indeed rare who can communicate in those ecstatic electrified moments when communication is so desiredon planes that are anything but travesties on real selfexpression the sad truth is that that world in which he livesand on which he feeds for his very life is a foreign country to his community the plight of the writerthe negro writeris really a kind of paradox a riddle a joke there on the one hand is his audience that is there is the white man for negroes we have established do not read this one consideration is challenging enough for that audience is to say the least a most peculiar onerather like some rare and freak animal say with five extremely developed senses but totally lacking in the sixth that sixthby far the most important and certainly the most dangerous to be withoutis his perception of reality that is his humble acceptance of his own like our own rather inglorious condition in this universeacceptance of his equal stratification among other races of the world it is that very sixth sense that terrifying blind spot that the negro writer has the sheer responsibility to instill yes responsibilityfor the socalled white truthsayers giants like faulkner hemingway fitzgerald and mercy wolfe while they lived betrayed a most cowardly inability to broach the problem were themselves in fact every bit as deluded as those whom they would awaken and improve this task in itself at times seems hopeless and passages of dialogue from chester himes and john a williams are jolting reminders often exasperating often pathetic of the white mans unacknowledged but really urgent sickness yet as though this were not of itself formidable enough were not breathtaking and often cowing in its immensity there is the added matter of the negronot the writer but the reader or nonreader or antireader it is he after all to whom the warrior would repair at the height of the battlefor reassurance for understanding the irony is that the understanding indeed exists as the briefest remarks with any wino will suggestbut only suggest for language is lacking it is he who understands as the white reader does not that ours is not a very optimistic world and most importantly it is he for whom the writer would create weary of barren polemics or of perpetually refuting an obvious lie and desperately needing to return to art and herein lay the paradox for it is with him in his company that the writer finds himself immersed in a world more alien to his own than all the regions of the universe not even the most successful writers are totally excepted here not even those giants who apparently would enjoy great empathy that is reciprocal empathy with their brethren often among other negroes the established writer finds himself being assessed on planes very different from those of his major contribution it is often interesting in discussing say a writer like baldwin to discover that it is primarily to his role as champion of civil_rights that he owes his notoriety among negroes lost is the artist here that strange phenomenon who probably will share rank with camus lost completely the deeper manambiguous definitionlessfrom whom the real art which is actually thoroughly without cause has sprung as for other of the contemporary authors williams ralph ellison john o killens le roi jonesthey are virtually unknown and certainly unread among literate negroes gwendolyn brooks that poet so recognized among the white literati is often toasted by negroes but seldom discussed much of this complaint may seem unrealisticas it were asking too much assuredly there is scarcely one facet of the negro personality which does not have sound historical explanationsexplanations that reflect less on the race itself than the peculiar often surreal history that has produced it our art has been the art of anguish the blues the prayer ideas seldom flourish in shantytown when a negro professor of english values her automobile her wardrobe her social engagements above her library there is a kind of sadness there but also an explanation when negro college students are taught by precept and example that to wear the right clothes and join the right fraternities are ends more desirable than mastering kant and dostoievsky there is a kind of grim irony justified only by the realization often difficult that here after all is a race that did not create itself for what are we really but a tribe of eunuchs who have mystically come very near to being what the whites in fact believe us to be inhumanwho have lost that most essential possession of any tribe any human uncompromising belief in our own worth this has everything to do with the emphasis often grotesque which we place on things this has everything to do with our denial of all that is intangible in this worlddenial of art discussion thoughtdenial of those very things that redeem a civilization a society of its intrinsic absurdity this has everything to do finally with our assumption very smug and very puritan that we have sufficiently explored this universe of ours and have defined it for the universe is limitless and he who would explore it who would chart new courses among its constellations is the writer the poetunfettered by intellectual restrictions spiritual bounds moral considerationnourished and not stifled by his society and whatever the negro writer has to contribute however personal or abstract his approach he needs his own environmenthis daytoday contact and involvementto lend it substance and art he need not be estranged from his roots and most often does not want to be few writers start out for the ivory tower they are generally forced that wayby a blind indifferent social climate that frustrates and injures often unawares as the nation at large matures is more receptive to the contemplative role negro america has remained a straggler in this importantthis essentialregard and the current negro writer who does not have an unshakable faith in himself is frustrated indeed in looking about him for justification of himself of his chosen function this is not a plea for special consideration for the writer though i personally rate that member who is able to interpret his society to sing of it among that societys most valuable constituents it is simply to seek for him a clearly defined place in the social order and hopefully some semblance of empathy with it this calls for a thorough reevaluation of the lowly place to which we have assigned the entire realm of creativity and thought it calls for energy and imagination it calls for adventure foretaste of paradise a blue haze descended at night and with it strings of fairy lights on the broad avenues from the window of a small room in an apartment on fifth avenue and th street i looked over the rooftops of negrodom and tried to believe my eyes what a city what a world and what a year for a colored boy to be leaving home for the first time twentyone sixteen months out of college full of golden hopes and romantic dreams i had come all the way from los angeles to find the job i wanted to hear the music of my taste to see serious plays and god willing to become a writer it did not take long to discover that i was just one of many young negroes arriving in harlem for the first time and with many of the same thoughts and intentions within a year or two we began to recognize ourselves as a group and to become a little selfconscious about our significance when we were not too busy having fun we were shown off and exhibited and presented in scores of places to all kinds of people and we heard the sighs of wonder amazement and sometimes admiration when it was whispered or announced that here was one of the new negroes nothing could have been sweeter to young people who only a few weeks or months earlier had been regarded as anything but remarkable in topeka and cleveland and eatonville and salt lake city young people who more often than otherwise had seemed a trifle richard wright whacky to the home folks in harlem we were seen in a beautiful light we were heralds of a dawning day we were the firstborn of the dark renaissance we were not just struggling artists trying to find ourselves no there was something special about being young and a poet in harlem in the middle twenties we couldnt quite explain it but one of our advocates on park avenue made an interesting suggestion primitive man she said had contacts with the infinite which civilization has broken primitive man was sharper more acute in his intuition relying always on logic and reason civilized man has lost the one thing most essential in america the indian and the negro are nearer to the unspoiled primitive than are other people the indians spirit is crushed the negrowell see for yourself up and down the streets of harlem untamed youngsters were doing a wild dance called the charleston they were flitting over the sidewalks like mad while their companions squatting nearby beat out tomtom rhythms on kitchenware the unsuspecting stranger who paused to observe the performance was in danger of being surrounded shoved into their circle and compelled to attempt a camel walk at parties in ballrooms and on neighboring stages the older people proved that age or lack of it had nothing to do with this joy this abandon this primitivism they proved it too at houserent parties where they drank bathtub gin ate pigs knuckles and danced with the lights off darkness brings the jungle to our room darkness hangs our room with pendulums of vine the link with the jungle was obvious in the little housefront churches there was swaying and moaning and shouting wasnt that proof on a voodoo island such behavior would be called possession would it be any more real or complete than this no the american negro our friend insisted was not quite civilizedfortunately in his play and in his worship his wildness was still apparent in his work and his art it had almost disappeared the new negro was to recapture this definite though sometimes dim quality in poetry painting and song by this means he must transmit it to all america through us no less america would regain a certain value that civilization had destroyed the idea intoxicated us we went to work zealously and some americans saw the things we did and the miracle of the whole notion was that it came so near taking root our group came within an inch of giving america if not as much as our friend from park avenue had hoped at least a certain new aesthetic value it came close to repeating in the united states say what the preraphaelite brotherhood had done in england two generations or so earlier the gusto and flavor of zora neale hurstons storytelling for example long before the yarns were published in mules and men and other books became a local legend which might easily have spread further under different con ditions a tiny shift in the center of gravity could have made the books bestsellers and it is easy to see how the startled surprise that greeted the poems of countee cullen and the wonderment that followed discovery of langston hughes completely effortless lyrics might have taken other directions and given the young poets an even wider vogue than they enjoyed at first the same or more could have happened to the stylized figures in aaron douglas drawings his bookjackets and illustrations were followed by household decorations furniture designs public murals these might have started a trend had they gone into other rooms different hotel lobbies more strategically situated university libraries even so the reception which the new negroes received was warmly gratifying never before in america never since and perhaps not for much time to come has it been or will it be possible for a negro poet to say with feeling speaking of harlem let us roam the night together singing in those days it was said and meant but there were moments when the new negroes betrayed a strange uneasiness of course none went so far as to suggest that there might be something wrong with harlem or that the romantic concept that our group had the link with the primitive the key to joy and intuitive understanding might be a little farfetchedbut now and then one of us would say a shocking thing almost beyond understanding then i remember for example hearing countee cullen say that he thought it fitting that a creative artist should die young he himself wanted all his work crowded into the next few years he wouldnt care to live a day beyond the age of forty langston hughes less inclined toward selfanalysis but sharper in his intuitions than most of the group sometimes imagined that he would have his fill much sooner be kind to me oh great dark city i will not come to you again but whywhy this note in the music of the new negro something was wrong when the depression came and artists of every kind began to feel the pinch the harlem group was not excluded new negroes were scattered from boston to florida from pleasantville to carmelbythesea from alabama to the pearly gates a decade passed twelve years perhaps then some of us thought we could safely return to see what had happened to the city that had once filled us with song the harlem we found in and was another place one of the first things to shock us was the revelation that the people by whom harlem was favorably known did not live there any more paul robeson and marian anderson were less familiar figures in harlem in the early forties than were mrs roosevelt and mayor la guardia richard wright and countee cullen lived within shooting distance more or less but they were safely removed from the sounds of the streets it took an hours journey for either of them to see the rooftops of negrodom e simms campbell and w c handy lived on quiet hillsides surrounded by trees and lawns there was still a hill in harlem a fine proud one to be sure but it was not the same as theirs and the trees and lawns were not in peoples yards hazel scott and cab calloway and jimmie lunceford and the rest would certainly not have been moved by a poem which invited them to roam the night together in harlem they lived in westchester at least one reason for avoiding the harlem night streets in would have been the fear of muggers where poets went about singing in the days of the new awakening angry frustrated boys now prowled where primitive children had danced on the sidewalks hungry evileyed little criminals lurked in doorways the rent party was a forgotten legend outlandish cults were meeting in some of the housefront churches where the moaning and shouting had formerly been spontaneous and filled with joy what in gods name had happened to me there seemed only one explanation no matter what else one might see there harlem remained what it had always been in essence a black ghetto and slum a clot in the american bloodstream and the fruit it was bearing was the fruit of the ghetto and the slum the fruit of compulsory group segregation based on race the children born there in the beautiful years of the middle twenties had grown up to be muggers and cultists when harlem rioted somewhat later a fuller answer emerged it is now known that a negro soldier was shot and wounded slightly when he attempted to take the part of a harlem poulet in an altercation with a white policeman in the lobby of a small hotel the soldiers mother happened to be nearby word of mouth reports of the incident were brief intense untrue a colored soldier had been shot and killed by white policemen in the presence of the soldiers mother at first it seemed that the mad rage which followed this incident in harlem was a protest and a reaction against the true reports of the kicking around sometimes the killing of colored soldiers in the south it suggested to me a story i had once planned to write about a gang of tough slumhardened black kids in chicago who hearing about a lynching in mississippi went out and overturned the fruit cart of an italian peddler and beat him up in a south side alley this early tendency to see the riot simply as an extension of the conflict in the south seemed good enough at first to me it seemed to sweep away the claim that the south had a special right to deal with the problem of race relations in america as it sees fit irrespective of the interests of the nation as a wholeto maintain its caste mores as a leading editor asserted during world war ii in defiance if necessary of all the allied and axis armies it confirmed a belief which incidentally i still hold namely that the trouble with harlem is birmingham the trouble with los angeles is new orleans the trouble with illinois is mississippi the only flaw in that first impression as it related to harlem is that harlem did not riot against white people harlem rioted against harlem true it ravaged the shops and businesses of owners who get their living in harlem but do not live there likewise beyond dispute is the fact that the mob went for the symbols of exploitation and oppression but that was not its deepest impulse harlem was trying to commit suicide it was sick of muggers and cultists and zoot suits it was horrified and disgusted by the fruit of the beautiful years and in a moment of confusion and frustration it rioted against itself and tried to wipe the slate clean the young intellectuals who came to harlem in the middle twenties made a wonderful discovery they found that it is fun to be a negro under some conditions those who like myself had grown up in mixed or predominantly white communities even found that some segregation can be fun when its completely voluntary but the new negroes had lived long enough to learn that it is never fun to be alien it is neither pleasant nor wholesome to be deprived of the freedom of movement or of friendship or of participation in the essential life of ones country harlem must go the american bloodstream cannot manage hard clots of such size and density and all the other little harlems must change otherwise america will be balkanized into a nation of mutually incompatible minorities for the ideas and plans and the vigilance and distrust necessary to hem harlem in and to keep it there will create or maintain other harlems and all of them will not be black be towns only police l patrol car rolled slow j ly through hedonsville glowing coals of two cigarettes outlined the faces of the policemen inside two blocks down main street on the corner of fifth the car rolled to a stop in front of the bus station the two officers climbed out and with night sticks in hand walked toward the door of the only place in town to be open at that hour am a big picture window grimy with water spots from a recent shower and covered with insects around the neonlighted beer signs showed the men plainly that the establishment had no customers for either the bus or the small cafe inside the bigger of the two men who had a red face and a large paunch opened the door they both went inside and stood hands on hips gazing around there were two waiting rooms in the building and two drinking fountains both sets were equally dirty though and the waiting rooms were littered with old magazines and a conglomeration of paper cups napkins and cigarette butts on the floor when are you going to clean up this mess mae asked the policeman a hawkfaced small man in his early twenties he then threw his cigarette butt into the litter and the other policeman did the same i didnt hire out to be a janitor said the plump middleaged blond who wore her hair in the ringlets so popular in the shirley temple era she was mae bradley the combination ticket agent waitress and general gossip for the night shift the two men laughed and took off their western style hats they moved over to a small table pulled out three chairs and plopped down the bradley woman brought three steaming mugs of coffee and turned back to the counter keavy she said to the small hawkfaced man i cant remember if you do take sugar in your coffee or not he roared with laughter how come you dont have any trouble remembering what dinnett here takes she blushed well keavy i the door opened just then and the three stopped their conversation to look at the new arrivals two negroes walked across the room toward the first waiting room the older one sat down while the younger gave him a twinetied carton to hold then the younger one walked toward the ticket counter he was a tall muscular man perhaps twentyeight years old although he had an air of positiveness about him as if he knew his way around he was dressed like a farm worker aside from an armystyle fatigue cap which he had removed and crumpled in his hand he wore a plaid shirt with frayed cuffs his levis had neat patches on the knees and were rolled to reveal high topped army boots these were popular with the farm hands since a recent case of snakebite in a cotton field he waited silently while mae bradley took her time about helping him want somepin she said from the table where she was still sitting with the two policemen i would like to ask the departure time of the new york coach he said onethirty same as always want a ticket she shifted her bulk in the chair no thank you i have one the man shifted his weight to one foot but may we have coffee please the two officers who had been staring at the young man both reached for their western style hats and put them on they made no move to get up however mae bradley got up with a sigh and moved towards the coffee urnshe drew two cups half full and pushed them across the counter slopping them on the way the big man forked into the watch pocket of his levis for some change he found two dimes and handed them to her fifteen cents each and lay it on the counter mae indicated the rubber thing with upright spikes which lay there to receive change wordlessly the negro dug again and found two more nickels he lay them with the others thank you sir she said sarcastically then she returned to her seat that wasnt funny mae i know what you meant though keavy said seriously he pushed the hat back on his forehead the western style hat was a new innovation of the hedonsville police force all five of them it did however look rather out of place in such a small southern town so very far from the west carrying the two cups of cofiee the man moved back toward a table near the first waiting room he pulled out a chair for the older man and himself and they both sat down with their backs to the others although the signs labeling the waiting rooms and drinking fountains for being for white and colored had been removed the cleaner spots in the wall showed where they had been it was however the same as if they still remained for no one ever violated the taboo even the icc ruling prohibiting discrimination which was posted by the ticket office might just as well have not been there the older of the negroes had grey hair and a deeply lined face he was shabbily dressed in an old boy scout shirt which hadnt yet had the emblems removed his pants were the army fatigue kind with the big pockets on the sides the old shoes he wore were too big for him and even turned up at the toes a little he seemed proud though and as he sat talking to the younger man you could determine that he was someone who had a purpose in life officers dinnett and keavy were still staring at the backs of the two negroes keavy spoke whos he the old ones pop claridge he lives in the shack at the far end of harlan street and takes care of the dump dinnett lit another cigarette no i mean the other one the big jig keavy also lit a cigarette i guess the young guy must be his soni think his names david i think he goes to college somewhere in the north dinnett got up and went to another table to find an ashtray then he came back and sat down again mae bradley gave one of her high pitched laughs he dont look like no college man to me dont blame him none dinnett laughed and then stamped out his cigarette in the ashtray if he started lookin too fancy we might have to haul him injust on suspicion of course he laughed again very loudly david claridge and his father turned briefly to look at him then they resumed their intense conversation if hes goin back to new york i hope he stays keavy stamped out his cigarette also those ones whos been to the north come bringin all those ideas might brainwash our young folks the door opened just then and slim hankins the night cab driver came in carrying two blue suitcases after he got inside he sat them down by the door and held it open for the young woman who followed him in just then the new york express pulled up outside after it rolled to a stop the door opened and the driver stepped out he began to help the passengers out for the rest stop the ones who were awake that is slim put the suitcases in the baggage compartment then he waited while the young woman paid him he waved at the officers and mae bradley then he left the sleepy wrinkled wobbly line of passengers lined up at the lunch counter so mae reluctantly got up to serve them see you later boys she said while mae was busy at the counter the young woman who had just arrived went to the ticket booth to wait for service dinnett lit another cigarette hey keavy aint that old man watsons daughter yeah dinnett i used to date her in high school remember keavy stared at the girl unashamedly shes even got on the earrings i gave her oh i forgot dinnett replied you dated so many of them that i couldnt keep up is she fun shes a prude if thats what you mean and shes a little bit too much of a brain to suit me otherwise shes nice keavy continued to stare at her wonder where shes goin dawn watson straightened her blue dacron dress and ran her hand over her brown hair she carried her small suitcase in her left hand when she finally saw mae coming toward her she sat the suitcase on the floor the plump fortyish blond with the ringlets stood for a minute regarding the slim young girl a bitter smile crossed maes face where to mae asked new yorkone way dawn watson replied forty thirtyfive mae said without referring to the large ratebook dawn opened her purse and brought out four ten dollar bills then she dug in her coin purse and extracted thirtyfive cents in change she handed it all to mae mae took the money without asking her to place it on the counter and then she began to write out a ticket the bus driver had been having pie and coffee now he finished got up from his table and went to the center of the room will the passengers please reclaim their seats in the bus were due to leave in five minutes people began to walk slowly back to the bus most of them looking a bit more awake and refreshed than they had when they arrived the driver tagged dawns two suitcases and then carried them to the baggage compartment in the side of the bus dawn still carried her smallest suitcase her ticket envelope was clutched tightly to her purse she walked toward the side door of the station following the line of people david claridge and his father got up and shook hands then they embraced each other as if they expected it to be a long time before they met again david walked toward the line of people entering the bus outside the side door and took his place behind dawn guess we better think about goin ourselves keavy said he got up and began to walk towards the side door of the station im coming dinnett said he also got up and with a wave to mae followed keavy see ya boys mae called out she was waiting on a customer who was hurrying to buy a candy bar to carry aboard the bus keavy was looking out through the side door watching the passengers get on the bus hey dinnett come here dinnett quickly joined his partner at the door look how close hes standing to her man hes helpin her on the bus should i nab him keavy clenched his fists better not might be tourists on the bus and we cant afford any incidents see if his old mans still there dinnett looked around the waiting room but mr claridge was nowhere to be seen must have faded through the front door i guess all the passengers were aboard and the driver had shut the door the bus had started to roll down the driveway it stopped when it reached main street the driver shifted gears looked both ways and started to turn left in the di rection of the highway gosh no man look at that keavys face turned white and beads of perspiration appeared suddenly he pointed what dinnett said his eyes following the line of keavys finger no keavy and dinnett seemed to recover from their shock at the same moment then they started to run after the bus they ran waving their arms the driver turned out the inside lights on the bus just then and all was darkness on the inside when dinnett and keavy reached the middle of the street they saw it was too late keavys hat had fallen off and he went back to get it with my earrings on too he mumbled the bus gathered speed now that it was past the city limits most of the passengers had gone back to sleep near the back of the bus sat a large dark man dressed in levis and a plaid shirt he sat on the seat by the aisle on the luggage rack overhead was a carton from which a dress suit and shirt had been removed on the inside seat beside the man sat a girl in a blue dacron dress she was holding the suit and shirt on her lap her small suitcase was on the floor beside her it was very dark in the bus now there was a new moon which didnt give much light each of the seats had small reading lights for the passengers but few were on in the rear it was especially dark the girl grasped the mans large hand and held it in both of hers then he leaned over put his arm around her and gave her a long hard kiss the bus reached the highway then and turned north toward new york in his struggle to ati e tain a better present and more hopeful future the negro sometimes forgets the importance of the past which gives him roots the negro is not a newcomer to the annals of world history but can look back to a participation in international affairs related to biblical areas which dates back at least years to bc when negro soldiers served in the royal egyptian armies by bc negro monarchs ruled over the egyptian empire and fought against powerful assyrian armies many negroes have read the old testament carefully or have sung spirituals such as joshua fit the battle of jericho based on biblical themes but few of them realize the extent of the negro role in the bible very few for example are aware of the fact that moses married a negro wife and his sister miriam was punished with a loathsome disease when she made unkind remarks about her brothers spouse josephus the great jewish historian tells about the background of this negro woman in greater detail than the bible he notes that moses as a general in the egyptian army laid siege to the royal city of ethiopia tharbis the daughter of the king fell in love with moses and sent messengers to him offering her hand in marriage after the city was captured with the aid of tharbis moses married her and took her back with him to egypt when absalom davids beloved son was killed after his attempt at rebellion joab the general of the army of israel sent a trusted negro retainer to deliver the sad message to the king when the great prophet jeremiah was imprisoned by his enemies and cast into a mirefilled cistern it was ebedmelech the ethiopian negro courtier who informed king zedekiah about the seers perilous situation ebedmelech was then ordered by the king to take charge of men and lift jeremiah out of the cistern after his rescue jeremiah received a divine message which declared that ebedmelech would be saved from the foes sword because he had put his trust in the lord the book of kings relates that taharqa the valiant negro ruler of egypt was an ally of king hezekiah and helped him in his battle of bc against sennacherib the mighty assyrian chief the assyrian armies were stricken by a plague as they stood before the walls of jerusalem and the survivors were compelled to leave the holy land shortly after this sennacherib died his successor esarhardon then defeated the forces of taharqa in a subsequent battle taharqa was captured and the assyrian king set up a victory monument which showed him holding ropes attached to taharqas shackled figure somehow however taharqa managed to escape and after reassembling his troops through brilliant military tactics drove the assyrians out of the delta as scholars dig about the ruins of the ancient near east and are able to reconstruct the past it is quite likely that we shall learn more about the negros part in the biblical world just as archaeology has presented important information about great african empires so too will it shed more light on the history of the negro in bible lands her flamboyant life l years adah tlil isaacs menken went from the lowest depths to the gleaming pinnacle of renown as few women have ever done for

accepted the opportunity for new york stardom the broadway opening of mazeppa in june was an enormous success and was to make adah an international celebrity largely because the audiences never could

bynow it is commonly assumed that the negro revolt is a protest of those wanting hhdfl to become a part of the existing order to get in there so to speak or so our middleclass leaders have always proclaimed but is this actually true of the great mass of slumbound negroes they want to be free of the shackles of segregation and discrimination to be sure but do they really want to become a part of white middleclass society and if they do want to get in will it ever be possible for them to overcome the obstacles and boobytraps lining their path at every turn then too those northern riots last summer were they staged by a people too filled with despair and desperation over the incredibly slow pace of their surge toward equality or were they simply a blind striking back by those who know deep in their hearts theyre never really going to make it in there and what are our leaders saying now that the much talkedabout civil_rights bill has been passed for more than a year and harlem mississippi and alabama still stand intact and are as formidable as ever in our schools we now want quality not necessarily integration roy wilkins national secretary of the naacp was recently quoted as saying now if that isnt a rerun of the old separate but equal lie then theres no such thing as a rerun if that is going to be the naacps official position why on earth did we ever expend all that time money heartache and blood trying to do away with that centuryold stumbling block the simple fact is there can be no worthwhile quality education in a segregated school that was the naacps main thesis when it presented its case before the us supreme court in the early fifties and it is just as true today granted integrated education is not automatically quality education but it is that wellworn step in the right direction i suspect that what mr wilkins really meant is we want some education as opposed to the none most of our ghettodwelling youngsters now get and admittedly some is usually better than none but some education never got anyone into harvard or bryn mawr or backwater u or even old roundthecorner tech and if you havent got into something somewhere after high school you are never going to make it in there to enjoy the good life of their affluent society not so long as your face is black that is whitney young executive director of the national urban league chided the newspapers not too long ago for the great todo they made when floyd patterson moved out of his exclusive home in a white neighborhood because none of the children would play with his kids said mr young stories such as these give a misleading picture of the actual situation plenty of white people get along fine with negroes in these communities of course that may be true but we really cant get too excited about whats happening with the plentyfew stop any five thousand negroes on any street and ask how many of their little friends are cavorting about in mansions in lilywhite neighborhoods and be prepared for the blank stare or the big horse laugh and in the meanwhile as congress made ready to pass a votingrights bill dr_king continued making headlines as friend and foe lauded and disparaged his every move but votingrights bill or no many suns will set before the majority of all eligible negroes are registered and voting in the south and long before that comes to pass they will have learned what the northern negro has always known voting wont get you in there either for who can honestly say that there is really any real difference between a george wallace of alabama and a william scranton of pennsylvania in the spring of billy scrantons troopers went to work on the heads of those chester demonstrators with as much if not more gusto and expertise as wallaces storm troopers did on dr_kings marchers in birmingham or even the heinous selma setto of last spring and although more than per cent of the negro vote was cast for lyndon johnson last november all too soon negroes are going to wake up to the fact that lbj hasnt changed one single spot hes simply talking out of a different side of his mouth nowadays as a master politician his strategy remains the same promise them everything the black muslims it seems cause white people an untold amount of worry and perhaps their concern is justified for privately most negroes agree with what the muslims are saying about white people however the muslims ultimate goal leaves most of us laughing or greatly perplexed after all we already live in a separate state that has always been our main complaint would malcolm_x have become the man with a plan at the time of his assassination last winter he seemed to be the only negro leader telling it like it is and as he told a group of students at dartmouth shortly before his death the summer of will be the longest hottest bloodiest summer ever of course malcolm made a similar prediction in the winter of only to have the heads of all the major northernbased civil_rights organizations lambast him for being absurd and that summer in philadelphia even after riots had occurred in new york and brooklyn one of the prominent negro judges called the city a tinderbox which was ready to explode as the other cities had done at the slightest provocation what cried the white hypocrites and their echoing uncle toms in pretended anguish our fair city of brotherly love a tinderbox reediculous then boom down came the roof burying them along with all their horrendous cliches interesting enough during or after the riot of none of the daily papers seemed to make mention of the riot that had occurred only ten months previous when a rookie italian cop allegedly in selfdefense killed a young negro falsely accused of shoplifting as he lay on the pavement having an epileptic seizure and so it goes again and again and again as each depressing summer wears away the paperthin walls of hope for there is really no evidence of any change of attitude in the white power structure or steppedup efforts to make justice and equality a more tangible reality for our untouchables in no mans land and even if there were some signs of change this would only effect a temporary delay in the final confrontation to put it bluntly we will never overcome so long as our society is structured in the form of a pyramid as of now there is really not enough space for all white people to get in there and until all of them make it most of us will simply cool our heels in the ghetto amongst our old friendsthe rats and roaches and the clubwielding copsknowing that the great society is only a slogan and we shall overcome is merely a dream my cousin is approaching the age when he will want to know if a negro is inferior if the fact has anything to do with his life to him life is a bright panorama of new sensations people and facts but the time is coming and it seems all too soon for he is a negro a child at present whose theoretically unlimited horizons will soon be limited by the american way of life ricky is a healthy boy of who considers himself the man of the house since his father died he has a natural interest in men and masculine pursuits though he lives with his mother and grandmother he and i are like father and son for i try to fill that void in his life i am a glamorous figure to him a sergeant in the united states air force this in itself is a source of pride to him my travels job and life seem like an exciting adventure to him we spend my yearly vacations together in new jersey i remember the trouble he was having at school one year the neighborhood gang of kids were beating the stuffing out of him his mother and grandmother were overprotecting him telling him to avoid fights and instead be a gentleman while i was there on leave his mother told me of his trouble at school ricky and i set aside a few hours each day and i taught him how to defend himself after winning his first school fight he acquired the aggressive spirit that is always a part of a man or boy some day confused and in doubt hell ask me are we really inferior to white people the answer i give will be very important to him it will direct rickys life and ambitions as a negro a responsibility i owe rickys father who cant be present i hope it is spring when he asks the question for i want to take him outside the house to his favorite spot the grape arbor his father planted its quite pretty there sowell walk in the warm sunshine towards the arbor two negroes an adult and a youth ill be seated in the grape arbor lighting a cigarette slowly collecting my thoughts while ricky gathers some grapes to eat then there will be that inevitable pause and ill begin its a long story ricky the negro race has a long rich and glorious past second to no other race no ricky we arent inferior the exploring parties of the past that charted this land contained negroes negroes have been emperors kings popes and statesmen but most of all they have been proud men the forefathers of our family came to america in the hold of a slave ship you must not think we were weak stupid or savages we fought escaped and many of us preferred death to a life of slavery our fathers built the south with their blood muscles and backs when you think of your slave background be proud your forefathers paid for your freedom they endured and in the end they won you are part of a proud family ricky we are from old virginia where your ancestors worked as slaves slavery for the american negro was awaiting its final death blow when your greatgreatgrandfather escaped from the plantation owner he wanted freedom so badly he accepted the risks of discovery and death when he was smuggled to the north on the underground railroad the underground railroad was the name of various escape routes for runaway slaves these slaves were hidden in homes wagons and forests as they traveled north to safety your greatgreatgrandfathers destination was a white quaker settlement in new jersey the quakers have long since died there but the settlement now a town still exists your greatgreatgrandfather spent his life there as a farmer its present name is the same springtown at the outbreak of the civil war your forefather joined the new jersey volunteers and served honorably as a soldiera front line soldierin the civil war each generation has had a military member since then your own father served in world war ii so you see ricky we have earned the right to live in this country i know i have not yet answered your question but i will now the white persons claim of our inferiority is usually based on a lack of understanding and knowledge a need to look down on others to feel good and what their own families have taught them the schoolmates who call you names and believe you are repulsive dont understand themselves remember that these are the same people who go to the beaches and try to darken their skin in the sun or wave their hair with chemicals i guess they want to be like us in their hearts our supposed inferiority is a myth just as the moon being made of green cheese is one if all their attempts to stop us from progressing were because we are inferior we would not have made progress but we have in spite of them in almost every job youll find a negro competing with a white man holding his own dont let talk destroy your dreams and ambitions remember that you will have to work and prepare yourself for your goals you may have to be twice as good as a white person but do it and you can have what you want in life also generation upon generation of negroes have done it before you now they are waiting for you to join them i hope the sun feels warm and life seems good when we start back for rickys home and his future life may he believe me as i believed his father one sunny day long ago horty old and years long is two has a pony tail i cant see her at the moment but a bouncing pony tail is visible over the top of the bookcase which separates me from the living room shorty is my daughter and right this minute shes chasing three cats all called goo actually thats not their name its a childish shortening of magoo ragoo and saboo the adult names of our cats she calls our cats all other animals and unfamiliar men goo its only embarrassing when the men sort of look like a goo but then thats another story shortys upper lip came out of africa it came and it lived in bondage imported by the spanish to replace the decimated red men of puerto rico there is a special pride in men who have lived in bondage and have thrown it off my daughters upper lip rich and full has that pride her lower lip came in steerage from county wexford long before the potatoes failed it had known slavery in its own land but it too pulled itself up proud and spit on grovelling and it came bringing its special gaelic defiance tight lipped and determined boisterous and gay shorty is as fluent as a two year old can be in both english and spanish she is defiant and obstinate in either language according to doctor gessell this is normal and is due to the maturational phase she is passing through im not about to quarrel with the doctor but i believe its due to her lips a couple of weeks ago shorty and i were doing some christmas window shopping on th street i took her to see the elaborate window displays in the big department stores i liked them but shorty was more interested in the ordinary toy windows i was deciding which set of electric trains would be best for her and whether or not it would be wise to buy her a football at this time when she called me her black eyes glittered and those defiant lips were smiling for all they were worth popie she said gesturing for me to come over to her she summons me with her right arm like john wayne does in those movies about the marines where he says follow me men its amazing just how much authority there is in a two year old arm mommy mommy she said pointing excitedly to the doll section and sure enough there was mommy she was about a foot high in a floral robe with rich brown skin and tight black hair it made me proud to see her in there with all those blond blue eyed walking talking wetting dolls integration is a wonderful thing shortys attention span isnt too long about thirty seconds at a shot off she ran to see some goos in the next window the more i looked at that doll the more i wanted it so with only that doll in mind i returned to toy land later in the week there was a big crowd of women in the doll section and way off on the far end of the counter sitting all alone and neglected was my doll i guess the window display was only token integration id like this one please i said to the elderly saleslady she seemed kindly and helpful she wore her grey hair in a bun and looked like everyones grandmother she glanced at the doll and then at me i dont look exactly like peter otoole but more like him than like sidney poitier she looked embarrassed fool that i am i felt sorry for her i was soon to learn that she was embarrassed for me she smiled tenderly i needed help and she would provide it she called me closer with her finger and i leaned over the counter its colored she whispered to ii i know i whispered back are you sure you want it she asked yes i whispered she looked a little ruffled but true to the shop girls code went to the storeroom to get a packaged doll when she returned she handed me the doll looking me straight in the eye damnedest looking sidney poitier shed ever seen its amazing what cosmetics can do i beckoned to her and she leaned across the counter its not colored you know its puerto rican i whispered into her ear getting a firm grip on my tongue with my incisors as soon as the words were out oh she said she stared at me very vaguely she was still staring as i stepped into the elevator shorty thinks its a great doll she calls it pretty mommy and no goos are allowed to touch it this year for the first time since the end of world war ii a buyers market exists in which the supply of homes exceeds the demand according to housing expert c w smith senior vice president of mortgage guaranty insurance corp the oversupply of homes the opportunities for the purchase of repossessed homes and the outlook for continued increases in taxes at the local and state levels plus increases in the cost of living can mean real dollar savings for those who buy homes now instead of waiting mr smith formerly director of the housing research foundation southwest research institute says one of the best ways the american family has of beating the inflationtax spiral is to buy as soon as possible with a small down payment the best home they can afford but if youre one of the millions of americans who dreams of owning a new home you probably share a common problem lack of a large down payment despite the existence of federal housing administration and veterans administration programs to encourage highratio loans of up to per cent of appraised value it is expensive difficult and time consuming for home buyers to qualify further most conventional uninsured home loans are limited to per cent of the homes appraised value thus you would need cash to buy a home in the past six years however the growth of private mortgage insurance has made it possible for lenders to safely make loans of up to per cent of a homes value firms such as the mortgage guaranty insurance corp or mgic as it is known insure the mortgage through the lending institution and provide a low cost private enterprise alternative to government sponsored programs this one firm one of the largest of the private enterprise competitors of fha now insures home mortgages with over institutions in states and the district of columbia and presently has over one billion dollars worth of insurance in force the fha was developed during the depression in the early s to stimulate home ownership by encouraging the making of higher ratio home loans to home buyers by protecting mortgage lenders against loss and widening the marketability of mortgage loans as an investment the va program was instituted to similarly guarantee mortgage loans for exservicemen although both fha and va have made substantial contributions to the field of housing finance in the s restrictions and procedural delays began to meet with resistance and mortgage lenders increasingly turned to conventional loans for one thing the interest rate ceilings imposed by congress now set at va per cent for both fha and va penalize home buyers by forcing investors to purchase loans at a discount to secure an adequate return the discount unlike an interest rate is not tax deductible neither can it be reduced by prepayment or financing prior to private insuring of mortgages a buyer seeking conventional financing who could afford to make only a low down payment might have had to resort to expensive secondary financing if a lender for example required a per cent down payment and the prospective buyer could afford only per cent he would have to take out a second mortgagein effect a loan for part of the down paymentat a high rate of interest this would be a short term loan of say three to five years and would frequently require a large final payment the buyer might not be prepared to meet moreover second mortgages are sold for discounts of up to per cent another item which is ultimately reflected in the price the buyer pays for his home in contrast a privately insured mortgage can be as high as per cent of the propertys appraised value and the cost amortized over its full term private mortgage insurance is considerably less costly than that of government programs some offer rates of about half that charged by the fha fha charges vi of one per cent per year on the declining balance for the life of the loan whereas mgics premium for example is only v of one per cent for the first year and va of one per cent for subsequent years many private mortgage insurance firms offer single payment plans of two per cent of the insured loan for the first years of coverage speed is also an important consideration for both sellers and buyers applicants for privately insured mortgages usually receive an answer within hours of receipt of the application as a result of efficient cooperation between these private firms and lending institutions whereas processing commitments under governmental programs can be very time consuming a generation ago it was neces sary for families to save as much as onethird of the price of a home before buying since the maximum available loans were about twothirds the cost of a house today even though you may be financially able to put down per cent to per cent it may be wiser to buy with only per cent down you can achieve your goal of providing your family with better living conditions sooner without unduly depleting your savings liquidating income producing investments or resorting to high cost secondary financing the buyer also usually has movingin expenses such as major appliances draperies carpeting and other household equipment by purchasing these items for cash with savings from a lower down payment the new owner avoids the high interest rates for short term credit and burden of additional payments a lower down payment allows him to amortize all his outlays over the period of his mortgage at a lower interest rate than would otherwise be available if we continue to experience gradual inflation the buyer will be able to repay the loan over a period of years with a greater number of cheaper dollars furthermore deductions can be made on the federal income tax return for loan interest and real estate taxes which further offset the larger mortgage finally ease of resale is a strong argument for buying a house with a small down payment want to sell your home when youre ready to trade up to a bigger home or must move to a new areaassuming the credit of the buyer is goodthe house with the larger mortgage will sell faster there will be more potential buyers who can meet the smaller down payment requirement as housing costs and living exm penses riselimiting buyers opportunities to accumulate savings for down paymentsthe demand for high ratio loans is expected to increase private mortgage insurance firms will enable conventional lending institutions to expand their services to meet home buyers demandsthus providing a continuing stimulus to the national housing economy the war on poverty has been the recipient of a great deal of coverage from all the various mass communication media almost all of us have heard of it but just what does it have to offer will it be like so many other large government programs in that the very people it was designed to aid might be left out because they really dont know how to avail themselves of its benefits it is hoped that this presentation will answer some of the general questions and present enough of a basis for interested negroes to discover just what the war on poverty can mean to them the major thrusts of the war on poverty are being directed by the office of economic opportunity of the executive office of the president the present director is r sargent shriver of the peace corps this organization was set up under the economic opportunity act of the act was passed last august and the money funded to the agency in october the original request from the presidents office was for million but the congress cut the actual award to million the request for the coming fiscal year will be one and one half billion dollars its obvious that there is already a great deal of money allocated for the poverty program and all indications point to an increase in such funds how does all of this affect the negrothe major drive of the program is to aid in eradicating poverty negroes have a higher per capita rate in the poverty category than any other ethnic group the natural consequence of this could be that the negro will benefit more per capita than any other ethnic group but in order to spell out in greater detail just how negroes can benefit it will be necessary to review the various provisions of the economic opportunity act itself a summary of the economic opportunity act of the director has a planning and coordinating staff responsible for coordinating the povertyrelated programs of all government agencies within the oeo separate staffs operate a job corps a program for volunteers in service to america vista a community action program and special programs for migrant workers in addition the oeo distributes funds to existing agencies to operate other programs authorized under the bill worktraining programs administered through the labor department workstudy programs and adults basic education through hew special rural antipoverty programs through agriculture small business loans through the small business administration and community work and training projects for welfare recipients through hew following is a summary of the programs authorized under the economic opportunity act of title iyouth programs there are certain inherent dynamics of the program as it now stands that make it particularly timely for negroes to avail themselves of the benefits from it the first being that both president johnson and the director r sargent shriver are known for their rather liberal attitudes both are aware that any such program that is geared to stamp out poverty has to have extraordinary significance forand contact withthe negro but knowing this they both supported and pushed for the program which of course takes them out of the area of theoretical liberals into the area of practicing liberals the upshot of it all is that negroes can expect most favorable consideration insofar as the top leaders of the program are concerned another dynamic of the program that makes it advantageous for negroes to act now stems from the fact that the office of economic opportunity didnt get its funds until october and thus is still in the process of organizing and must commit its present funds by june the end of the government fiscal year the result of this peculiar set of circumstances and pressures is that money is being awarded rather liberally to almost any legitimate program proposal another factor that works in the favor of favorable disposition of requests now is the fact that no hard and fast rules have been established as yet there are no precedents from former programs or those set by experience since there have never been any such previous programs the officials of the program are literally operating by the seat of their pants there are just two areas where the negro seeking aid might encounter difficulty there are some cities where the local government has chosen to act as the distributing agency for the government funds this means local government control of funds and the liberal aspect of the wards might be decreased or increased depending upon the convictions of the local government officials in addition to this there are usually conservative elements of the business community who bring pressure to bear against such programs this can be quite effective in cases where local administrators of the funds are susceptible to such pressures the second area of difficulty arises around the legitimacy and adequacy of the program proposed and the ability of the group involved to demonstrate that they have assets totaling per cent of the amount requested but assuming that a group of interested citizens have a serious and well planned proposal that meets a definite need of their community in the pertinent areas listed under the various titles then they should encounter no great difficulty in getting fair consideration for their proposals i say this even though i mentioned previously that there might be cases where conservative forces are at work these elements can be discounted a bit at this time because like the federal agency the local agency also has to award its money in order to get more for the next fiscal year so it behooves them to forget conservative considerations in the interest of anticipated increases in funds having attempted to show that generally speaking such funds are readily available to negroes the next step would be to explain something of the mechanics involved in getting the money the proposed organization must be a private nonprofit organization or a part of the existing local government structure in the case of a private group they would have to incorporate themselves as a private nonprofit agency the next step would be to organize the goals and ideals that the group wishes to accomplish following this should be a budget that would list the amount of funds needed to execute the proposed program for the next year all of this and other pertinent data should be submitted to the federal or local government agency handling the program heading under which the project falls in the case of the federal agency the usual procedure is for the agency to review the request and deciding favorably on it it would then make a small program development grant which would allow the new group to get better organized and consult with a counselor trom the agencyinquestion about the proposed program after this hurdle has been successfully cleared there usually follows a grant for the remainder of the approved request this is called a conduct and administration grant now the group is in business as previously mentioned the organizing group must show that it has assets of per cent of the total requested this doesnt necessarily have to be in the nature of cash it can be any tangible asset like equipment office space or free talent at the present the per cent aspect is rather liberally interpreted for two years the government will award up to per cent of the funds after two years the government at its discretion can maintain this relationship but more usually the relationship will gravitate to more exact and detailed advice and information can readily be gotten from the agency that administers the area under which the proposed program falls but now is definitely the most favorable time for negroes to attempt to get their proper portion of help under this program there are certain factors that are operating now that will eventually resolve themselves and accompanying them may also be the more liberal elements that now exist here is an opportunity for negro organizations to begin to take care of their own problems it is an unparalleled opportunity for negroes to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and compassion for their own people how long this chance remains with us depends on how effectively and dramatically we make our desires known and feltnow why wait the late insurrection in southampton has greatly excited the public mind and led to a thousand idle exaggerated and mischievous reports it is the first instance in our history of an open rebellion of the slaves and attended with such atrocious circumstances of cruelty and destruction as could not fail to leave a deep impression not only upon the minds of the community where this fearful tragedy was wrought but throughout every portion of our country in which this population is to be found public curiosity has been on the stretch to understand the origin and progress of this dreadful conspiracy and the motives which influences its diabolical actors the insurgent slaves had all been destroyed or apprehended tried and executed with the exception of the leader without revealing anything at all satisfactory as to the motives which governed them or the means by which they expected to accomplish their object every thing connected with this sad affair was wrapt in mystery until nat turner the leader of this ferocious band whose name has resounded throughout our widely extended empire was captured this great bandit was taken by a single individual in a cave near the residence of his late owner on sunday the thirtieth of october without attempting to make the slightest resistance and on the following day safely lodged in the jail of the county his captor was benjamin phipps with a shot gun well charged nats only weapon was a small light sword which he immediately surrendered and begged that his life might be spared since his confinement by permission of the jailor i have had ready access to him and finding that he was willing to make a full and free confession of the origin progress and consummation of the insurrectory movements of the slaves of which he was the contriver and head i determined for the gratification of public curiosity to commit his statements to writing and publish them with little or no variation from his own words that this is a faithful record of his confessions the annexed certificate of the county court of southampton will attest they certainly bear one stamp of truth and sincerity he makes no attempt as all the other insurgents who were examined did to exculpate himself but frankly acknowledges his full participation in all the guilt of the transaction he was not only the contriver of the conspiracy but gave the first blow towards its execution it will thus appear that whilst every thing upon the surface of society wore a calm and peaceful aspect whilst not one note of preparation was heard to warn the devoted inhabitants of woe and death a gloomy fanatic was revolving in the recesses of his own dark bewildered and overwrought mind schemes of indiscriminate massacre of the whitesschemes too fearfully executed as far as his fiendish band proceeded in their desolating march no cry for mercy penetrated their flinty bosoms no acts of remembered kindness made the least impression upon these remorseless murderers men women and children from hoary age to helpless infancy were involved in the same cruel fate never did a band of savages do their work of death more unsparingly apprehension for their own personal safety seems to have been the only principle of restraint in the whole course of their bloody proceedings and it is not the least remarkable feature in this horrid transaction that a band actuated by such hellish purposes should have resisted so feebly when met by the whites in arms desperation alone one would think might have led to greater efforts more than twenty of them attacked dr blunts house on tuesday morning a little before daybreak defended by two men and three boys they fled precipitately at the first fire and their future plans of mischief were entirely disconcerted and broken up escaping thence each individual sought his own safety either in concealment or by returning home with the hope that his participation might escape detection and all were shot down in the course of a few days or captured and brought to trial and punishment nat has survived all his followers and the gallows will speedily close his career his own account of the conspiracy is submitted to the public without comment it reads an awful and it is hoped a useful lesson as to the operations of a mind like his endeavoring to grapple with things beyond its reach how it first became bewildered and confounded and finally corrupted and led to the conception and perpetration of the most atrocious and heartrending deeds it is calculated also to demonstrate the policy of our laws in restraint of this class of our population and to induce all those entrusted with their execution as well as our citizens generally to see that they are strictly and rigidly enforced each particular community should look to its own safety whilst the general guardians of the laws keep a watchful eye over all if nats statements can be relied on the insurrection in this county was entirely local and his designs confided but to a few and these in his immediate vicinity it was not instigated by motives of revenge or sudden anger but the results of long deliberation and a settled purpose of mind the offspring of gloomy fanaticism acting upon materials but too well prepared for such impressions it will be long remembered in the annals of our country and many a mother as she presses her infant darling to her bosom will shudder at the recollections of nat turner and his band of ferocious miscreants believing the following narrative by removing doubts and conjectures from the public mind which otherwise must have remained would give general satisfaction it is respectfully submitted to the public by their obedient servant agreeable to his own appointment on the evening he was committed to prison with permission of the jailor i visited nat on tuesday the st november when without being questioned at all he commenced his narrative in the following words siryou have asked me to give a history of the motives which induced me to undertake the late insurrection as you call it to do so i must go back to the days of my infancy and even before i was born i was thirtyone years of age the d of october last and born the property of benj turner of this country in my childhood a circumstance occurred which made an indelible impression on my mind and laid the groundwork of that enthusiasm which has terminated so fatally to many both white and black and for which i am about to atone at the gallows it is here necessary to relate this circumstancetrifling as it may seem it was the commencement of that belief which has grown with time and even now sir in this dungeon helpless and forsaken as i am i cannot divest myself of being at play with other children when three or four years old i was telling them something which my mother overhearing said it had happened before i was born i stuck to my story however and related some things which went in her opinion to confirm it others being called on were greatly astonished knowing that these things had happened and caused them to say in my hearing i surely would be a prophet as the lord had shown me things that had happened before my birth and my father and mother strength ened me in this my first impression saying in my presence i was intended for some great purpose which they had always thought from certain marks on my head and breasta parcel of excresences which i believe are not at all uncommon particularly among negroes as i have seen several with the same in this case he has either cut them off or they have nearly disappeared my grandmother who was very religious and to whom i was much attached my master who belonged to the church and other religious persons who visited the house and whom i often saw at prayers noticing the singularity of my manners i suppose and my uncommon intelligence for a child remarked i had too much sense to be raised and if i was i would never be of any service to any one as a slave to a mind like mine restless inquisitive and observant of everything that was passing it is easy to suppose that religion was the subject to which it would be directed and although this subject principally occupied my thoughts there was nothing that i saw or heard of to which my attention was not directed the manner in which i learned to read and write not only had great influence on my own mind as i acquired it with the most perfect ease so much so that i have no recollection whatever of learning the alphabet but to the astonishment of the family one day when a book was shown me to keep me from crying i began spelling the names of the different objects this was a source of wonder to all in the neighborhood particularly the blacks and this learning was constantly improved at all opportunities when i got large enough to go to work while employed i was reflecting on many things that would present themselves to my imagination and whenever an opportunity occurred of looking at a book when the school children were getting their lessons i would find many things that the fertility of my own imagination had depicted to me before all my time not devoted to my masters service was spent either in prayer or in making experiments in casting different things in moulds made of earth in attempting to make paper gunpowder and many other experiments that although i could not perfect yet convinced me of its practicability if i had the means i was not addicted to stealing in my youth nor have ever been yet such was the confidence of the negroes in the neighborhood even at this early period of my life in my superior judgment that they would often carry me with them when they were going on any roguery to plan for them growing up among them with this confidence in my superior judgment and when this in their opinions were perfected by divine inspiration from the circumstances already alluded to in my infancy and which belief was ever afterwards zealously inculcated by the austerity of my life and manners which became the subject of remark by white and black having soon discovered to be great i must appear so and therefore studiously avoided mixing in society and wrapped myself in mystery devoting my time to fasting and prayer by this time having arrived to mans estate and hearing the scriptures commented on at meetings i was struck with that particular passage which says seek ye the kingdom of heaven and all things shall be added unto you i reflected much on this passage and prayed daily for light on this subject as i was praying one day at my plough the spirit spoke to me saying seek ye the kingdom of heaven and all things shall be added unto you questionwhat do you mean by the spirit answerthe spirit that spoke to the prophets in former days and i was greatly astonished and for two years prayed continually whenever my duty would permit and then again i had the same revelation which fully confirmed me in the impression that i was ordained for some great purpose in the hands of the almighty several years rolled round in which many events occurred to strengthen me in this my belief at this time i reverted in my mind to the remarks made of me in my childhood and the things that had been shown me and as it had been said of me in my childhood by those by whom i had been taught to pray both white and black and in whom i had the greatest confidence that i had too much sense to be raised and if i was i would never be of any use as a slave now finding i had arrived to mans estate and was a slave and these revelations being made known to me i began to direct my attention to this great object to fulfil the purpose for which by this time i felt assured was intended knowing the influence i had obtained over the minds of my fellowservants not by the means of conjuring and such like tricks for to them i always spoke of such things with contempt but by the communion of the spirit whose revelations i often communicated to them and they believed and said my wisdom came from god i now began to prepare them for my purpose by telling them something was about to happen that would terminate in fulfilling the great promise that had been made to me about this time i was placed under an overseer from whom i ran away and after remaining in the woods thirty days i returned to the astonishment of the negroes on the plantation who thought i had made my escape to some other part of the country as my father had done before but the reason of my return was that the spirit appeared to me and said i had my wishes directed to the things of this world and not to the kingdom of heaven and that i should return to the service of my earthly masterfor he who knoweth his masters will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes and thus have i chastened you and the negroes found fault and murmured against me saying that if they had my sense they would not serve any master in the world and about this time i had a visionand i saw white spirits and black spirits engaged in battle and the sun was darkenedthe thunder rolled in the heavens and blood flowed in streamsand i heard a voice saying such is your luck such you are called to see and let it come rough or smooth you must surely bear it i now withdrew myself as much as my situation would permit from the intercourse of my fellowservants for the avowed purpose of serving the spirit more fully and it appeared to me and reminded me of the things it had already shown me and that it would then reveal to me the knowledge of the elements the revolution of the planets the operation of tides and changes of the seasons after this revelation in the year and the knowledge of the elements being made known to me i sought more than ever to obtain true holiness before the great day of judgment should appear and then i began to receive the true knowledge of faith and from the first steps of righteousness until the last was i made perfect and the holy ghost was with me and said behold me as i stand in the heavens and i looked and saw the forms of men in different attitudes and there were lights in the sky to which the children of darkness gave other names than what they really were for they were the lights of the saviours hands stretched forth from east to west even as they were extended on the cross on calvary for the redemption of sinners and i wondered greatly at these miracles and prayed to be informed of a certainty of the meaning thereof and shortly afterwards while laboring in the field i discovered drops of blood on the corn as though it were dew from heaven and i communicated it to many both white and black in the neighborhood and i then found on the leaves in the woods hieroglyphic characters and numbers with the forms of men in different attitudes portrayed in blood and representing the figures i had seen before in the heavens and now the holy ghost had revealed itself to me and made plain the miracles it had shown me for as the blood of christ had been shed on this earth and had ascended to heaven for the salvation of sinners and was now returning to earth again in the form of dew and as the leaves on the trees bore the impression of the figures i had seen in the heavens it was plain to me that the saviour was about to lay down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men and the great day of judgment was at hand about this time i told these things to a white man etheldred t brantley on whom it had a wonderful effect and he ceased from his wickedness and was attacked immediately with a cutaneous eruption and blood oozed from the pores of his skin and after praying and fasting nine days he was healed and the spirit appeared to me again and said as the saviour had been baptized so should we be alsoand when the white people would not let us be baptized by the church we went down into the water together in the sight of many who reviled us and were baptized by the spirit after this i rejoiced greatly and gave thanks to god and on the th of may i heard a loud noise in the heavens and the spirit instantly appeared to me and said the serpent was loosened and christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men and that i should take it on and fight against the serpent for the time was fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first questiondo you not find yourself mistaken now answerwas not christ crucified and by signs in the heavens that it would make known to me when i should commence the great work and until the first sign appeared i should conceal it from the knowledge of men and on the appearance of the sign the eclipse of the sun last february i should arise and prepare myself and slay my enemies with their own weapons and immediately on the sign appearing in the heavens the seal was removed from my lips and i communicated the great work laid out for me to do to four in whom i had the greatest confidence henry hark nelson and sam it was intended by us to have begun the work of death on the th of july last many were the plans formed and rejected by us and it affected my mind to such a degree that i fell sick and the time passed without our coming to any determination how to commence still forming new schemes and rejecting them when the sign appeared again which determined me not to wait longer since the commencement of i had been living with mr joseph travis who was to me a kind master and placed the greatest confidence in me in fact i had no cause to complain of his treatment to me on saturday evening the th of august it was agreed between henry hark and myself to prepare a dinner the next day for the men we expected and then to concert a plan as we had not yet determined on any hark on the following morning brought a pig and henry brandy and being joined by sam nelson will and jack they prepared in the woods a dinner where about three oclock i joined them questionwhy were you so backward in joining them answerthe same reason that had caused me not to mix with them for years before i saluted them on coming up and asked will how came he there he answered his life was worth no more than others and his liberty as dear to him i asked him if he thought to obtain it he said he would or lose his life this was enough to put him in full confidence jack i knew was only a tool in the hands of hark it was quickly agreed we should commence at home mr j travis on that night and until we had armed and equipped ourselves and gathered sufficient force neither age nor sex was to be spared which was invariably adhered to we remained at the feast until about two hours in the night when we went to the house and found austin they all went to the cider press and drank except myself on returning to the house hark went to the door with an axe for the purpose of breaking it open as we knew we were strong enough to murder the family if they were awaked by the noise but reflecting that it might create an alarm in the neighborhood we determined to enter the house secretly and murder them whilst sleeping hark got a ladder and set it against the chimney on which i ascended and hoisting a window entered and came down stairs unbarred the door and removed the guns from their places it was then observed that i must spill the first blood on which armed with a hatchet and accompanied by will i entered my masters chamber it being dark i could not give a death blow the hatchet glanced from his head he sprang from the bed and called his wife it was his last word will laid him dead with a blow of his axe and mrs travis shared the same fate as she lay in bed the murder of this family five in number was the work of a moment not one of them awoke there was a little infant sleeping in a cradle that was forgotten until we had left the house and gone some distance when henry and will returned and killed it we got here four guns that would shoot and several old muskets with a pound or two of powder we remained some time at the barn where we paraded i formed them in line as soldiers and after carrying them through all the manoeuvers i was master of marched them off to mr salathul francis about six hundred yards distant sam and will went to the door and knocked mr francis asked who was there sam replied it was him and he had a letter for him on which he got up and came to the door they immediately seized him and dragging him out a little from the door he was dispatched by repeated blows on the head there was no other white person in the family we started from there for mrs reeses maintaining the most perfect silence on our march where finding the door unlocked we entered and murdered mrs reese in her bed while sleeping her son awoke but it was only to sleep the sleep of death he had only time to say who is that and he was no more from mrs reeses we went to mrs turners a mile distant which we reached about sunrise on monday morning henry austin and sam went to the still where finding mr peebles austin shot him and the rest of us went to the house as we approached the family discovered us and shut the door vain hope will with one stroke of his axe opened it and we entered and found mrs turner and mrs newsome in the middle of the room almost frightened to death will immediately killed mrs turner with one blow of his axe i took mrs newsome by the hand and with the sword i had when i was apprehended i struck her several blows over the head but not being able to kill her as the sword was dull will turning around and discovering it dispatched her also a general destruction of property and search for money and ammunition always succeeded the murders by this time my company amounted to fifteen and nine men mounted who started for mrs whiteheads the other six were to go through a byway to mr bryants and rejoin us at mrs whiteheads as we approached the house we discovered mr richard whitehead standing in the cotton patch near the lane fence we called him over into the lane and will the executioner was near at hand with his fatal axe to send him to an untimely grave as we pushed on to the house i discovered some one run around the garden and thinking it was some of the white family i pursued them but finding it was a servant girl belonging to the house i returned to commence the work of death but they whom i left had not been idle all the family were already murdered but mrs whitehead and her daughter margaret as i came round to the door i saw will pulling mrs whitehead out of the house and at the step he nearly severed her head from her body with his broad axe miss margaret when i discovered her had concealed herself in the corner formed by the projection of the cellar cap from the house on my approach she fled but was soon overtaken and after repeated blows with the sword i killed her by a blow on the head with a fence rail by this time the six who had gone by mr bryants rejoined us and informed me they had done the work of death assigned them we again divided part going to mr richard porters and from thence to nathaniel francis the others to mr howell harris and mr t doyles on my reaching mr porters he had escaped with his family i understood there that the alarm had already spread and i immediately returned to bring up those sent to mr doyles and mr howell harristhe party i left going on to mr francis having told them i would join them in that neighborhood i met those sent to mr doyles and mr harris returning having met mr doyle on the road and killed him and learning from some who joined them that mr harris was from home i immediately pursued the course taken by the party gone on before but knowing they would complete the work of death and pillage at mr francis before i could get there i went to mr peter edwards expecting to find them there but they had been here also i then went to mr john t barrows they had been here and murdered him i pursued on their track to capt newit harris where i found the greater part mounted and ready to start the men now amounting to about forty shouted and hurrahed as i rode up some were in the yard loading their guns others drinking they said captain harris and his family had escaped the property in the house they destroyed robbing him of money and other valuables i ordered them to mount and march instantly this was about nine or ten oclock monday morning i proceeded to mr levi wallers two or three miles distant i took my station in the rear and as it was my object to carry terror and devastation wherever we went i placed fifteen or twenty of the best armed and most to be relied on in front who generally approached the houses as fast as their horses could run this was for two purposesto prevent their escape and strike terror to the inhabitants on this account i never got to the houses after leaving mrs whiteheads until the murders were committed except in one case i some times got in sight in time to see the work of death completed viewed the mangled bodies as they lay in silent satisfaction and immediately started in quest of other victims having murdered mrs waller and ten children we started for mr william williams having killed him and two little boys that were there while engaged in this mrs williams fled and got some distance from the house but she was pursued overtaken and compelled to get up behind one of the company who brought her back and after showing her the mangled body of her lifeless husband she was told to get down and lay by his side where she was shot dead i then started for mr jacob williams where the family were murdered here we found a young man named drury who had come on business with mr williams he was pursued overtaken and shot mrs vaughans was the next place we visited and after murdering the family here i determined on starting for jerusalem our number amounted now to fifty or sixty all mounted and armed with guns axes swords and clubs on reaching mr james w parkers gate immediately on the road leading to jerusalem and about three miles distant it was proposed to me to call there but i objected as i knew he was gone to jerusalem and my object was to reach there as soon as possible but some of the men having relations at mr parkers it was agreed that they might call and get his people i remained at the gate on the road with seven or eight the others going across the field to the house about half a mile off after waiting some time for them i became impatient and started to the house for them and on our return we were met by a party of white men who had pursued our bloodstained track and who had fired on those at the gate and dispersed them which i knew nothing of not having been at that time rejoined by any of them immediately on discovering the whites i ordered my men to halt and form as they appeared to be alarmed the white men eighteen in number approached us in about one hundred yards when one of them fired this was against the positive orders of captain alexander p peete who commanded and who had directed the men to reserve their fire until within thirty paces and i discovered about half of them retreating i then ordered my men to fire and rush on them the few remaining stood their ground until we approached within fifty yards when they fired and retreated we pursued and overtook some of them who we thought we left dead they were not killed after pursuing them about two hundred yards and rising a little hill i discovered they were met by another party and had halted and were reloading their guns this was a small party from jerusalem who knew the negroes were in the field and had just tied their horses to await their return to the road knowing that mr parker and family were in jerusalem but knew nothing of the party that had gone in with captain peete on hearing the firing they immediately rushed to the spot and arrived just in time to arrest the progress of these barbarous villians and save the lives of their friends and fellowcitizens thinking that those who retreated first and the party who fired on us at fifty or sixty yards distant had all only fallen back to meet others with ammunition as i saw them reloading their guns and more coming up than i saw at first and several of my bravest men being wounded the others became panicstruck and squandered over the field the white men pursued and fired on us several times hark had his horse shot under him and i caught another for him as it was running by me five or six of my men were wounded but none left on the field finding myself defeated here i instantly determined to go through a private way and cross the nottoway river at the cypress bridge three miles below jerusalem and attack that place in the rear as i expected they would look for me on the other road and i had a great desire to get there to procure arms and ammunition after going a short distance in this private way accompanied by about twenty men i overtook two or three who told me the others were dispersed in every direction after trying in vain to collect a sufficient force to proceed to jerusalem i determined to return as i was sure they would make back to their old neighborhood where they would rejoin me make new recruits and come down again on my way back i called at mrs thomas mrs spencers and several other places the white families having fled we found no more victims to gratify our thirst for blood we stopped at maj ridleys quarter for the night and being joined by four of his men with the recruits made since my defeat we mustered now about forty strong after placing out sentinels i laid down to sleep but was quickly roused by a great racket starting up i found some mounted and others in great confusion one of the sentinels having given the alarm that we were about to be attacked i ordered some to ride round and reconnoitre and on their return the others being more alarmed not knowing who they were fled in different ways so that i was reduced to about twenty again with this i determined to attempt to recruit and proceed to rally in the neighborhood i had left dr blunts was the nearest house which we reached just before day on riding up the yard hark fired a gun we expected dr blunt and his family were at maj rileys as i know there was a company of men there the gun was fired to ascertain if any of the family were at home we were immediately fired upon and retreated leaving several of my men i do not know what became of them as i never saw them afterwards pursuing our course back and coming in sight of captain harris where we had been the day before we discovered a party of white men at the house on which all deserted me but two jacob and nat we concealed ourselves in the woods until near night when i sent them in search of henry sam nelson and hark and directed them to rally all they could at the place we had had our dinner the sunday before where they would find me and i accordingly returned there as soon as it was dark and remained until wednesday evening when discovering white men riding around the place as though they were looking for some one and none of my men joining me i concluded jacob and nat had been taken and compelled to betray me on this i gave up all hope for the present and on thursday night after having supplied myself with provisions from mr travis i scratched a hole under a pile of fence rails in a field where i concealed myself for six weeks never leaving my hiding place but for a few minutes in the dead of night to get water which was very near thinking by this time i could venture out i began to go about in the night and eavesdrop the houses in the neighborhood pursuing this course for about a fortnight and gathering little or no intelligence afraid of speaking to any human being and returning every morning to my cave before the dawn of day i know not how long i might have led this life if accident had not betrayed me a dog in the neighborhood passing by my hidingplace one night while i was out was attracted by some meat i had in my cave and crawled in and stole it and was coming out just as i returned a few nights after two negroes having started to go hunting with the same dog and passed that way the dog came again to the place and having just gone out to walk about discovered me and barked on which thinking myself discovered i spoke to them to beg concealment on making myself known they fled from me knowing then they would betray me i immediately left my hiding place and was pursued almost incessantly until i was taken a fortnight afterwards by mr benjamin phipps in a little hole i had dug out with my sword for the purpose of concealment under the top of a fallen tree on mr phipps discovering the place of my concealment he cocked his gun and aimed at me i requested him not to shoot and i would give up upon which he demanded my sword i delivered it to him and he brought me to prison during the time i was pursued i had many hairbreadth escapes which your time will not permit me to relate i am here loaded with chains and willing to suffer the fate that awaits me i here proceeded to make some inquiries of him after assuring him of the certain death that awaited him and that concealment would only bring destruction on the innocent as well as the guilty of his own color if he knew of any extensive or concerted plan his answer was i do not when i questioned him as to the insurrection in north carolina happening about the same time he denied any knowledge of it and when i looked him in the face as though i would search his inmost thoughts he replied i see sir you doubt my word but can you not think the same ideas and strange appearances about this time in the heavens might prompt others as well as myself to this undertaking i now had much conversation with and asked him many questions having forborn to do so previously except in the cases noted in parenthesis but during his statement i had unnoticed by him taken notes as to some particular circumstances and having the advantage of his statement before me in writing on the evening of the third day that i had been with him i began a crossexamination and found his statement corroborated by every circumstance coming within my own knowledge or the confessions of others whom had been either killed or executed and whom he had not seen nor had any knowledge since d of august last he expressed himself fully satisfied as to the impracticability of his attempt it has been said he was ignorant and cowardly and that his object was to murder and rob for the purpose of obtaining money to make his escape it is notorious that he was never known to have a dollar in his life to swear an oath or drink a drop of spirits as to his ignorance he certainly never had the advantages of education but he can read and write it was taught him by his parents and for natural intelligence and quickness of apprehension is surpassed by few men i have ever seen as to his being a coward his reason as given for not resisting mr phipps shows the decision of his character when he saw mr phipps present his gun he said he knew it was impossible for him to escape as the woods were full of men he therefore thought it was better to surrender and trust to fortune for his escape he is a complete fanatic or plays his part most admirably on other subjects he possesses an uncommon share of intelligence with a mind capable of attaining anything but warped and perverted by the influence of early impressions he is below the ordinary stature though strong and active having the true negro face every feature of which is strongly marked i shall not attempt to describe the effect of his narrative as told and commented on by himself in the condemned hole of the prison the calm deliberate composure with which he spoke of his late deeds and intentions the expression of his fiendlike face when excited by enthusiasm still bearing the stains of the blood of helpless innocence about him clothed with rags and covered with chains yet daring to raise his manacled hands to heaven with a spirit soaring above the attributes of man i looked on him and my blood curdled in my veins i will not shock the feelings of humanity nor wound afresh the bosoms of the disconsolate sufferers in this unparalleled and inhuman massacre by detailing the deeds of their fiendlike barbarity there were two or three who were in the power of these wretches had they known it and who escaped in the most providential manner there were two whom they thought they left dead on the field at mr parkers but who were only stunned by the blows of their guns as they did not take time to reload when they charged on them the escape of a little girl who went to school at mr wallers and where the children were collecting for that purpose excited general sympathy as their teacher had not arrived they were at play in the yard and seeing the negroes approach she ran up a dirt chimney such as are common to log houses and remained there unnoticed during the massacre of the eleven that were killed at this place she remained in her hiding place till just before the arrival of a party who were in pursuit of the murderers when she came down and fled to a swamp where a mere child as she was with the horrors of the late scene before her she lay concealed until the next day when seeing a party go up to the house she came up and on being asked how she escaped replied with the utmost simplicity the lord helped her she was taken up behind a gentleman of the party and returned to the arms of her weeping mother miss whitehead concealed herself between the bed and the mat that supported it while they murdered her sister in the same room without discovering her she was afterwards carried off and concealed for protection by a slave of the family who gave evidence against several of them on their trial mrs nathaniel francis while concealed in a closet heard their blows and the shrieks of the victims of these ruthless savages they then entered the closet where she was concealed and went out without discovering her while in this hidingplace she heard two of her women in a quarrel about the division of her clothes mr john t baron discovering them approaching his house told his wife to make her escape and scorning to fly fell fighting on his own threshold after firing his rifle he discharged his gun at them and then broke it over the villain who first approached him but he was overpowered and slain his bravery however saved from the hands of these monsters his lovely and amiable wife who will long lament a husband so deserving of her love as directed by him she attempted to escape through the garden when she was caught and held by one of her servant girls but another coming to her rescue she fled to the woods and concealed herself few indeed were those who escaped their work of death but fortunate for society the hand of retributive justice has overtaken them and not one that was known to be concerned has escaped leroi jones two short plays the toilet and the slave presented together on an evenings bill might indeed be a little much but not we hasten to add for any of the reasons many of the plays critics have advanced the plays are brief tight intense theatrical units exploding with emotion and therefore calculated to elicit heightened emotional response in the audience furthermore the plays deal with unorthodox matter experimentally and they are plainly designed to shock it is not at all surprising that some spectatorscritics among themelected to leave the close quarters of the st marks theatre in the middle of the first play the toilet but a word about the plays action the toilet which opened the evenings entertainment concerns a group of boys in a metropolitan high school and the ordinary gang politics and powerplays complicated by racial antagonisms most of the boys are negroes and a white boy or two seek identification with the gang well integration if you like one of the white boys had scribbled a note to a husky negro who properly resentful manfully proceeds to rebuff this advance with his fists aided and abetted by his negro cohorts the aggrieved negro youth succeeds in leaving his admirer bloody and belittled on the floor of the boys restroom where all the action takes place however when the bell rings and all the boys have run off to their next classes the manly negro returns and gently holds his vanquished white confrere in his arms the action of the slave takes place in a duplex apartment of a professorial white man and his wife while a revolution is raging in the streets outside the revolution is racial and apparently the blacks are winning into the apartment storms one of the black rebels who it turns out is the exhusband of the professors wife father of the two halfcaste daughters sleeping upstairs and leader of the revolution he is brandishing a revolver and murder is clearly in his heart now much of the criticism of these two plays has been directed at the language used by some of the characters in the toilet for in tance a variety of fourletter words usually withheld from publication are heard in virtually every sentence the language is strongly bravado and overemphasized for effect nevertheless it is easy to see that the squeamish may not wish to be subjected to it the rebel leader in the slave employs abusive language like a weapon it slashes still the mature theatergoer should be willing to suppress the reaction against what might seem to him obscenity long enough to evaluate the plays with some degree of objectivity in doing so it is possible that he will discover two plays of considerable power one quite effective in terms of artistic creation the other all but a failure the toilet manages to be arresting and interesting throughout and its evocation of compassion is not confined to the final scene of reconciliation it is important to remember that in the little world on stage through which the playwright is guiding the psychic vision of the audience all is toughness and vanity love except for self is an alien and unwelcome quantity it is a vile place where these young people find themselves but they are alive in it the slave is neither arresting nor ultimately very interesting despite the raging war without and the cruel violence within there is too much talk and much of it sounds irrelevant after awhile in the end one from the slave is left with the taste of anger ana with no memory of any of the characters humanity the slave also suffered by being the second play on the bill slower in pace deeper in symbol and meaning it might have gained by being considered firstbefore the audiences energies had been milked and it is altogether possible that the slave needs three acts rather than one in which to establish its premises and develop its points for what it would say remains of great importance in his second novel a drop of patience doubleday william melvin kelley recreates the night world of cabarets and musicians with economy and skill even though he is restricted to the sensations of the blind musician ludlow washington creator of a new jazz style however it is not ludlows music which is central in the novel but his relationships with women his first and humiliating experience with sex is with malveen a prostitute his marriage with ettasue fails ragan an educated white woman who lives with him is afraid to marry him finally a negro college girl attaches herself to him in all these relation hips there is misunderstanding blindness on their part to his needs and his own blindness in not knowing how much or how little he can expect of them kelley has written an absorbing novel in which he ranges from the eerie atmosphere of the first chapter where ludlow is left in a home for blind children and a boy claims him as his slave to the deadpan humor of a party where ludlow puts a fellow musician onto a white southern woman burdened with guiltdudley randall the order we impose upon history is modified by the entrance of new elements within that order this is a quote from william barretts what is existentialism it has particular pertinence to the subject at hand namely dave dexter jrs the jazz story because dexters book does just thatit modifies in some ways the history of jazz as we have known it the past is never really a fixed or completed thing it is always subject to new discoveries or approaches nowhere is this more evident than in the treatment of the history of jazz for the most part the past of jazz has remained relatively fuzzy and unclear probably due to the reluctance of publishers to print books on the subject until there was enough popular demand to make such books sell in the last few years there have been quite a few attempts at histories of jazz strangely enough some of the better ones have come from for eign authors dexter joins a growing group of writers who feel moved to record the development of this particular american art form because the topic is too broad for one man and one work to encompass it is desirable that more people are turning their efforts to this task for only after we have many many versions and views on the subject will there exist enough background for a realistic consensus and consensus is about all one can expect from the history of jazz dexters particularly strong contributions revolve around his knowledge of the kansas city development for years we have heard of kansas city jazz but dexters is perhaps the most thorough analysis of what actually constituted and produced kansas city jazz as a young writer and jazz fan who lived in kansas city at its most strategic and flourishing time jazzically speaking he is able to relate personal experiences about that hitherto vague mecca of an even more vague jazz style another contribution of the book is the chapter on charlie parker reams have been written on the high priest of bop but most such writing on jazz dieties is usually too emotional and biased in content to have much historical value mr dexter breaks away from this with his frank and candid views based upon personal contact with charlie parker and his close associates but just as his pinnacle of achievement in the book concerns one of the creators of modern jazz so the book also reaches one of its low points in the same area statements mr dexter makes would lead one to suspect that he too has a bias he seems to favor the more traditional kinds of jazz to the contemporary music for this he cannot be criticized for this is a matter of personal taste but what is objectionable is his sometimes questionable statements such as this one on miles davis for all his unquestioned musicianship it is obvious why he has achieved so little in all the years he has worked as a leader and recording artist im not sure what mr dexter uses as a yardstick to measure achievement but judged by all of the traditional criteria his statement must ring a bit thin later on he relates that the modern jazz quartet is a combo appealing exclusively to the intellectuals the group had no beat really generally speaking the book moves along pretty well propelled by the momentum of the readers interest and not from any particularly outstanding style in its presentation but it is readable and interesting the book is probably a very useful addition to a jazz collection because it does present us with another competently done work in areas where the author is most at home brooks johnson perhaps the most controversial of the ideologies of twentieth century africa is that of negritude the concept whose basis is the idea of a particular essence common to black people derived from their common african heritage developed among negro intellectuals under french colonial rule and since its inception has inspired vigorous reaction in african circles but the man who has been the most astonished by the extraordinary career of negritude has been its creator the poet aime cesaire it is not surprising that this should be so for when cesaire first used the term in his celebrated long poem cahier dun re tour au pays natal it had no precise ideological content even today cesaire regards it less as a rational and comprehensive system of thought though he readily accepts some of the objective deductions made from it than as a personal stand in the context of his career as a writer and active politician this adventure started in his native island of martinique where he was born in he received his secondary education at the local lycee as a scholarship student and was early revolted by the spectacle of his island poor and miserable for the most part but what revolted him most was the mulatto mentality of his compatriots who under the pressure of colonial rule had come to accept the canons of judgment borrowed from their white overlords and had set up a vicious racial discrimination among themselves cesaire later went on to paris to continue his studies at the lycee louis le grand and later at the ecole normale superieure it was at louis le grand that his intimate friendship with leopold senghor who was a fellow student was to open out a new world of feelings and ideas and to plant in the very centre of his experience what has now become its principal aspect namely the sense of racial belonging when i met senghor i knew myself to be african he recalls together they discovered the writings of the new school of anthropology of frobenius and delaforse who began to contest the theory of inherent black inferiority and later the writings of marcel giraule and father tempels who drew attention to the intense spiritual life of african traditional society dissatisfaction with the french policy of assimilation which was based on an official attitude of contempt for the negro though singling out a few individuals for a kind of whitening process soon developed into a reaction among negro intellectuals a racial consciousness born out of indignation against the exactions and ravages of french colonialism on one hand and a new awareness of the human potential of the black race was to lead cesaire and senghor to found a paper with the collaboration of leon damas at the time an already established writer the paper letudiant noir served as an organ for anticolonialism as well as african culture it was in the midst of this intellectual ferment that in cesaire produced his masterpiece cahier dun re tour au pays natal in which the intense spiritual turmoil of the black intellectual under colonial rule was expressed in the most forceful language for cahier is animated with the bitter wrath of a man who had seen and felt to the remotest nook of being the injustice and indignity of oppression in it cesaire has interiorized the collective drama of his race to such a degree that the poem is no longer the espousal of a cause but rather the assumption of a personal destiny make of me the commissary of its blood make of me the depository of its resentment make of me a man of initiation make of me a man of contemplation but make of me also a man of sowing the cahier is at the same time a protest poema political document evenas well as a personal testament andre breton who met cesaire during the war in martinique where cesaire had returned to teach literature at the local lycee proclaimed the poem no less than the greatest lyrical monument of our age and his judgment has been confirmed by cesaires subsequent literary career which has made him one of the leading poets in the french language today in cesaire was elected a deputy to the french national assembly and later became mayor of fort de france capital of martinique he has since led an active political life as the outspoken spokesman for the french caribbean population in this respect his political programme has been autonomy for the french caribbean a formula for giving the antilles a measure of selfdetermination within the framework of frances departmental constitution for cesaire considers the present arrangement by which the west indian territories are directly administered from paris as a concealed form of colonialism cesaires greatest preoccupation has been decolonization in africa and elsewhere as the only condition for the spiritual development of subject peoples he was a prominent figure at the two congresses organized by presence africaine at the second congress in rome he delivered a paper on the role of the writer in the liberation struggle we must hasten the process of decolonization he said that is to say employ all means to hasten the ripening of a popular consciousness in the same spirit he wrote his famous pamphlet discours sur le colonialisme in which he attacked the pretensions of the colonial enterprise from colonization to civilization the distance is infinite and in advocating the recognition of an independent neoafrican culture he wrote it is not a dead society that we want to revive it is a new society that we need to create a society rich with all the powerful means of modern production and warm with all the ancient fraternitythus cesaires political preoccupation is only a part of a wider problem and his advocacy of the ancient fraternity of african culture is at once affirmation and quest this latter aspect is worked out in the poems where he attempts a revaluation in modern terms through surrealistic imageryof the mystic life of traditional africa as well as an effort at personal identification with its values this is seen in his poem to africa peasant the wind where hulls glide fixes around my face the distant hand of a dream your field in its pillage bursts open with sea monsters that l am helpless to ward off and my gesture is as pure as a forehead of oblivion strike peasant l am your son yet beyond his immediate concern with the regeneration of africa and her farflung sons his ultimate message is that of the universal brotherhood of manas he says there is room for all at the rendezvous of victory for his poetry as a whole is the expression of a vision of a state when humanity will have achieved the rock without dialect the leaf without keep the fragile water without femur in other words when man will have achieved a concordance with a universe restored to its primal purity william had told her to go back to his folk in tennessee when he was gone because there wouldnt be any insurance money and she was too old to work sadie had always listened to william and they had lived together years without getting into trouble but now that summer was coming on and her money running out and william six months in his grave she had got to feeling that she wanted to see something before she passed he had always told her how dangerous it was to see anything beyond the end of your own land or your table and they had lived peaceful this way but she had always known that there was more to see than met her eyes had known it even as a girl walking along the road that went further to nashville when she saw folks in cars riding by with a kind of look in their eyes which said im going someplace where there is something to see it had come into her head lately especially late at night that none in her line of kin had ever seen anything the old people had come up in slavery and momma after poppa got in trouble and was taken away worked for one family all her years she and william did have plans for charles they meant for him to go to the city and work but he had passed in the war and williams people had always farmed just kept quiet and farmed so none of them had ever seen anything unless maybe charles but she didnt mean the kind of seeing things where you got killed she meant something like just looking where you werent noticed where you could just walk around have nothing special to do and maybe learn something that didnt have colored people written on it so when she had gone to the doctors office for her swoledup leg and saw the pictures in life magazine of all those people milling around the fair she knew thats where she had to go william wouldnt like it a bit it went against everything he believed about peaceful living but he was old fashioned and after charles had passed in france he didnt want to hear anything about going anyplace she never argued with william he had cut out a good life for them but she wondered to herself if maybe that wasnt the trouble all along folks not going anywhere and not seeing anything that way a war comes along and you get killed and you never know why it happened sometimes when william complained about not having more money and then laid it up to god she wanted to say were just ignorant william weve never seen anything and dont know anything but william was too good and he prided himself on knowing enough to get by so she didnt say anything and even from the grave he had a powerful influence over her but she had made up her mind to go to the fair if the time came later in the next world when she would have to explain herself to william she would tell him the truth then there would be plenty of time to straighten things out up there meanwhile she couldnt get all those pictures out of her head all those people and all those lights and what they called exhibits where you could look all day and everyone to busy to watch who else was looking which would give her a chance to have eyes for everything and everyone unless others folks had the same idea and she had the money twohundred and forty dollars and twentyone cents it would be enough to get to new york city and then back to tennessee her leg was hurting her quite a bit though and she was worried about all the walking shed have to do but even so so far as she was concerned she was on her way to the fair and she went to bed feeling that all the world was lit up for her to see it then she got this hot pain running from her leg all through her body and she knew she was going to die she cried some for what she was going to miss for what all her people had ever missed and how could she explain to them all up there why she had waited so long to see something then she got sensible and fixed some words in her mind for william who would wonder what had gotten into her head anyway take the first step they said my child is laying down there one foot they say half stuck in a bag of garbage like he had crawled out of it black beans and candy wrappers bones rags and coffee grounds and robert brown on the stoop this street in the morning looks like a burnt mattress after the firemen put the fire out the children burst out of the doors like black seed pods and they take all that glassis it my window that brokeand all those bottles and they smash them up after school when the street is done smoking and stinking the children make knives from the busted springs and jump outbamfrom the doors i saywhooshand they run away with the springs and the glass they got plenty to do all day after school on this floor mrs perez is shouting and hollering she say ay ay and i say she should go back wherever she come from back there her husband or whatever could chase her through all that brush they got down there he could mash her up where the

something i see from here the snow is coming thats right fall down baby cover it all up take the second step robert brown is a smart boy and i dont think hes anything but drunk down there he likes coffee black he likes his cuffs clean and he robbed me from my pocketbook but he never drank before now then he got that little car german but where did they get the money where do they get all the money from when in my life you never could see that kind of sugar my sisters boy he had money too and he was hooked when he was almost a baby and they got him and sent him to the place and he come back and got hooked again and now he lay around on the couch all day and look tired but robert brown is nobodys fool he see them all around here on this street sleepy and scratching theyselves all the long day and leaning up against nothing he laugh he says look at the fools mamma but i dont even look here is gloria screaming again last summer she was throwing herself around in a pink hoop and now she got louie shes standing there so mad shes rocking and shes calling him names and shaking her little butt is she mad or what he say no peace around here at all and he walk off and she laugh now ha ha ha but then i never seen anything like the way after a woman tells a man to get out how she looks when he goes and stand there saying ha ha ha and he dont turn around he walk up the street with his cap just so his hands in his pocket and dont turn around there she is pretending she got her own business too and when he is far from her sight she take off after him walking fast like him and still shaking with it gloria going to find out now if you tell them to go they go i take the third step willie prentice in his life got himself cut six ways and hes fixing up to fight again i see that portorican grinding his teeth and they are going to cut each other right here in the hall now theyre just looking head turning right left slow getting ready but the portorican is going to scream pretty soon like a buzzsaw knives when buddy was little and he cut his toe with the axe our daddy poured kerosene into the cut and took ashes from the stove and poured them over that toe and bound it up with flannel and he got well we stole too from my daddy sewed up eggs in the hems of our coat and went down the road to school and stopped by the store and traded those eggs for stockings and candy on monday we washed on tuesday we ironed on wednesday we scrubbed the floor with potash on thursday we run off and did what we did my little brother buddy he threw a turtle in the fire once and it walked clean out of its shell but robert brown never hurt the cats around here and he took care of that dog till it run off he went to school and learned what he had to and he went to the store and sometimes he polished his own shoes and he watched all the fighting around here and never said nothing and he never went up on the roof with the rest of them to do what they do up there and he never stole from nobody but me once he asked me why they come around sometime and i didnt tell him they looking for colored tail or the stuff i said they was policemen checking up he say checking up on what and i say the city got all these policemen and they got to do something with them i take the fourth step the old women are crowding up on me they step when i stepand i go slow i dont believe robert brown got into a fight he is too fast a boy and he never got mixed up with nobody around here no he say he got his own friends then he brought her around he say this is my mamma and she say hello mrs brown but did she mean mrs brown she never been in a place like this before i could see and she grin all the time and she was with him like white on rice stuck on him grabbing him taking him i say

bacon once and flowers why did she do that she think i dont know anything but bacon get away old women i go down by myself and dont catch hold of my arm because i throw you all down the rest of the stairs i throw you into the street and they didnt see the blood with their own eyes so how they know it is there take the fifth step he take her around in that little car and he wear a white scarf and he shoot out his cuffs like he had to go someplace to learn to do it i told him to be careful and he say i got to learn what did i mean and what do he mean they are crowding up in front of me now but i cant hear what they say because the city is taking up the garbage which they do ten times a day and ten times a night where do we get all this garbage from they crowding up there in front of me but i see whitey got a bottle of texas rum in his back pocket and george he is going to lift it right out like it was a straight splinter they are all looking down at the stoop i push them away easy because they made of sticks they weak i can see him hes laying there and his foot is half stuck in a bag of garbage like they said is he drunk because i dont see that blood robert brownrobert brown are you drunk boy red top and i share a tworoom apartment out here in nothing weve lived here for two years and will probably stay put until they raise the rent or until a highway comes through or some kind of urban renewal its a nice place if you like old obsolete buildings and substandard living we used to have a cat here about a year ago but the rats chased him away we used to wash walls and windows and sweep the place once in a while too but it just gets that way again so whats the use i remember how it looked when we moved in and how we put black flag down all around the rooms every night before we went to bed until the people in the other apartments complained that we were disturbing the equal distribution of roaches and threatened to kick us out of here if we didnt accept our share of the bastards and stop trying to be such aristocrats we live in a democracy out here and we didnt want to make enemies of our neighbors so we accepted our quota and learned to live with them we havent learned to eat them yet we eat just about everything else but not these slimy little companions red top is my roommate and quite obviously hes a negro he has a real name but ive forgotten it i guess hes what youd call a handsome man about eight inches over five feet pounds a head full of nappy red hair gray eyes that slant upward slightly and practically no beard at all he manages to stay in pretty good shape for his age and hes quite popular he never has to buy any he says i should be half so lucky my checks might go a lot farther if i didnt have to pass a little around among the ladies lingerie lounges and at supermarkets for that occasional loaf of bread or bottle of wine from time to time i get most it backin time ill get it all back from them people like red top and sometimes they come by to visit and bring little things for us red top gets out more than i do sometimes he stays out all day once they locked him up for two weeks as a material witness in a murder trial i thought he was dead it seemed like a logical assumption to me he didnt come home so he must have been dead i was a little disappointed when he finally returned because i had already cashed his check and spent most of it he was disturbed about this he was angry with me hes a pretty vicious guy sometimes i had to get a job to pay him back two weeks he made me work just for money and then he made me pay the rent myself we understand each other though and the arrangement works pretty good most of the time red top is not a native of the city is anybody he was born on a farm the son of a sharecropper who was the son of a sharecropper who was the son of a slavethe son of a white mans slave the son of a son of a bitch he got a chance to break away from home during the big war when he was drafted into the army as a cook and after he had helped free the rest of the world he came back home to become a modernday slave in the great usa he fought the old ways for a while joining every group that promised him equality and freedom but always ended up being investigated by the feds for membership in a subversive organization any damn organization with letters is communist inspired and any movement to correct an existing deformity is communist inspired and any outspoken critic of the good old american way whatever the hell that is is stamped and sealed communistic and red top was one of the hottest communistic noncommunist in the usa they shook him up so he was afraid to sign his name on a pledge card in church he was smart aggressive and on the way up good job and all but he wanted to charge out in front of the ranks carrying the flag of the cause and he did and when he looked around for the rest of the troops they were miles behind him and nobody was near to defend him when they pulled the flag away and cut him up in little pieces and left him for deadand left him dead spiritually without substance without soul dead he drifted around the country for a few years after that sleeping where he could and living from time to time but dying away a little more every day we bumped into each other one day outside the cutrate liquor store we were both standing outside waiting for one of the guys to come out with a bottle of wine and let us have a taste when three little punks appeared with a basket of bottles they had collected throughout the neighborhood and brought to the store to cash in for the grand deposit when the kids came out i took their basket and started to enmass my own personal fortune red top followed me down the alley we struck up a conversation joined forces and spent the afternoon talking about nothing and the effect it has on the rest of the city and searching for bottles the kids had stripped the alleys cleanwe could find only a half dozen bottles scarcely enough for a bottle and a loaf of bread when we got back to the store there was a pop truck parked at the curb the driver and his helper were inside restocking the place when we hit on the idea to take the empties right off the truck you get the bottles and ill watch these cats red top said and i began unloading the truck as id take a case off the truck id hurry around to the side of the building and hide it among the boxes piled there i got twenty cases of empties before red top alerted me after the truck left we carried the cases down the alley and stacked them where theyd be safe for a while and then returned to the store with enough bottles for two pints of wine we turned in a few others at the grocery store and got bologna and bread the idea to buy food was red tops i wanted to drink it all up but hes the kind of guy who has to take care of his stomach since its all fouled up i sort of felt he had the right idea but it was a strange feeling to spend money for food instead of begging for itbuy what you want and beg for what you need thats been our philosophy out here for generations its always worked why should i suddenly have to buy food when its out there if you stand long enough and put it on real strong for some goodnatured chump weve got all kinds of dogooders walking around just praying to find somebody begging for a meal but they always have to give you a lecture the bastards its not enough that you say thank you hell no they want some assurance that youre not going to buy wine they want to ease their conscience because they cant stand the sight of you and though they want to take you to a restaurant and buy a dinner for you its just too much to ask that they should have to socialize with you theyre feeding you and thats enough they keep telling themselves so they say it just before they drop the money in your hand of course they drop it you think they want to touch your hand and it always sounds the same way now youre sure you wont use this to buy yourself a drink or they say now get something to eat and you stand there smiling and lying and agreeing to anything they say so theyll let go of the change and drop it into your crummy black hand and you can take off and get some bread and cheeze or bologna or a cup of coffee and most of all a pint of something thats really drinkable they dont give you that much though just nickels and dimes just small change to help ease their conscience once in a while theyll try to proposition you too like the cat who asked me to go to bed with his sister so he could watch us she was a nut about negroesshe was a nut about menand he was another kind of nut who was nuts about her being nuts about negroes it takes all kinds and then there was the old lady about nine hundred years old and the little fairy hes always around hes a safety valve for some of us and all kinds of weird people so red top and i got along pretty good we got on relief about the same time and moved into this crummy place and have been here ever since at first i used to go out and find odd jobs but that got to be too laborious and i decided to just stay home sometimes i write sometimes i read most of the time i get drunkthats making sense out of life red top worked for a while but the welfare officer caught up with him and was taking fifty percent of his pay as a kickback and red top said to hell with him why should the white man get rich off him he quit the job and now just takes it easy like me and has a little hustle going at night down the street in one of the houses he sort of sees to it that the girls are properly protected before during and after i think thats why he never has to buy it he says its not true but i know it ishes not that good nobody is everybody has to pay sooner or later everybody has to pay its sort of a quiet life we lead here no television or radio to distract us from our thoughts and dreams and drinks for a long time we had a rather interesting schedule for the first week of the money what with money being plentiful and dwindling away to absolutely nothing by the middle of the monthbeginning with monday as the first day to find out what had taken place over the weekend wed start out at marovitz grocery store standing in front of the meat counter listening to the women relate their long narratives about susans kitchenette whippin this applies strictly to adults fighting not children to sams encounter with the book who never pays on time all the way to big p bailing a couple of his girls out of jail and mr marovitz you should have seed her when she came runnin out of her room why she had blood all over her and not a stitch of clothes onnot even well just not a stitch mr marovitz eyes would light up and he would be lost to the story and not see the children stealing sweets for that matter he wouldnt even see me and red top stealing well i sure saw that woman a lady interrupted she bust right into my place and begged me to help her and all the time my husband the damn fool he just standing there smilin like some stupid asshe just smilin and lookin i gave her my housecoat and told her i didnt want no blood on it and i wanted it back wed hang around there until we found where they were holding the inquest thats right the inquest monday without an inquest would have been like monday without daylight it would have been like monday without breathing we had to have an inquest because somebody always got killed over the weekend either by car or knife or gun or heroin or a policeman or falling from a window anything but suicide we dont do that we leave suicide for white people because theyre fragile and cant take it suicide is for the whites because theyve got everything suicide is for the whites because they dont have anything so by monday morning the weekend of drinking had caught up with us and it was a pleasure to sit in a quiet funeral parlor and smell the flowers and listen to the witnesses lie everybody blaming the dead man or woman the flowers were always pretty we got to love this time of the week the clean floors the high ceilings the beautiful flower arrangements the various scents filling the room we got so we enjoyed the damn places so much we started stopping by in the evenings during the middle of the week to see if there was a wake going onthe black pat and mike paying our respects to the bereaved family if we were lucky and didnt look too bad they might invite us by for a drink afterwards we had some swinging wakes sometimes red top would make out with the cats wife or aunt or cousin or maybe even his brother i never made out with anyone but then i never do so thats not too important after leaving the inquest on this first day of the first week of the month our checks in our pockets wed go back to mr marovitz store cash our checks bring the food accounts up to date and head for the hottest spot on the street herbs barber shop everybody was there they loved the place the guys in show business staying at the hotel used the shop as their conversation corner during the day a few of the policy runners with their little books would stop in between deliveries on their runs and joke with the rest of the sitters sitting around living and reliving the weekend before they cut out to start back to the hustle herb was about hes always been about except hes losing his hair now and can no longer stand in front of the mirror combing and pushing his pompand used to be a little on the heavy side before he started playing golf like everybody started playing golf at about the same time because the money got big for all of them at about the same time and the courses began to open up a couple of them anyway and take negroes in on a large scale herb was happy smooth dapper and everyone loved him he had a memory like an elephant and could recall vividly incidents that happened when he first came to the city at the age of nine he knew everybody and didnt seem to be impressed with status one way or the other oh he respected authority and was pleased when someone who grew up with him made the big time but it didnt really move him he just liked people and didnt give a damn where they come from or what line they were in so long as they conducted themselves like gentlemen when they were in his establishment herb had a barber working with him back a few years agowell before that he had three barbers working there but that was during the war when things were really goodand the cat couldnt leave the bottle alone herb wouldnt let his barber drink in the shop so youd see the cat cut a while talk a while cut a while and then step outside and around the corner to a place where he stashed his pint and then come tipping sheepishly back to his customer making some excuse about not being able to get his throat cleared herb would cut his eyes at him and the message would be delivered without words herb would never have said anything in front of the customers the cat used to get so stoned that by oclock he couldnt cut another head and herb would tell him to go home hed come back the next morning apologizing and promising never to do it again and always herb would forgive him things went on like that for a year until herb finally had to let him go and the cat went up and down the street telling everybody what a rotten bastard herb was for kicking him out after the way he had run the shop so efficiently for him and all and the way he used to stay late and see to it that herb would get away for business and how tight herb was for not giving him what he was really worth but instead all he gave him was a kick in the ass you know people believed this guysome of them actually believed him its convenient to believe only what you want to believe sometimes a singer who had made it up the ladder to one of the big clubs downtown would come in and tell stories of things that had happened to him in detroit and new york and philadelphia and san francisco and everyone would sit quietly through each tale and then prime him for another black jack kept us posted on who had hit the numbers and for how much and slick and mr p would argue about who had the best girls cats would come in selling hot shoes and shirts and socks and jackets and coats and furs and cufflinks and all kinds of good buys sometimes red top and i would buy but mostly wed just look the crap over and pass it on to the next cat who would look it over and pass it on to the next who would look it over and somebody was always stopping in to put the quiet touch on herb theyd come in and whisper something in his ear hed nod and run his hand in his pocket and bring out the right amount he had a knack for bringing out just what the guy had asked for and no more and he would nonchalantly slide it into the cats hand with his left hand while his right hand kept cutting and cutting and cutting and the slickemback boys would sit under the dryers with their scalps tingling and their inner souls bursting with anticipation the longing for the waves to be meticulously set by the barber who has grown to be barberbeautician with the advent of the new hair straightening operation called the process now the whole world can have straight hair wed get our monthly haircut and sit around for another hour or two soaking up the stories and then wed cut out for jakes lounge and sit for a while drinking whisky and beer and then drop by the cutrate liquor store for the stockpile of wine take the blood home and hide it from ourselves and then take off for the street with a pint in the back pocket off for the big street stopping in alleys from time to time to taste up and down the street one side and the other pinching butts joking making out trying to make out but youve always got to pay the best we knew how and sharing a wine with the cats who didnt have any because theyd have some sooner or later and we damn sure wanted to be on the list when they started paying back and as always wed get damn good and drunk and end up with some of the reserve supply gone and a babe in the bed whos still drunk she had to be drunk when you woke up or it didnt seem real if you got one who was as sober as you the next morning you didnt trust her you just knew she had taken all of the blood and hid it some place while you were stoned youd wake her up and kick her out of your bed and start tuesday off with a tall glass of ice cold water trying to activate the high and get it going again without drinking any of your blood it never worked though so youd have to start in again in order to remain stable and steady in his new book who speaks for the negro poetnovelist robert penn warren states the following the italics are added it is selfinterest to want to live in a society operating by the love of justice and the concept of law we have not been living in such a society it is selfinterest to want all members of society to contribute as fully as possible to the enrichment of that society the structure of our society has prevented that it is selfinterest to want to escape from the pressure to conform to values which we feel immoral or antiquated our society has maintained such pressures it is selfinterest to want to escape from the burden of vanity into the hard and happy realization that in the diminishment of others there is a deep diminishment of the self our society has been organized for the diminishment of others more than a half century ago in the souls of black folk w e b dubois called us this happygolucky nation which goes blundering along with its reconstruction tragedies its spanish war interludes and philippine matinees just as though god were really dead a lot has happened since he said that but perhaps god is not dead yet it would be sentimentality to think that our society can be changed easily and without pain it would be worse sentimentality to think that it can be changed without some pain to our particular selvesblack and white it would be realism to think that that pain would be a reasonable price to pay for what we all selfishly might get out of it our own freedom this passage and others like it from mr warrens book is being praised for its wisdom and insight but as mr warren inferred dubois was saying it all a half century ago and james baldwin has been saying it lately how odd that the words take on so much more significance when the hand that holds the pen is white not so very long ago the earth numbered two thousand mil lion inhabitants five hundred million men and one thousand five hundred million natives the former had the word the i others had the use of it between the two there were hired kinglets overlords and a bourgeoisie sham from beginning to end which served as gobetweens in the colonies the truth stood naked but the citizens of the mothercountry preferred it with clothes on the native had to love them something in the way mothers are loved the european elite undertook to manufacture a native elite they picked out promising adolescents they branded them as with a redhot iron with the principles of western culture they stuffed their mouths full with highsounding phrases grand glutinous words that stuck to the teeth after a short stay in the mother country they were sent home whitewashed these walking lies had nothing left to say to their brothers they only echoed from paris from london from amsterdam we would utter the words parthenon brotherhood and somewhere in africa or asia lips would open thenon therhood it was the golden age it came to an end the mouths opened by themselves the yellow and black voices still spoke of our humanism but only to reproach us with our inhumanity we listened without displeasure to these polite statements of resentment at first with proud amazement what they are able to talk by themselves just look at what we have made of them we did not doubt but that they would accept our ideals since they accused us of not being faithful to them then indeed europe could believe in her mission she had hellenized the asians she had created a new breed the grecolatin negroes we might add quite between ourselves as men of the world after all let them bawl their heads off it relieves their feelings dogs that bark dont bite a new generation came on the scene which changed the issue with unbelievable patience its writers and poets tried to explain to us that our values and the true facts of their lives did not hang together and that they could neither reject them completely nor yet assimilate them by and large what they were saying was this you are making us into monstrosities your humanism claims we are at one with the rest of humanity but your racist methods set us apart very much at our ease we listened to them all colonial administrators are not paid to read hegel and for that matter they do not read much of him but they do not need a philosopher to tell them that uneasy consciences are caught up in their own contradictions they will not get anywhere so let us perpetuate their discomfort nothing will come of it but talk if they were the experts told us asking for anything at all precise in their wailing it would be integration of course there is no question of granting that the system which depends on overexploitation as you know would be ruined but its enough to hold the carrot in front of their noses theyll gallop all right as to a revolt we need not worry at all what native in his senses would go off to massacre the fair sons of europe simply to become european as they are in short we encouraged these disconsolate spirits and thought it not a bad idea for once to award the prix goncourt to a negro that was before listen let us waste no time in sterile litanies and nauseating mimicry leave this europe where they are never done talking of man yet murder men everywhere they find them at the corner of every one of their own streets in all the corners of the globe for centuries they have stifled almost the whole of humanity in the name of a socalled spiritual experience the tone is new who dares to speak thus it is an african a man from the third world an exnative he adds europe now lives at such a mad reckless pace that she is running headlong into the abyss we would do well to keep away from it in other words shes done for a truth which is not pleasant to state but of which we are all convinced are we not felloweuropeans in the marrow of our bones we must however make one reservation when a frenchman for example says to other frenchmen the country is done forwhich has happened i should think almost every day since it is emotional talk burning with love and fury the speaker includes himself with his fellowcountrymen and then usually he adds unless his meaning is clear no more mistakes must be made if his instructions are not carried out to the letter then and only then will the country go to pieces in short it is a threat followed by a piece of advice and these remarks are so much the less shocking in that they spring from a national intersubjectivity but on the contrary when fanon says of europe that she is rushing to her doom far from sounding the alarm he is merely setting out a diagnosis this doctor neither claims that she is a hopeless case miracles have been known to existnor does he give her the means to cure herself he certifies that she is dying on external evidence founded on symptoms that he can observe as to curing her no he has other things to think about he does not give a damn whether she lives or dies because of this his book is scandalous and if you murmur jokingly embarrassed he has it in for us the true nature of the scandal escapes you for fanon has nothing in it for you at all his workredhot for some in what concerns you is as cold as ice he speaks of you often never to you the black goncourts and the yellow nobels are finished the days of colonized laureats are over an exnative frenchspeaking bends that language to new requirements makes use of it and speaks to the colonized only natives of all underdeveloped countries unite what a downfall for the fathers we alone were the speakers the sons no longer even consider us as valid intermediaries we are the objects of their speeches of course fanon mentions in passing our wellknown crimes setif hanoi madagascar but he does not waste his time in condemning them he uses them if he demonstrates the tactics of colonialism the complex play of relations which unite and oppose the colonists to the people of the mother country it is for his brothers his aim is to teach them to beat us at our own game in short the third world finds itself and speaks to itself through his voice we know that it is not a homogeneous world we know too that enslaved peoples are still to be found there together with some who have achieved a simulacrum of phoney independence others who are still fighting to attain sovereignty and others again who have obtained complete freedom but who live under the constant menace of imperialist aggression these differences are bom of colonial history in other words of oppression here the mother country is satisfied to keep some feudal rulers in her pay there dividing and ruling she has created a native bourgeosie sham from beginning to end elsewhere she has played a double game the colony is planted with settlers and exploited at the same time thus europe has multiplied divisions and opposing groups has fashioned classes and sometimes even racial prejudices and has endeavoured by every means to bring about and intensify the stratification of colonised societies fanon hides nothing in order to fight against us the former colony must fight against itself or rather the two struggles form part of a whole in the heat of battle all internal barriers break down the puppet bourgeoisie of businessmen and shopkeepers the urban proletariat which is always in a privileged position the lumpenproletariat of the shanty townsall fall into line with the stand made by the rural masses that veritable reservoir of a national revolutionary army for in those countries where colonialism has deliberately held up development the peasantry when it rises quickly stands out as the revolutionary class for it knows naked oppression and suffers far more from it than the workers in the towns and in order not to die of hunger it demands no less than a complete demolishing of all existing structures in order to triumph the national revolution must be socialist if its career is cut short if the native bourgeoisie takes over power the new state in spite of its formal sovereignty remains in the hands of the imperialists the example of katanga illustrates this quite well thus the unity of the third world is not yet achieved it is a work in progress which begins by the union in each country after independence as before of the whole of the colonised people under the command of the peasant class this is what fanon explains to his brothers in africa asia and latin america we must achieve revolutionary socialism all together everywhere or else one by one we will be defeated by our former masters he hides nothing neither weaknesses nor discords nor mystification here the movement gets off to a bad start there after a striking initial success it loses momentum elsewhere it has come to a standstill and if it is to start again the peasants must throw their bourgeoisie overboard the reader is sternly put on his guard against the most dangerous will o the wisps the cult of the leader and of personalities western culture and what is equally to be feared the withdrawal into the twilight of past african culture for the only true culture is that of the revolution that is to say it is constantly in the making fanon speaks out loud we europeans can hear him as the fact that you hold this book in your hand proves is he not then afraid that the colonial powers may take advantage of his sincerity no he fears nothing our methods are outofdate they can sometimes delay emancipation but not stop it and do not think that we can change our ways neocolonialism that idle dream of mothercountries is a lot of hot air the third forces dont exist or if they do they are only the tinpot bourgeoisies that colonialism has already placed in the saddle our machiavellianism has little purchase on this wideawake world that has run our falsehoods to earth one after the other the settler has only recourse to one thing brute force when he can command it the native has only one choice between servitude or supremacy what does fanon care whether you read his work or not it is to his brothers that he denounces our old tricks and he is sure we have no more up our sleeves it is to them he says europe has laid her hands on our continents and we must slash at her fingers till she lets go its a good moment nothing can happen at bizerta at elizabethville or in the algerian bled that the whole world does not hear about the rival blocks take opposite sides and hold each other in check let us take advantage of this paralysis let us burst into history forcing it by our invasion into universality for the first time let us start fighting and if weve no other arms the waiting knifes enough europeans you must open this book and enter into it after a few steps in the darkness you will see strangers gathered around a fire come close and listen for they are talking of the destiny they will mete out to your tradingcentres and to the hired soldiers who defend them they will see you perhaps but they will go on talking among themselves without even lowering their voices this indifference strikes home their fathers shadowy creatures your creatures were but dead souls you it was who allowed them glimpses of light to you only did they dare speak and you did not bother to reply to such zombies their sons ignore you a fire warms them and sheds light around them and you have not lit it now upcountry in north africa transl at a respectful distance it is you who will feel furtive nightbound and perished with cold turn and turn about in these shadows from whence a new dawn will break it is you who are the zombies in this case you will say lets throw away this book why read it if it is not written for us for two reasons the first is that fanon explains you to his brothers and shows them the mechanism by which we are estranged from ourselves take advantage of this and get to know yourselves seen in the light of truth objectively our victims know us by their scars and by their chains and it is this that makes their evidence irrefutable it is enough that they show us what we have made of them for us to realise what we have made of ourselves but is it any use yet for europe is at deaths door but you will say we live in the mother country and we disapprove of her excesses it is true you are not settlers but you are no better for the pioneers belonged to you you sent them overseas and it was you they enriched you warned them that if they shed too much blood you would disown them or say you did in something of the same way as any state maintains abroad a mob of agitators agents provocateurs and spies whom it disowns when they are caught you who are so liberal and so humane who have such an exaggerated adoration of culture that it verges on affectation you pretend to forget that you own colonies and that in them men are massacred in your name fanon reveals to his comradesabove all to some of them who are rather too westernisedthe solidarity of the people of the mothercountry and of their representatives in the colonies have the courage to read this book for in the first place it will make you ashamed and shame as marx said is a revolutionary sentiment you see i too am incapable of ridding myself of subjective illusions i too say to you all is lost unless as a european i steal the enemys book and out of it i fashion a remedy for europe make the most of it and here is the second reason if you set aside sorels fascist utterances you will find that fanon is the first since engels to bring the processes of history into the clear light of day moreover you need not think that hotheadedness or an unhappy childhood have given him some uncommon taste for violence he acts as the interpreter of the situation thats all but this is enough to enable him to constitute step by step the dialectic which liberal hypocrisy hides from you and which is as much responsible for our existence as for his during the last century the middle classes looked on the workers as covetous creatures made lawless by their greedy desires but they took care to include these great brutes in our own species or at least they considered that they were free menthat is to say free to sell their labour in france as in england humanism claimed to be universal in the case of forced labour it is quite the contrary there is no contract moreover there must be intimidation and thus oppression grows our soldiers overseas rejecting the universalism of the mother country apply the numerous clausus to the human race since none may enslave rob or kill his fellowman without committing a crime they lay down the principle that the native is not one of our fellowmen our strikingpower has been given the mission of changing this abstract certainty into reality the order is given to reduce the inhabitants of the annexed country to the level of superior monkeys in order to justify the settlers treatment of them as beasts of burden violence in the colonies does not only have for its aim the keeping of these enslaved men at arms length it seeks to dehumanise them everything will be done to wipe out their traditions to substitute our language for theirs and to destroy their culture without giving them ours sheer physical fatigue will stupefy them starved and ill if they have any spirit left fear will finish the job guns are levelled at the peasant civilians come to take over his land and force him by dint of flogging to till the land for them if he shows fight the soldiers fire and hes a dead man if he gives in he degrades himself and he is no longer a man at all shame and fear will split up his character and make his inmost self fall to pieces the business is conducted with flying colours and by experts the psychological services werent established yesterday nor was brainwashing and yet in spite of all these efforts their ends are nowhere achieved neither in the congo where negroes hands were cut off nor in angola where until very recently malcontents lips were pierced in order to shut them with padlocks i do not say that it is impossible to change a man into an animal i simply say that you wont get there without weakening him considerably blows will never suffice you have to push the starvation further and thats the trouble with slavery for when you domesticate a member of our own species you reduce his output and however little you may give him a farmyard man finishes by costing more than he brings in for this reason the settlers are obliged to stop the breakinginhalfway the result neither man nor animal is the native beaten undernourished ill terrifiedbut only up to a certain pointhe has whether hes black yellow or white always the same traits of character hes a slyboots a lazybones and a thief who lives on nothing and who understands only violence poor settler here is his contradiction naked shorn of its trappings he ought to kill those he plunders as they say djinns do now this is not possible because he must exploit them as well because he cant carry massacre on to genocide and slavery to animallike degradation he loses control the machine goes into reverse and a relentless logic leads him on to decolonisation but it does not happen immediately at first the europeans reign continues he has already lost the battle but this is not obvious he does not yet know that the natives are only halfnative to hear him talk it would seem that he illtreats them in order to destroy or to repress the evil that they have rooted in them and after three generations their pernicious instincts will reappear no more what instincts does he mean the instincts that urge slaves on to massacre their master can he not here recognise his own cruelty turned against himself in the savagery of these oppressed peasants does he not find his own settlers savagery which they have absorbed through every pore and for which there is no cure the reason is simple this imperious being crazed by his absolute power and by the fear of losing it no longer remembers clearly that he was once a man he takes himself for a horsewhip or a gun he has come to believe that the domestication of the inferior races will come about by the conditioning of their reflexes but in this he leaves out of account the human memory and the ineffaceable marks left upon it and then above all there is something which perhaps he has never known we only become what we are by the radical and deepseated refusal of that which others have made of us three generations did we say hardly has the second generation opened their eyes than from then on theyve seen their fathers being flogged in psychiatric terms they are traumatised for life but these constantly renewed aggressions far from bringing them to submission thrust them into an unbearable contradiction which the european will pay for sooner or later after that when it is their turn to be broken in when they are taught what shame and hunger and pain are all that is stirred up in them is a volcanic fury whose force is equal to that of the pressure put upon them you said they understand nothing but violence of course first the only violence is the settlers but soon they will make it their own that is to say the same violence is thrown back upon us as when our reflection comes forward to meet us when we go towards a mirror make no mistake about it by this mad fury by this bitterness and spleen by their everpresent desire to kill us by the permanent tensing of powerful muscles which are afraid to relax they have become men men because of the settler who wants to make beasts of burden of them because of him and against him hatred blind hatred which is as yet an abstraction is their only wealth the master calls it forth because he seeks to reduce them to animals but he fails to break it down because his interests stop him halfway thus the half natives are still humans through the power and the weakness of the oppressor which is transformed within them into a stubborn refusal of the animal condition we realise what follows theyre lazy of courseits a form of sabotage theyre sly and thieving just imagine but their petty thefts mark the beginning of a resistance which is still unorganised that is not enough there are those among them who assert themselves by throwing themselves barehanded against the guns these are their heros others make men of themselves by murdering europeans and these are shot down brigands or martyrs their agony exalts the terrified masses yes terrified at this fresh stage colonial aggression turns inward in a current of terror among the natives by this i do not only mean the fear that they experience when faced with our inexhaustible means of repression but also that which their own fury produces in them they are cornered between our guns pointed at them and those terrifying compulsions those desires for murder which spring from the depth of their spirits and which they do not always recognise for at first it is not their violence it is ours which turns back on itself and rends them and the first action of these oppressed creatures is to bury deep down that hidden anger which their and our moralities condemn and which is however only the last refuge of their humanity read fanon you will learn how in the period of their helplessness their mad impulse to murder is the expression of the natives collective unconscious if this suppressed fury fails to find an outlet it turns in a vacuum and devastates the oppressed creatures themselves in order to free themselves they even massacre each other the different tribes fight between themselves since they cannot face the real enemyand you can count on colonial policy to keep up their rivalries the man who raises his knife against his brother thinks that he has destroyed once and for all the detested image of their common degradation even though these expiatory victims dont quench their thirst for blood they can only stop themselves from marching against the machineguns by doing our work for us of their own accord they will speed up the dehumanisation that they reject under the amused eye of the settler they will take the greatest precautions against their own kind by setting up supernatural barriers at times reviving old and terrible myths at others binding themselves by scrupulous rites it is in this way that an obsessed person flees from his deepest needsby binding himself to certain observances which require his attention at every turn they dance that keeps them busy it relaxes their painfully contracted muscles and then the dance mimes secretly often without their knowing the refusal they cannot utter and the murders they dare not commit in certain districts they make use of that last resortpossession by spirits formerly this was a religious experience in all its simplicity a certain communion of the faithful with sacred things now they make of it a weapon against humiliation and despair mumbojumbo and all the idols of the tribe come down among them rule over their violence and waste it in trances until it is exhausted at the same time these highplaced personages protect them in other words the colonised people protect themselves against colonial estrangement by going one better in religious estrangement with the unique result that finally they add the two estrangements together and each reinforces the other thus in certain psychoses the hallucinated person tired of always being insulted by his demon one fine day starts hearing the voice of an angel who pays him compliments but the jeers dont stop for all that only from then on they alternate with congratulations this is a defence but it is also the end of the story the self is disassociated and the patient heads for madness let us add for certain other carefully selected unfortunates that other witchery of which i have already spoken western culture if i were them you may say id prefer my mumbojumbo to their acropolis very good youve grasped the situation but not altogether because you arent themor not yet otherwise you would know that they cant choose they must have both two worlds that makes two bewitchings they dance all night and at dawn they crowd into the churches to hear mass each day the split widens our enemy betrays his brothers and becomes our accomplice his brothers do the same thing the status of native is a nervous condition introduced and maintained by the settler among colonised people with their consent laying claim to and denying the human condition at the same time the contradiction is explosive for that matter it does explode you know as well as i do and we are living at the moment when the match is put to the fuse when the rising birthrate brings wider famine in its wake when these newcomers have life to fear rather more than death the torrent of violence sweeps away all barriers in algeria and angola europeans are massacred at sight it is the moment of the boomerang it is the third phase of violence it comes back on us it strikes us and we do not realise any more than we did the other times that its we that have launched it the liberals are stupefied they admit that we were not polite enough to the natives that it would have been wiser and fairer to allow them certain rights in so far as this was possible they ask nothing better than to admit them in batches and without sponsors to that very exclusive club our species and now this barbarous mad outburst doesnt spare them any more than the bad settlers the left at home is embarrassed they know the true situation of the natives the merciless oppression they are submitted to they do not condemn their revolt knowing full well that we have done everything to provoke it but all the same they think to themselves there are limits these guerillas should be bent on showing that they are chivalrous that would be the best way of showing they are men sometimes the left scolds them youre going too far we wont support you any more the natives dont give a damn about their support for all the good it does them they might as well stuff it up their backsides once their war began they saw this hard truth that every single one of us has made his bit has got something out of them they dont need to call anyone to witness theyll grant favoured treatment to no one there is one duty to be done one end to achieve to thrust out colonialism by every means in their power the more farseeing among us will be in the last resort ready to admit this duty and this end but we cannot help seeing in this ordeal by force the altogether inhuman means that these lessthanmen make use of to win the concession of a charter of humanity accord it to them at once then and let them endeavour by peaceful undertakings to deserve it our worthiest souls contain racial prejudice they would do well to read fanon for he shows clearly that this irrepressible violence is neither sound and fury nor the resurrection of savage instincts nor even the effect of resentment it is man recreating himself i think we understood this truth at one time but we have forgotten itthat no gentleness can efface the marks of violence only violence itself can destroy them the native cures himself of colonial neurosis by thrusting out the settler through force of arms when his rage boils over he rediscovers his lost innocence and he comes to know himself in that he himself creates his self far removed from his war we consider it as a triumph of barbarism but of its own volition it achieves slowly but surely the emancipation of the rebel for bit by bit it destroys in him and around him the colonial gloom once begun it is a war that gives no quarter you may fear or be feared that is to say abandon yourself to the disassociations of a sham existence or conquer your birthright of unity when the peasant takes a gun in his hands the old myths grow dim and the prohibitions are one by one forgotten the rebels weapon is the proof of his humanity for in the first days of the revolt you must kill to shoot down a european is to kill two birds with one stone to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time there remain a dead man and a free man the survivor for the first time feels a national soil under his foot at this moment the nation does not shrink from him wherever he goes wherever he may be she is she follows and is never lost to view for she is one with his liberty but after the first surprise the colonial army strikes and then all must unite or be slaughtered tribal dissensions weaken and tend to disappear in the first place because they endanger the revolution but for the more profound reason that they served no other purpose before than to divert violence against false foes when they remainas in the congoits because they are kept up by the agents of colonialism the nation marches forward for each of her children she is to be found wherever his brothers are fighting their feeling for each other is the reverse of the hatred they feel for you they are bothers inasmuch as each of them has killed and may at any moment have to kill again fanon shows his readers the limits of spontaneity and the need for and dangers of organisation but however great may be the task at each turning of the way the revolutionary consciousness deepens the last complexes flee away no one need come to us talking of the dependency complex of an aln soldier c with his blinkers off the peasant takes account of his real needs before they were enough to kill him but he tried to ignore them now he sees them as infinitely great requirements in this violence which springs from the people which enables them to hold out for five yearsfor eight years as the algerians have donethe military political and social necessities cannot be separated the war by merely setting the question of command and responsibility institutes new structures which will become the first institutions of peace here then is man even now established in new traditions the future children of a horrible present here then we see him legitimised by a law which will be bom or is born each day under fire once the last settler is killed shipped home or assimilated the minority breed disappears to be replaced by socialism and thats not enough the rebel does not stop there for you can be quite sure that he is not risking his skin to find himself at the level of a former inhabitant of the old mother country look how patient he is perhaps he dreams of another dien bien phu but dont think hes really counting on it hes a beggar fighting in his poverty against rich men powerfully armed while he is waiting for decisive victories or even without expecting them at all he tires out his adversaries until they are sick of him it will not be without fearful losses the colonial army becomes ferocious the country is marked out there are moppingup operations transfers of population reprisal expeditions and they massacre women and children he knows this this new man begins his life as a man at the end of it he considers himself as a potential corpse he will be killed not only does he accept this risk hes sure of it this potential dead man has lost his wife and his children he has seen so many dying men that he prefers victory to survival others not he will have the fruits of victory he is too weary of it all but this weariness of the heart is the root of an unbelievable courage we find our humanity on this side of death and despair he finds it beyond torture and death we have sown the wind he is the whirlwind the child of violence at every moment he draws from it his humanity we were men at his expense he makes himself man at ours a different man of higher quality here fanon stops he has shown the way forward he is the spokesman of those who are fighting and he has called for union that is to say the unity of the african continent against all dissensions and all particularisms he has gained his end if he had wished to describe in all its details the historical phenomenon of decolonisation he would have to have spoken of us this is not at all his intention but when we have closed the book the argument continues within us in spite of its author for we feel the strength of the peoples in revolt and we answer by force thus there is a fresh moment of violence and this time we ourselves are involved for by its nature this violence is changing us accordingly as the halfnative is changed everyone of us must think for himselfalways provided that he thinks at all for in europe today stunned as she is by the blows received by france belgium or england even to allow your mind to be diverted however slightly is as good as being the accomplice in crime of colonialism this book had not the slightest need of a preface all the less because it is not addressed to us yet i have written one in order to bring the argument to its conclusion for we in europe too are being decolonised that is to say that the settler which is in every one of us is being savagely rooted out let us look at ourselves if we can bear to and see what is becoming of us first we must face that unexpected revelation the striptease of our humanism there you can see it quite naked and its not a pretty sight it was nothing but an ideology of lies a perfect justification for pillage its honeyed words its affectation of sensibility were only alibis for our aggressions a fine sight they are too the believers in nonviolence saying that they are neither executioners nor victims very well then if youre not victims when the government which youve voted for when the army in which your younger brothers are serving without hesitation or remorse have undertaken race murder you are without a shadow of doubt executioners and if you choose to be victims and to risk being put in prison for a day or two you are simply choosing to pull your irons out of the fire but you will not be able to pull them out theyll have to stay there till the end try to understand this at any rate if violence began this very evening and if exploitation and oppression had never existed on the earth perhaps the slogans of nonviolence might end the quarrel but if the whole regime even your nonviolent ideas are conditioned by a thousand yearold oppression your passivity serves only to place you in the ranks of the oppressors you know well enough that we are exploiters you know too that we have laid hands on first the gold and metals then the petroleum of the new continents and that we have brought them back to the old countries this was not without excellent results as witness our palaces our cathedrals and our great industrial cities and then when there was the threat of a slump the colonial markets were there to soften the blow or to divert it crammed with riches europe accorded the human status de jure to its inhabitants with us to be a man is to be an accomplice of colonialism since all of us without exception have profited by colonial exploitation this fat pale continent ends by falling into what fanon rightly calls narcissism cocteau became irritated with paris that city which talks about itself the whole time is europe any different and that supereuropean monstrosity north america chatter chatter liberty equality fraternity love honour patriotism and what have you all this did not prevent us from making antiracial speeches about dirty niggers dirty jews and dirty arabs highminded people liberal or just softhearted protest that they were shocked by such inconsistency but they were either mistaken or dishonest for with us there is nothing more consistent than a racist humanism since the european has only been able to become a man through creating slaves and monsters while there was a native population somewhere this imposture was not shown up in the notion of the human race we found an abstract assumption of universality which served as cover for the most realistic practices on the other side of the ocean there was a race of lessthanhumans who thanks to us might reach our status a thousand years hence perhaps in short we mistook the elite for the genus today the native populations reveal their true nature and at the same time our exclusive club reveals its weaknessthat its neither more nor less than a minority worse than that since the others become men in name against us it seems that we are the enemies of mankind the elite shows itself in its true coloursit is nothing more than a gang our precious sets of values begin to moult on closer scrutiny you wont see one that isnt stained with blood if you are looking for an example remember these fine words how generous france is us generous what about setif then and those eight years of ferocious war which have cost the lives of over a million algerians and the tortures but let it be understood that nobody reproaches us with having been false to suchandsuch a missionfor the very good reason that we had no mission at all it is generosity itself thats in question this fine melodious word has only one meaning the granting of a statutory charter for the folk across the water new men freed men no one has the power nor the right to give anything to anybody for each of them has every right and the right to everything and when one day our human kind becomes fullgrown it will not define itself as the sum total of the whole worlds inhabitants but as the infinite unity of their mutual needs here i stop you will have no trouble in finishing the job all you have to do is to look our aristocratic virtues straight in the face for the first and last time they are cracking up how could they survive the aristocracy of underlings who brought them into being a few years ago a bourgeois colonialist commentator found only this to say in defence of the west we arent angels but we at least feel some remorse what a confession formerly our continent was buoyed up by other means the parthenon chartres the rights of man or the swastika now we know what these are worth and the only chance of our being saved from shipwreck is the very christian sentiment of guilt you can see its the end europe is springing leaks everywhere what then has happened it simply is that in the past we made history and now it is being made of us the ratio of forces has been inverted decolonisation has begun all that our hired soldiers can do is to delay its completion the old mother countries have still to go the whole hog they still have to engage their entire forces in a battle which is lost before it has begun at the end of the adventure we again find that colonial brutality which was bugeauds doubtful glory but though it has been multiplied tenfold its still not enough the national service units are sent to algeria and they remain there seven years with no result violence has changed its direction when we were victorious we practised it without its seeming to alter us it broke down the others but for us men our humanism remained intact united by their profits the peoples of the mother countries baptised their commonwealth of crimes calling them fraternity and love today violence blocked everywhere comes back on us through our soldiers comes inside and takes possession of us involution starts the native recreates himself and we settlers and europeans ultras and liberals we break up rage and fear are already blatant they show themselves openly in the niggerhunts in algiers now which side are the savages on where is barbarism nothing is missing not even the tomtoms the motorhorns beat out algerie frangaise while the europeans bum moslems alive fanon reminds us that not so very long ago a congress of psychiatrists was distressed by the criminal propensities of the native population those people kill each other they said that isnt normal the algerians cortex must be underdeveloped in central africa others have established that the african makes very little use of his frontal lobes these learned men would do well today to follow up their investigations in europe and particularly with regard to the french for we too during the last few years must be victims of frontal sluggishness since our patriots do quite a bit of assassinating of their fellowcountrymen and if theyre not at home they blow up their house and their concierge this is only a beginning civil war is forecast for the autumn or for the spring of next year yet our lobes seem to be in perfect condition is it not rather the case that since we cannot crush the natives violence comes back on its tracks accumulates in the very depths of our nature and seeks a way out the union of the algerian people causes the disunion of the french people throughout the whole territory of the exmothercountry the tribes are dancing their wardances the terror has left africa and is settling here for quite obviously there are certain furious beings who want to make us pay with our own blood for the shame of having been beaten by the native then too there are the others all the others who are equally guilty for after bizerta after the lynchings of september who among them came out into the streets to shout weve had enough but less spectacularthe liberals and the toughs of the tender left the fever is mounting amongst them too and resentment at the same time and they certainly have the wind up they hide their rage in myths and complicated rites in order to stave off the day of reckoning and the need for decision they have put at the head of our affairs a grand magician whose business it is to keep us all in the dark at all costs nothing is being done violence proclaimed by some disowned by others turns in a vacuum one day it bursts out at metz the next at bordeaux its here there and everywhere like in a game of hunt the slipper its our turn to tread the path step by step which leads down to native level but to become natives altogether our soil must be occupied by a formerly colonised people and we must starve of hunger this wont happen for its a discredited colonialism which is taking hold on us this is the senile arrogant master who will straddle us here he comes our mumbojumbo and when you have read fanons last chapter you will be convinced that it would be better for you to be a native at the uttermost depths of his misery than to be a former settler it is not right for a police official to be obliged to torture for ten hours a day at that rate his nerves will fall to bits unless the torturers are forbidden in their own interests to work overtime when it is desirable that the morality of the nation and the army should be protected by the rigours of the law it is not right that the former should systematically demoralise the latter nor that a country with a republican tradition should confide hundreds and thousands of its young folk to the care of putschist officers it is not right my fellowcountrymen you who know very well all the crimes committed in our name its not at all right that you do not breathe a word about them to anyone not even to your own soul for fear of having to stand in judgement on yourself i am willing to believe that at the beginning you did not realise what was happening later you doubted whether such things could be true but now you know and still you hold your tongues eight years of silence what degradation and your silence is all of no avail today the blinding sun of torture is at its zenith it lights up the whole country under that merciless glare there is not a laugh that does not ring false not a face that is not painted to hide fear or anger not a single action that does not betray our disgust and our complicity it is enough today for two french people to meet together for there to be a dead man between them one dead man did i say in other days france was the name of a country we should take care that in it does not become the name of a nervous disease will we recover yes for violence like achilles lance can heal the wounds that it has inflicted today we are bound hand and foot humiliated and sick with fear we cannot fall lower happily this is not yet enough for the colonialist aristocracy it cannot complete its delaying mission in algeria until it has first finished colonising the french every day we retreat in front of the battle but you may be sure that we will not avoid it the killers need it theyll go for us and hit out blindly to left and right thus the day of magicians and fetishes will end you will have to fight or rot in concentration camps this is the end of the dialectic you condemn this war but do not yet dare to declare yourselves to be on the side of the algerian fighters never fear you can count on the settlers and the hired soldiers theyll make you take the plunge then perhaps when your back is to the wall you will let loose at last that new violence which is raised up in you by old oftrepeated crimes but as they say thats another story the history of mankind the time is drawing near i am sure when we will join the ranks of those who make it
now that we in america face a new world indeed on the whole a receptive world and now that we are developing a sense of history long delayed what shall be the purpose of the negro from nowinto the future should we not call for a summit meeting of all the acknowledged leaders of the civil_rights movement to a round table conference in an endeavor to formalize a joint program of action for those basic human rights still denied the negro in the social political economic and educational area of life these leaders in the order of their standing both in america and abroad and in my own estimation of their contribution to the cause of the negro are dr martin_luther_king southern christian leadership conference sclc roy wilkins national association for the advancement of colored people naacp whitney young the national urban league james farmer congress of racial equality core john lewis student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc there are no longer any fundamental doctrinal issues that separate these groups or their leaders isnt there in fact too much fragmentation with the danger of even greater stratification and division between the groups that have been accepted as spokesmen for the american negro citizenry is not the drain on the treasury of each of these groups admittedly dangerous because of the excessive costs of operating on such a great national scale i refuse to believe that anyone of these leaders would deny the urgent need to meet to discuss these issues i am likewise convinced that each leader of each group would upon an urgent national call from the ranks of the negro people of america reply with a resounding yes who shall sound the call to these leaders these men in whose hands lie the plans for the virtual destiny of millions of their fellowmen these men who by their program will put america to the continuing litmus paper test of its humanism and its equal treatment of the negro i personally call upon the negro church the great religious leaders of the masses of the negro people too long under eclipse and too long surrendering their traditional roles as spokesmen for their million enrolled church members i also call upon the restless negro and white students in colleges north and south young men and women of energy and imagination the visionaries who give such impetus and life to these movements to urge these leaders to cease their bureaucratic differences and sit down at the conference table work out a common bargaining ground a concensus and elect a leader then merge their forces and formalize in a joint statement a series of resolutions of demands in every area of human rights and bring these demands to the attention of the president of the united states the attorney general and the leaders of both houses of congress such a demand for human rights based upon a strong legal and moral foundation will be unassailable and will be heralded and praised throughout america and the world and finally i ask those of you who will make this call to our leaders to urge the distinguished dr martin_luther_king who was recently honored with the bestowal of the nobel peace prize to become chairman and spokesman for the group i am certain the white churches and synagogues of america the great protestant catholic and jewish leaders will do as they did in their march to selma alabama give this proclamation their united support this group action in essence is what dr_king referred to when speaking of the needless waste of assets in the various drives for equality of the negro in the weeks following the assassination of malcolm_x when it appeared that a bitter and costly feuding between his followers and his former muslim group would erupt in bloodshed dr_king offered to mediate the differences between the two groups these two instances are but straws in the wind of what could happen in the area of agreement between the civil_rights groups if a clarion call for such a summit meeting were made and from the sources above suggested great miracles have often been wrought out of the commitment to a cause by a few people a word on the danger to the american negro and his present crusade for equal rights and participation in the american society by such movements as the black muslims the negro no longer lives as he did years ago in an isolated community what he does in harlem philadelphia cleveland detroit chicago and particularly in the south is broadcast throughout america and the world various interpretations are given to whatever may be reported about him or pictured about him depending upon the attitude of the news media or the place of coverage the death of malcolm_x for example was reported in the foreign press as the result of a giant conspiracy of white antinegro groups to kill negro civil_rights leaders this completely false picture was spread throughout europe asia africa and the communist world resulting in violent demonstrations in many of the african countries under the theory that malcolm_x was an american lumumba i point to the above as a warning note to the great and growing body of young negroes in the schools and colleges of america upon whom the destiny of the entire negro race depends that a renewed sense of purpose and a clarification of the objectives of the american negro is a prime necessity first and foremost it is imperative that we support every effort on the part of our local state and national governments for widespread and total education of the negro masses especially those in densely populated ghettos and pockets of poverty in the deep south and their counterparts in the metropolitan cities of the north there is a heavy responsibility on the part of the professional upperclass the better circumstanced and welltodo negro to sacrifice much of his time to help his brother at the lower level and particularly to give liberally of his money to those causes and there are many working to this end he must be willing to speak up and be heard in public meetings before the various boards of education not only for integrated education but for high quality education by the best and most qualified teachers he must assert that the negro taxpayer will support an increase in the tax rate however high it may be when funds are needed to build better schools and provide higher salaries for better quality education the poor of all races are the beneficiaries and our poor percentagewise unfortunately is the greater and he should be the first to support and insist upon a program of preschool education at the age of two and onehalf years and a longer school day and a shorter vacation period there is an urgent need for guidance values of negro children in their early years of life i have referred above to what history has done to them and their families for more than two centuries america is paying the cost of thisand we are the victims of that benighted history next of importance are the need of guidance values and a new awareness for the negro youth early in life beginning at preschool age and continuing through the primary and high school years with concentration on the need for total perfection and discipline a hierarchy of values and culture is an absolute necessity nothing has been a greater contributing factor to the negros lack of readiness for full participation in american opportunity today than the grave losses sustained by the negro because of the traditional treatment of the negro masses in our schools both north and south historically he was segregated by law in the south and provided with a minimum of education given by poorly trained and poorly equipped teachers in totally inadequate buildings worse the term of the school year was substantially less than that for white children in the north he found himself in ghetto schools for the most part defacto segregated confronted with a teaching staff with little interest or motivation it becomes necessary therefore for the negro to approach the necessity for mass education with a sense of tragedy that if we fail in thisall else fails we must inquire in the secondary or high school courses to find those unusual minds of excellence or those with unusual skills in the various sciences physical chemical and biological in the manual and creative arts the performing arts of music drama acting and expressionall to the end that the american negro heirs of a rich and vaunted african heritage of many centuries with a history of gigantic accomplishments in these and many other fields which leading world authorities now fully recognize may rise again to a place long denied the negro as one of the truly great races of the world we must give up our lives to this test of excellence and supremacy in this struggle for a place among the great races of the world which in its accomplishment will carry our native america to an even higher place among the nations of the world i speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy i urge members of both partiesamericans of all religions and c l rsfrom every sectionto join me in that cause at times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in mans unending search for freedom so it was at lexington and concord so it was a century ago at appomattox so it was last week in selma ala there longsuffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as americans many were brutally assaulted one good mana man of godwas killed there is no cause for pride in what happened in selma there is no cause for selfsatisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of americans but there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight for the cries of pain the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of the government of the greatest nation on earth our mission is at once the oldest and most basic of this country to right wrong to do justice to serve man in our time we have come to live with moments of great crisis our lives have been marked with debate about great issuesissues of war and peace of prosperity and depression but rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of america itself rarely are we met with a challenge not to our growth or abundance our welfare or security but to the values and purpose and meaning of our nation the issue of equal rights for american negroes is such an issue and should we defeat every enemy double our wealth conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue then we will have failed as a people and a nation for with a country as with a person what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul there is no negro problem there is no southern problem or northern problem there is only an american problem and we are met here tonight as americans not as democrats and republicans to solve that problem this was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose the great phrases of that purpose still sound in every american heart north and south all men are created equalgovernment by consent of the governed give me liberty or give me death those are not just clever words those are not just empty theories in their name americans have fought and died for two centuries and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty risking their lives those words are promised to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man this dignity cannot be found in mans possessions it cannot be found in his power it rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others it says that he shall share in freedom choose his leaders educate his children provide for his family according to his ability and merits as a human being to apply any other testto deny a man his hopes because of his color or race his religion or the place of his birthis not only to do injustice it is to deny america and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for freedom our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish it must be rooted in democracy the most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders the history of this country is in large measure the history of the expansion of that right to all our people many of the issues of civil_rights are complex and difficult but about this there can be no argument every american citizen must have an equal right to vote there is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right there is no duty which weighs more heavily on us to ensure that right yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting because they are negroes every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right the negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong the hour is late or the official in charge is absent if he persists and manages to present himself to the registrar he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application if he manages to fill out an application he is given a test the registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test he may be asked to recite the entire constitution or explain the most complex provision of state law even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read or write for the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination no law that we now have on the books and i have helped to put three of them there can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it in such a case our duty must be clear to all of us the constitution says no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color we have all sworn an oath before god to support and defend that constitution we must now act in obedience to that oath wednesday i will send to congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote the broad principles of that will be in the hands of democratic and republican leaders tomorrow after they have reviewed it it will come here formally as a bill i am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends to give them my views and to visit with my former colleagues i have prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which i had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which i will submit to the clerks tonight but i want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposals of this legislation this bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all electionsfederal state and localwhich have been used to deny negroes the right to vote it will establish a simple uniform standard which cannot be used however ingenious the effort to flout our constitution it will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the united states government if state officials refuse to cooperate it will eliminate tedious unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote finally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting i will welcome suggestions from all the members of congressi have no doubt i will get someon ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective but experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the constitution to those who seek to avoid action by their national government in their communitieswho seek to maintain purely local control over electionsthe answer is simple open your polling places to all your people allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin extend the rights of citizens to every citizen there is no constitutional issue here the command of the constitution is plain there is no moral issue it is wrong to deny any american the right to vote there is no issue of states rights or national rights there is only the struggle for human rights i have no doubt what will be your answer last time a president sent a civil_rights bill to congress it contained a provision to protect voting rights that bill was passed after eight long months of debate and when that bill came to my desk for signature the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated this time on this issue there must be no delay no hesitation no compromise with our purpose we cannot we must not refuse to protect the right of every american to vote in every election he may desire to participate in and we ought not and we cannot and we must not wait another eight months before we get a bill we have already waited years and more and the time for waiting is gone so i ask you to join me in working long hours nights and weekends if necessary to pass this bill and i dont make that request lightly for from the window where i sat with the problems of our country i recognize that outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of the nation the grave concern of many nationsand the harsh judgment of history on our acts but even if we pass this bill the battle will not be over what happened in selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of america it is the effort of american negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of american life their cause must be our cause too it is not just negroes but all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice and we shall overcome as a man whose roots go deeply into southern soil i know how agonizing racial feelings are i know how difficult it is to reshape attitudes and the structure of society but a century has passed more than years since the negro was freed and he is not fully freed tonight it was more than years ago that abraham lincoln a great president of another party signed the emancipation proclamation but emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact a century has passed more than years since the equality was promised and yet the negro is not equal the time of justice has now come no force can hold it back if it is right in the eyes of man and god that it should come and when it does that day will brighten the lives of every american for negroes are not the only victims how many white children have gone uneducated how many white families have lived in poverty how many white lives have been scarred by fear because we have wasted our energy and substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror those who ask you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future this great rich restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to allblack and white north and south sharecropper and city dweller these are the enemiespoverty and ignoranceand not our fellow man and these too shall be overcome let no one in any section look with prideful righteousness on the troubles of his neighbors there is no part of america where the promise of equality has been fully kept in buffalo as well as birmingham in philadelphia as well as selma americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom this is one nation what happens in selma or in cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every citizen but let each of us look within our own communities and our own hearts and root out injustice there tonight men from the south as well as the north men from the east as well as from the west are all americans all fighting together in viet nam men from every region fought for us across the world years ago in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the south made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region of the great republic i have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this countryfrom the great lakes down to the gulf of mexico from the golden gate to the harbors along the atlanticwill rally now together in this cause to vindicate the freedom of us all for all of us owe this duty all of us will respond to it the real hero of this struggle is the american negro his actions and protestshis courage to risk safety and even lifehave awaked the conscience of the nation his demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice to provoke change and stir reform he has called upon us to make good the promise of america and who among us can say we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery and his faith in american democracy for at the heart of battle for equality is a belief in the democratic process equality depends not on the force of arms but the force of moral rightnot on recourse to violence but on respect for law and there have been many pressures upon your president and there will be others as the days come and go but i pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be foughtin the courts and in the congress and in the hearts of men we must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly but the right of free speech does not carry with it as has been said the right to holler fire in a crowded theater we must preserve the right of free assembly but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares we do have a right to protestand a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors i intend to protect all those rights as long as i am permitted to serve in this office we will guard against violence knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons with which we seek progressobedience to law and belief in american values in selma as elsewhere we seek peace we seek order we seek unity but we will not accept the peace of stifled rights the order imposed by fear the unity that stifles protest for peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty in selma as in every city we are working for just and peaceful settlement we must remember that after this speechafter the police and the marshals have goneafter this bill is passed the people of selma must still live and work together when the attention of the nation has gone elsewhere they must try to heal the wounds and build a new community this cannot easily be done on a battleground of violence as the history of the south itself shows it is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such impressive responsibility in recent days the bill i am presenting will be known as a civil_rights bill but in a larger sense most of the program i am recommending is a civil_rights program its object is to open the city of hope to all our people all americans must have the right to vote and we are going to give them that right all americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race and they are going to have those privileges but to exercise that privilege takes more than legal right it requires a trained mind and a healthy body it requires a decent home and the chance to find a job and the opportunity to escape from poverty of course people cannot contribute to the nation if they are never taught to read or write if their bodies are stunted from hunger if their sickness goes untended if their life is spent in hopeless poverty we want to open the gates to opportunity but we are also going to give all our peopleblack and whitethe help they need to walk through those gates my first job after college was as a teacher in a small mexicanamerican school my students were poor and often hungry and they knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice they didnt understand why people disliked them but they knew it was so you could see it in their eyes i often walked home after classes wishing there was more i could do but all i knew was to teach them the little i knew hoping it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a child but now i do have that chance and ill let you in on a secreti mean to use it and i hope that you will use it with me this is the richest and most powerful country which ever occupied the globe the might of past empires is little compared to ours but i do not want to be the president who built empires or sought grandeur or extended dominion i want to be the president who educated young children to the wonders of their world i want to be the president who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be taxpayers instead of taxeaters i want to be the president who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election i want to be the president who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties i want to be the president who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth and so at the request of your beloved speaker and the senator from montana the majority leader and the senator from illinois the minority leader mr mcculloch rep william m mcculloch rohio and other members of both parties i came here tonight not as president roosevelt came down one time in person to veto a bonus bill not as president truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill but i came down here to ask you to share this task with me and to share it with the people we both work for i want this to be the congress republicans and democrats alike which did all these things for all these people beyond this great chamber out yonder in states are the people we serve who cannot tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen we all can guess from our own lives how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness how many problems each little family faces they look most of all to themselves for their futures but i think they also look to each of us above the pyramid of the great seal of the united states it says in latin god has favored our undertaking god will not favor everything that we do it is rather our duty to divine his will but i cannot help believing that he truly understands and that he really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight the struggle for ra v rial justice and brother i hood the time has jj come and is overdue for objectivity perspective calmness and reason dramatic heroism has served a useful function but oversimplification name calling and demagoguery are not the proper tools with which to resolve complex issues white and black men are offended and even angered when one attempts to evaluate racial problems without prejudice and misguided emotion nevertheless i shall now make such an attempt of course i realize that all men have prejudices and are only deceiving themselves when they claim to have no prejudices i too may unwittingly be indulging in that popular pastime which confuses thinking with a mere rearrangement of ones prejudices if so i ask your indulgence for my weakness and lack of insight although it is scarcely helpful to have prejudice in anyone who is trying to rectify what he considers to be prejudices in others that the white race has as a whole grossly mistreated colored races especially the negro race is a fact on which i assume we can all agree i also take for granted that many white people are thoroughly ashamed of the way white men have exploited black men and that we all sincerely want to atone personally for the past present and future racial sins of ourselves and other white men moreover i am aware that john steinbeck spoke rather accurately when he said i am constantly amazed at the qualities we expect in negroes no race has ever offered another such high regard we expect negroes to be wiser than we are more tolerant than we are braver more dignified than we more selfcontrolled and selfdisciplined we expect them to obey rules of conduct we flout to be more courteous more gallant more proud more steadfast nevertheless it is time that some white liberal points out to negroes how some whites who believe in equality for all people feel about negro prejudices which are damaging to both races the white man is not the only one who must answer whether he is his brothers keeper of course i know that many negroes understand this and act accordingly there is no such thing as a typical negro just as there is no such thing as a typical white mannot even a typical southern white man what i am saying is directed primarily at those negroes who generalize from particulars and hate or distrust all white men failing to give credit where it is due and willing to believe the worst about a white mans motives for his words and actions the fall issue of columbia college today quotes several negro college students whom i believe would understand what i am trying to say george sneed jr said the important thing to me is to be considered as an individual refuse to be thought of as a part of a mass problem and i dont feel any gratitude toward campus groups who treat me this way for negroes to be treated as individuals the key thing is to have more association between the races its hard to hate people you really know mr sneed was referring i am sure to an association on the basis of full equality and respect henry white said most people in harlem and i suspect other negroes feel very discouraged and are full of resentment against whitestoo much so i think negroes have to stop feeling so sorry for themselves my parents have taught me not to expect to have things handed to me but to work hard and get what i wanted my teachers have encouraged me in the same way but maybe if i had different parents and teacher i would feel trapped and bitter too i hope and trust that mr white realizes however that presentday american social and economic forces especially where negroes are concerned make it extremely difficult for some people to rise above their environment no matter how hard they work james alexander said when i first came to columbia i felt insecure every time i saw a negro face i automatically introduced myself now i have a lot of friends at the college and many of my white friends are as close as the negro ones r these young negro men and others like them represent the hope for the negro race and indeed for the entire human race while perhaps more fortunate in environment and opportunities than most other negroes or whites they nevertheless demonstrate that they have been able to keep intact their per sonalities and selfesteem in spite of white injustice and discrimination as charles eliot silberman a white economist and journalist points out in the same columbia magazine the negro will be unable to compete on equal terms until he stops despising himself and his fellows and purges from his mind all sense of black inferiority until he really believes with all his being that he is a free man and acts accordingly what i am saying is applicable not only to american negroes but to negro people everywhere when in december the united nations security council was debating the congo rescue action there was demonstrated among some of the african and asian nations an antiwhite bias which was both unbecoming and damaging adlai stevenson is a man of considerable patience understanding and concern for negro people therefore his words were not taken lightly when he spoke with indignation and sorrow i have served in the united nations from the day of its inception off and on for seven years but never before have i heard such irrational irresponsible insulting and repugnant language in these chambers language used if you please contemptuously to impugn and slander a gallant and successful effort to save human lives of many nationalities and colours i say that racial hatred racial strife has cursed the world for too long i make no defense of the sins of the white race in this respect but the antidote for white racism is not black racism racism of any form by anybody is an offense to the conscience of mankind and to the charter of the united nations racial problems are so numerous and complex and so interrelated with other problems that no wise person can expect easy answers in one master plan the back cover of negro digest wisely states that knowledge is the key to a better tomorrow i should like to add that so is trust better laws and social planning are necessary to help resolve racial problems but in the long run nothing will take the place of the permanent and solid way of daybyday relationships in numerous ordinary ways until people cease to think in terms of black and white as making any difference except color it is difficult now for negroes and whites to be natural around each other even men of good will in both races are just a little too enthusiastic to members of the opposite race white writers for negro magazines are often almost fawning in their attempts to assure negroes that while other white men may be prejudiced they themselves are not i should think any selfrespecting negro while appreciating the effort would cringe with embarrassment negroes in positive as well as negative ways must help white people break down the barriers of strangeness that help perpetuate segregation and all the evils that go with it it is true that communists both openly and subtly have exploited race prejudices and legitimate negro aspirations for their own purposes i dont believe however that many negro people anywhere in the world have long been deceived by communists if anything negro people have as a result become more cynical about white motives thus a negro comedian can jokingly but nonetheless bitterly condemn liberals who rent a negro to prove how liberal they are this comedian has a valid point to make but white people who are really trying to break down barriers between races are also treated with suspicion concerning their motives but here we must have help and understanding from negroes if we are to be in a position to help them in a sense our white children are underprivileged we talk about brotherhood but our children dont know any negro children to learn to take for granted as being just like white children negro people if they are really serious about brotherhood rather than merely seeking a reversal of injustice have an obligation to help white people rear their children without the blight of prejudice certainly i know that one runs the risk of being offended or having ones children hurt by a prejudiced remark made by a white child recently my five year old daughter reflecting certain community attitudes was heard by our older children using disparaging language concerning negroes the spanking we gave her will help her get her values straighter in the future but the job would be easier for white parents who are trying to rear their children without racial prejudice if negroes would be more understanding and helpful i am told that once when a negro visitor came into our church a white visitor walked out i can only say that if this happened and if it happened because of race prejudice that the visitor was not typical of our congregation in fact we do not have any members like that and we do not want members who have such attitudes it is somewhat ironic that the church of which i am the minister regularly loses some prospective white members because we are integrated and because of our ideas in racial matters yet negro people make a fetish of trying to integrate churches where they are obviously not wanted while ignoring a church that obviously does want them on a genuinely integrated basis and not merely as a token of integration but even without the risk of offense it is difficult to go where at least temporarily one stands out as different also one does not like to leave his friends at other churches nevertheless i am convinced that some negroes must be willing to make these sacrifices in order to help us all mature and get used to each other our family and mem bers of our congregation do visit negro churches in support of this ideal i remember that i used to dance with negro girls when i was a student at yale divinity school and i really didnt think i was prejudiced until one day in my hometown in georgia a white girl i was with sat down by a negro on a bus a white man then exclaimed that she was not any better than the negro a remark which made me extremely angry you see my prejudice was still showing it was years later before i could preach yes i would want my daughter to marry a negro negro digest july and mean it negroes and whites have to associate with each other on equal terms until the strangeness and prejudices wear off v equality friendship and brotherhood imply a free give and take negro and white people of good will must learn to speak frankly to each other without suspecting prejudices and inferior motivation negroes are not treated as equals as long as they are handled with kid gloves by whites afraid that feelings will be hurt or that they themselves will be misunderstood nor can negroes continue to have one face for negroes and another for whites neither negro nor white people can mature so long as white liberals pretend that negroes can do no wrong and are not subject to rules of decency and morality this is true no matter how immoral and vicious other white people are or how lax white people of good will are in protecting negro people against unjust white people uncontrolled and lawless negro gangs are just as vicious and wrong as their counterparts in the ku klux klan as a white man i can work to counter white prejudice but negro prejudice is something about which i as a white man can do little in the october issue of look jim brown a cleveland browns negro football star spoke of how he was being lionized by a crowd one day until confronted with a little white girl who wanted to hug him mr brown spoke of friendly looks becoming frozen he did not let the little white girl express her admiration for him he seemed to be mad at the entire white race for this prejudice but i should like to point out to jim brown that he himself is contributing to continued prejudice he should have let the little girl hug him even if smiles did become frozen does mr brown believe that courage is only demonstrated on the football field or in picket lines or in defiant attitudes if looks ever are to become unfrozen the jim browns are going to have to risk rejection and prejudice it seems to me that in a way that crowd was overcoming its prejudice more than jim brown was his when white people make an effort please my negro brother do not rebuff them because other white men have hurt you please forgive our past ignorance and callousness if we are now trying to atone forgiveness is essential if life is to be based on reality give credit for growth dont reject friendship even if there are still prejudices to be overcome and even if many white people fumble awkwardly and ineffectively in our attempts to be brotherly and righteous of course it goes without saying that negroes also have to be accepted with their prejudices by white people indeed negroes in order to be tolerant and just have to be more understanding and tolerant than white people there is so infinitely much more to understand and forgive but i am pleading with negroes for their own sakes and the cause of civilization everywhere that they try to rid themselves of the poison of hatred many negroes have done so wonderfully well and i am not speaking of the mask put on by socalled buffoons or uncle toms here again however it is easy for negroes to criticize the constructive permanent methods of fair and realistic negro leaders while being swept off their emotional feet by demagoguery as woodrow wilson ironically said the man on horseback is always a hero the apostles of hate of all colors may yet win the day if so in the long run it will not matter whether there is black or white supremacy the world will not be a fit place for anybody soapbox oratory is not going to bring brotherhood the future belongs to countless unsung negro and white people who are determined to love to forgive and to understand in order to find permanently satisfactory solutions to their problems segregation is on the way out future generations will read about us in their history books and wonder how we could have been so blindly prejudiced the time will come when races will have merged because the taboo of color will no longer separate people in marriage or in any other meaningful human relationship within a year after the civil war ended a negro entered a fashionable richmond virginia church and knelt at the altar while communion was being served emotions ran high until a distinguished layman arose in his pew stepped forward to the altar and knelt beside his negro brother the layman was general robert e lee moved by his example the whole congregation came forward and knelt at the altar today there is increasingly real hope that when courageous forgiving seeking negroes kneel at the altars of white churches they will be permanently joined by repentant whites as we all pray let us break bread together on our knees when im on my knees with my face to the rising sun o lord have mercy on me the american consumer is a trusting soul and because of this he has become fairgame for hucksters and unscrupulous businessmen using deceit and insincerity the baitvertiser fools his victims so completely that most times they dont have the slightest idea that theyve been tricked and dont think that you are immune from getting hooked by a bait ad more than once youll see what appears to be a tremendous bargain rush to the store or invite the firms sales representative for a free home demonstration youll soon discover that the bait advertiser isnt very eager to sell you the product he advertised it will be temporarily out of stock or youll be told it really isnt for you because it is an inferior product gradually the sales pitch will start to upsell you to a product that sells for a lot more than the one advertised the bait advertiser spends big sums for direct mail newspaper radio and tvall designed to offer something which he has little or no intention to sell but in reality to get you on the hook did you ever see an ad for a vacuum cleaner with a picture of an upright upon which you can read the name hoover do you really think that you are being given a chance to purchase a rebuilt hoover vacuum cleaner for just ok you take the bait and invite the salesman to your home how wrong can you go for for even a used cleaner the salesman will arrive at your home and place a few sprinkles of baking soda on your living room rug the machine will wheeze in agony and the powder will stay put on the carpet a pretty poor machine id say the salesman says these old rebuilt machines never seem to work right i cant offer you any guarantee of any sort so why do you want to buy such a piece of junk it isnt by accident that the salesman just happens to have a new machine in his automobile trunk he brings it into the house and it works perfectly this ought to do the trick and the price is only but im going to let you have it for only you can readily see that the ad was just a comeon in fact the price mentioned is not the regular price of the machine he demonstrated its regular price is only but a reputable store would be a better source because it will stand in back of its written guarantee the bait advertiser could not compete on equal terms with a reputable dealer one reason for him to misuse the name of a good firm like hoover the second hand house you may have bought will have an old heating system youve been dickering with a neighborhood firm to install a new gas furnace but before you sign the contract you notice an ad for a much lower price than that which was quoted to you by the first firm beware an actual case in the records of the better business bureau of cleveland tells the story of a home owner who bought a bargain installation the bill was for more than above the newspaper advertised price and when she remonstrated she was told that the ad said btus hardly large enough to heat her home and the ad had a small notation saying that installation was extra does your home need asbestos siding home owners throughout the east have been plagued by a firm which advertised to cover an average x home for only if you take note of these measurements youll realize that the average home spoken of will almost fit into your living room those who signed contracts for this installation received bills from two to four times the advertised price want to save money now and not refurnish your own apartment ok lets make your old furniture do there are ads offering to reupholster a sofa and a chair in decorators fabrics for only the salesman for this firm wasnt even subtle lady he said to one housewife you couldnt possibly redo two pieces of furniture for only and get nice fabrics the ad is only a comeon so that i can show you samples of better grade fabrics you may think that you can cut corners on the family budget by buying a sewing machine and making some clothes at home dont be hooked by the ad offering a genuine rebuilt singer sewing machine for only there is no such thing the machine is rebuilt all right with japanese parts or with inferior bootleg parts try as you might the salesman wont even let you buy the machine hell pitch for you to buy a more expensive model and dont even apologize for the unauthorized use of the singer name want to save on your fuel bills radio advertising will blare forth the tremendous bargain of a combination storm and screen offered to home owners for just installed free of charge just try to buy one the storekeeper will all but hit you over the head trying to convince you why you should buy his regular special at a price several times the amount of the advertised special many states have had so many complaints filed with the attorney generals office that consumer frauds bureaus were established in quite a few the authorities are attempting to protect the consumer from the merchants who trick and deceive by bait advertising and from merchants who use other devious methods to cheat the public in practice bait ads are damaging to the entire community these ads give business to the advertiser who stoops to trickery taking away business from the honest merchant yet how do you spot a bait ad many reputable firms run ads which feature what is known in the trade as loss leaders they offer merchandise at rock bottom prices to entice you to come to the store and possibly make other purchases in fact the bait advertiser is right when he tells you that the higher priced product will give you better service and might very well cost less in the long run but the fact remains that if you are going to spend more for a product than the bargain price advertised youd be better off not dealing with the bait advertiser after all anyone whod trick you to make a sale wont hesitate to give ou poor service sell shoddy products and fail to back up the products guarantee most businessmen try to offer top quality merchandise at fair prices this is how they grow in reputation and in sales however the rotten minority can hurt you in your pocketbook here are some ways in which you can protect yourself against the baitvertiser remember that you cant get something for nothing shy away from amazing or fantastic bargains the stores you know and trust seldom use such terms talk to your friends and neighbors about the reputation of any firm you plan to do business with a good reputation is the result of fair play and stores with such a reputation dont have to resort to bait ads shop around and obtain comparative prices on merchandise or services you plan to buy to make sure you are on the trail of a good product at a fair price before you expose yourself to a firm of unknown reputation a price far below that quoted by a reputable firm is a danger signal ado not buy from anyone unless he can show you the product he advertises and is willing to sell it without knocking it a reputable firm does not handle products which it considers inferior never sign any paper of any kind until you have read it and are sure you understand it a firm interested in its reputation wants you to know exactly what you are getting before you commit yourself remember that bait advertising the alluring but insincere offer to sell something is going to trick a lot of people out of a lot of money today and every day dont let it trick you suspicious that you are the planned victim of a bait advertiser call your local office of the better business bureau or your local chamber of commerce and ask if the firm has a clean record did you fall victim to a baitvertiser swallow your pride and bring the facts to the attention of the consumer frauds bureau of your state president johnson designated may as senior citizens month in the hope that all citizensof will participate in helping make life beyond a better life for senior citizens of our land why suddenly a special month designated for considering the problems of old folks perhaps some statistics from the presidents council on aging will help to focus the light of information on this largeand growing american minority fred panzer director of public information for the council provides the following data every seconds one american turns thats an hour a day million a year today nearly million men and women in the united states are over by the year the number will be more than million adds mr panzer a numerous aged population is a uniquely modern achievement and challenge three powerful social forces are responsibleindustrialization urbanization and medical progress together they create the conditions that generate an aged population and its problems these problems confront americans of all ages indirectly through our parents and grandparents directly as we ourselves grow older these problems have to do with a usually diminishing income a scarcity of jobs declining health and high medical costs inadequate or unavailable housing and special living requirements mr panzer describes the problems as follows income our old people are quite frequently our poor people as the economic mainstream has risen from scarcity to affluence it has left millions of our aged stranded in the backwaters of poverty there are elderly families with less than a year nearly elderly individuals live on less than a year jobs in most respects the aged have the same problems as the rest of the populationonly more so this is certainly true about employment age bias begins at and age alone is too often the excuse for arbitrarily removins men and women from active participation in life health the hardships of hospitalization in later years are commonplace only one out of ten senior citizens will escape at least one lengthy costly stay in a hospital older persons need three times more hospital care than the rest of the population yet their average income is only half as high housing the important field of housing for older americans commands attention one out of each five dwelling units occupied by persons over is substandard housing for our aged is complex and neglected social needs modern living shatters traditional family life and relations between children parents and grandparents the gap between the generations widens it is being partly filled by social service agencies public and private they try to provide the care that too many families can no longer provide for themselves and what of the negro aged the minority within this special minoritythe manpower report to president johnson in march had the following observations the difficulties which beset the older worker in the job market are multiplied manyfold for the older negro not only is he hurt by discriminatory employment practices because of race but the factors which are a disadvantage to older workers generally inadequate education and employment in less skilled occupations are even more pronounced among the older negroes among men to years of age in the median number of years of school completed by nonwhites nearly all negroes and hereafter so referred to was only about six years compared with nine years for whites in this age group only about per cent of the negro men in these ages in were employed in clerical professional and other types of whitecollar jobs as against about per cent of the white men nearly half of all the older negroes were either laborers or service workers and thus subject to frequent and extended periods of joblessness and to meager incomes the rate of unemployment for negro men workers aged and over was per cent in march two and onehalf times as high as that for older white workers moreover among those to about one and onethird times as high a proportion of negro as white men were not in the labor force presumably many of them had decided there was little or no possibility of finding employment consequently the average income of older negro men is only about half that of older white men an even greater income disparity than exists between negroes and whites in the younger age groups although differences in education and other qualifications partly explain the income gap between white and negro workers there is ample evidence of unequal renumeration for equally qualified workers older negro workers have considerably lower average earnings than white workers with the same years of education in the same occupation the older negro professional men as a group earned less than the overall average for older white men in all occupations including laborers the housing and home finance agency released a report on the aging nonwhite negro and his housing which further pointed up the disparity between the white and black aged and the conditions under which they live for example of the negroes of or over reported in the census some per cent or live inside cities most in substandard dwellings more than threefifths had income of less than while only one of eight had an income of or more and aged negroes lived in generally more overcrowded homes than whites fortunately something is now being done to help the aged both black and white and to bring the gap between financial resources and general living conditions available to the two racial groups in the annual report to president johnson from the council on aging health education and welfare secretary anthony j celebrezze said that the federal government spent more than billion during to assist the aged in the fields of income payments housing employment health and welfare there are a total of federal programs for older americans hospital insurance through social security was arranged last november the presidents council on aging founded in may assists the president in meeting the problems of the aged it keeps up a continuing study of the governments responsibilities to these problems and makes recommendations regarding policies and programs council members include heads of cabinet departments and independent agencies that administer the major federal programs in aging mr celebrezze is chairman and warren t roudebush is staff director other members of the council are c douglas dillon secretary of the treasury orville l freeman secretary of agriculture john t connor secretary of commerce w willard wirtz secretary of labor robert c weaver administrator housing and home finance agency john w macy jr chairman civil service commission and william j driver administrator of veterans affairs o often one hears the accusation that the negro has made few if any significant contributions to the culture of america even the eminent university of chicago physiologist dr dwight j ingle has said as much in his statement that there is historical evidence to assert that the white race has made greater contribution than the negro race in terms of discovery and social evolution dr ingle does try to be objective in his studies on these matters presenting an apparent contradiction or refutation perhaps of each negative theory that he presents yet few persons have not heard these accusations and often their refutations seem weak somehow thus many persons including the negro himself are often puzzled about this subculture creature called the american negro who has been accused of being at best only a secondrate imitator who like the horrid barnacle has clung to the bottom of society which never wanted him anyway giving little or nothing to that society as a candid observation of the american language will show however the negro has made a contribution but like so many of his efforts as a member of a minority this too has gone largely ignored henry l mencken often spoke of the distinct quality of american english for taking any word or phrase and utilizing it to its own advantage even if it took liberties linguists note that a word which is slang dialectal provincial or otherwise substandard today may tomorrow change its course a looksee into any good etymological dictionary will show that this has certainly happened to two standard words namely silly and nice to recall only twoand this happened before these words reached american shores there is simply no end to the words and expressions deliberate creations of the american negro often used by those who have no idea of their origin who can say which among these will not defy time itself and emerge one day at the pinnacle of linguistic esteem language grows out of a mutual agreement between one or more people that one must communicate that one must make himself understood that one must give thus something of the history of the negros struggle for identity and often utter salvation is to be found in his unique capacity to communicate with a pungency that is purely his own what depth of meaning is conveyed in the negros classification of his god as a waymaker or of his overbearing neighbor as seditty no known spelling by the way or highpolluted a much more accurate metaphor than highfalutin of whih it is a corruption and who can use sugared terms with such casual endearment words like baby sugar or honey how many irksome situations those epithets have soothed moreover no one uses the word us as the negro does in embracing all of his people friends and enemies alike so long as they are negroes whites tend to use them especially in considering their foes and take the word signify no race uses that word with such insinuation and innuendo literally the merriamwebster dictionaries say that the word denotes to show by sign to communicate by words signals and the like to make known to mean denote import to have meaning to matter often used impersonally the oxford dictionary indicates that the word has carried such meanings since the fifteenth century but in my childhood i heard my neighbors use that word with weighty significance to signify meant something tantamount to cardinal sin hes always signifyin on me was an expression to cause consternation to all hearers no one could speculate on what might result to the guilty fellow proof that the negro is a keen observer of mankind is to be found in such words as busthead for an intellectual negro hammerman for the person of authority alligator now shortened to the jive word gate for a dude a sporty swaggering welldressed hep cat the sophisticated fellow who did not have to prove his manliness by fighting alligators or indians the very use of mister before any term object or concept in order to personify it verbs and nouns are rich in onomatopoeia in negro speech consider the following to have ones glasses on meaning to be haughty or formal to igg to ignore a cruncher a road or street conkbuster cheap liquor headlight a lightskinned negro hanging out not up to par as a descriptive adjective or to be rained on to be disappointed or tricked some words are actually of pure african origin among these are cuffee goober and pinder cuffee is an african word for negro goober is from the bantu word nuguba and pinder comes from a nigerian word the latter two words meaning peanut are deliberately derogatory usages which reflect disdain for efforts of the negro toward the culture of the language yet strongly refute the claim that the negro has made no contribution thereto both the plant and the word were transported bodily from africa it is perfectly natural for peoples to corrupt pronunciations of perfectly good words when those words change environs whites not knowing the literary accuracy of goober and pinder laughed these words to the derision of illiteracy who knows how many other words long since lost have followed this same course another fine linguistic contribution to the colloquy is bill bojangles robinsons copacetic no dictionary gives bill robinson this credit some claim the word comes from the yiddish with an original kspelling nevertheless it still remains that bill robinson gave the word its special flavor of meaning for fine all right or ok one hears a close onomatopoetic association with the latin word copia from which comes copious with the meaning of spatial abundance hence a state of allrightness the examples could be multiplied by research the negros use of the american language reflects strongly his battlesemotional psychological sociological economic and spiritualas he has journeyed from slavery toward freedom in a recent article alan rich writing in the new york herald tribune has said the following negro singers almost without exception as many writers have pointed out have a special gift for making the language beautiful and natural few caucasians can come within miles of this with the possible exception of the welsh and the english from the north of their country it may be a matter of dialect or it may be something physical if one reviews the many years the negro has lived in america there can be little doubt that this gift of tongues is a combination of many factors none of which can be ignored in evaluating the negros place in the american colloquy someone said he didnt care who made the laws of a people as long as he could write their songs in songs ones words become part of the speech and thought of a people and influence their ideas and attitudes some of the words of our poets have attained this influence at least to the extent of being used as titles of books john howard griffin took the title of his book black like me about a white man who darkens his skin and travels through the south to find out what it is like to be a negro from langston hughes dream variations just to mention the spirituals reminds us of how deep an impress they have made on our language and through it on our minds titles taken from the spirituals rush to the memory baldwins go tell it on the mountain alan lomaxs the rainbow sign mary whitt ovingtons the walls came tumbling down howard thurmans deep river albert luthulis and henrietta buckmasters let my people go anna arnold hedgemans the trumpet sounds eugene oneills all gods chillum got wings ama bontemps golden slippers frederic ramseys been here and gone has a title taken from those other black and unknown bards the folk singers who left us our legacy of ballads blues work songs hollers and other folk songs if all the roads the buildings the dams the artifacts that negroes have built in their three hundred years in this country were to vanish suddenly yet their monuments would still remain in the lines and phrases which the poets known and unknown have left in the songs and in the daily speech of men in his declining years sam clemens may have been critical of the bible but as a journalist most of his life he had learned one of its lessons this lesson was to be his key for unlocking the meaning of his stories know you the truth and the truth shall make you free clemens as mark twain used truth as a weapon in his lifelong fight against mans inhumanity to man as manifested in slavery and more subtly in bigotry because he was the only southern writer to write the truth about life in the south he was called by william dean howels the most desouthernized southerner i know and the lincoln of our literature most of us have read huckleberry finn and pondered over the section where huck struggles with his conscience this wasnt just a morality lesson this was huck speaking in the language and logic of the southland trying to understand the irrational it was twains way of putting the south under the searing light of truth he wanted them to realize their attitudes and actions toward the negro were unfair unreasonable cruel and hypocritical in the light of their christian upbringing it appears he hoped too optimistically that the southerner would understand and seek to mend his ways but after all the truth hurts and these truths were not the sort to be admitted especially when the myth of magnolia blossoms romance and genteel living were the image the south tried to put forward the hypocrisy of the churches in the matter did not escape in an essay about the decay of lying twain bemoaned the fact that lying in its noble formstorytelling about jumping frogs and the like had been replaced by the vicious and degrading practice of preachers who stand in pulpits and rationalize slavery ministers today who have been chastised for failing to take a stand on the greatest moral issue of our time can look back and see how long they have been procrastinating even mark twain was concerned about it most readers then did not take him seriously on these matters because his outcries were just an abolitionists opinion and worse the opinion of a man who deserted the confederate army after being drafted into it or maybe they just called him names to cloak their guilty consciences the most shocking truth twain was to explore was of course miscegenation in puddnhead wilson some were critical because it glorified the atheist some hooted at its using fingerprints but they all steered clear of the horrible truth that the footprints of two children revealed he was no joel chandler harris when he wrote that tale of a young white raised thinking he was a negro and a young negro raised as a white no it was mark twain using truth who told how they found out who they were at he left the reader the problem of deciding what kind of life the pair would then face because after all the reader had helped make the world they lived in it was here that the indignities forced upon negro women by white men were told of with a cas f ualness that misled the southern reader they were so used to the practice and safe in the knowledge that reprisals never followed that they failed to realize that twain was the only writer who dared to mention this degrading and sorry element of life among the magnoliablossomcovered southern aristocracy no gone with the wind will ever wipe out the truth that twain told it was after all the sort of things one doesnt talk about but he did he not only talked about it he built his book around it when after all the fingerprint theory could have been examined in hundreds of other plots most southern writers painted a picture of the negro that kept the bigot happy saying there see what they are like or see how happy they always are twain knew the happy negro was a myth because he had learned young in his autobiography he told of the young slave boy who was always cutting up laughing and shouting to the point of annoying young sam clemens then on one of his midnight walks around the aunts plantation where the slave boy lived sam came upon the boys cabin he listened and heard a gentle sobbing the sobbing continued all night and so it was every night that sam visited the place it was then that he learned the slave boys parents were in maryland where the boy would never see them again so the happy slave boy cried himself to sleep every night but his oh so human pride would not let him reveal that deep sorrow to any whitesthe myth would have been punctured twains comment was that boy showed more courage than any man i ever met so when jim moans over his familys being so far away we see this childhood episode being replayed when huck shows the love and understanding that the southern white always has for the negro and says why he misses his folks as much as white folks do it dont seem natural but he does we see this isnt just an ignorant boy muttering this is mark twain again damning the south and quietly asking man to let the truth set all men free truth was used in so many ways although some was more theory at the time at the top of a page in puddnhead wilsons calendar was the inscription training is everything the peach was once a bitter almond cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education here was the great humorist putting forth the idea that environment made the man and so in the book about puddrihead valet de chambre although really white southern aristocrat was at illiterate able to use only the basest dialect was vulgar and uncouth could not feel at home in a drawing room but was at ease in a kitchen but nothing could change him now that he learned he was white rich and free he could wear fine clothes move in the best circles but he could not endure these new terrors he was now a caricature a pathetic and sorry humanthe stereotyped negro of southern writers but if he was terrified what about tom actually a negro but he had lived as a dandy attending yale and coming home as a sort of conquering hero he also could not face his new life and roxy the slave whose son by her white master had been raised as a white through her switching babies in their cribs was called by twain heir of two centuries of unatoned insult and outrage there was nothing subtle about that remark it was twain using the truth again although twain left the confederacy and its army behind because he was bitterly antiwar the absurdity and cruelty of the southern system and cause made it easy for him he looked at that southern system and gave descriptions of masters a fairly humane man toward slaves and other animals but lest that phrase mislead you the same master was called a thief because he was the man who daily robbed him the slave of an inestimable treasuryhis liberty langston hughes has called twain as modern as faulkner for his handling of the puddnhead story this seems to fit for both twain and faulkner loved their southland but their writings about them were as acid as any goya etching painting people as they were in the hopes that men would see themselves as others do and so become the men they should be the book roughing it contains many examples of twains desouthernization at least in attitude he occasionally gave in and deleted something a chapter in life on the mississippi was taken out but a story was left in that was a cozy tale of the southern ideas of delicacy refinement religion and womanhood and he illustrated them with nice examples of southern gentlemen shooting and stabbing others this also explains twains distaste for sir walter scott to him scott was an early perpetrator of the sort of roses and magnolia legend of the prewar south the sentimentality of scott romances were just false to twain who had grown up in such a place some said that twain deleted that rarely read chapter from life on the mississippi because it would have offended his friends in the southland those who say that must not have read huck for hucks straight reporting of the scene in the south at that time is an indictment of a nation a region a people and certainly a tradition the lowlife pap who promises not to vote as long as a free negro is allowed to vote is real just like the cotton aristocracyhotheads like jefferson davis who made the civil war twain the journalist had long ago learned that the truth is better than any exaggeration and usually more flamboyant so huck reports calmly and coolly seeing brutality cowardice chicanery loyalty and courage in all the people he met and it wasnt just rednecks such as pap the bustling old mrs phelps wanted huck to explain why he had been delayed in getting where he didnt know he was heading it warnt the groundingthat didnt keep us back but a little we blowed out a cylinder head good gracious anybody hurt no mam killed a nigger well its lucky because sometimes people do get hurt now if the phelps were not at the top of the social ladder then colonel sherburn was and the good colonel shot down the drunken boggs in cold blood because he had promised to kill him if boggs insulted him again so when old boggs staggers up and insults the colonel again well the colonel as any gentleman should keeps his promise and shoots him dead the fact that he was killing a helpless man is apparently immaterial if an aristocrats honor is at stake when jim says he will steal his wife and child if he cant earn the money to buy them huck is shocked that he was plannin to steal his child from a man he didnt even know and who had never done him no harm but very soon after that huck lies to the men searching for runaways and saves jims life he then ponders why he feels so good after having done something wrong twain made gentle suggestions too in innocents abroad he recommended the system he found in certain lands of freeing slaves who showed an aptitude for some useful trade here he was asking the south if the myth that the negro showed no ambition couldnt be tested by giving a slave some reason to have ambition certainly he must have reasoned who would be ambitious when life offered only utter despair in those extraordinary twins he showed wales mccormick making jesting advances to aments mulato girl and the girls mother made almost no objection it was the privilege of the dominant race to exercise the droit du seigneur if it chose there again was utter despair in an essay he wrote that the happy songs the negro sings all seem to be about life after death and dying mark twain told truths as a journalist and he asked questions he asked why the southerner does not trust the shiftless negro and yet trusts mammies to raise their young children when the offspring are at their most impressionable ages when asked twain said the noblest trait a man can have is to love his fellow man but the rarest trait he does have is love for his enemy that man was called old and sick when he wrote an essay the united states of lyncherdom no longer subtle he came out ripping and tearing into lynching and said justice must be equitable the same for all he asked he wrote an essay to foreigners so they might understand the missionaries we send in to a person sitting in darkness he asked shall we go on conferring our civilization on those sitting in darkness when we as a nation set people free only to put them back in chains and kill to take a mans land he was also upset about the treatment of the indian when he attacked ministers who rationalized slavery twain was not aiming at religion itself he was attacking men for their lack of responsibility he was displeased because they had not achieved what he felt they were capable of achieving so in picturing the south twain painted a picture of dorian gray a looking into the soul a sinister soul whose crime of constant crime of indignity to humans wason earth at leastunpunished so twains negroes lived in a hell on earth as did their real brothers but he didnt make them mute they spoke outrealistically of courseto each other and to the huck finns who represented the wisdom of youth that hant been taught to hate yet their simple pleas for the basic comforts and dignity ring out as did martin_luther_kings plea for his dream jim just wanted his wife and child with him the sobbing slave boy just wanted his parents when roxy switched babies she just wanted the best of life for her son as would any mother they spoke from no soapboxes they spoke from their hearts and most important they spoke truth through the pen of mark twain truth is accuracy and when he had mrs phelps make her callous and stupid remark about the negro killed by the cylinder head he was being accurate it was not out of place it was in some ways the sort of thing we dont talk about but the reporter twain didnt think offtherecord comments belonged offtherecord when they told a real truth of sickness of a people yet van wyck brooks criticized twain for writing for the masses and not for the intellectual elite the masses of twains day were not used to reading anything much less the truth about miscegenation and other quaint practices of the southland they didnt even talk about such things twains observations about what white mans civilization had meant to the sandwich isles leave no doubt as to his belief that other races deserve a chance to build a better world because his own race had sure botched things up but he rarely shouted out about these outrages oh near the time when haleys comet was to come take him away he said some very bitter things about man god and everything in between but it was more just rehashing what he had been saying all along in his life with the pen he had gone from the gentle lessons of huckleberry finn to the discussing of the peculiar institutions peculiar institution was his name for slavery most vile evil in puddn head wilson in the latter he let two lives be ruined not by roxys switch but by a system that was and is ugly but we often miss his message with indifference similar to that of new yorkers who watched a woman stabbed to death we have read this panorama of mans inhumanity to man on a far larger and more revolting scale and then remembered only the laughs mark twain had not thought it necessary to say here it is i am telling you all about whats wrong down there like the girl who was stabbed he thought just a simple sight of what was happeningof the truthwas enough so unlike the weather which they talk about but do nothing about here was a problem that they didnt even talk about but mark twain did and today some talk about it and some do something about it sam clemens was born and reared in the south but before the hate was drilled into his head he heard another boy sobbing in the night this was truth this was injustice so when he told stories about other such injustices he thought others would see he couldnt know that parents would hurry up the hateteaching process so that whole legislatures would reel in terror at the thought of three or four small children going to a school his truth of mrs phelps was just as real as the whitesheeted maniac who sneered about the four children who died in the birmingham bomb blast he called a master a thief for stealing anothers liberty and that truth is still with us in certain senators and congressmen but mark twain apparently thought man could and would learn he knew the truth he wrote the truth so men could read the truth he wanted them to know the truth for if man knew the truth the truth shall make you free the american society of african culture amsac held a threeday student news editors conference at hampton institute toward the end of last march and several african and american student editors had the opportunity of getting to know each other under amsac auspices there is no certainty that the two groups established any concrete bridges of mutual understanding however during one explosive session there occurred an exchange of bareboned viewpoints which should have established a basis for an ultimate meeting of minds a young man from howard university taking the floor after amsac director calvin h raullerson had observed that american students had not participated in the sessions to the extent of the africans lit the torch to the inflammable situation he was weary he said in effect of ceaseless complaining from the africans who in their own countries offered no better examples of the institutions and customs they criticized in america in response a young man from kenya seized the spotlight and elo quently explained why the africans complained their complaints he insisted was a matter of defense we were told that america had the ideal form of government that there was a democracy in the united states and that we should aspire to that form of government he declared but was shocked when i came here to find that there is no democracy here i have been here four years now and i am still shocked we were told by the americans that we should emulate this form of government but now we know that we must defend our own customs and our own idea of government that is why we complain the kenyan was followed to the microphone by a young man from southern rhodesia who while affirming the sentiments of his colleague from kenya added that he complained because of the way his brothers in america were treated under the american government in the burst of spontaneous applause the dangerous heat subsided core chief james farmer flew in from the southern wars to address the open session of the conference resource people who participated were saunders redding hampton professor then serving as writerinresidence at duke university abctv newsman mai goode editor john mccormally of the hutchinson kansas news and negro digest editor hoyt w fuller it was a literary luncheon for bert and katya gilden the coauthors of that huge bestseller hurry sundown that we met roy newquist book editor of chicagos american only the day before we had sent mr newquist tearsheets of our review of his book counterpoint april counterpoint is a big book also a collection of some interviews of writers rangingas we noted in the reviewfrom irwin shaw to basil rathbone we found it impossible to resist asking mr newquist how he had managed in collecting interviews of writers to bypass all the negro writers in the world seeing as how he had traveled some miles to interview the writers the question of course threw mr newquist off his poise especially since it was asked in the presence of all those literary people and he turned appropriately ruddy and fumbled with words his first coherent response was that many of the writers in his book had mentioned negroes and the negro problem and we said well of course how could they avoid doing so since negroes and the problem constitute the most pressing concern in the country today we repeated how did you manage to ignore negro writers mr newquist recovered adequately enough to explain that he had indeed interviewed james baldwin but that mr baldwin didnt come off so well we smiled indulgently at that knowing james baldwin as we do and then having met mr newquist we had our own ideas as to who didnt come off so well in that interview mr newquist had no answer as to how he had missed all the negro writers in organizing his book and then when we learned that mr newquist was flying off presently to russia a dark suspicion arose in our mind why we asked was he going to russia well the good mr newquist blushed again and gave weight to our suspicions he was going behind the iron curtain to interview writers however he hastened to explain that his next book counterpoint ii would contain interviews of negro writers bully we told mr newquist it was very white of him we thought perhaps this threeday session was a natural outgrowth of last augusts fiveday talkfest out on the monterey peninsula under the auspices of the university of california at berkeley that beseiged institution on the bay indeed the april conference had many things the california conference lacked including james baldwin it also had all of new york city outside the new school auditorium a less cozy atmosphere and some extremely rude people masquerading as militants the new school auditorium as it turned out wasnt big enough to accommodate all the people willing to pay to hear the speakers sermonize argue harangue and occasionally enlighten and delight the star of the conference might well have been richard gilman drama critic for newsweek magazine who in effect told negro playwrights they were incapable of creating art incredibly only le roi jones even bothered to respond to him on this particular point and playwright jones who has all but ceased trying to communicate with white people mostly shrugged mr gilman away mr gilmans precise words are unavailable but their essence was this the creation of a mature artistic play demands a playwright who is free to consider the nature of being for it is in such exploration that good plays emerge negro playwrights are engaged in seeking to establish their being therefore until negro playwrights reach the point where they have no need to establish their being rather than to explore its nature they cannot create good plays consensus among many at the conference was that the ladies provided the most moving panel discussion the everlovely abbey lincoln was a joy playwright alice childress always on track rode to the heart of the matter and poet sarah wright was profound but it was paule marshall the able novelistshort story writer who most stirred the audience hers was a complex lucid presentation that put the negro woman in american literature in ripe perspective sterling brown too long submerged in the clouds of academia illustrated the kind of wit and erudition howard university english students have been exposed to all these years the crowds that roared to his sallies never missed the point at one session mr brown read a passage from robert penn warren of years ago that would put that southern poetnovelist to shame today mr warren has just published a book on negroes not merely getting into the act but even upstaging the actors a poet and folklorist of no mean accomplishments mr brown enlivened the panel on image of the afroamerican in literature how does one describe calvin hernton no not physically thats easy enough he is tall slender even angular betterlooking than he knows with eyes perenially hidden behind dark glassesbut the way he comes on that boy shook up the conference arriving extremely late for the panel on poetry and polemics he led off his assault with a quite original explanation for the souths predicament in language which was to say the very least earthy this is a family magazine so mr hernton might forgive our presuming to paraphrase him he strongly suggested that the southerners lack of access to satisfying sex was the source of all his maladjustments well now mr baldwin delivered the keynote address on the negro writers vision for america which was the theme of the conference for those who have heard mr baldwin on other occasions and have read his work there was nothing startlingly new from himwhich is no criticism what he has to say cannot be repeated and emphasized too often although the white publicas actorplaywright douglas turner observed seems to be deaf the white public however is not alone in seeming to be deaf as black questioners from the floor found it expedient to demonstrate there was the inevitable young man who found that he had no ties with africans other than a sameness of color and there was the prim young lady who wondered why mr baldwin particularly dwelt on the less noble characters out of the ghetto sylvester leaks a writer who breathes fire told the young man he had been brainwashed and directed him to the schomburg collection in the harlem branch library and mr baldwin assured the young lady that though he patterned his writing on whores junkies and jazz musicians he too was reared by one of those longsuffering negro maids perhaps the conferences most exotic panelist was a colored lady named myrna baines who works for yes this is correct the national review she called james baldwin an extremely talented literary prostitute but not alas to mr baldwins face miss baines proved a provocative antidote to the noisy delegates from peking john o killens sparkplug of the conference told his audience that the black american is the white americans hope black writers must save america if it is to be saved he said james baldwin said that the liberation of this country depends on whether or not we are able to make a real confrontation with our history the authors critics poets historians and professors paraded before the capacityplus audiences their

and one which might set the precedent for something betterif not bigger next time around cillens promises another conference this is the fourth of a series of national educational television programs on african writers which have been transcribed and published in negro digest the first the black writer in exile appeared in the december issue the second black writers white readers appeared in the march issue the third the literary impact of negritude appeared in the may issue in this instalment host lewis nkosi of south africa is joined by the nigerian playwright wole soyinka in putting questions to ghanas william abraham associate professor of philosophy at the university of ghana and author of the book the mind of a frica mr nkosi is an author journalist and broadcaster mr soyinka is a lecturer in english at the university of ife in nigeria the interview was taped in ghana bll rogers and aaron craig were rising writers each had published two novels a collection of essays and an occasional article each was considered a serious artist concerned with the fate of mankind they often expressed this concern on lively television programs where they discussed race problems rogers was black and craig was white once they accepted invitations to speak at a seminar at goatwater college in iowa the theme of the seminar was is there a difference between the negro and the white writer by coincidence each decided to drive to iowa bill from new york and aaron from san francisco aarons trip was uneventful he drove leisurely to vegas where he lost at roulette and picked up a girl the next day he pushed on to denver and the day after to omaha stopping at good motels and restaurants along the way he arrived at goatwater college greatly refreshed bursting with liberal goodwill looking forward to meet ing his pal bill whom he hadnt seen since the march on washington bills trouble started before he left new york state at fishkill he stopped at a diner and asked for a hamburger the waitress told him she didnt serve niggers he laughed suavely and said he didnt want any niggers just a hamburger but she didnt have any sense of humor her cold blue eyes stared at him with such unrelenting hatred that he shrugged and left after two similar experiences he was a desperately hungry man and drove as fast as the hertz car would take him to cleveland where he ate enough for three men and packed in enough sandwiches to last him until he reached iowa on the highway again he became sleepy and began to look for a nice motel for the night but whenever bill asked for a room it seemed there werent any vacancies no matter what the neon signs outside proclaimed finally bill pulled off the highway and fell into an exhausted sleep only to be awakened a few minutes later by a state trooper whatchu doin here boy bill rogers whose books had been translated into eight languages including japanese who had appeared on cbstv and nbctv countless times protested that he was no damn boy but a man so the cop beat him on various parts of his head and took him to jail where after two days he was found guilty of assaulting an officer of the law and fined finally bruised and battered he arrived at goatwater college just as the seminar was about to begin after a long flattering introduction he hobbled painfully to the microphone is there a difference between the black writer and the white writer youre goddamned right there is that was the last time bill was invited to goatwater college naturally all writn v ers attempting to crei ate works of art have s problems in common whether they live in saskatchewan uzbek or hattiesburg mississippi but having affirmed this i must insist that the black writer lives in an entirely different world from his white counterpart and therefore their works are bound to reflect different realities it would be foolish to say that one writes better than the otherthats a matter of individual talentbut it does seem to me that the black writer has the advantage as far as material is concerned for his is the one story that has never been told his is the story which in every form tragedy farce comedy epic etc cries out to be heard the black writer however hard he may try cannot escape the unique experience of his people which has no parallel in modern history for years a continent was depopulated to furnish the labour supply for another continent which has become the richest in the world those were years of hell out of which a great literature ought to be produced the task of the black writer is to illuminate as fully as possible all the tragedy and pathos all the humor vigor and excitement which those centuries of oppression have generated he must avoid the stereotyped formula and never subscribe to dogma but he must care very much about his worknever mind what anyone else thinks never mind what the current fashion may be he above all must care so deeply that nothing can persuade him to cheapen his work this is what is meant by integrity and commitment those writers who dont care enough those who are not committed seldom finish anything worthwhile simply because they dont know where they stand finally and most important the black writer must be aware of the fact that a fierce revolution is raging in the world today nearly everywhere the little guy is trying to get the man off his back it is class against class slave against master nationalist against imperialist in the united states it is a racial war where the confines of a humans life from cradle to grave are determined by whether his ancestors came from europe or africa it has been possible for thousands of white writers to ignore this central fact of american life to the black writer it is an inescapable matter of life or death but it also offers him his richest material james washburn stepped out of his little house of brown wood among the other little houses of brown wood and he walked down the sidewalk into another world he shuffled over the cracked and crumbling concrete and stood on the sewer cover to wait for the bus that would take him to work and into another world people moved around him passing from one world into another and as they passed through his world many would nod and say a word and he responded in kind and then they would be gone into another world with james left in his awaiting the bus and a passerby for the worlds are overlaid on this planet like a stack of photograph negatives separate but parts of the whole and difficult to identify like holding more than one negative up to light and being unable to determine how much of the picture is in the first negative and how much belongs to the one immediately behind the people unaware that they were changing worlds would speak to james and he would respond with the youthful enthusiasm possessed by many of the elderly which was his most remarkable trait the bus came and he boarded it dropping his cents into the glass box where the handle turned beside the driver and made a cling cling cling sound like a cash register and then he walked haltingly down the aisle while the bus pulled away from the curb with its engine straining and james took a seat at the back as was his custom in his hand he clutched the brown paper sack from the brown wooden house and in it was his lunch two sandwiches an apple a piece of chewing gum the bus trundled on and somewhere along the line he left it with a blue piece of paper that was a transfer and he boarded another bus showing the paper that vouched for his fare and he rode to work watching the buildings go by the back of the bus he left the second bus and shuffled over the neat wide squares of concrete to the building of white granite and he pushed open the large glass door rimmed with aluminum and he shuffled down the marble tile floor of the hall morning james the voice said morning mistah harris james replied lovely day yassuh what do you say we skip out and go fishing harris laughed cant do that keep up the record harris approved james had not missed a day of work in years but he had not parried the offer to keep up the record it had been to remain content in the worlds of overlaid negatives where all things are black or white and the voice had been white and it would have required sustaining two worlds at once which could not be done he shuffled on down the hall and the other voices acknowledged his passing and he replied with exuberant yassuhs like the machine going cling cling cling but it was yassuh it was never nawsuh james washburn was a good nigger it was not a matter of knowing his place and wanting no trouble because he had avoided an awareness of the issues it was that he expected little and was satisfied there was a tale that james had been with the company longer than anyone but the boss whothe tale wenthad won james in a poker game often he served at parties given by the boss and other executives not only for extra money but as a favor to his company friends james shuffled to the end of the hall and turned into the room where the sign on the door had said maintenance cleotis haynes big and stupid and turner phillips young and cynical awaited him they were aides to the maintenance chief james washburn the ride to the building had been made in the morning sunblaze that is early summer and the twoblock walk and the dampness not yet baked out of the atmosphere made the air of the maintenance room steamy and sticky and james began to sweat beneath the veil of perspiration he was alternately hot and cold and he pulled a large handkerchief from his pocket and wiped it against his face hot enough for you boys he asked sho nuff cleotis said shwhew james said stuffing the sack into a locker wonder when theyll aircondition this place he had not put forth the words as a question but simply as a statement a few words thrown out in gesture to stir the air around and make the room more bearable to indicate the hope that a god unseen might bring the pleasures of modernity even to a maintenance room but turner had supplied an answer when they hire white janitors the sudden silent conflict created nervous static in the humid air james turned and saw the open door of the maintenance elevator and soas he always did first thing in the morninghe stepped into the elevator and rode to the second floor seeking a cup of coffee in the cafeteria a breath of cool air and the uncalamitous peace of a world his own james sipped the coffee and pondered what had been said minutes before but it was a passing recollection which slid away when the coffee warmed his belly he was one of the company men in the cafeteria for a morning cup of coffee in his own world in the kitchen with the younger men of higher rank in the dining room each in their separate worlds abutting architecturally then he stood and the worlds began to slide apart and he made his way down the hall again into the unmarked room separate from the hall and the other rooms and he stepped into the elevator and pushed the button as he descended he considered turner phillips james did not like what he saw and he sensed upheaval confusion and disregard for the status quo and the wonderful abutment of worlds turner and ceotis waited in the maintenance room the privilege of the morning cup of coffee in the company cafeteria necessarily denied to them not by james but by the great overlaid system of worlds where all things are black and white but the white worlds allow the good nigger to come close though he cannot enter and he can linger there on the fringe of the white world like a hapless soul standing and staring before the show window at the fine goods beyond it the rebel rejects his world as unsane and treads between worlds without his own forever in the outskirts of the system the white world reflects the man who lives in it the rebels world is rejected and it is the good nigger who reflects his worldrather than his world reflecting him cleotis james said bring the ladder lets check the lights turner go to the basement and bring up some bulbs the long kind cleotis gathered up the ladder clumsily and james led him from the room turner rode the elevator into the cool dark depths of the basement where supplies were stored and there his tension eased for he was alone where the darkness demanded no action and the coolness no penance turner languished in the peace and solitude a world temporarily his own inviolable but there remained in him the emptiness that is fear the hollowness of frailty and the fear was cold and clung like a ball of ice in his inner being for today was the day all the tomorrows were held in abeyance of the action prepared by all the yesterdays and the action would be today turner probed in the darkness and found the light switch flipped it gathered up the fluorescent bulbs turned out the light and resumed his duties at midmorning when the chores had been accomplished for the hour turner in the unobligated minutes asked james did you ever think that maybe you could be president of the company it was a question that surprised james although it had been coming since early in the morning when turner had said that the maintenance department might be physically better if white janitors were employed james turned it in his mind for it had been thoughtfully offered and then he said never seriously would you like to have been turner asked theres no way to say james said turning away but you never had a chance did you aint you full of questions not a chance in the world turner said maybe not a chance in the world the words hung in the heavy air like a requiem a cannon heard from afar the last clear word uttered at graveside the word that goes with you always and even when it is lost in the confusion of the conscious the feeling of it still is there fresh and strong maybe youll be president james chuckled i want the chance turner said james turned further away and took a step i want a chance james i cant do nothing for you boy you can help me turner said theres nothing i can do i just work here i dont own it you can help me turner argued james touched the elevator door you know what the ceo is turner said the committee for equal opportunity they send you here james demanded i told them to leave me alone theyre working for all of us turner said they need help they cant do anything if we dont help them trouble makers james said angrily i want no part of them we got to help turner said we need you james we need everybody people will listen if we stand together you one of them why didnt you tell me before now theyre educated men turner said its all been thought out its the only sensible way we just want whats right whats right whats right james exploded how you know whats right youre just a pup you dont know nothing all that booking and studies dont tell you whats right help us get away from me youre making trouble i dont want no part of it why wont you help us turner demanded because you like washing toilets you like sweeping floors youre too scared youd rather turn your own kind in and get patted on the head and sent back to the maintenance room youre too scared i got no quarrel with nobody no reason to be afraid how much will you get a twenty cent raise get out for the last time get out youre scared turner said scornfully too scared to save yourself you wont ever be free to sit where you want to or eat where you want to because thats where the white man is i dont want to eat with the white man youll never have the chance i dont want it im black im not ashamed of it i am what i am and nothings wrong with that turner whirled from the conflict hurrying to the door and as he grasped the knob he turned back with muscles stretching angrily over his high cheekbones and his mind uncoiled the word and he spat it out through clenched teeth and with disgust nigger and he was gone james sank down on the bench overcome with the violence of the argument turner plunged out of the building and onto the large neat squares of concrete under the white sky of midmorning in early summer the air was now warm and dry and everywhere was the sunglare the heat the straight silver light and his subsiding anger left him breathing deeply and perspiring under the sun and his mind snatched up flashes of the conflict and he wondered why did james refuse but james had no motive conviction bound him and it was earnest serious sincere he felt uncausably insulted when turner challenged his reasons immutabilities do not stand on reasons the lines of thought and knowledge that crisscrossed his brain were the etchings of tradition and his mind could not suddenly transform itself into a new and fresh organism vital in its origin and undestined by habit he had not fathomed the truth of his defense it had been instinct tradition speaking for itself when he had exploded and shouted turner down i am what i am and nothing wrong with that but out in the street in the hard dry heat turner stood before a show window staring at the fine goods beyond and decided that today was still the day in the building the noon hour came and employees poured into the halls with the elevator shuttling them to the second floor where the cafeteria smelled of steaming food and there was the noise of plates utensils talk the scraping and scooting of chairs on the floor and the sound of laughter there was turner phillips standing in the doorway with a sign this company cafeteria unfair to employees behind him were other signbearers out of their worlds treading between worlds about to launch a drive to enter this new world turner sensed a retaliatory mood like bees about to swarm an alien or ants deploying to drive out an invader but he entered carrying the sign awkwardly and the others followed him taking seats the press had been dutifully notified cameras whirred and popped in the sudden stillness recording the oversystem of worlds in another moment the boss appeared in the doorway a big man with a leathery face from which business success had not erased the look of country toughness his glare was chilling stern firm he moved out of the doorway and out of sight again james protested mightily that he knew nothing of the sitin and his mind boiled furiously over what had transpired in the room little more than an hour ago you worked for me a long time nigger but i wont put up with this the boss warned he stormed out of the maintenance room for the heat intensified his anger and he returned to the cafeteria where all was quiet again he surveyed the room and asked whos in charge i am turner said standing you work for me the boss said i might have known a flashbulb popped hows the restaurant unfair colored workers cant eat here turner said well the boss said breathing slowly theres two ways we can solve that problem no three ways we can close it up is that what you want no sir well then we can get along without colored workers is that what youd like no sir yes sir the boss fingered his thick chin a moment with a rough hand and he stared at turner and he measured the situation suppose we try it today and maybe we can work something out we appreciate that turner said but what we want is the right to eat here anytime like everybody else not just today what if we throw you out i guess youll just come back turner did not answer you better have money the boss said turner took a tray leaning his sign against the wall and he took a plate and utensils and went along the rail to where the food was displayed and the cameras were whirring again ham please he said the girl behind the glass looked beyond him to the boss ham please turner repeated and the word floated into the stillness but she looked at the boss well damn it girl what did i hire you for its okay she said meekly i guess so the boss said what about the others turner asked them too the boss said and headed for the doorway the silence broke into quiet talk and released breath and turner relished the slap of the meat on the plate james washburn opened the brown paper sack and reached inside for the sandwiches he had made in the morning the air was oppressive his hunger faded the boss rode down on the elevator reconsidering his decision which he had not enjoyed making he had not given it serious thought but he had known that it had to come there would be a reaction and some discontent of course but he wouldnt plan for that either sometimes spot judgments were the best he made he paused by the door to the maintenance room thinking maybe he should apologize to old james no he would understand james was not like this new breed james would understand he was a good nigger i am the white mother of a negro child this fact has brought me some problems and some heartaches but it has also brought me many joys my problems began before my daughter was born when a member of my immediate family found that i was pregnant she strongly urged me to obtain an abortion when i would not even consider it i was then advised to give the baby to its father to raise since we were separated this i refused to consider also i loved my baby even before she was born just like any mother then too i believe that while every child should have two parents to love and care for him if that is impossible a child feels more secure with the mother if she is at all conscientious no matter the difference in color i have no desire to make life easier for myself at the expense of my child since i insisted on bearing my child and rearing her i was the recipient of one more bit of advice from this same family member tell everyone that she is adopted when she is eight or so you can tell her the truth and tell her to let it be your secret people will think more of you that way this last gem of wisdom i absolutely refused to follow i am proud of my daughter not ashamed of her i see no reason to keep her a secret i want the whole world to know that she is my child whether people think less of me nr or more of me is not important only my childs happiness should be of concern by the age of eight the formative years are largely passed to lead her to believe that she is adopted and then for her to discover that her own mother lied to her to hide their true relationship could do her irreparable emotional damage since much of our true happiness in life depends on our own estimate of our worth to hide her identity would lead her to believe that there is something disgraceful about being a negro this belief set me on a road of thought which led me to a philosophy by which i hoped to raise my daughter since she is at the age of eight a happy well adjusted child in love with life perhaps the tenets by which i have raised her have some value firstly i have from the beginning not hidden from her the fact that there is prejudice in the world living in an allwhite neighborhood where she is the most popular child in the block and with the only relatives that she knows white her fathers relatives live in france it would be easy to hide this fact of life from her for the time being however since i cannot protect her forever i believe if she is prepared in advance for what she will probably have to face some day she will be better armored to meet it more importantly i want her to learn early that there are constructive ways to battle prejudice her first test of how well she is prepared to meet this contingency came in her seventh year one of the local swimming pools sought to bar my daughter on racial grounds we quickly solved that problem nonviolently by appealing to one of the race relation groups in our city the favorable outcome of this problem in prejudice gave me the opportunity to demonstrate to my child in a practical way the value of fighting back in a constructive manner if she learns this valuable lesson future experiences of this nature can not crush her spirit but can only serve to strengthen her awareness of her true worth as a human being above all i hope that she never becomes steeped in deep personal vindictiveness against persons with whom she comes in contact who personify racial prejudice that type of hate is selfdestructive it can destroy the one who hates as a reasoning human being and leave untouched the hated i have also sought to instill in my daughter a sense of solidarity of identification with the negro race two of the most bitterly unhappy people i know are women who with a background similar to my childs have sought to deny their race i believe that she will gain far greater happiness by being proud of her heritage by loving instead of hating the race with which she is identified by the people with whom she comes in contact but most of all when she is mature i think that she will know great happiness if she seeks the advancement of this race rather than trying to run away from a priceless heritage if she can achieve this sense of identification she may never experience a sense of being lost between two worlds forever a stranger to both secondly i have sought to instill selfconfidence in this little being for if she believes in herself if she realizes that she is a worthwhile person no one can make her feel inferior to this end i have put a great deal of emphasis on education we do a great deal of talking about the desirability of good grades scholarship and college i have also encouraged any natural talent that she might have artistically a deep appreciation of the creative process can give an individual a strength of spirit and mind which can help to weather many an emotional storm lastly i have sought to instill in my daughter an appreciation of the cultural things of life she has been to the theatre to art galleries museums heard music and read good literature whenever possible i have called her attention to the glories of natureto the vast peace of a starry sky to the moon in all of its phases to the soulfilling awe of a sunset i want her to realize that although there is ugliness and hate in the world there is also great beauty and this alone makes life worth living if the magnitude of a problem is to be measured in terms of the contradictions and paradoxes it embraces then the silent explosion by philip appleman beacon press makes a very strong case for the uncontrolled growth of the worlds population as the most critical problem facing the world the simple fact is that too many people are being born too fast another way of stating the problem is that in more than half of the countries of the world the birth rate is higher than the food production rate the results are too apparent hunger is the rule around the world and filling the void in the stomach with food is more pressing to the masses of the world than filling their heads with political theories and philosophies there are many who recognize the threat of the population explosion and the dangers it carries with it the central point at issue is what to do about the problem the obvious answer is to reduce the birth rate contraceptives come immediately to mind and with it comes one of the strange paradoxes of the problem it seems that the two major forces against some sort of universal birth control device are the catholic church and communism each has its own reason for opposing contraception the catholic church bases its opposition to a great extent on the morality issue but dr appleman very convincingly refutes the grounds for such an argument his feeling is that overpopulation brings about overcrowded and congested conditions which naturally breed conditions directly related to immorality the communists base their opposition to contraception as being an imperialist capitalist doctrine but many of the very top officials in russia quietly practice birth control to further explore the contradictions it would be well to note that poland both a catholic and communist country has officially accepted contraception as a valid means for coping with her population problems dr appleman is very skillful and effective in his utilization of irony paradox and contradiction to bring a point home for example he points out that it is the colored nations of the world precursors of the modern wellfed civilizations that now are the most hardpressed in the claws of hunger he further demonstrates that good deeds alone are not the answer for instance the fact that certain fatal diseases have been substantially controlled in some countries by american aid merely adds to the problem because we now have more mouths to feed than before in countries that couldnt feed their people in the first place the questions ultimately revolve around catholicism communism contraception contradiction and colored peoples until this riddle of alliteration can effectively be solved we cannot possibly hope for world peace how long can we expect twothirds of the world to go to bed hungry each night when the remaining onethird consumes twothirds of the food of the world how long can we expect empty bellies to blithely overlook the fact that americans consume per cent more food than they need to survive is it rational to think that people will love us when they know that we store more food in a year just to keep farm prices up than they produce for their starving people is it intelligent to expect people to believe us when we say were their friends and spend billions to explore the barrenness of the moon with virtually nothing for the scientific prevention of overpopulation and starvation dr applemans book offers a very strong and penetrating analysis of the problem its readable enlightening and frightening its a must for anyone interested in the world situation humanity or the horrible facts of life in many parts of the worldbrooks johnson national home visit day is gaining ground across the country and there is reason to expect that soon like brotherhood week it will be a national institution last year we understand there were some cities in states and washington dc with home visit day exchanges for the benefit of those readers not yet initiated as to the meaning of this program here is a brief resume under the auspices of local groups interested in interracial goodwill visits are arranged among a selected number of whites and negroes over tea and coffee these people sit in the living rooms of their hosts and make an effort to overcome the tensions and strains which so many americans bring to even minimal contacts with people of races different from their own the aim is to discuss problems of race which existor might arisein their communities to speak openly and honestly and make an effort to come to an understanding in human terms when one thinks of it it is plainly astonishing how few negroes and whites have had this experience it is extremely rare in this country where the two races have lived together for nearly years to find negroes and whites who visit each others homes as friends and neighbors and only that that is what national home visit day is all about and who can argue with itwell we didnt want to argue with it in truth we were perfectly willing simply to leave it alone after all these years out here on the battle lines the inclination is to be a little cynical about all these advertised gestures at friendship and goodwill we dont go around knocking them but we dont give them much encouragement either were inclined to think that the best way for people to get along is to leave each other alone dont erect any barriers and dont do any forcing thats the way people of the same color get along and thats the way people of varying colors can get along as we said we were willing to leave national home visit day alone and then an old and good friend phoned she and another lady were driving up to the north shore to visit in a home there and wouldnt i come along no pretty please no and then she put it another way the year before the negro groups had been embarrassed because there were so few negro men taking part this year only one or two men had volunteered only negro women seemed to be carrying the ball well this is a dilemma older than national home visit day and we were moved we steadfastly refuse to add to the burdens on the backs of negro women we went the north shore suburb that we visited is one of the most exclusive among that string of restricted municipalities and we were surprised to find the home of our hostess so humble humble that is by comparison with most of the other abodes in the community the house originally a onefamily structure we surmised hadlike topsyjust growed with the owner a partiallydeaf but marvellous little lady occupying the top floor of what now was a twofamily flat the humbleness of the home was deceptive on another point as well the owner a maiden lady bore the name of one of the richest and most illustrious of americas mercantile families we were the first negroes to arrive and we were ushered into the salon where three ladies of progressive middle years and one gentleman waited they were all quite sweet as we had expected they would be and the conversation daintily touched on the weather the drive from chicago and the welcome spring as we knew it would the civility and goodwill were all but paralyzing we were tempted several times to abandon breeding and to plunge brutally to the heart of the matter with some statement on the ridiculousness of the occasion but we refrained sadism alas is beyond us and then the other guests began arriving my friend and her entouragea group of negro ladies ranging in age from about to very mature credited their lateness to mistaken directions and perhaps they were indeed blameless the new white guests included a couple from texas the lady one of a type to whom subtlety ordinarily seems alien but who managed to appear subdued through the early part of the afternoon the rest of the white guests were all local residents some of them we learned quite prominent in the civic and business life of chicago as well as of the suburb settled over tea and coffee and assorted sandwiches and cakes the dialogue began and abruptly our attitude changed the suburbanites drew out newspapers and petitions and related documents and described their quiet campaign to persuade their neighbors to open the community to negroes through advertisements in the local paper endorsed by dozens of their friends and acquaintances and sympathizers they had sought to illustrate that more than morality and charity were involved in welcoming negroes to live among them in the world of today and tomorrow they had argued it is imperative that people of all races and creeds learn to accept each other these people had gone from door to door broached the subject at parties and at their clubs risked alienating friends of long standing by daring to suggest that negroes be invited into the suburb they had put gentle pressure on real estate agents extracting promises that these usually solid partisans of negro exclusion would consider negro home shoppers as they considered any others the result had been astonishingly favorable for them and for us it was all but unbelievable we sat next to a thin whitehaired lady a grandmother many times over who was interested in the theater as we are and there was much to discuss she mentioned her own children of whom she was very proud and remarked that her grandchildren were being properly brought up my children grew up understanding the evil of any kind of hatred and they are passing this understanding on to their children she said they will at least get a fair start toward being equipped to live in the world we had announced upon arrival that we had to leave early and when the time came we reluctantly departed later we talked with the friend who had asked us to participate in the national home visit day ceremonies and she thanked us for our presence we had been as she expected the only negro male in the group and the negro ladies had been most grateful that there was at least one but we told her that it was we who owed her a debt of gratitude she had allowed us to discover the sincerity and courage of some white suburbanitesand she had enabled us to glimpse the image of our own embarrassing prejudice
it is more than a hunw dred years since abra kji ham lincoln charqed themselves to the unfinished work of the dead at gettysburg even lincoln with his deep sense of mans imperfections could not know that a century later we would still be striving to abolish injustice no task is more deeply rooted in the complexities of american life poverty and tradition fear and ignorance the structure of our society and the workings of our economy all converge on this enormous wrong which has troubled the american conscience from the beginning its just solution is essential not only to give the full blessings of freedom to negroes but to liberate all of us there are those who say it has taken us a century to move this far it will take another hundred years to finish the job i do not agree great social change tends to come rapidly in periods of intense activity and progress before the impulse slows i believe we are in the midst of such a period of change it is our task to carry forward nothing less than the full assimilation of more than negroes into american life this is not to be assimilation of bland conformity our object is not to make all people alike it is as it has always been to allow ready access to every blessing of liberty while permitting each to keep his sense of identity with a culture and tradition in this way we enlarge our freedom and enrich our nation we have just passed a milestone in this task the civil_rights bill of extends the protection of law to many of the demands of justice this bill of course is not the whole answer but i ask each of you to think what an enormous setback failure to pass it would have been now your government must and will move rapidly to carry out that legislation we also intend to give new vigor to our many activities in the field of equal opportunity the congress in the civil_rights act established the principle that race or color can be no criteria for participation in federal programs last week i approved the first set of regulations to implement that principle those regulations are designed to provide just and prompt and reasoned resolution of all disputes our first objective will always be to assure nondiscriminatory operation rather than to put an end to programs which are vital to the welfare of all americans the widespread voluntary support in all parts of the country of the public accommodation title is proof of the educational value of law and the great reservoir of goodwill among americans i believe this section too will find wide acceptance it is simple justice that all should share in programs financed by all and directed by the government of all the people within your government there are many programs dedicated to the goal of equal opportunity they range from the civil_rights division of the justice department the civil_rights commission and the presidents committee on equal opportunity in housing to the community relations service the presidents committee on equal opportunity in employment and the soontobecreated equal employment opportunity commission each of these groups has a distinct and important mission those now in existence have done a difficult task in an impressive way but they all share the same general objective and they must pursue that objective through cooperation among themselves and with private groups with so many groups in a single field there is always the danger of duplication overlap or unnecessary delay therefore i am delighted to announce that i have asked vice presidentelect hubert humphrey and he has agreedto take responsibility for working with all these groups assisting in coordination of their efforts and guiding them toward energetic pursuit of equal opportunity for all these are some of the steps we are taking there will be more for as the problem of civil_rights has grown in urgency it has also grown in complexity we must open the doors of opportunity but we must also equip our people to walk through those doors thus programs to eliminate poverty to improve education and to provide housing by enlarging the opportunities of all americans assure new opportunities for negro americans there are those who predict that the struggle for full equality in america will be marked by violence and hateand it will tear at the fabric of our society for myself i cannot claim to see so clearly into the future but i do not agree i know that radical feelings flow from many deep and resistant sources in our history in the pattern of our lives and in the nature of man but i believe there are other forcesstronger because they are armed with truthwhich will bring us toward our goal in peace they consist in the sense of morality and justice which is written in our laws and more importantly nourished in the hearts of our people these feelings carried forward by men of goodwill in every part of the land will lead this nation toward the great and necessary fulfillment of american freedom in this way our peoples will once again prove equal to the ideals and values on which this nation rests is man a gorilla with a gun extrapolation say the dictionaries is the method of finding by calculation based on the known a series other terms whether preceding or following the method is proper to mathematics and works efficiently when dealing with number and quantity when it is transferred to the realm of quality and of organic life more still to that of history and of culture it tends to lose its precisely exact scientific quality and becomes a venture in creativity or at any rate a work of fantasy imagination now takes the place of calculation there can be no doubt that the scientist who seeks to learn the origin of man from a fossilized remnant of a skull that might have belonged to a man or to a baboon must be blessed with a creative imagination as well as with a scientifically exact intelligence i suppose that when robert ardrey a playwright rather than a professional scientist sub titles his book a personal investigation into the animal origins and nature of man he is serving notice that he intends to extrapolate with unrestrained imaginative abandon at any rate this is what he does there is of course a good basis of scientific evidence in african genesis the most recent discoveries of paleontology made in africa especially the most notable those of dr l s b leakey at olduvai in tanganyika give very convincing indications that the origin of man was in africa and not in asia the olduvai gorge is a deep canyon fantastically rich in fossils and in primitive tools which has preserved a seemingly completely and continuous record of the millionyear period in which man appeared and here it must be clearly said that the conclusions of this book differ radically from those of dr leakey who is certainly the most credible authority on the subject leakey says that the tools at olduvai were the work of man in his earliest known form zinjanthropus mr ardreys thesis is that the tools are the work not of man but of an ape indeed of an inferior ape a vegetarian and pacifist ape who was not even to be the ancestor of man the real ancestor of man in ardreys thesis was an ape who made not tools but weaponsand was a killer so while admitting that l s b leakey is a great scientist mr ardrey says that on this point he has gone wrong mislead by sentimentality and romanticism the term romantic fallacy occurs everywhere in the book and is used to discredit any and every theory of man which does not admit that he is a descendant in the direct line from a killer ape and therefore it must be said that the reader who picks up this book looking for precise and coherent information about the important new discoveries in africa is himself the victim of an illusion what information there is concerns mainly the discoveries and hypotheses of certain south africans whom mr ardrey greatly admires and even this information is buried in autobiographical reminiscence picaresque anecdote and pages of philosophical improvisation on the basis of the remote possibility that there were in africa perhaps a million years ago toolandweapon using homiuids or prehuman apes mr ardrey delivers a very aggressive homily in atheistic evolutionism he attacks not only the traditional christian worldview but also much more radically the worldviews of marx freud darwin and practically everyone else you can think of one theory of man after another is tossed out the window with glorious enthusiasm as romantic fallacy and all because some ape seems to have picked up the leg bone of an antelope and used it to crack the skull of one of his fellows this is all we need in order to entirely reconstruct all social philosophy all history all anthropology all psychology all economics for mr ardrey this one monumental act of violence explains everything homo sapiens including modern man is therefore the direct legitimate descendant of a transitional carnivorous erectwalking righthanded and weaponusing anthropoid because this ape was no ordinary mildmannered vegetarian no generalized fruiteating ape but a ruthless killer ape man emerged man is according to ardrey the child not only of the ape but of the weapon it was the weapon that fathered man not only that but mr ardrey even goes so far as to hint that instead of man developing weapons for himself he was in some sense developed by biology to be a user of weapons whether man is in fact a biological invention to suit the purposes of the weapon must be a matter of future debate whatever that debate may be to suppose that instead of weapons being developed for man man was developed for weapons is carrying alienation pretty far but it is quite characteristic of mr ardreys worldview and of his south african sources the consequence follows immediately man is by his very nature an inventor and user of weapons and a defender of territory the essence of human nature is therefore not so much rationality as triggerhappiness or at least clubhappiness and territoriality even sex is set aside as a secondary relatively meaningless urge compared with mans essential drive to beat up anything and anyone that threatens to invade his territory yes territory is very important here crucially important man is not really interested in woman in love in the warmth of satisfied libido as freud may have thought man is not so deeply engaged in making a living that his very existence is shaped and dominated by the system of production according to marxian dogma man is an ape that goes berserk when he thinks he is running out of lebensraum and i must admit that mr ardreys description of two rival teams of howling monkeys trying to jam each others broadcasts is very suggestive of modern political life the chief contention of robert ardreys highpowered social message is that any philosophy religious or otherwise which takes an optimistic view of man regards him as basically rational and progressive and postulates that he can better himself by using his intelligence to improve his social system is basically a romantic illusion it is absurd says mr ardrey to hope that man can settle his differences over territory by means of arbitration rather than by bombs man is a predator whose natural instinct is to kill with a weapon it is fortunate that some members of the human race are still capable of thinking otherwise for instance pope john xxiii in his encyclical pacem in terris quite apart from religious faith and christian hope it seems to me that mr ardreys thesis negates any real hope there may be for man in evolutionism after all the theory of natural selection postulates that a species is able to survive by progressive adaptation to new and more difficult conditions we armed gorillas have now reached a rather crucial point in our evolutionary development in which killing with a weapon is about the least effective way of settling our problems and guaranteeing our survival it would seem that if we cannot get beyond the stage where we were a million years agoin other words if we cannot adapt to a new situation and settle our problems by reason instead of with clubswe are soon going to be as extinct as any dinosaur the amusing thing about all this is that we are a species that has been given the choice of survival or nonsurvival we have very large skulls and presuming there is still a proportionate content inside them it is up to us to make use of them for something besides inventing ways to blow ourselves up this is so obvious that even mr ardrey after ignoring and scouting it for over three hundred pages finally has to face it in his last chapter cains children with conclusions that we shall presently see the author of african genesis is totally and slavishly committed to a philosophy of ironbound determinism which is dominated by one inexorable obsession the killer ape armed with the legbone of an antelope because man descended in a direct line from an ape with a weapon then he is predetermined to be a killer he is before all else a killer and it is folly to even consider him being anything else at least until his lucky genes have had a few hundred thousand more years mr ardrey confesses himself to be firmly convinced of mans pristine depravity thus he is committed to a worldview in which violence barbarism murder and every form of violence are bound to prevail yet the whole picture is not all of unrelieved darknessotherwise the book would hardly have been a bestseller in america what about freedom man is predetermined to be a killer but fortunately his killing habits are the basis of his freedomfreedom from vegetarianism freedom to leave the jungle and roam around the world living on highcalory foods and having a wonderful time man is a gorilla with a gunand a credit card freedom was the first gift of the predatory way and doubtless as man exists for the weapon so does freedom the progress of the weapon is mankinds most significant cultural endowment however the idea that man is capable of destroying all life with his weapons is dismissed by mr ardrey as neoromantic it presumes too much of mans capacities while a giant effort on the part of man could conceivably bring extinction to all land vertebrates it is impossible to believe that a world of insects would not survive though a nuclear disaster is according to him very likely it cannot be more than a partial disaster as a result of which overpopulation will cease to be a problem in india and instead there will be plague and anarchy a depleted population of radiated mutants may end up being devoured by rats says our author cheerfully but even this evolution will come out on top nevertheless he has another optimistic alternative which is a surprising variant of the new red or dead realism man has indeed reached his peak he has developed the absolute weapon but now he must learn to live without it at this point we begin to wonder if mr ardrey is suddenly going to say something useful what he says is this if man has to live without war he is heading for a deep decline society and culture will disintegrate without armed conflict to keep them going moral j order sheltered throughout all history by the judgment of arms will collapse but perhaps evolution will finally develop out of our race a new breed that really has and uses reason however mr ardrey would not have us be romantics putting our trust in conscience to preserve sanity and life for conscience is irrational is in league with our illusions entirely subjective and provincial it is consequently amoral it operates with symbols and emotions not with ideas and principles it is animal not rational in fact it is essentially an antirational power it has created a chamber of dull horrors called civilization and neither conscience nor civilization can save us our only hope is the presence of cain our unpredictable ancestor living in our wild genes he will take care of everything whether it be firing the weapon or avoiding a general disaster because he prefers to fight in the back streets with a switchblade knife it is old daddy cain who alone knows the answers and makes the choices we are children of cain and were it not so then for humanity there would be small hope i am prompted to reflect that this is where you end up when you lose your grasp on the real import of the higher religion no man can really exist completely without a religion and a philosophy if he gets rid of good ones he will unconsciously exchange them for bad ones if he is impatient of myth in higher religion then he will end up fabricating a myth of his own and organizing his own crude fantasies into another homemade system which pleases him better with consequences that are only too well known now mr ardreys exploits in mythmaking are not hard to observe they are evident on every page of his book to take just one example on page he wants to give a brief description of lake victoria as the spot near which man came into existence there are innumerable ways in which one could describe lake victoria out of a hundred possible qualifiers mr ardrey characteristically selects the following a hundred miles to the east spreads sprawling and enormous the cynically smiling face of lake victoria poisonous with disease crawling with crocodiles the probable focus of our earliest human experience i submit that people who read books like this need a little elementary training in semantics in the interests of their basic mental and spiritual hygiene such a sentence ana there are hundreds like it in the book has one function above all others it attempts to predispose the readers emotions by a suitable feeling of disillusionment an awareness of the general dominion of evil and violence as the basic law of all existence once one feels this one will resist the romantic fallacy and will experience less compunction in reaching for a gun or firing an icbm this kind of thinking is all too common in the twentieth century theories which substituted genes for intelligence and conscience abounded in the europe of mussolini of hitler of goebbels the second world war was not the direct consequence of mental conditioning by pseudoscientific myth the nazi dogma of race blood and land developed an ideology of war and conquest out of just this kind of emotionally loaded anthropology everyone is aware that hitlers racism was in part simply a crudely misunderstood mishmash of popular evolutionism hitlers attempts to help the processes of natural selection with his gas chambers are mentioned in the book with no particular expression of romantic disapproval once when the quiet and distinguished spanish philosopher miguel de uramuno was lecturing at salamanca in the early thirties a falangist general leaped up and expressed his impatience with all forms of humanism by shouting viva la muerte the heroes of african genesis are the killer gorilla and daddy cain the god if we can call it that which has watched over the gorillas fortune and destiny is no other than death mr ardrey is cool toward all other gods particularly to the ones that favor nonviolence and compas sion about death he waxes lyrical death is the evaluator death choses death disposes we should all be lost in a wilderness of chance had not death through a bill on choosings erected the value of the world i know if this last sentence had a meaning and i am not able to find a meaning in it myself it would be that death is a kind of free and personal absolute and mr ardrev w turns out to be no atheist after all nothing can better dispose us for a third world war than the conviction that we are doomed to fight anyway that our enemies are all wellarmed gorillas too and the only smart thing to do is to let them have it before they ambush us in the chaotic atmosphere of a nation torn by race riots deafened by the stridency of hate groups and of fanatics it is understandable that readers may deride a kind of perverse comfort from this mythology they will do so all the more readily because there is an unquestionably important basis of scientific data mixed in with the theatrical rhetoric and sermonizing of a frican genesis romanticism has more forms than one the sentimentally optimistic kind that served the purpose of nineteenth century laissez faire and the liberal myth of perpetual easy progress has obviously had its day but it has yielded to the tough and callous romanticism of the street gang or of the fascist storm troopa romanticism no less fallacious and deceptive for the fact that it also on occasion covers itself with a veneer of realism and pseudoscience this second kind of fallacy is that which we find developed and indeed monstrously overdeveloped in african genesis it is all the more regrettable because it is rooted in an intuition one which in our day has become completely unavoidableof the desperateness of the human situation this is the greatest and most urgent truth of our time we live in the presence of the meaninglessness and absurdity to which we have been inexorably reduced by our own more or less dishonest attempts to convince ourselves that we were progressing toward a definite and even a noble goal the pessimism of the existentialists may indeed be dour and frustrated but it has at least a certain stoic dignity about it but this fraudulent attempt to organize the negativity and desperation of modern man around a stupidly melodramatic killer image assembled from the less responsible surmises of popular anthropology can do nothing whatever to help modern man in his quest for identity and for meaning it is one thing to admit our violence and face it humbly and realistically quite another to turn that acceptance into the shouting and posturing of racist selfcongratulation periodically the air staff board a group of general officers meet in the pentagon to insure that their collective judgment and experience are brought to bear upon important matters concerning the air force among this starstudded group is maj gen benjamin o davis jr air force director of manpower and organization and the only negro general officer in the u s armed forces near minot air force base n d feet below the surface of the ground a white minuteman missile crew commander places a key around the neck of captain leonard i saunders the ritual denotes that full responsibility for the alert status of the missiles becomes that of the yearold negro these experiences point out the increased responsibility given negroes in the u s air force since it became a separate service in at that time military units were segregated because the war department felt it segregation has proven satisfactory over a long period of years and to make changes would produce situations destructive to morale and detrimental to the preparation for national defense prominent negroes protested the arrangement during the s some progress had been made however general davis father now retired became the first of his race to be promoted to brigadier general judge william hastie was appointed civilian aide to the secretary of war officer candidate schools were desegregated these advances however had very little effect upon the average negro airman those who couldnt fly or were never given the opportunity to learn aircraft maintenance were restricted to construction and transportation duties or other specialized tasks his skills and even his ability were a matter of debate the largest percentage of negroes about were stationed at lockbourne field near columbus ohio they operated as a separatebutequal combat unit on july the beginning of the end of military segregation came at that time president truman as commanderinchief of the armed forces issued an executive order to promote the highest standards of democracy in the armed forces the legal effect of this was to nullify separatebutequal recruitment training and service the order according to general davis was received with mixed reactions some of the men were reluctant to being uprooted and assigned to different environments however the largest percentage of the men considered the change a challenge and were eager to correct a long injustice he said lt col george j friedline who at the time commanded a segregated unit at andrews field maryland said integration of his unit took place without incident we integrated by moving all the men out of the barracks and reassigned them to quarters by alphabet there wasnt any other fair way of doing it he said in the early s integration became a practical necessity the korean crisis brought an immediate swelling of the armed forces this plus the policy of replacing troops in korea by regular rotation gradually eliminated segregation for the first time the negro was permitted to fight as an integrated member of a unit yet even with this impetus integration took almost six years to accomplish in the office of the assistant secretary of defense reported that full integration of negro personnel contributed to improved utilization of personnel overconcentration of negroes in certain specialties and shortages in others tended to disappear as full advantages were taken of the equal ity of opportunity to attend service schools and to advance on the basis of experience and ability the change wasnt as smooth as the defense department indicated it had been however it meant that identification of race had to be eliminated from certain service records and assignment orders it meant that a negro first sergeant could order a mississippian to perform kp kitchen police duty or other unpleasant duties if need be above all it meant restraint on the part of the colored airman who was assigned to a unit and found that the top bunk near the latrine was left vacant for him or that after attending preparatory school for personnel duties he was assigned to a base as disposal officer because he just wouldnt fit in with the rest of the staff for all the challenge was great but the negro airman made progress senior master sergeant grant s williams sr a sergeant major at selfridge air force base mich said attitude played an important part in the change i never carried a chip on my shoulder said sergeant williams i maintained restraint and later won the cooperation of suspicious whites who had never worked for or with a negro general davis recalls that unlike lieutenant frederick d gregory a recent graduate of the air force academy he lived alone during his fouryear attendance at west point from the other students all white lived in twoman rooms yet he was the first of his race to graduate from the school in years gregory was one of several negroes to earn a commission from the academy in its brief nineyear history after integration the general went on to command units in korea and formosa and to hold management positions with the far east air forces and u s air forces in europe today as the air forces director of manpower and organization he is responsible for all matters pertaining to manpower organization and management engineering a position comparable to a corporate vice president he directs a pentagon staff of military and civilian personnel they must justify to the department of defense bureau of budget and the congress the six billion dollar manpower requirement of the air force the general describes his job as important interesting and unglamourous one order for a reduction in personnel and i become the most unpopular man in the world he said awesome could well describe captain saunders assignment as a missile combat crew commander for around his neck in a minuteman missile silo near minot air force base hangs one of the keys that would destroy enemy targets in the event of a nuclear attack on this nation the captain is one of a handful of highly trained and skilled negroes working in one of the most selective jobs in the air force surrounded by a maze of colored lights cables and switches saunders indicated an awareness of his responsibilities by explaining that the missiles can be launched only on orders from the president of the united states by turning two keys once the order has been authenticated i cant launch without my deputy meaning capt ross w randolph also colored these keys he said pointing to the objects hanging from their necks must be turned simultaneously by both of us neither man accepted the quip that they may well be the first to send minuteman missiles soaring toward their targets if a nuclear war should break out it is highly unlikely that such responsibility would have been bestowed upon saunders and randolph prior to true negroes dropped bombs on enemy targets and strafed enemy territory during world war ii and were recommended for more than distinguished flying crosses but to have the authority to unleash tons of tnt takes stability and maturity these ingredients it was then believed were rare in the negro today the negro airman has been conceded the right to be qualified for a delicate assignment and be depended upon to carry it out note these examples during the cuban crisis capt thomas l hennagan flew reconnaissance missions over cuba in the mileanhour rf jet aircraft for exemplary courage and professional competence under hazardous flight conditions he was awarded the distinguished flying cross the nations second highest decoration for combat capt joseph s grant jr was one of the first negroes to be selected to train vietnamese air force pilots in combat support activities a test pilot capt edward j dwight is currently serving as an experimental flight test officer at wrightpatterson afb ohio he performs flight test evaluation on new improvements in design and instrumentation of bomber aircraft applicable to both military and civilian aircraft while men like grant dwight and hernagan are making history others of their race are making unheralded progress at changing the air force image of the negro at the grass roots level at an air base in georgia lieutenant walter a collins and technical sergeant bennie sparks supervise integrated staffs of military and civilians capt annie l lawrence is a personable general duty nurse at andrews afb md she cares for some patients including wives and dependents of military personnel and diplomats at mather afb calif maj haldane king a member of the first class of negro bomber pilots accounts for and budgets millions of dollars necessary for the operation of the base col william a campbell now branch chief aerospace forces division at air force headquarters has served in a quasidiplomatic post in turkey he was an advisor with the joint u s military assistance training team in ankara these men and women and thousands like them justified president trumans annulment of the separatebutequal policy which applied until the military once said that it was not a sociological laboratory true it was not and should not be but it has done much to provide a means of communication and education between the races when a negro officer or sergeant tells a middleaged white southerner assigned to his office to perform a task and it is accomplished in an attitude of cooperation this is a significant social achievement more often than not the mere performance of an assigned responsibility can at least temporarily lower racial barriers in some communities as in the case of capt keaver holley iii in brownfield texas holley braving intense heat and high winds for over half an hour piloted a helicopter which rescued an injured worker from a foot grain elevator shaft to show their appreciation for his heroism the city held a dinner in his honor holley and his wife set a precedent by being seated at the head table with civic leaders at the affair in a community which practiced strict segregation and so it has been with the negro airman so dedicated to democracy so deeply committed to justice and freedom he has had conflicts and through it all maintained restraint there have been significant breakthroughs and the negro has achieved the beginnings of equality in the air force while freedomseeking organizations struggle for civil_rights in labor education public accommodations voting numerous other areas while the press radio and television give dazzling coverage of throngs of negroes and whites demonstrating for the cause of human dignity one might easily deduce that the negro population because the goals sought are primarily for its benefit is completely activated this is not true to be sure one of the most lamentable facts to be dealt with in the movement for civil_rights is that of apathy in large sectors of the negro population the slothful attitude of persons who seem contented with things just as they are and who are unwilling to join the fight for rights is of no small frustration to negro leaders who spearhead rights movements three areas where this dispiriting situation exists are considered here first the negro elite it is in this segment of successful professional and business men and women that one would normally expect solidarity in the push not only for unlimited horizons in their own fields but also for broader opportunities and full assimilation of the less fortunate of their race i say this because the relative secureness of this group which not incidentally has been largely gained through negro patronage makes less likely their suffering from reprisals from the adversary moreover it is from this group that leadership should logically spring it doesbut in fartoomany cases negroes of the upper bracket are selfishly content to enjoy the fruits of their own success caring little or nothing about the social revolution now in progress which seeks to deliver all peoples of this land to the doors of freedom and dignity there too are some such as one of the wealthiest negro businessmen and manufacturers who refused to endorse the battle for civil_rights legislation scorning the efforts to remove racial barriers he declared that the negro automatically created the barrier himself by the lack of positive action in his own behalf that the lack of initiative courage integrity loyalty and wisdom are responsible for his not making the rate of progress that he should make secondly and probably to negro leadership the most discouraging of all groups comes the complacent element that has succumbed to tokenism these negroes gullibly note scattered privileges at places of public accommodation and the scant hiring of negroes on white collar jobs and placidly resign themselves in blind faith to an unquestioned dream about things that will naturally get betterbecause they are better now than they were fifty years ago but more than years ago w e burghardt du bois author of the souls of black folk pointed to certain human essentials which were sorely needed in that day many of which remain unattained at this time work culture libertyall these we need not singly but together not successively but together each growing and aiding each he wrote and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims before the negro people the ideal of human brotherhood gained through the unifying ideal of race such ideal is not attainable by inaction and credulity but is best achieved through positive efforts through politics moral appeals law suits public protests etc nevertheless some kind of effort must be spentin concert probably nowhere are greater efforts needed than in the third group consideredthat multitude of non and semiliterates whose lives liberty and pursuits of happiness are but unpitied abortions struck by the knife of the southern way of life blinded by ignorance circumscribed by fear degraded by the standard setters these are people who have little faith in the possibility that they too may someday be free to contribute to and share in the fulfillment of the american dream but fulfillment of this dream for the negro first requires a vigorous demolition of all apathetic obstructions that darken his vision and thwart the equality process he must take unrelenting action to remedy all the frustrating conditions mentioned afore what can be done well obviously a distinct approach must be made to each area to successful negro professionals business men and women doctors merchants lawyers manufacturers dealers in services etc who scorn positive efforts to gain in all fields full equality for the negro who fail to align themselves with the swelling freedom movement who about the race problem openly express an attitude of unconcern i would apply the same kind of technique that is now effectively used to sway obdurate white merchantsboycott there simply is no reason why these negro magnates who have made fortunes in the markets of their own race should be spared the ax of selective patronage as concerns the group that has been mesmerized by tokenism those who cannot see the hollowness of their plight because of a few dazzling democracylabeled trinkets dangling before their eyes the leadership has a kingsize task cut out for itself it must find ways of communicating to these people the truth that there are many other rights more meaningful and longoverdue where the scant tokens came fromright underneath the trampling feet of the racists to fail to demand these rights while credulously applauding the measly crumbs that have been grudgingly doled out by the moderates is to guarantee that there is where they will remain to prepare the selfsatisfied to realize this truth perhaps it is necessary to in every possible way dispossess them of their illusions take them a step backwards and snatch from them their pacifying baubles of freedom and opportunity they must not be allowed to go about unpressured stubbornly insisting that everything is all right the freedomconscious should flatly reject the apathetic demonstrators should vigorously demonstrate against them the negro press should ceaselessly condemn them the rights of the unconcerned to partake of token freedomgimmicks must be challenged at every point the complacent negro must be awakenedin a way not wholly unlike that of the proverbial farmer who sometimes had to slam a twobyfour between the eyes of his mule simply to get his attention but there are some this third group who find nothing meaningful upon which their attention can focus mainly because it is obstructed by the veils of ignorance and despair not largely selfimposed these factors of misdirection have shunted their victims far adrift of the mainstream of american democracy one vivid example of what must beand what isbeing done to lift veils from these nonparticipating citizens is the voterregistration training program in the deep south pursuing a doortodoor campaign to enlist votingage persons in classes where they can be taught to overcome some of the roadblocks set up by intimidating arbitrary registrars the young people of sncc student nonviolent coordinating committee courageously attack the mammoth problem of getting negro americans in position to exercise their most fundamental right as citizens more grass roots programs for adults must be undertaken by the leadership negro coops banks and insurance companies while upon first mention might appear to be institutions which concede and give support to a segregated system are vitally necessary to cushion the misfortunes of awakened negroes who struggling to make the transition from peonage and indignity to freedom and equality become victims of violent and revengeful racists who ruthlessly evict them from property and dispossess them of goods a notable point here however is that when the veil is lifted the negro then evicts hitnselj from his house of despair dispossesses himself of his attitude of apathy generally apathetic attitudes of the negro come about as a result of longstanding restrictive conditions that have been imposed upon him he has in the past been limited to small benefits lying within a defined sphere he has from past experience found it futile to expect any other good that lies outside this boundary thus this mental attitude has become hardened and resists change even when the restrictions which have heretofore limited his progress have been removed if this attitude is to be removed it must immediately be replaced by anotherone of hopefulness the method by which the supplantation must be made is precisely the problem of negro leadership a sultry summer day two gate posts of crumy i y bling brick stand at the city limits of holly springs mississippi as you enter to your left is rust college a humble methodl ist college very much involved in the black revolution across the street is mississippi industrial statefunded and therefore uninvolved turn left at the first block and you are on rust avenue the first building you come to an old frame bungalow is the cofo council of federated organizations center next to it is the holly springs freedom school my fellow traveler edward sheehan author of kingdom of illusion and i had traveled a long way to see ivanhoe donaldson on a night in chicago a few months earlier we had listened to this young new yorker describe the mississippi summer project ivanhoe had been a junior at michigan state university when four years before he had joined sncc now he was the director of a fivecounty program of voter registration campaign and freedom schools all centered here in holly springs we stopped the car in front of rust avenue the stifling mississippi heat and the fact that we had been tailed for miles by the police in the last town led me to shed my clerical collar and coat the collar not only made me hot but apparently aroused the suspicions of the mississippi officers feeling a sense of relief at having reached our destination safely i was surprised to be greeted by a young angry negro squat and husky dressed outlandishly in coveralls and a huge farmers straw hat he asked crisply who are you smiling as friendly as i could manage i replied that i was a chicago priest friend of ivanhoe donaldson but for this fellow this was no password lets see some id he demanded i proceeded to show him my drivers license my collar voters card etc and said brother youre worse than some mississippi police to him my joking remark was not funny listen he retorted a mans life might depend on this resentfully but convinced he thrust out his hand and said im hardy frye we shook hands he walked off and we headed into the headquarters the next person to greet us was indeed happy to see us kathy dahl is my name are you the catholic priest from chicago she asked ivanhoe donaldson had mentioned i was coming and kathy was a catholic nurse originally from the midwest she was working to become registered in mississippi so that she might stay on in the project after the summer was over kathy was very happy to meet a priest of her faith interested at all in a cause for which she was daily risking her life ironically kathy had come to the project through the protestant council of churches a tall negro teenager from the town who was present at the headquarters offered to direct me to the church so that i might arrange to say mass on the next day sunday if the priest wanted me we went first to the spanking new catholic church and school standing out almost grotesquely amid the frame buildings in the colored section of town the same priest was pastor of both the colored and white church and wasnt enthusiastic at all about the mississippi project but told me i could say the oclock mass the next morning his attitude regarding the unkemptness of the workers and especially of communist influence among them was a common one i had during the week the criticisms seemed to me to be largely irrelevant and out of touch with one of the real authentic social revolutions taking place in our times at most one of the hundred workers i met larry rubin had an uncle who was a red we went back to the center and ivanhoe still had not returned rev e g freud presbyterian chaplain to the group was glad to see us and exchanged some pleasant conversation about dear old pope john and the new spirit he engendered then we sat out on the front steps talking again to kathy dahl talking about many things but always coming back to the noninvolvement of our church suddenly a pickup truck pulled up in front of the house a young fellow hurried toward us addressed himself to kathy and asked do you know wayne yancey yes she replied but hes in memphis no hes dead he died out on the road six miles out from here they ran headon into another car the other fellows on his way to the hospital abruptly he turned went back to his truck and kathy shuddered silently she turned to me and advised me to say nothing to the others who hadnt paid any attention to the young mans coming she whispered to one young white fellow asked him to come with us and asked me to drive her and him to the hospital as i pulled the car out i remembered the wailing sirens of a quarter of an hour before at that moment kathys premonition and her experience in the project had led her to remark that she prayed that none of the workers were involved in what must be an accident on the road indeed some were involved and one was dead what i saw in that next hour will remain indelibly fixed in my memory hurriedly i put on my collar and suitcoat pulled out our rented car and hurriedly drove the mileandahalf that brought us to the greenwood hospital kathy was as i mentioned a registered nurse and was anxious to see what help she might be indeed during the next hourandahalf she was the only person with any professional medical knowledge who treated charley scales a young man in terrific pain with a smashed hip broken jaw and many lacerations the doctor of the hospital was reportedly over on the other side of the institution treating a seriously sick white man i had rushed into the hospital with kathy and was given free entry now perhaps due to my clerical garb after kathy began to give whatever ministrations she could to the injured man i decided to go back out the door and to see if what i had glimpsed as we hurried in could possibly be true indeed it had been true there across the street in a blue combination ambulancehearse lay the body of a human being horribly from the rear window a foot stuck out there like the carcass of an animal lay the strong broken dead black body of wayne yancey mr brittenum the negro mortician of holly springs stood beside the vehicle which he owned and at the direction of a policeman threw back the canvas cloth revealing the smashed face of a young man a young student from hawaii positively identified the remains as those of wayne yancey we walked back to the hospital steps in a few moments ivanhoe donaldson made his first appearance on the scene he came hurrying across the front lawn of the hospital then crossed the street heading with two companions toward the ambulance he waved a hasty greeting to me at his side was the young man who had been our greeter hardy frye his face impassive dressed in blue jeans and a tshirt his feet in sandals the frail figure of ivanhoe donaldson belied his importance this young man is a key figure in the movement which had finally begun to shake the whole nation and which a few weeks hence would be thrust before the conscience of the nation at the democratic convention observing from the sidewalk a softbellied white man his thin blond hair sleeked back barked an order to the policeman he was mayor cooperwood dont let nobody touch the body mayor cooperwood shouted hardy frye let out a cry of rage turned and ran past the policeman and gathering crowd toward the rear steps of the hospital i thought surely that one of the gathering group of policemen would seize him hardys rage at the death of his companion was compounded by a fear that a list of the names and addresses of negro farmers friendly to the movement might be in waynes pocket and thereby likely to fall into the hands of the police a sickening resentment that was new to me though not to those experienced in mississippis way began to seize me no doctor at all had even taken the time to see if perhaps one ounce of life might be left in wayne yancey in fact no doctor ever had or ever would come out to certify him as dead mayor cooperwood walked to his car and we could all hear him summoning the rest of his police force in a few minutes more policemen were on the scene including the fish and game warden in his truck when they appeared the mayor ordered the negro undertaker to get out of there with the body the only official recognition of waynes death was the police charging charley scales the driver of the car who at that moment lay in the hospital attended only by kathy dahl with manslaughter a charge which carried a maximum sentence of twenty years a civil_rights worker would certainly get the maximum ivanhoe asked me to hurry back to the headquarters and pick up one of the young lawyers who were part of the project something had to be done to see if it would be possible to make the tragedy just the death of wayne and not the slow death of the other young man in a mississippi jail as i hurried back and forth to the hospital i realized that the fatal accident in any estimation had little to do with the whole movement the car of the rights workers had been passing on one of the many hills on the road between memphis and holly springs and collided headon with a car driven by another young negro who was also hurt but not so seriously but then i thought of the constant tensions these people lived under for just one week now i had been in mississippi everytime i gripped the wheel of the car i was tense that very afternoon a police car had tailed us bumper to bumper through oxford mississippi trailed us a mile or so out of town your tension and fear as you go milesanhour dreading any minute to be stopped for speeding or for obstructing traffic for some obscure license violation for any of dozens of charges has a maddening effect on your nerves only god knows what effect it had had on this tragic afternoon at any rate wayne yancey was dead charley scales was placed under arrest and ivanhoe was told that he would have to get an ambulance to take charley to the john gaston hospital in memphis tennessee brittenums ambulance was summoned again he had to be paid and ivanhoe and kathy made the trip to memphis to get medical care for charley and to see the lawyers headquartered in a memphis hotel to find if there might be a way to keep charley from the terrifying charade of mississippi justice the evening came on quickly and quietly i promised that the next mornings mass would be offered for wayne and arrangements were made by rev freud and a young negro minister to conduct evening services on sunday for him on the campus of rust college a scheduled dance for the youngsters of town was held at the college that night sheehan and i went over and mingled with the young people and the professors many of them yaleys taking their summer vacation from yale by teaching at rust i met several young people from the catholic high school and enjoyed the evenings music played by three local students hardy frye sat around with us at the dance somehow our few hours of involvement at holly springs had won hardy over to us he was a californian finishing college at berkeley his coveralls and farmers hat were the habit of the movement brash tough willing to die hardy wears the coveralls in somewhat the same manner that francis wore brown in assissi long ago they call me mr freedom it makes me angry to realize that we need the white workers to protect us but we do if those first three martyrs this summer werent two of em white nobody would have cared but the fbi is around now if they kill me the country will hear about it and the white sheriff hes beginning to be fair he sees me on the freedom days marching people to the courthouse to register he knows that per cent or more of the people here are negro and he likes his airconditioned office and fancy cigars hes getting to think that maybe its time to start being a little fairer his deputy is still a sadist though every morning this summer ive headed downtown my job is voter registration in town the first thing i do is go to the country courthouse in the town square and fall asleep the policeman comes along and nudges me and says move on boy i talk back and say man ill move on when you move all those rednecks off the steps too and he lets me be it does the young colored kids a lot of good to see a black man talk back and like i say if they kill me theyll hear about it hardy had been arrested since the afternoon at the hospital they arrested his companion cleve for resisting arrest by not replying sir to a policeman hardy was picked up because they claimed the tennessee license on the rented car in which he sat was invalid hardy chose to go right to trial on the spot and they took him to the judge who ran a grocery store in town the fine was hardys last dollar for the moment but he paid it rather than spend the weekend in jail when he might be needed laughingly he said what are you going to do father in a place where the judge who finds you guilty and fines you cant even spell california in writing out my address some of hardys talk seemed at variance with a totally nonviolent approach but it seems to me that a totally nonviolent approach is now humanly impossible the philosophy of dr martin_luther_king jr seemed based upon the fact that redemptive suffering and nonviolence would change the hearts of the dominant white society this has not happened at least not with requisite speed robert moses leader of the mississippi project has evolved a new approach that combines nonviolence with a realization that violent reactions might come in reply and the hope must be that the violent reactions will bring a response from the power structure of the south not of love but of law enforcement to prevent further anarchy the leaders say that the last thing they want is federal occupation of mississippi federal occupation always means the preservation of the status quo federal intervention is absolutely necessary to get voters registered but the real solution lies in men like the sheriff beginning to realize that the status quo is being changed gradually but really in ten years the negro will have a real substantial voice in the destiny of his state that at least is the hope i offered mass the next morning for wayne yancey my last mississippi meal was breakfast in the backroom of a negro tavern canteloupe and coffee with kathy sheehan and frye sunday was a day to eat in the back room because the police turned out in full force on sunday mornings to stop any attempts of the freedom workers to integrate sunday worship services in the churches of holly springs finally after breakfast ed sheehan and i got to visit with a very weary ivanhoe donaldson ivanhoe wished that we could have been around longer to see what was being done so successfully in the rural areas at least as we sat talking in the center we saw the fruits of months of work for dozens of people men and women dressed in their sunday best began to arrive from holly springs and from the nearby farms they were going to leave together in a sixcar caravan and head for the district convention in greenville mississippi that afternoon it seems unjust to call the freedom democratic party a mock party or a symbolic protest as senator humphrey compromisingly described it in atlantic city the freedom democratic party is a political party real people from hattiesburg and jackson and greenville and greenwood from city shacks and barren farms people coming alive at frightful personal risk coming alive to a sense of their own dignity and power ivanhoe told us that after this days meeting in greenville the state convention in jackson would come on thursday and then on to atlantic city television recorded for millions the reality of the freedom democratic party and brought to the fore the brave clarksdale druggist dr aaron henry who summarized amidst the swirling confusion of the convention the reality of the work of young negroes like ivanhoe donaldson and the hundreds who joined them in mississippi and remain there now the freedom democratic party did not and could not compromise the whole essence of the lives of those involved is an uncompromising commitment to really change things in mississippi and the nation the compromises of credentials committees and politicians anxious to hold on to votes do not make sense to people who daily risk their lives and jobs and families the cries of senator eastland of communism the complaints about the way that the young people dress seemed so ludicrous to us at the climax of our trip and i hope to the whole nation who viewed the atlantic city convention it would be good if everyone of us who seeks false compromises could spend time in mississippi we all need to look often at the quiet dignity of ivanhoe and kathy and hardy we cannot turn away when it is time to contemplate the neglected smashed remains of wayne yancey who made the long trip back to the south from his home on jackson boulevard in chicago in order to really do something about freedom the regular mississippi democrats walked out of the national convention and after much ado the sergeantsatarms managed to keep the seats empty but we cannot go on pretending that mississippi is empty or isnt there those crumbling gate posts at the entrance of holly springs open to an integral part of america until we realize that with all that it takes in the personal committment of our lives in our own homes then our efforts in viet nam or anywhere else ring false wayne yancey is dead so are the three chaney schwerner and goodman but hardy frye and hundreds like him are alive mayor cooperwood and his like are also alive the outcome of the battle is far from certain the cost in lives is impossible to tell as you pass those crumbling gate posts the brown scenery of dead grass on the campus of rust college is noticeably devoid of any signs of new construction but as i pulled out of that town after a quick week of visiting the freedom centers i was convinced that a new holly springs a whole new mississippi and america is being built not by architects and laborers with bricks but by the dedicated young men and women of the mississippi project return of a native daughter with the inflection of surprise the young turkish woman had said well you are the very first american i have ever met who was not looking forward to going home then came her candid second thought but you are the first american black i have known i considered my bleak past as a negro in america and the uncertain future for me and my generation of american blacks of course i assured her my color has a great deal to do with my reluctance my dread of returning to the united states did not speak of returning as going home the country had never provided me with the safety the comfort the freedom that the word home implies there was something else i felt compelled to say if i were white with similar values and aspirations i daresay i still would be reluctant to return there are some things about america which render much of the country virtually unlivable for certain types or groups of peopleirrespective of race the pockets of american expatriates all over the world are evidence of that evidence of the search for a kind of freedom that is not available to substantial minorities of people in the united states this indictment astonished my listener whose interactions with americans had occurred most frequently across her desk at the us information service in istanbul i hastened to elaborate on the charge what i mean is there are strict limits on a most personal kind of freedomthe freedom to be ones self it is very keenly felt if the self you happen to be does not fit the general pattern that is summarized succinctly in the cliches allround and allamerilean this of course needed clarification i went on to describe the risks one takes in america when it is apparent that he holds an unorthodox political view or prefers to wear a beard or favors chess over baseball or elects to spend an evening in a library rather than at a party a pattern of such preferences excludes a person from conventional social contacts in america his interest and preferences are dismissed as idiosyncracies quirks or eccentricities and he is dismissed as a candidate for conventional community life there was not time then to continue my discourse on america and my paranoid streak reminded me that the usis building was not the place for such revelations rather abruptly i ended my conversation with the lady who was beginning to look skeptical but a monologue with the same theme began within me i continued thinking of the individual who is rejected because he is unconventional in american terms and how much more complex his situation is when he happens also to have the conspicuous distinction of being black his position is much more insecure his dilemma much more dangerous his condition much more tragic when an american negro discovers that he can resolve his dilemma and change his condition simply by living in another country how must he feel when he discovers also that he must return to america to live again it is like stepping naked and refreshed from a pool of sweet waters and then again putting on mudcaked ragged clothes that reek with a terrible stench such was my feeling when faced with the knowledge that some irresistible motives were forcing me back to the united states in previous generations a few american negroes known and unknown left the legendary land of the free for a european freedom left and never returned in my own generation unnumbered american negro emigrants are finding permanent niches for themselves in tokyo stockholm lagos and other places where they can move freely be themselves and at long last live for others of us however permanent exile and expatriation are themes of frequent fantasies but never will become realities i never have experienced the conviction one must feel when he knowingly buys his last oneway ticket from the united states twice i initiated plans for remaining abroad and twice the plans were abandoned why i recalled my first time abroad i was years old when i went when i returned to the united statesold enough yet too naive to have anticipated the potential impact of the european experience i hardly was prepared for the transition from restricted life in segregated washington dc to the permissive atmosphere of paris indeed i was at first bewildered by the strange unnamed sensation i experienced when i looked for a hotel bought a theater ticket or selected a restaurant for lunch or dinner later i realized that that strange unnamed sensation was the feeling of freedom sheer freedom of movement a sensation i have yet to feel in the united states that sensation accompa nied me through the streets i was aware of a difference in other peoples reactions to me and my reactions to them en passant i felt we viewed each other with curiosity or interest or indifference never with the apprehension or anxiety or disdain that i have perceived in the black and white exchange of glances on the sidewalks of america in paris during the course of development of relationships i observed that a difference in skin color was an irrelevant difference the parisians i encountered seemed to possess a kind of social intelligence which penetrates superficial aspects of an individual such as the color of his skin shape of his nose his hair texturean intelligence which searches beneath for signs of beliefs and personal identity although racial characteristics did not seem relevant in their assessments of people parisians in particular and europeans in general are wellinformed about racial conflicts in various parts of the world and especially in the united states only a few have a clear idea of what the daytoday existence of a negro in america must be like many however realize that it must be a miserable existence often i recall the compassion of their invitations to living you ought not suffer the injustices and indignities of your like in america why go back to be mistreated stay here and make paris your home in other placesstockholm geneva rome belgrade istanbul beirutthe same invitation has been extended for the same reasons it is an invitation that i have been unable to accept why the answer and insight were to be found in some lines by james baldwin it is the day he the american living in europe realizes that there are no untroubled countries in this fearfully troubled world that if he has been preparing himself for anything in europe he has been preparing himselffor america preparation for what kind of life in what kind of america am i now prepared to do battle continually on an american front or shall i avoid and evade the conflict in an insulated suburban retreat and where is the retreat that is not in touch by radio television and the press however incomplete the news with the many scattered battle grounds isnt the battle after all mine indeed it is more mine now since i have known the feeling of freedomand the feeling was good the european preparation was essential it was preparation for the role of combatantdefender a role one must be able to play until the final curtain the role carries with it a responsibility for helping to establish a firm basis for a secure freedom in america for myself and my people to leave america permanently would mean abdication of that responsibility for the sake of my people i returned indeed for the sake of all america i returned this has a righteous and an embarrassingly patriotic ring i know but rightly or wrongly it rings true is it not for the sake of america that this war against ignorance and intolerance is being waged it is an extremely patriotic act on the part of the citizens black and white who care enough for the present and the future of the united states to sacrifice personal desires and material gains to risk limb and sometimes life in this fight for freedom the success or the failure of their efforts is crucial to the survival of america america speaks to the free world as its leader what an hypocrisy what a great hoax and who in the world does not know it if america is to make credible her championing a free society obviously freedom must be extended to all the american people moreover the concept of freedom must be clarified for the multitude that does not understand it i am convinced that most americans regardless of race never have experienced the feeling of freedom they do not know what it means to be denied freedom since they never have known what it means to be free the negro in the united states is continually aware that he is not free the white american is reminded of the boundaries and restrictions in the society each time he confronts a negro facetoface or a reference to a negro in the past five years there have occurred a series of very poignant and desperate expressions of the need for freedom in the united states in many places and at many levels it has been demonstrated clearly that the winds of freedom will not blow over the land for a spell last year saw some changes in practices and the lovering of some barriers in hitherto impregnable quarters of the south but it saw also the unflagging strength of the resistance in other southern quarters and the extent of the duplicity and deceit in the rest of the country although there were several positive events negative ones seemed more salient conservatives and segregationists were demoralized and disappointed as were liberals and integrationists white integrationists ran scared while black nationalists grew more hostile it was last year that the names chaney goodman and schwerner were etched painfully in the hideous history of mississippi and just the year before the assassinations of evers then kennedy had revealed the horror that lies deep in the land that same year the year of the centennial celebration of the civil war saw the populace yet immersed in but another stage of that same war it was in that i returnedin time to watch the final preparations for our great march a march that lay bare the breadth of the unrest and the depth of the hope throughout america the march brought out people brown yellow black and white from every region of the united states people went to washington because they wanted to express their support of the current movement more important though they went because they were and are extremely concerned about their own personal freedom and wished to demonstrate their concern this seems especially true for the nonnegroes who participated theirs especially was a proclamation of the desire to be able to be ones self an often frustrated desire that troubles a significant minority of people in this strange land the march too was a disclosure of the confidence in the american system that is held by that black and white minority so often frustrated and betrayed by the american system itself it is this very system and its values which must be modified by the current movement specifically pressures toward uniformity which pervade american society are not compatible with the kind of permissiveness and tolerance which must exist in a free society by virtue of a bizarre contradiction in the culture the process of integration is a response to some pressures toward a uniform society although the likelihood of such an amalgamation is remote it may well be a threat to the remnants of negro culture that generations from now negroes may have to struggle to retain for now though the march must be toward the moment of freedom and the social implications of freedom in a new american way of life it must be recognized however that such freedom will not be achieved in america in our time from the shores of europe my eyes have the grotesque confusion the grim paradox of the real america and the ideal america from that distance the real america seemed a monstrous thing from my peculiar vantage point of extreme marginality in america black and illequipped for conventional living the confusion and the paradoxes are more vivid the image more monstrous it is very tempting to turn away from it all on those dismal days when the newscasters report all defeats and no victories i sometimes ask why should i or anybody else give a damn about this country once more i am beset by fantasies of settling down in a foreign haven where i might enjoy freedom and sanctuary then i return to reality i might find freedom there but there is no true sanctuary no hiding place i think of my unborn children and of their unborn again i know why i am here i renew my pledge to myself my pledge to the future of a free america however remote however elusive that freedom this generation has its responsibility for contributing to it i returned knowing that i wanted this period in american history to be a part of my personal history yet i know too how very distant the realization of american freedom is a fineprint item that appeared near the end of californias long november ballot may prove to be the superweapon segregationists across the country have been looking for it shows a way to wipe out all laws designed to open the housing market to negroesall the antidiscrimination legislation liberals have pushed into enactment in eleven states and nine cities over the past decade that small itema constitutional amendment which california voters approved two to one placed in the state constitution a clause which forbids either the state or any municipality to deny limit or abridge directly or indirectly the right of any person to decline to sell lease or rent any part or all of his real property to any person or persons as he in his absolute discretion chooses in one swipe it nullifies the states two fair housing laws which inhibit discrimination against renters and home buyers and bars any such laws in the future racial discrimination has been indubitably legalized the california brainchild answers the prayers of racists who complain indignantly that no sooner do they beat down one scheme to let negroes in than another rears its head here finally is machinery with the breadth and strength to do the job they want done the solidity of the constitutional amendment makes the referendum seem as ephemeral as a butterfly illinois segregationists already are gathering signatures proposing a constitutional amendment cut after the ingenious california model while in a number of other states basic groundwork is quietly being laid but the product itself is not all that dazzles the technique of marketing it to california voters was equally brilliant the most racist measure ever placed on an american ballot from first to last was characterized as having nothing whatever to do with race its sponsors the state realty and apartment house associations professed to abhor discrimination and to favor integration the issue they insisted was rights the two fair housing laws violated our inherent property rightsthe right to do what one chooses with ones own these mild laws both of them weak in enforcement provisions and administrative machinery were said to constitute forced housing it was claimed they gave government control over the traditionally free housing market and were the opening wedge for government to seize full control over private property in the future and our lives along with it in short the gimmick was confusion the whole area of rights of course is fantastically easy to confuse psychology experiments have proven the strong propensity of humans to respond negatively to anything that suggests a restriction of our rights in a gallup poll that included the south per cent of those interviewed said they would not move if negroes moved next door but in another poll which excluded the south when the question was framed the other way and persons were asked if they thought they should have the right to refuse to sell to negroes per cent said they should berkeley realtor jay force one of the architects of the campaign quite knew what he was saying much as he sounds like he doesnt when he declared were simply asking for the people of our great state to have the right to vote on legislation affecting their constitutional rights to decide for themselves whether or not they want legislation denying limiting or abridging their property rights in the th century ordinarily rational people were similarly confused by the argument that to restrict child labor would be to infringe on our right to hire without interference and that to abolish slavery would be to violate personal property rights campaign strategists foreseeing that there would be insufficient overt racists to carry the measure welded a coalitiona coalition which was characterized by congressman philip burton as the confused and the contemptible californias achievement should not have surprised anyone no state has demonstrated more racial savvy than california which has been the prime provider of our national segregation techniquesnot the south as some suppose southern negroes were still docile plantation slaves when california began fencing in its orientals san franciscos packed swarming chinatown wasnt designed to amuse tourists with techniques sharpened on yellow skin california during the past decade has quietly received and insulated a half million negro newcomers tucking them away so neatly few californians ever see them los angeles one of the most segregated cities in america thus partitions more than negro arrivals each month negro californians who number almost an even million comprise the most phenomenal component of the phenomenal growth rate of the nations largest state in election postmortems journalists observed that california had become the first state to write racism into its constitution they were years late with that credit line california won that laurel in when the state constitution acquired an amendment granting all necessary power to cities and towns for the removal of chinese without the limits of such cities or towns or for their location within proscribed portions of municipalities citizens had been so removing and locating chinese since the latter began arriving in precivil war days but the chinese had begun wondering out loud if it were legal the golden state retained this gem in its constitution until when the japanese came they promptly committed the transgression of being too industrious and they had to be told their place the infamous land acts of and prohibited japanese from owning or leasing farm land though they were sought after as hands at token wages and lands already acquired by them passed to the state these laws which withstood constitutional condemnation until after world war ii served as models for similar land acts throughout the west but california will shine brightest in the segregationist heaven for showing how to make restrictive covenants work since the ancient origin of the land deed property owners had been loading them with covenants saying the estate could be sold only to a certain class or race but how to make them stick had eluded the cleverest minds down through the agesuntil a san diego lawyer thought of asking courts to enforce them the scheme failed when an appeal court ruled that the covenant in questiona bar on chineseviolated the th amendment but gold had been glimpsed and the san diego example set off a chain reaction of similar suits across the country finally in a louisiana suit succeeded and the negro owner of a raciallyrestricted property was ordered to vacate it everywhere lower courts obliged with similar eviction orders in some states however as in california appeal courts upset the evictions ruling that racial restrictions against sale or rental violated the th amendment then a los angeles lawyer cleared that road block he was inspired to test a covenant that contained in addition to restrictions on sale and rental additional ones on use and occupancy eureka the court ruled that while the former restrictions were unconstitutional the latter two were not therefore the chinese owner of the property in question could not be forced to surrender his deed but he could beand was barred from residing on his property or conducting business on it where restrictive covenants had failed they began working again when injected with use and occupancy clauses they did that is until when the supreme court upset the whole apple cart by declaring all four racial restrictions to be unconstitutional but all was not lost as milpitas california soon demonstrated during the s that small bay area city became a veritable showcase of how to segregate sans covenants when negro employees of ford motor companys milpitas plant were unable to find housing the united auto workers decided to build an integrated housing project to accommodate them a suitable tract was found outside milpitas but the land was swiftly rezoned for industrial use at a second site authorities refused to approve the subdivision plan a start on a third site brought a sudden upgrading of building regulations when a fourth site was stymied the builder gave up and withdrew after searching four years the union finally persuaded another builder to tackle the milpitas obstacle course only to have the sewer connection fee hiked to a ransom but that outrage caused a clamor that brought state action only direct intervention by the attorney general permitted the builder to construct the project these are a few of the legalized barbed fences which the campaign of confusion painted as our free housing market that has had its indemic freedoms abused of course the negro like the oriental is not confused as to whether the real estate market has been open and competitive or closed and restrictive he knows he is forced to buy from a small fenced segment of it where a dollar buys less than in the market from which he is barred nor is the negro confused about which is the basic property right the right to buy or the right to sell knowing he cant sell property until he owns property he sees travesty in the claimed right to sell in a restricted way that robs him of his right to buy one who has been bruised by such a right knows it is not a right but a privilegea privilege those in power have granted to themselves yet californias negroes and its other minorities are not without allies alongside californias his torical racist strain has dwelled a hardheaded egalitarian breed which has demanded that all humans be treated decently and these opposites sometimes give the state the appearance of advanced schizophrenia a coalition of minorities and liberals have been able to win some important battlesrepealing the infamous land acts and zoning ordinances clearing the way for integrated housing in milpitas and passing the two fair housing laws and the war is not over currently this coalition is huddling in strategy sessions and reconnoitering for an assault on the enemys new stronghold which it will not admit to be impregnable tentative plans call for a barrage of carefullylaid lawsuits to test the federal constitutionality of the racist statute which so long as it exists gives the lie to californias claim to an open society the legislation we have j long awaited was final jj ly passed but the v ybk struggle is not yet over in the months and years ahead we must resolve in fact what the civil_rights act is resolving in law the common enemy remains the enemy is segregationand segregation hurts us all whether it be blatant in the south or subtle in the north it saps and diminishes democracy and justice let us be clear about segregation whether it exists by law or by custom by edict or by tradition by patterns of employment or patterns of housing segregation hurts our children negro and white alike and nowhere is this damage more devastating than in education for democracy the war against segregation is a single war but all too often it is waged on many flanks which are secondary to our objective the elimination of racial discrimination in education these flanking skirmishes take place over neighborhood schools over mobile classrooms over compensatory education and even over the use of a school bus these secondary struggles confuse and divide and frustrate our primary purpose they lead citizens of good will to take passionate issue on one side or the other to become rigid inflexible and frozen to forget what the enemy is and where the enemy stands the shortsightedness of many the recklessness of some is seen when good and allied policies of education are turned one against the other when the justice of integration takes a collision course against the quality of education let us examine these flanking skirmishes which lead us away from our prime objective first the neighborhood school in some cities the neighborhood school has been used as an instrument to perpetrate segregation turning our struggle for integration into a condemnation of the neighborhood school and all its works to be sure some who extol the neighborhood school do so because they abhor integration but many who defend the neighborhood school genuine desire a school sensibly close to home so conflict arises positions are taken motives are impugned and a smoke screen goes up to protect the enemy yet the neighborhood school and the integrated school are not incompatible both are good they should go hand in hand whenever possible if we must choose between them we choose integration but why must we choose we must work for both integration and the neighborhood school simultaneously we must achieve each to the greatest degree possible second the mobile classroom in some cities portable extensionsmobile classroomsmerely enlarge the segregated school expanding and containing the ghettos of education turning our struggle for integration into another skirmish this isnt mobility this is merely anchoring the status quo but mobile classrooms can be used as integrated preschool centers and reading centers they can be used for these services as an instrument toward integration the misuse of mobile classrooms does not make them bad in themselves any more than the misuse of neighborhood schools makes them bad in themselves the mobile classroom and integrated education are not incompatible the mobile classroom can play a useful affirmative role if we must choose we choose integration but why must we choose let us use mobile classrooms to achieve a greater degree of integration and quality education third compensatory education a highquality highintensity program of the very best education we can provide for those who need it mostthe children of discrimination poverty and neglect in some cities compensatory education like the neighborhood school and the mobile classroom is misused is employed as an excuse to put off and postpone integration and our struggle for integration is once again turned into a senseless flanking fight yet compensatory education and integrated education are not incompatible they are logical effective paths to precisely the same objective but here once more they have been represented as two sides of an argument and we are maneuvered into taking senseless positions if we must choose we choose integration but why must we choose we need both compensatory education and integrated education at one and the same time fourth and last is bussing and here the smoke screen is densest of all bussing is an unfortunate word it has been used in unfortunate ways when those who oppose integration speak of bussing they almost always paint a picture of school children traveling for hours and hours and miles and miles until there is little time or appetite left for school such trips to nowhere are not envisioned by the most ardent supporters of bussing a school bus of course is a means of transportation and transportation is a means of getting children to school it can also be a logical reasonable way to increase integration in some of our cities but a school bus is not a policy or a panacea the question remains what is the most effective approach to desegregation in a given city in a given school system if we must choose between segregated schools and the school bus as a vehicle toward integration negro digest march s then we must choose for the school bus and see that it is headed in the right direction and we must head in the right direction ourselves to end for all time the blight of segregation wherever it exists and in whatever forms and shapes it assumes when the enemy becomes the neighborhood school policy when the enemy becomes compensatory education whenin an ultimate kind of madnessthe enemy becomes the school itself segregation gains and all of us lose by turning once and for all from these distracting issues we shall find in ourselves and in our schools an alliance that can be strengthened and will prevail schoolmen and educators everywhere must come to realize that their natural interests lie along the road to full equality for all our citizens that our schools can teach no lesson more important for all our children than integration that they must do far more than they have ever done to see that our schools are leadersnot followersin the struggle to eliminate segregation and civil_rights leaders too must reassess their relations with the schools they must recognize that all too vital energies can be dissipated in false skirmishes they must not merely be veto groups they must move from the position of naysayer and yeasayer into creative positions saying this is what we wantbecause good education demands it all civil_rights organizations as some have should study and know about nongraded school organization about team teaching about the model school system about the experimental programs now being advanced about ways to bring all our young people toward the highest levels of education of which they are capable essential to our success in the years ahead is a working partnership between education and the civil_rights movement in carrying forward our present momentum for change we can expect that there will be strains and stresses and initial misunderstandings but these creative tensions are always vital to the process of progress our schools should be can be the peoples major instrument to democratize society to give substance and meaning to the promise of america when the creative energies of the civil_rights movement are allied and joined with the best traditions of american education then we shall find beyond legislation for equality the reality of equalityin education and in every other realm of our lives taken strictly as a poet leroi jones poems should be considered in a literary context for instance he is not a jazz poet he is not a negro poet he is not a race post as in so far as he was a poet at all richard wright was a race poet jones is not i mean a jazz poet in the sense that kenneth rexroth tries to be but when i say he is not a negro poet i mean that he is not one in the sense that paul laurence dunbar was now by placing jones work in the literary context i mean that he suceeds as a poet struggling with form and with meaning in his poems this is very clear he is a poet in the sense that kenneth patchen is a poet in the same sense that robert creely is a poet concerned with form jones may not be as accomplished a poet as creeley but he is surely in that range leroi jones titles are always good good and interesting in a poetic sense titles like a poem some people will have to understand and the insidious dr fu man chu have the necessary elements of mystery though they reek of what is often called the new american language advocated by dr william carlos williams et al the poem as an art form demands titles have to be creative too and jones well realizes this ake up wake up w boys pa was gently rolling us back and forth grinning his mischief through his toothstudded purple gums get up and help your mama it was lunchtime again and pa always walked back to the house for a hot meal because cold biscuits and eggs choke me near to death hed say now he was bending over us his seamed and lumpy face looking so much like a roughfinished bust with scrape marks of the sculptors spatula still on itrousing us for our midday chores pa was tall and a bit stooped and coal dust blackened every crack and ravine in his face and body but he was gentle and good and comforting except on his rare occasions of anger he was very angry the time he caught us throwing rocks down into the blackberry pit hed scooped us up one under each arm my brother herman and me and stormed down slades road to our house and into our room his usually squinting eyes flared wide and bloodshot as he banged shut the door threw us to the plank floor and took off his belt in one motion his nostrils quivered coltlike as he strapped us til we burned all over and ma had to come and make him stop you leave em alone leave em alone and they wont bother us he wheezed through his angry teeth and through his anger we saw fear wed never seen pa afraid before the time old man sim had come to our house to beat us because we had bloodied his boys nose for calling us niggers pa had stood up real tall you get the hell outta my house or i throws you out and old sim had left red as a poker iron another time sheriff jenkins had come to the door with luke sedges who owned the mine and called pa out into the yard and asked him about some union agitator who was stirring up the men pa shook his head though we boys knew the man had stayed with us for two nights pa never explained to us when it was good to lie and when it was bad blackberry pit was an old deserted openpit mine that had been worked out before we were born now it was overgrown with sassafras and blackberry bushes clear down to the bottom the floor of the pit was shaley and mosaiclike with white clay and rusty dust it was a kind of irregular amphitheatre relentlessly encroached with underbrush and the best blackberries in newton grew there also the biggest rattlers the pit was fested with the snakes they retreated to the shelter of the roots and stones in the bottom on warm days theyd come out into the west virginia sun to sleep and stretch one evening we counted twentyone squirming and lazing in the dust below all of the kids were forbidden to trespass even the upper rim of the pit superstition about snakes and the concomitant fears were grounded deep in the community folklore and the respect paid the pit was close to the character of primitive tribal religion of course young innocence and curiosity always make blasphemers of children the pit was well harvested despite parental taboo one day we gathered our army and laid siege to the pit and threw rocks down there to see if the snakes would get mad and come up and kill the whole town we werent afraid even if the grownups were our army would destroy them then everybody would talk about how brave the boys had been the whole neighborhood would go picking all the way down to the bottom after the battle down there the berries were as big as your thumb there would be berry cobblers with buttery crusts bubbling in the coal stove ovens juicy dumplings steaming in iron pots puffing spices and sugar smells all over the kitchen and thered be rich black jam and biscuits and sweet butter and heady blackberry wine pa cut our dreams short and chased the other kids home every buttock under sixteen was sore that night herman and i gave each other knowing glances when we got up aw pa and we put the mattresses back on the bedsprings i was to help ma hang the clothes while herman took script to the commissary for cheese and flour after chores we and the gorham boys and ned stevens were going berrypicking five left out of that gallant company of two weeks ago pa swatted us playfully as we scampered past him out of the room past the kitchen and out into the dancing sunlight ma straightened up from the wash basket to give herman the company script from her apron pocket i started to hang up blue workshirts and flour sack pillow cases the basket was bottomless i still had five pieces to go when herman got back landsakes you younguns is in a hurry interjected ma as she took the goods from herman go and eat the hot bread and crisp fatback and ambercolored pear preserves stuck in our throats and had to be washed down with buttermilk were going ma we yelled as we skipped past her on the porch you stay out of devilment she warned looking up from her lapful of snapbeans and the marbled blue and white pan into which she was throwing them we were already through the hole in the back fence we crossed the tracks coming out of old number three mine and ran up the road to hells hill slate pile and turned off at the cart trail to pick up our buckets we were late the others were already at the pit we were going to the picnic grounds afterwards to devour the forbidden fruits up ahead ned stevens who was fourteen and older than the rest of us stood beckoning us on herman was thirteen and he and ned were rivals for leadership ned led by his wits but herman was stronger and big ger hey jim herman come on where ya been all this time aw shut up we had to get our buckets herman replied as we climbed the scrubby rise of earth that rimmed the pit raymond and deane gorman stopped their game of mumbledepeg as we descended the other side everyone walked over to the pits edge with his bucket here the further down you

dust and little ned down with it im in the nest im in the nest mama mama mama whos that down there called a voice behind us mr stevens was on his way from work its ned its ned we blurted while running to him mr stevens turned ashy gray as he pushed past us and fell on his knees at the edge of the pit oh lawdy my boy my boy oh lawdy he screamed falling on his face we could see ned on his knees rolling and scrambling in the midst of the coiling and striking rattlesnakes then he went wide eyed with a loud eeeeee eeeeee and we couldnt tell anymore whether he was moving or just twitching from the fangblows as the snakes kept on striking and bobbing and dancing up little puffs of gray dust and whirring the rattles on their angry tails a long shout from the mine whistle blasted away the spell the gorham boys had run all the way to the mine for help an old company truck growled and rattled down the dusty road towards us its solid tire chain transmission groaned and jangled to a stop and twenty frightened men scrambled from its bed and front fenders gimme that spyglass growled the foreman a body less hand obeyed my gawd he swolled up biggern a cow wouldnt go down ther for all of sedges money you kids git home ma was waiting on the back stoop when we crawled through the back fence you all go on and wash face and hands theres milk and cornbread on the china boy we washed conscientiously for the first time scrubbing and soaping ourselves in silence save for the noise of splashing water and soap suds being blown from our nostrils we abluted and purged our sins in the mildewed wooden tubs and outside of a sudden came a shriek that curdled courage and twisted the heart together jesus lawdy gimme back my ned jesus help me help me help me jeeee suss and when we crept furtively to the door we saw ma stevens down the dustquilted road rolling and tearing at her bosom as though her agony had been made molten like hot lava and poured searing and scalding over her breasts then ma came in from the back and wrapped an arm about each of us and hugged us ever so tight eat your bread and milk boys when we finished we tipped to our room made the pallets and went to sleep as for me i slept deeply and dreamlessly till i was awakened by what sounded like thunder dynamiting the pit cant get the boy out they still sleep yes said ma im glad said pa although many racial barriers have fallen and others are in the process of decay the area of marriage remains one in which negroes and whites are clearly separated by the law this is true not only throughout the south but in a number of other states as well in some of these states interracial marriages are classified as misdemeanors and in others they are felonies in all states prohibiting miscegenous marriages such unions are declared to be null and void thus we see that court decisions integrating municipal golf courses and swimming pools and civil_rights acts affecting areas of public accommodation have not in any way lessened either the effectiveness or the legality of state laws prohibiting marriage between individuals of different races the supreme court has never ruled on the constitutionality of such laws and until no statute of this kind had ever been stricken by a state court a number of such statutes have been upheld within the past several years miscegenation legislation has a long history extending back to the very beginnings of the american legal system a look at this history will enable us to view the current legal question in some perspective the first law banning mixed marriages was passed in by the colony of maryland virginia followed in with a statute providing that a white man having a bastard by a negro or mulatto should pay a fine of pounds or in default of payment be sold for five years it also punished such women for marriage to a negro a mulatto or indian massachusetts enacted its first antimiscegenation statute in followed by delaware pennsylvania and north carolina by thirty states forbade miscegenation and the penalties provided for the violation of these laws varied from imprisonment for a few months to a term of up to ten years and fines ranging up to californias antimiscegenation statute dates from its first legislative session though frequently attacked on constitutional grounds they have always been upheld as a valid state regulation until recent times as of miscegenous marriages were felonies in these states alabama florida georgia indiana maryland mississippi missouri oregon south dakota tennessee and texas they were misdemeanors in delaware nevada south carolina west virginia and wyoming as late as twentyfour states maintained prohibitions against miscegenous marriages prior to fourteen states repealed antimiscegenation statutes these states are iowa kansas maine massachusetts michigan new mexico ohio rhode island washington north dakota south dakota oregon colorado and montana the exercise of control over the marriage relation by the states dates back to our earliest legal decisions as early as chief justice john marshall pointed out that all of our marriage and divorce laws are state laws and state statutes the national power with us not having legislative or judicial cognizance of the matter within these localities the control of the state in this area seems to have been almost beyond question in the supreme court noted that marriage as creating the most important relation in life as having more to do with the morals and civilization of a people than any other institution has always been subject to the control of state legislatures control however cannot be an unreasonable control in the case of american sugar refining company v louisiana the court stated that the doctrine of legislative control does not carry with it the right to enact race and class legislation such legislation may not be discriminatory irrational with no legitimate end but rather an unreasonable expression of popular prejudice courts which have upheld miscegenation statutes have pointed to the allegedly valid reason for their establishment and enforcement in scott v georgia it was held that the amalgamation of the races was not only unnatural but is always productive of deplorable results the decision said that our daily observation shows us that the offspring of these unnatural connections are generally sickly and effeminate and that they are inferior to the fullblooded of either race in physical development and strength in an early missouri case state v jackson it was held that mixed unions were incapable of reproduction later courts merely followed this precedent the courts often talk in general terms declaring that it is well established law that such statutes are a proper exercise of the states police power often substantiating this by analogy to statutes prohibiting incestuous marriages polygamy and restrictions based upon age the first case involving miscegenation to reach the supreme court and the only one to be decided on the merits to date was pace v alabama the case was tried under an indictment charging the defendants a white and negro with cohabitation in violation of the alabama code the code provided heavier penalties for interracial cohabitation than for the same offense by members of the same race the court ruled that it was constitutional and speaking through mr justice field said indeed the offense cannot be committed without involving persons of both races in the same punishment the punishment of each offending person whether white or black is the same among the state cases directly upholding these statutes as valid are kirby v kirby an arizona case which holds that marriage is purely a subject for state regulation dodson v state an arkansas case which holds that marriage is subject to the state police power green v state an alabama case which states that god made black and white different and meant them to be separate and state v gibson an indiana case holding that natural law forbids racial intermarriage in a significant case meyer v nebraska the right to marry is said to be protected by the due process clause and cannot be infringed upon by action that is arbitrary and bears no reasonable relation to legitimate legislative objectives the argument advanced most frequently to justify legislation prohibiting interracial marriage is that of nonwhite mental and physical inferiority the reasoning of a judge sitting on the tennessee supreme court is typical we know that the complainants belong to a race but recently emancipated from slavery that as a race they are far below the white man in intelligence another contention to prove that these states have a reasonable relation to some purpose within the competence of a statute to effect a reasonable regulation is the idea that racial intermarriage would produce such strong and widespread group feelings and racial repulsions and antagonisms as to threaten the security and tranquillity of the state scientific knowledge concerning the nature of race and the inherent abilities of the races has been completely ignored in recent cases which sound as if they might have been written more than a century ago the famous naim v naim case provides an excellent example of this the court said we find in the constitution no requirements that the states shall not legislate to prevent the obliteration of racial pride but must permit the corruption of blood even though it weaken or destroy the quality of its citizenship this case which was decided in makes references to racial pride and corruption of blood reminiscent of earlier decisions in the supreme court of california in the case of perez v sharp struck down that states miscegenation statute the court stated the regulation of marriage is considered a proper function of the state if a regulation is directed at a social evil and employs a reasonable means to prevent that evil it is valid regardless of its incidental effect upon the conduct of particular groups the right to marry is as fundamental as the right to send ones child to a particular school or the right to have offspring a statute that prohibits an individual from marrying a member of a race other than his own restricts the scope of his choice and thereby restricts his right to marry distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality the right to marry is the right of individuals not of racial groups the equal protection clause of the united states constitution does not refer to the rights of the negro race the caucasian race or any other race but to the rights of the individuals the argument of those courts which have upheld miscegenation statutes on the grounds that they are necessary for the public peace and order would seem even less persuasive when viewed against the holding of the supreme court in cantwell v connecticut the court held in every case the power to regulate must be so exercised as not in attaining a permissible end unduly to infringe the protected freedom the danger in these times from the coercive activities of those who in the delusion of racial or religious conceit would incite violence and breaches of the peace in order to deprive others of their equal right to the exercise of their liberties is emphasized by events familiar to all the supreme court has finally agreed to hear a case which deals with the question of miscegenation statutes in a florida court upheld a statute which proscribed cohabitation by persons of different races the court concluded its opinion in mclaughlin v state by setting forth its views concerning miscegenation statutes it said if the newfound concept of social justice has outdated the law of the land and by consequence some new law is necessary it must be enacted by legislative process or some other court must write it the florida court felt that it was obligated to uphold miscegenation statutes by the sound rule of the stare decises and the precedent of past decisions this is the case which the supreme court heard and ruled on last december it avoided the greater issue of those statutes prohibiting interracial marriage itself ruling only that the florida law prohibiting interracial cohabitation was unconstitutional but most observers believe that the court will strike down all such laws it is admittedly up to the states to establish a public policy concerning the marriage relation if we accept the view that such policies may be based upon whim or prejudice however we might decide that it is wrong for baptists to marry presbyterians or catholics to marry lutherans or jews to marry methodists no end is in sight when men may write their prejudices into the law with no standard to meet we have ceased to be a society of law and have become a society ruled merely by men discussing the possible aftermath of an elimination of the various miscegenation statutes an article in the university of illinois law review presented this assessment although emotion dictates that the consequence of a sweeping invalidation of interracial marriage statutes would be widespread other indications are to the contrary human behaviour in the area of sex is not basically motivated by a careful regard for the statute book above and beyond considerations of racial equality all who defend such laws must remember the legal axiom that a law should cease when the reason for the law has been removed a scientific view that holds the races to be inferior has been cast aside the idea that government may deny rights to people because allowing them their rights may cause trouble has also been abandoned the marriage relation is within the realm of state authority but every restriction must have a reason once these two ancient reasons for prohibiting racial intermarriage have been removed only prejudice remains to enforce them afewerk tekle is an extraordinarily imposing manin both physical stature and artistic achievement standing over six feet he has

ethiopian visitor toured major museums and art centers in chicago he confided that he had made a similar tour of european art centers following the completion of his studies at the central school of arts and crafts and the slade school of the university of london dont get yourself iny volved in the racial troubles of the couno was the recurring advice i received prior to my departure for this country scores of people must have said to me in almost the same words so when i reached the airport in new york my first step on american soil seemed to have encored those identical words i almost said aloud i wont please i was determined not to become involved as i had promised my wellwishers at home not knowing that as long as i came along with my skin there was no way out of it it is a year now since i left home and within this short time not only have i heard and read so much about the racial discrimination of this country but i also have had occasion to experience it personally i now know what an awful experience it is most of the racial friction that one comes in contact with is that between the white and the colored people one rarely hears of discrimination among negroes themselves there are negroes whose color is on the borderline between white and black and if given a choice some of them would rather choose to be classified as whites from what i have seen here in manhattan kansas it seems there are two categories of negroes white negroes and regular negroes negroes who due to some unfortunate circumstances were born with a very light skin seem to regard themselves as a more privileged class of negroes than those with a darker skin this is something i cannot understand i first noticed this attitude on our campus observed that most of the white negroes prefer the company of either white americans or other white negroes and the black negroes kept to themselves the black negroes in turn loathe the company of african students this to me indicates that some of these negroes regard the whites as superior to the blacks by virtue of their white skin and that is precisely what some people have dedicated their lives to correct or is it not outside the campus the situation is not any better downtown i usually see negro couples who seem to pair up according to their color this looks so intentional that i find it difficult to dismiss as merely coincidental of course there is nothing wrong with this as long as it is coincidental but it is when the choice is made with a definite preference to a lighter skin that find it objectionable this white preferentialism is perhaps more noticeable in the negro clubs here it is very rare to see a very darkskinned negro boy with a very lightcolored girl in fact one of the boys i met in the club told me in the course of a conversation that among the negro boys there is a mad rush for any girl with a light skin and the lighter her skin the more keen the competition for her the girls too scramble to win the favors of a boy with a white skin just what is all this about i cannot imagine a more inappropriate time for this fashion craze it is bad enough for whites to discriminate against blacks and vice versa but is it not ridiculous for blacks to despise other blacks because of a slight difference in intensity of skin pigmentation is this situation helping the fight for racial equality what is wrong with the black skin that one should be ashamed of it i think god made the right choice in everybodys color and i dont believe one is superior to the other in fact my dark skin is one of the things i have that i can be proud of while this mania may not be sufficiently obvious to the indigenous citizens we should remember that we do not always see ourselves as others see us it may all turn out to be a peculiarity of the negroes in this community alone but there may be a danger of its spreading to infect some healthy societies i do sincerely hope that this situation does not exist among negroes in other parts of the country let us all wear our skin with dignity and pride for black is the right color for us she came across the front promenade of the upper tier of the park behind the library at th ave and nd st she walked slowly looking up with unhappy little eyes at the idlers lounging and leaning against the benches and balustrades on both sides of her of all that polyglot crowd escaping the hateful june sun by crowding into the shade of the park trees she was unquestionably the tiniest and most spectacular she stood under five feet and her thin body and fleshless legs attested to her need of proper food and care even if her face which was oddly fat and rosy denied it as she neared the spot where i stood where the balustrades broke into a stairway leading to the parks lower tier i saw that her skin was unhealthily yellow beneath the rouge that the uncombed fragments of hair which hung from under a onceelegant embroidered hat were in need of fresh henna and that her faded cotton frock her woolen jacket and unseasonably heavy cotton hose were exceedingly dirty i admit i stared at her seeing the womans busted nearsoleless shoes i suddenly thought of my own mother who must have been this womans age and who has even now an unconquerable passion for shoes in almost such a state of disrepair i felt a great compassion and sympathy for the little woman i had been occupied with the approach of the disreputable brown oxfords when i raised my head and looked straight into her slategray eyes she stopped a few feet in front of me and spread her shapeless little legs thrusting her hands to her hips in a startling motion and while i stood looking at her the dull eyes flashed like steel blue flames her tight little mouth opened revealing three or four tobaccobrowned teeth and a coarse incongruous voice spat out at me you black sonof abitch standing there rolling your eyes at me dont blame me cause im white and youre black that said she puckered her thin lips as if spitting or me then continued haughtily down the steps and through the park lane without changing her leisurely pace on one of those warm sunny october days in florence found myself wandering about the narrow streets of the old city keeping always within reasonable proximity to the puny arno so as not to get lost i went unnoticed over the cobblestones between gray and crumbling buildings for most italians had long since accustomed themselves to the presence of all shapes and sizes and colors of soldiers but when i emerged from a sunless thoroughfare we in america would call it an alley just at the base of the rambling and imposing stairway of the pitti palace i met a spunky little old lady who did notice me i had no idea of her age other than that she was beyond sixty she had not one tooth in her head and apparently had had none for a great many years but she had striking little blueblack eyes and an aggressive chin untidy and lustreless gray hair and a beaked nose like the ones all witches are supposed to have she was barely five feet tall and she wore a faded black sack of a frock which though not large was like a tent over her slight frame she flashed her charming toothless smile at me and irather ashamed at the moment of my strong set of natural foodgnashers smiled down at her she abruptly reached out her bronzed and bony right hand and took my left hand her strength was quite as surprising as this unexpected maneuver but not nearly so surprising as what she went on to do her other hand slid along the right side of my face and the rough fingers experimentally touched my lips all the time a stream of language poured forth from her throat in a low liquid tone but the only words i recognized were nero black and belli denti beautiful teeth then satisfied i was not an apparition she suddenly gripped me behind the neck and pulled me forward and downward and before i had time to think anything at all she kissed me dryly on the cheek and released me she stood there for a moment afterwards composed and smiling while i felt flushed and foolish when her hand moved toward me again i started but she merely gave my arm three very gentle pats and still smiling alluringly said arrivedici and glided resolutely down the dim alley of a street the average fan of marian anderson greeted with the rumor that she will retire this year reacts rather as if he had been told that the statue of liberty had decided to take a seat the singer draws a careful distinction between her announced farewell tour and retirement i have never said i would retire she explains all the announcements have carefully called this a farewell tour to retire means you put the lid on this and its finished but reactions to the news have given her great happiness i was leaving a store the other day with a package tucked under my arm and i heard this voice behind me saying yous quittiny i didnt turn around and it said again yous quittiny i looked and saw it was a sales girl not of my race this time she looked at me accusingly and said yous quittin you cant do that i know that you cant always sing but it is not like a faucet you can turn off and say this is it if it was many people would have found it easy to stop and not come back to make those endless series of farewell tours if you are not to be exclusively involved in singing one believes this is the way to do it not by giving a few less concerts each year until you finally give just one people keep asking you what you are going to do afterwards we thought one would like to work with children the idea is to be of service one does not want to sit and hold her hands it would be work for the young who cannot get help the world and people are so uncertain it is not easy to find foster homes when things are so uncertain so precarious but one thinks many people would take children if foster homes were explained to them in a different way this plan helps the doer and then the community and then the state and finally the whole government one cant be paid back it is a thing of the heart and of the soul miss anderson was sitting in the living room of the ranch house her architect husband built in the connecticut hills she was wearing a dress of navy blue chiffon with white polka dots and navy blue sneakers and may well be the only woman in the world who can somehow make sneakers elegant it is a fascinating thing in talking to her to find how aware one is forced to become of her eyes her face is strong and exquisitely modeled but over and over again the listener is made aware of her eyes dark liquid and infinitely expressive suddenly you know that whatever her own reason is for singing so often with her eyes closed it is just as well because if you watch these eloquent eyes you might find it difficult to hear the music and although the nature of her artistry has never made miss anderson noted for comical gifts she has for punctuation of a joke one of the best winks in the business perhaps her dedication to the fate of children was begun a few years ago when she went back to the philadelphia neighborhood where she grew up there were beautiful big brownstones now even the rooms were cut up you find two families living in one divided room a child or is taking care of the little ones while the parents work where do you suppose a childs mind is she cant wait for the day to get out of school for good we think a great deal is lost in not letting them be susceptible to the good things as well as the bad when you think of what one would like to do the area broadens all the time and you feel smaller and smaller and smaller we have not found yet the absolute niche in which one would hope to fit but it would be to help the young people in their teens and the young parents the older parents too if some sort of elevating entertainment could be arranged to find what they like and give them what makes them reach so many people wonder what they could do wonder what we could have done and didnt but you can t upbraid other people and you cant let others do it for you like peace it must begin in the heart and the soul the singer is well aware that this dream of hers is a matter for the future the tour of farewell this season opens next month in washington and will conclude easter sunday in new york but already there are requests from europe especially scandinavia where she made her first sensational successes and from south america there is also a proposal to sing in africa where she has never been she welcomes the idea of going back to places where she has sung before always with the hope that some day she may see something of the cities she whisked through so often it was a close miss arriving at six giving the concert and then away early the next morning one did not worry at the time but always felt one would come back you did not feel that the years were taking you with them then you realize youve been going along with them miss anderson takes apparent pleasure at this point of her career in recalling what her early hopes and ambitions were you see so many young people getting out of college rosy eyed the world is theirs and you wonder about years later how many will get what they wanted at a very early age i knew music took absolute precedence at the start even when music was soft it drowned out any conversation for me one of the first desires i remember was to go away and sing not to leave my family but to travel and most of all it was in geometry class where i was a poor student and always thought this is the day i want to be on a train going away i prayed to the evening stars to have concerts and go away and in high school i prayed to sing at the metropolitan with that company there there wasnt enough money to go when it came to philadelphia but once my teacher advised me to find out about tickets when they told me how much the price was i answered but i only want onev in agreeing that so often through her career her publicity has seemed impersonal the singer says one often talks of all the people who made this moment possible but then the selection is up to the reporter one has no control over it vehemently she recalls that it was utterly utterly hopeless to see mr hurok in new york when she first hoped to have him manage her and she likes to recount how by chance he finally came to hear her in paris we have never had a contract he would send me one but somehow i never signed it i would not advise this for other people but it has been our way that sentence ended with one of her best winks the history of the united states in the first half of this century will always be inextricably entwined with the career of marian anderson as a negro she endured many slights in the early days which undoubtedly accentuated her natural shyness but they could not have been more vividly counterbalanced than on that famous easter in when at the lincoln memorial she sang to people there is so much pride and joy in my people for the united states the only country they know there are all classes all kinds among negroes just like anyone else sometimes it is not thought that we think feel and see as others sometimes there are things unknown to a person who thinks he does not have prejudice a person in a strange place will look up and a frown comes on his forehead you say what your mission is but you generally dont know what to expect i was delivering something to an affair recently and in this hall a young woman looked up with furrows in her brow then someone said to her thats so and so then it was all right but you are not different after you are identified you are not taken at face value but you can only feel sorry for people who need these things to live on who havent found other things if one can be mean for any reason because a person is black or anything he can be mean to his own people if circumstances inspire it at home the singer is mrs orpheus fisher and she delights in telling how she arrived with her husband after the wedding and heard him announce to the servants loudly anybody who calls my wife miss anderson gets fired prominent in the living room of the house is a beautiful long low table with drawers in it cut down from a sideboard bar in mr fishers workshop i found it in the back of an antique shop miss anderson recalls i ran my finger along the edge of it and then around the end and my heart began to go bump bump bump i got it home but i told my young man before he saw it that if he didnt like it i would take it back he said darling its wonderful then i kept getting up in the middle of the night to see if it was still there miss anderson has recorded for publication this winter a collection of spirituals hall johnson has a whole storehouse of them that have never been heard of the seven we talked about i had never even heard of five of them before a strong believer in the powers of affection the singer likes to tell of a friend who took a rose from her garden this new rose was given our name and a friend of mine took a bud in her car to new york and it drooped but she cared and restored it and it was as erect as can be so many things respond to the tiniest touch of consideration or love the recognition that you or it exists like a swelling theme the singer returns with her classic calm to the subject of prejudice you may think you know whats in anothers head but you dont if a man has an intelligent reason theres nothing wrong with him not liking one negro or all negroes but not if he does not have an intelligent reason you can put a stigma on a person so easily you can say theres a dangerous dog but remember that maybe the person he bit was someone who hit him
aperusal of recent studies reveals some curious facts about the way negroes spend iheir money they were found to splurge in certain spheres in a pathetic effortsome authors believeto compensate for white contempt while there is not much new about that hypothesis some of the elements of negro spending when compared to whites at the same income levels are interesting enough to warrant close inspection take for example the negros special devotion to clothing particularly their preoccupation with hats and shoes negroes buy dress shoes almost twice as frequently as whites the new york times reports a survey of neighborhood stores conducted by jack schwartz a social science research analyst for the united states information agency found hats and shoes more frequently exhibited to negroes and more frequently placed in ebony advertisements than in life however i do not accept in full schwartzs explanation that negroes buy hats and shoes in a way to conceal their personal characteristics such as long narrow shoes for thick chubby feet and hats to hide the texture of their hair although this is done sometimes in an effort to approximate the frail characteristics of the white ideal i believe that the basic explanation rests in a cultural pattern whose roots reach back to slavery negro slaves were often compelled to go without shoes even in winter and without hats under the hot summer sun according to accounts by ullrich phillips in american negro slavery and the testimony of my late paternal grandmother who was a slave child in tennessee negroes accordingly came to overvalue these apparels as indicated by the songs they sang they sang in their fantasies that all gods chilluns had shoes and were going to put them on when we got to heaven anyway slaves in general were sick of wearing only handmedown clothes from white masters and their families and placed a high value on the possession of personal clothing but the fixation of todays urban negro on clothing has some subtle sociopsychological foundations thorsten veblen theory of the leisure class describing the antics of the white leisure class of a generation or more agowhich the negro particularly the upper class is just now emulatingpointed out that clothing gained a special significance in the city in the small rural communities from which most big city negroes have migrated everybody knew how many suits you owned and whether you ordered them from montgomery wards or spiegels and what price you paid as well as your general socioeconomic status so it was useless to put on a front but in the anonymity of the city to which negroes have more suddenly and extensively been exposed the strangers one encounters on the bus and the subway do not know ones true status thus the need to spotlight position by attire veblen also observed that the practice of creasing pants and shining shoes arose because of the need for leisure class individuals to show that they were free from work working class persons began to emulate them pretending themselves when possible to be free from work since one could not have done manual labor and kept shoes shined and pants creased during my days as a dishwasher busboy and factory laborer i observed some persons wearing their dress suits to work and leaving them in the locker while they changed over to work shoes and clothes one individual even carried a brief case so that people on public vehicles would think he was a lawyer all of this is to say that a negro dressed in a hat and fancy shoes is obviously not a laborer this condition occurs so seldom that he desires to spotlight it when he can add to this the fact that negroes are more likely to have a rural background where they grew accustomed to walking more and to wearing out their shoes by more walking the resulting corns may cause them to pay more attention to the quality of their shoes hats however cannot be readily rationalized except as stated above in general negroes appear to buy what they want instead of what they need or as one oldtimer put it they buy what they want and borrow what they need they devote a smaller share of their budget to medical care for example despite a greater exposure to accidents and ill health it is pathetic to watch some children with correctable defects in the negro ghetto neglected in the matter of medical attention by parents who spend the money on other things one of the most interesting areas of negro consumption is food in spite of the popular belief that the best way to attract a negro is with food negroes spend a smaller proportion of their income on food than do whites at the same income levels it may well be that negroes seeking to make amends for conspicuous consumption in other spheres cut back on food intake or its quality i have known more than one individual to rely on a diet such as oatmeal or bananas three meals a day while paying for an expensive car true part of the difference in food expenditures is explained says marcus alexis writing in the american journal of economics and sociology by the fact that many negroes work as domestics and in restaurants and hotels where they get some of their meals free but this does not seem sufficient to account for all of the difference of the foods negroes do purchase they spend less for protein foods milk cheese vegetables and fruits than white families at the same income levels nor is it necessarily true as white farmers in the south sometimes say that a nigger and a mule can get along on next to nothing rather we may again trace the practice back to slavery and the southern plantation where negroes were conditioned to rely on the leftovers this gave rise to their taste for chitterlings pig feet pig snouts pig ears pig tails hog maws neckbones chicken feet chicken necks gizzards and greens many varieties of which they could pick growing wild in the fields and by the roadside besides food is consumed in the privacy of the home where others have no knowledge of it and so its status value is more deceptive there are however periodically planned dinners where some showingoff can be done also when company is present special meals typically including a surplus of meats are prepared in the pretense of eating better than is actually the case coming down to certain luxuries including personal care ointments hair pomade creams etc recreation and liquor most studies show negroes spending a greater proportion of their income than whites at the same income levels part of the devotion to personal care especially hair straighteners and the like has been said by observers to represent a desire to approximate white standards of beauty while this is sadly true to some degree we must again consider that while these practices may have been initiated for that reason they have now come to represent a cultural norm personal care also may have taken on special interest to negroes because in the days of slavery they were denied such commodities as storebought lotions for which they used grease scum from the dishpan hair preparations using instead grease fat or shortening and tooth powder for which they used ashes and baking soda contrary to popular fallacy however studies show negroes owning cars less frequently than whites but just because fewer negroes own cars does not mean that those who own them are not prejudiced in favor of the more expensive models also in the case of cars they must compete headon with whites who too have a fetish for fine cars in fact there is sometimes a kind of rivalry between the races many negroes have boasted of driving down south in a big car and watching the white folks eyes bulge the late prof e franklin frazier in black bourgeoisie found negro physicians who would not attend their supposedly scientific meetings because they did not have a cadillac or an expensive car certainly cars can be flaunted before others better than household furnishings and equipment which can be seen only by household visitors thus in some localities especially where there is a great tendency toward furnished apartments negroes spend slightly less on household furnishings this is not necessarily true of the upper classes however melvin tolson the poet has observed that jews will go into business and live in the back staying there for years while building up the business a negro too whenever he goes into business may live in the back but as soon as he makes a profit his wife is likely to lead him to throw up a big house filled with scandinavian modern aborigine furniture instead of a bigger business then he parks beside the house a car longer than the house is wide fraziers observations in black bourgeoisie would seem to bear out tolsons contention restrictions on negro recreation and his shorter time off from work might lead one to expect that he would spend less on recreation but this is not the case unless reading and educational endeavors are included in the calculations the answer i think lies in the fact that recreation is recuperation from the drudgery of work which besets negroes more stringently than whites just as negroes according to vance packard in the status seekers spend twice as much for liquor to lift their spirits they also resort to recreation for this motive frazier suggested that negroes also play a lot in the effort to get whites to take them seriously much of the negros expenditures on recreation in any case consist of money paid by the black bourgeoisie for social responsibilities we may conclude then that no single factor is responsible alone for the negros expenditures rather there are a combination of factors some more important than others they may be summarized as the desire for social status denied them in a white society the desire for social acceptance especially acceptance by whites and the negros special social circumstances let us take them up one by one and determine their relative impact because of the negros compensatory need to clamor for status advertisers who must be aware of such matters in order to be effective more frequently appeal to status when addressing negroes a pittsburgh courier survey of housewives found negroes highly brandconscious with a special preference for higherpriced brands the american journal of economics and sociology reports a predilection on the part of negroes for shopping at higher priced stores especially stores from which they were formerly excluded i have watched some negro women shoppers in the more exclusive downtown stores some were observed to duck in an exclusive store first to buy a shopping bag bearing the exclusive name then head straight for the cheap sales others sneak down to bargain basements and fill their bags with goods hopefully without being spotted by anyone of their acquaintance if caught there by friends they may pretend that they had meant to get off the elevator on the mezzanine or were in search of the restroom women in the upper class have been observed to place their coats on the backs of chairs in a way to exhibit expensive labels others in small gatherings pretend that their feet are hurting and kick their shoes partly off to reveal expensive brands still others will lie about where they bought their new furniture and their dime store jewelry a study of lowincome families in new york david caplovitz the consumer behavior of low income families found negroes twice as likely to buy high priced television sets three times as likely to buy phonographs costing or more and twice as likely to buy washing machines at or more than lowincome white families a new york times report also reveals the negros quest for status in his purchases there is evidence also that negroes in the effort to make their swift transition from the personal friendship of the rural community to the impersonal nature of the metropolis seek fellowship and social acceptance in their buying activities prof joseph t johnson of lincoln university missouri in the negro potential has observed that cosmetics used to improve personal appearance and identifying property such as clothing both of which negroes spend more on may be used to make oneself more socially acceptable white salesmen have discovered the use of mr and miss when addressing negroes particularly in the south to be especially effective as a gimmick other negroes are swayed by the fleeting approval of a white clerks superficial smile a study of low income families in new york found that negroes were three times as likely to buy from doortodoor peddlers that they cherish this facetoface contact as compensation for metropolitan impersonality is borne out by the fact that the likelihood of buying from peddlers lessened with length of residence in the city the same study showed whites doing slightly more creditbuying from large impersonal department stores and discount chains and negroes four times as likely as low income whites to buy on credit from neighborhood dealers a study reported by john harp in the american journal of economics and sociology found migrants less likely to buy from chains and more likely to patronize neighborhood stores than in the case of urban born residents negroes however show a greater tendency to buy outside their neighborhoods or generally in white neighborhoods one marketing research agency found them especially likely to buy in the suburbs where they cant live in doing so they are seeking escape and respite from their own areas and acceptance on an equal plane with whites one member of a secret society conventioning in detroit when asked whether he had met discrimination there replied that he was too busy spending money to be discriminated against such negroes feel that they can buy their way through the wall of segregation can purchase white acceptance they are bellbent on proving that they are just as good by god as whites or more pathetically that they are in fact not even different from whites since they have few occupations of prestige they concentrate on consumption as a symbol of status they are dedicated to the proposition that all money anyway is created equal the ability to pay money becomes the only proof to whites that they are not inferior upper class negro women try to outshine whites at integrated gatherings boasting later of having stolen the show by virtue of their attire others get mad when store clerks suggest a darker shade of face powder a red item of clothing or a larger shoe in this regard negro market experts have advised white advertisers to use an integrated approach one went so far as to recommend that advertising be worded in such a way that no reference is made to race as for negro customers an ebony magazine study during the early fifties of families asked negro customers the question some readers of ebony prefer negroes in the advertising picture others prefer whites in the advertising picture how do you feel about this less than half of the negroes preferred negroes the new york times recently reported that the use of negro models in ads repels some negroes just as many are repulsed by colored dolls for their children when a store in chicagos south side negro section put in colored mannequins business fell off further proof of the pursuit of white acceptance in buying is the fact that a house in a middle class white neighborhood carries more status than a house of the same quality in an uppermiddle class negro area similarly an apartment in an integrated building has more prestige than otherwise would be the case although such negroes will claim to be motivated merely by a desire to advance the race this is not alone the case many are angered and resentful when other negroes move in and friends left behind in allnegro buildings will predict and secretly hope that the whites in the newly integrated building will soon move out this does not mean however that all negro splurging is due to their special quest for status and acceptance many are newcomers to the city anxious to lose their rural identities but unskilled in meeting easycredit lures and overcharging lowincome negroes are more than twice as likely as whites at the same income level to buy on credit credit not only allows them to purchase the goods they want it also gives a stamp of approval to them as customers as migrants to the city and frequent movers within the city they are uprooted and have few other outlets for social approval their occupations generally put them in a low class position and having little prestige on the job they are led to compensate in other ways among which is spending also women in the negro family have a greater control over the purse strings by virtue of their employment and historical position see the frustrated masculinity of the negro male negro digest august this could help to skew negro spending in spite of all of the foregoing negroes are still too poor to be real spendthrifts as myrdal an american dilemma quickly realized in his studies negro income is barely more than half that of whites but this simply makes it all the more important that they spend wisely the money they do have the roots of racism virtually all analj yses of racial and re y p ligious hostilities are childishly naive and run away from the very problem to be solved by all sorts of vehement namecalling and outbursts of indignation accordingly any report of a lynching is told in terms of stark melodrama as simple and uncomplicated as a movie western the villains of the dramathe whites naturallyare the bad men the heroesthe innocent negro victimsare the good men lynchers then are just a bunch of hoodlums bums loafers and hooligans if only some way could be found to throw all these bad men in jail there wouldnt be any more lynchings the causes of the white mans cruelty to his negro fellow americans are various and manifold and it would require an analysis of all the complex historical sociological economic political and ethnic factors to understand a problem of such scope and immensity but however multitudinous and complex the psychological factors outweigh all the others combined the fundamental psychological cause of the white americans contempt for the negroes is his unconscious need to project his own inferiority and guilt upon another people unless this basic phenomenon is properly understood then the hundreds of books written about better interracial relations and the millions of words spoken by men of good will in lectures and sermons will continue to be of no avail when the psychological basis underlying the white mans cruelty to the negro is really comprehended then for the first time it will be seen that the men who participate in the mutilation and murder of their negro brethren are not necessarily all hoodlums and hooligans they are for the most part men like you and me and our neighbors differing from us principally in one respect you and i and our neighbors not subject to the same historical social and economic pressures as the southern lynchers have found less violent means of relieving the unbearable tensions of our feelings of inferiority and guilt very few persons in our society are so blessed or gifted or fortunate as to be free of feelings or inferiority and inadequacy unworthiness and guilt indeed so central is the torment of guilt in the western world that two ancient religious faiths judaism and catholicism have formally institutionalized the feeling of mans selfabasement the jews in yom kippur the high holy day of repentance for sins the catholics in confession the sacrament of penance and as if the consciousness of guilt and inferiority were not already sufficient to plague most people this sorely disturbing feeling is deepened with the passing of every day except for those rare paragons of beauty and grace who walk the earth in every generation the overwhelming mass of men and women spend their lives in quiet desperation regretting that their bodies and faces their talents and accomplishments their worth and achievements are so many millions of lightyears distant from their hearts desire how pitiably small a number of men can regard themselves in the words of the psalmist as a little lower than the angels and crowned with glory and honour and of the three thousand million inhabitants of this earth what an infinitesimally small fraction thereof would merit ophelias growing description of hamlet o what a noble mind is here the courtiers soldiers scholars eye tongue sword the expectancy and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form through the strange and diabolical workings of the dynamics of projection we unconsciously seek relief from tensions of inferiority and guilt by ascribing to others the ugly traits and base motives that persistently trouble us with our own sense of unworthiness for the more contemptible we imagine others to be the less contemptible we then appear to ourselves that is why no one is so ready to condemn others as the guilty and the greater their own sense of guilt the louder and more vehement their condemnation of others all that modem psychology has discovered about the readiness of the guilty to condemn their fellowmen was foreshadowed in the deeply moving episode of the eighth chapter of st john wherein the woman taken in adultery was brought before jesus the benign admonition of jesus to the womans captors men bristling with righteous indignation has resounded down the corridors of time through nineteen hundred years resounded alas for the most part to deaf ears he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her in the light of the eighth chapter of st john and in the light of everything that modern psychology has learned about the mechanism of projection there is much truth in the epigram righteous indignation is being mistaken at the top of your voice how few of us suspect that even in our moments of ease when we are enjoying certain types of alleged humor we are unconsciously relievingby means of projection own feelings of inferiority take a blackface comedian the stereotyped negro comic so familiar to radio television and vaudeville audiences sambo is a lowdown noaccount lazy shiftless goodfornothing nigger addicted besides to chickenstealing crapshooting wifebeating and drinking how the audience laughs shrieks and guffaws every time sambo opens his mouth and gives fresh evidence of his dumbness his shiftlessness his nogood laziness his dishonesty why does the spectacle of such inferiority in a fellowhuman being amuse the audience the audiences laughterthe audible evidence of their unconcious feeling of relief from the tensions of unworthiness and guilt arises from their ability to project all their inferiority upon the negro buffoon before them for the black comic is an exaggerated stereotype a magnified abstraction embodying many of the contemptible traits that make us squirm with a sense of our own degradation hardly a man or woman alive is free of some taint of laziness hardly a one of us but is sometimes assailed with selfdoubts and bad conscience because of our lapses from aggressiveness and drive ambition and farsightedness and thrift virtues so insistently inculcated and so highly prized by an acquisitive society and so cavalierly disregarded by the dirty lazy nogood sambo so we laugh at the black clown in his loud checked suit the seat of the pants conspicuously patched and as we go into hysterics at his dumb remarks we unconsciously puff up with a proud feeling of identification with all the forces of white dignity and respectability white aggressiveness and energy and probity and we cast out from ourselves and heap upon sambo all our own faults and sins so greatly magnified in him but in the southern states with their huge negro populations and where negroes consequently are always close at hand the whites have no need for the stage and television to remind them of the inferior blacks inasmuch as the need to project is in direct ratio to the intensity and oppressiveness of ones own feeling of inferiority it follows that hostility toward the negro attains its extreme among poor southern whites the abject poverty of these people the wretched shacks they call their homes lacking the barest minimum of sanitary requirements drinking water and slops of privies being in intimate proximity their ignorance and illiteracy their malnutrition their inability to afford the barest medical care their more or less chronic infection with hookworm trichinae and other parasitic disease organisms finally their utter rejection by the upperclass whites is it any wonder that these poor souls the white trash cringe with a sense of their boundless inferiority but no their inferiority is not boundless it hasglory be definite limits and clearly marked bounds a white man in the south can sink only so low and no lower his feet can never quite touch the miry bottom of the slough of despond long before he sinks down into the dank slime of the nethermost depths his feet rest safely atop the black woolly heads of the negroes the poor southern white no matter how depressed and dejected has only to look about him and seeing the lowly negro experience a sudden elevation to dizzy heights of superiority from which lofty eminence he can now with lordly disdain look down upon the dirty niggers opportunities for such heady flights of soulsatisfying superiority are not wanting in his daily environment he boards a streetcar and cannot fail but observe that the last several rowsthe jim crow sectionare reserved for negro passengers especially unctious to the white mans ego is the spectacle of negroes standing after all the jim crow seats are occupied even though there may be any number of unoccupied seats in the white section for only at the imminent risk to life and limb would a negro passenger dare take a seat in the sacrosanct white section the poor white now glows with a sense of high status an expansive and heartwarming feeling of identification with the great master race the ruling class the lords of the earth the freeborn native white americans the poor southern white experiences the same heartswelling pride when he is in a bus station or a railway depot as he notes the two separate waiting rooms one for whites and one for colored and four separate toilet rooms all clearlyand with what a world of significancemarked womenwhite womencolored menwhite mencolored if only the dynamics of relief ended with the white mans renewed sense of elation in being thus reminded of his superiority and his renewed feeling of identification with the master race there would then be nothing too especially harmful about his preening and strutting but always accompanying the elation of supposed superiority over the blacks is a renewed and intensified contempt for them the projection of all the white mans inferiority and guiltupon the negroes thus unconsciously making use of the dynamics of projection the whites project their body odors and smells upon the other race by calling them stinking niggers their indolence by calling them lazy goodfornothing coons their physical and mental uncleanliness by calling them dirty niggers their colossal ignorance by calling them dumb boogies the extreme in the dynamics of projection is attained in lynching a white woman has been found raped and murdered a young negro suspect has been apprehended and thrown into the county jail awaiting trial the whole countryside is seething in a ferment of fear anger vengeance whoever the murderer may beand hour by hour as the mass hysteria grows all are convinced without proof that the imprisoned negro is guilty becomes the common object of the peoples mass projection of guilt every man in the community sorely troubled with feelings of sexual guilt since first as a little boy he was discovered in the act of masturbation many of the men afflicted with bad consciences as they recall their countless fornications and adulteries some of their carnalities reeking with the taint of incest some of the men troubled with the memory of even more secret sinister and forbidden lusts how cleansing and purifying to cast out of their hearts all the accumulated filth and sins of a lifetime and hurl them down the dirty lowdown nigger murderer this spiritual cleansing and purification imbues the whites with a high sense of dedication to the protection of white american womanhood and the duty to guard their chastity and to avenge to the death their ravagers and despoilers mass hysteria convinces the lynchers of the precedence of the higher unwritten law over the poltroonish delays and legalistic technicalities of slow judicial process and the sacred right that sanctions any redblooded mans taking the law in his own hands a tidal wave of chivalric zeal and religious ecstasy engulfs the whole mass of men now inspired and exalted with a sense of high dedication to avenge outraged virtue the excitement and elation of their holy mission at last brings to an end talk and unmanly argument and the avengers are swept on an irrepressible floodtide of direct action the jail is stormed sheriff warden and jailers are all swept aside like straws in a windstorm the cell is broken open the negro dragged out into the night screaming under the blows of his captors and now before the curtain descends on the final act of the bloody tragedy while the dry faggots are being enkindled for the negros purification by fire one final opportunity presents itself to the white executioners to cast out from themselves yet one more gallmg inferiority and cast it upon their live human sacrifice their burntoffering many of these men have been sorely disturbeddisturbed since boyhood enviously and jealouslyby the oftrepeated and wideeyed accounts of the negroes fabulous endowment with the physical attributes of masculinity their herculean virility their prodigious sexual potencymore like a stallions than a mans and so for all the white mans contempt for the negroes there always remained one area of lifethe incomparably important area of sex in which the white man could never with any real show of conviction boast superiority over the blacks but on the contrary if all the stories and legends were true had to admit of a crushing and humiliating inferiority the roar of the flames the crackling of the drywood the terrorstricken shrieks of the negro youth mingled with the affrighted cries of the birds and animals of the woods the visceral sounds of retching and vomiting of bystanders sickened by the savage spectacle the yellow and orange and crimson flames casting their unholy glow over the ghastly scene the champions of virtue are now emboldened to yet one final act of bloody cruelty which only their dedication to a holy cause could give them the fortitude to carry through once more they seize the black boy and with a crude jackknife or a razor or whatever instrument is at hand they mutilate and castrate the negro expiating his sinand all their own sexual sinsby cutting off the offending penis as the hot flames sear the negros naked and bleeding body and now to the unholy sights and macabre sounds of the hellish nightmare is added the acrid smell of burning living flesh and hair the avengers experience a thrilling feeling of ultimate purification the heavy burden of all their sins mercifully lifted from them the unsupportable weight of all their transgressions blessedly lightened their exaltation springs from a new sense of superioritynow for the first time complete superiority over the negroes the score is now settled the galling disparity is evened the cruel wound to their masculine pride is healed as they now contemplate the dying negro youth castrated and emasculated wjohn conyers jr w was elected to last fall congress from detroits newly appor e r the statisticians had a field day not only did his election mark the first time since reconstruction that two negroes from one state would sit in the house of representatives but it marked the first time in history that two negroes from a single northern city would represent their state in the congress of the united states that detroit should be the city having this distinction seemed surprising to many observers who knowing that both chicago and new york have much larger negro populations expected eitheror bothof those cities to elect a second negro congressman long before detroit however for those familiar with the special historical circumstances of the development of the detroit negro community the historymaking election of conyers was taken in stride outside observers hastened to credit the united union litical negro motor cars presence of the giant automobile workers uawcio for astuteness of the the podetroit community making of course is the chief detroit and generaon the politics business of tions have been nurtured industrys prosperity and men like alex fuller horace sheffield and nelson jack edwards for instance are hi h in the councils of labor and their influence certainly reaches into city hall and the state house at lansing but the rise to eminence of young congressman conyers with due respect for the support provided by the strong labor faction in the city can scarcely be explained simply in terms of labor influence conyers as a matter of fact is only one of an astonishing array of bright young detroiters who have gone to washington in recent years to help run the nations affairs and while conyers and his older colleague charles c diggs made the journey by way of the ballot box the others went to the capitol as available resources in the governments draft of the best talent obtainable indeed detroit is represented by more able and experienced young negro men in responsible government positions than any other major city in the country and significantly not more than one or two of these young men has a direct labor union background although it is altogether possible that some of them may have toiled at times on the assembly lines in the generation of most of these men the auto plants replaced the pullman cars as the interim place of employment on the road to the university degree it is true that conyers father is a uaw international representative and that young conyers had the support of uaw executive board member nelson jack edwards but then conyers opponent also had powerful labor support in the name of uaw official horace sheffield and the the citys strategic position on the underground railroad made it a sanctuary for negroes early in the nineteenth century and many of the slaves who had set out for canada found permanent refuge on the michigan side of the detroit river still the presence of canada and unlimited freedom only a few moments away added to their sense of security even when slave agents arrived from the south scouring the area for runaways the community prospered achieved a remarkable degree of social and political integration and produced a number of distinguished business and professional men who in restrospect seem all but astounding when john brown came recruiting guerillas for his excursion at harpers ferry he found well organized support from negro communities on both sides of the river long before world war ii and the era of highly publicized negro firsts in public and private life negroes were integrated into the economic and political life of the city negro lawyers had offices in downtown buildings a negro served as manager of what is now the citys largest department store j l hudson and a negro handled the finances for the entire county area some of the citys wealthiest negroes have doctor or dentist forbears who served almost exclusively white clienteles and invested their money in property rented to immigrant families pouring into the city from germany poland and italy the negro families from the south found a stable proudeven prosperous negro community when they arrived to take jobs in the factories before during and after world war i the old community proved a good model and the new arrivals put to excellent use the aday henry ford was paying they bought homes sent their children to college and took active roles in community development by the time world war ii exploded detroit had the largest percentage of negro home owners of any city in the north and one of the most solidly based middle classes important number of home owners fact that these homes were not all concentrated into a single corner of the city detroit negroes lived a pattern of corruption did not become allpervasive as it is for example in chicago the independence of the detroit negro in politics is but a reflection of the spirit of confidence and determination which generally animates the citys negro community racial barriers exist in detroit and always have but the citys negroes have not been thwarted by them they have if anything become more unified and sophisticated because of them when for example local impresarios refused to bring negro musical artists to the city schoolmarm nellie watts sponsored their appearance herself the nellie watts concert series under whose auspices the great marian anderson first sang in the city is a detroit institution when the larger community refused or failed to promote significant operatic opportunities soprano celeste cole founded an interracial opera company which continues to discover and train operatic talent these are only examples the cotillion club a civic improvement organization of young business and professional men is only one of several community groups through which the citys leaders influence the life of the total community the cotillion club did much to overshadow the citys postworld war ii reputation for ostentatious society wingdings by instituting an annual cotillion during which the honored debutantes were young women of exceptional character and scholarship rather than the daughters of the socially prominent the club serves also as watchdog over the local government for decades men like the late fred hart williams scion of an old detroit family and a veteran civil servant urged young negroes to take an interest in their history and partly because of him detroit has one of the oldest and most active chapters of the association for the study of negro life and history the city also had for many years the largest branch of the national association for the advancement of colored people detroit negroes have race pride without the insidious sense of inferiority which often goes along with it and here again the citys development helps to explain that partly because of the unionsand negro strength in themracial segregation and favoritism have been far less frequent in the factories of detroit than those of any other city negroes and whites worked side by side and in many cases shared the same schools and neighborhoods and it was difficult under these circumstances for whites to assume superiority simeon booker chief of the washington bureau of the johnson publishing company says of the detroiters in washington that they are as a group the most selfassured and generally effective negroes in the nations capital they are absolutely comfortable around whites he says they have transplanted their political prowess gained from michigan and are using it to give negroes new muscle on the national scene and helping the civil_rights movement far more than their more talkative counterparts booker also says that in washington detroit negroes continue the easy relationships with their white colleagues and consequently gain support for their views and projects they think big he says they are not merely trying to enrich themselves they aim for policymaking levels and establish themselves they are obviously able to compete in the market place and they seldom squawk about local segregationnot because they accept it but because they are busy getting into a position to do something about it perhaps of the personable crop of detroiters now working in washington the one with the most extensive labor background is william b gould and his association with labor came primarily after his basic preparation for employment in that field at one of the youngest of the d c contingent and characterized by one observer as probably the most brilliant gould is attorney advisor to the national labor relations board a post to which he brings exceptional background and experience he is a law graduate from cornell university he did graduate study at the london england school of economics and formerly served as assistant general counsel to the uaw the backgrounds of most of the other detroiters with highlevel federal posts are equally impressive congressman charles c diggs jr a graduate of the university of michigan at ann arbor is a former state senator as was his father before winning election in as michigans first negro congressman he was also head of his familys huge mortuary and allied enterprises the largest complex of its kind in the state he brought with him to washington valuable administrative experience william t patrick jr the first and only negro member of the ninemember city council until his resignation in is possibly the only negro to serve the government as a layear executive on loan from private industry patrick a fine lawyer with an impeccable record of achievement and service in detroit reluctantly left the detroit common council whose members are elected at large thus minimizing the chances for a negro candidate to accept a post with the michigan bell telephone company as assistant general counsel his chore in washington was to assist r sargent shriver in planning the administrations antipoverty program leon m wallace who went to washington as assistant to the administrator of veterans affairs is now director of insurance service for the veterans administration a job in which he supervises more funds than major insurance firms in the nation a man known for both diligence and integrity he is preparing for even greater responsibilities by studying evenings at a washington university the detroit executive closest to the administration is hobart taylor jr who was associate white house counsel before taking the job as executive vice chairman of the presidents committee on equal employment opportunities a native texan and son of a veteran houston politician taylor is a graduate of the university of michigan law school with a distinguished record as a private and public attorney in detroit he was brought into the kennedy administration by then vice president johnson and moved up with his champion william sebrons job as the secretary of agricultures assistant for civil_rights coordination reportedly is one of the toughest and most thankless positions in government he went to washington from a job as deputy director of the michigan fair employment practices commission for years he served the city as one of the ablest urban league aides one of the handful of detroiters whose presence in washington predates the current administration edward sylvester jr is deputy administrator of the bureau of labor affairs for the department of labor he first went to washington in as a member of the national staff of senator stuart symington and the democratic national committee and was appointed assistant to assistant secretary of labor george l p weaver in a graduate engineer sylvester in pioneered in forming the first commercial lumber company in the interior of liberia the liberianamerican enterprises inc john w roxborough ii like edward sylvester jr was in washington prior to the johnson administration serving under the late john foster dulles as attorney advisor for the state department from to he now holds a similar post for the private enterprise section of the general council of the agency for international development aid in the interim roxborough held posts under the u s commission on civil_rights in detroit he was special assistant attorney general broadus n butler assistant to the u s commissioner of education took leave from his job as assistant to the dean of the wayne state university college of liberal arts for a year in washington an unstinting participant in community and educational improvement projects dr

interest detroiters in negro and african history he holds ma and phd degrees from the university of michigan mark battle acting assistant director for field operations of the department of labors neighborhood youth corps gained a reputation as a highly effective youth worker at detroits franklin settlement then went on to repeat his success at similar jobs in cleveland and chicago he served as a special consultant on youth employment before assuming his present post a key job in one of the largest programs of the antipoverty war charles j wartman is chief of the standardization branch of the office of assistant director of the civil defense plans and operations a former college instructor virginia state college he was a longtime executive editor of detroits foremost negro newspaper the michigan chronicle and a confidante to some of the states most influential labor and political leaders while certainly no bright young man mrs esther lamarr should be included in any rundown on youthful detroiters holding important jobs in washington a wellknown social and civic worker in the city she was called to her present job as special assistant to the veterans administration administrator from her city niche with the mayors commission on children and youth other distaff detroiters who should be cited are mrs ruth dailey brooks former assistant to michigans senator philip hart and now staff assistant for the senate subcommittee on refugees under mississippi senator james o eastlands judiciary committee and dorothy quarker longtime aide to representative charles c diggs and operator of a sort of unofficial communications center for the detroiters in washington one of the youngest of the detroiters in washington is ofield dukes able journalist who works as assistant director of information in charge of office operations for the presidents committee on equal employment opportunities a former newsman at the michigan chronicle and writer for the negroowned radio station wchb dukes also takes seriously his citizenship responsibilities frequently returns to detroit to speak to audiences about new opportunities for negroes and the need for education to take advantage of them there are of course other detroiters holding important jobs in washington such as charles smith member of a family prominent in county government and an employee of the defense department and kermit bailer assistant administrator for community programs in the housing and home finance agency some have since returned to the city like dr karl gregory who was an economist with the budget bureau but now teaches at wayne state university they all brought with them a sense of assurance and especially a sophistication relative to race relations whichin the words of simeon

sometimes when i looks at my house an my diamont ring i cant help but remember miss lucy she was a good woman and sometimes i believe if it wasnt for segregation she woulda been gooder there are times when i cant remember ever not being involved in civil_rights however i know that at one time i felt i could best help by living my own life quietly and showing others that sure enough equality was a state of mind or some unexplainable hypothesis i recall hearing of differences the need for minorities to be separate suppression the only answer and so forth i can even remember staring hard at peoples faces and watching their every move to try and discover this dramatic thing that adults would term different odd etc it wasnt until my teens that i discovered it wasnt so much a facial expression or movement or physical oddity but that it was color and even sometimes ideals or religion discovering what my elders had preached to be in conflict with what i believed i found the only recourse in active participation in civil_rights now i realize that i was almost totally ignorant of the meaning of civil_rights and the struggle being waged today in my midtwenties i find myself looking back and being ashamed at the surface structure of my thinking which allowed me to look pained whenever i heard the all too familiar why some of my best friends are negroes but it had always seemed so clear to me that all we had to do in order to win was to simply make whites realize how unamerican they were acting it wasnt until one afternoon in a civil_rights organizations office that part of the depth to which the last several hundred years has plunged this country was revealed to me several young negro members were standing around talking one of the men was saying why hell man even some of my friends are white shortly after this i attended a small dinner party in one of our predominately negro neighborhoods the hostess asked if somebody would walk to the store for a loaf of bread it was a warm night a slight breeze stirred the papers in the street and it was a good night for walking on leaving the store i noticed a pickup truck with four or five negro men in the back and two men and a woman in the front they started to follow right behind me finally one of the men threw a paper bag and shouted whitey get out of our neighborhood the rest of the men picked up his call and soon i felt something pass my head within a second there was stabbing pain in my legs as a wine bottle smashed sending slivers of glass deep into my skin the men kept shouting hey white girl get out before we show how good black men really are the woman leaned out and started screaming leave our men alone white trash one of the men threw another wine bottle and it smashed against the building splattering glass in all directions just as i reached the entrance to my friends home a man jumped out of the back of the truck and cornered me in the entrance way the rest is rather lost in vague hysterical half memories there was a great deal of confusion however i remember the husband of the girl we had come to see pushing my date back and telling him to stay out of it youre white and will only make it worse joan of arci used to play her well carrying the torch of freedom to the oppressed and how sick and confused when forced to accept the realization that the hundreds of years of degradation suppression and denial had left a very real very ugly very white reflecting scar i found that my banner was not always received with cheers but could and was subject to being spat on spat on because of color spat on because i was white many negroes have told me repeatedly that due to the fact i am white it is impossible for me to have a conception of the position of the negro in our country perhaps this in part is true but almost any civil_rights worker black or white has been subjected to job pressures has been asked to move when it was found out that he associated with were seen with or knew someone who was labeled undesirable families have disowned refused to tolerate even refused to talk to their children who find they have a need to fight for what they believe to be right one girl i know has had her mother walk past her downtown looking straight ahead with no sign of recognition at one time i withdrew from any active participation having my selfmade white joan of arc image shattered finding i was not immune to prejudices and injustices and finding the constant assumptions of whites and negroes almost intolerable by assumptions i mean the forever present filth that seems to exist in some peoples minds here is an example during a dinner break one evening following a lengthy meeting one of the negro leaders and i went out to eat he excused himself for a few minutes and while he was gone a white man came over to the table and after a rather uncomplimentary opening explained in emphatic terms why no selfrespecting white man would ever touch me the meeting was being held on the edge of the negro ghetto and on our way back we passed several negro men lounging against a building they started taunting my companion and myself asking prices and saying other insulting things one man grabbed my arm and asked what was wrong with him for a stud after all he was the right color for my tastes also ive been asked by both negroes and whites the question who meaning men is really the best after all you associate with both you should know my period of withdrawal lasted almost a year but i am again active in civil_rights however it seems that during the time i was away i was able to gain perspective and a true evaluation of my own beliefs and a deeper knowledge that it would take more than tauntsindeed more than learning that spite exists in all racesto ever make me give up again understandably the years of injustice are a reason for many negroes having learned to hate whites but it is frightening to know that too many of us are blind and feel that once we conquer the largest battle white oppression that everything will be american there is a deep sense of shame when i read or see or experience bigotry for it is a mirror through which many negroes judge and cast their own reflections and these reflections are just as hateful just as full of waste the white battlefield is by far the largest and the most important but this well of intolerance that has been built up in negroes cannot be forgotten we cannot turn away but must accept that two battlefields actually exist one white the other black for what will it have gained us at last when picket lines for human rights will no longer be needed if the negro brings with him to the equality so long overdue the ugly reflection of the whites will the negro bring compassion and understandingor hate and oppression and spite then too i am troubled by what seems like almost insurmountable apathy in some negroes for work in their own behalf today i am serving on two committees that have had active programs to get negroes to join several negroes have joined in the past but they either do not attend the meetings or else withdraw from the organization all together why the majority of the executive staff is negro but try as we will we cannot get negroes to stick with these two committees the committees are open consequently to charges of white power structure trying to take over etc the greatest lack seems to be negro women especially in the various northern organizations i have served with so few negro women seem to take an active daytoday part in the struggle picket lines are needed but there are the evercurrent charges of discrimination in housing and jobs that must be checked verified and documented before we hit the pavement without the participation of all races and all sexes we find ourselves handicapped and without the people who could help us to fight john does and jane does all over the country white and black have to learn to stand up under pressures from jobs families and communities they have to learn to live with the question marks and insecurity that active participation brings we all have to look to himself but it must be his choice to be the best the laziest or the worst that he chooses to make of himself but it must be his choice not the result of social pressures there are thousands of john does and jane does across the country who are working for equality there are thousands picketing petitioning using every available legal means at hand and even a few are dying both whites and blacks have died for this right of mens choice i hope for the day when negroes and all other minorities are born with their right to dignity the quality which separates the artist from the ordinary human being is the depth to which he is able to reach into his soul and thus give expression to those emotions bom of the human condition in this light odetta holmes felious gordon is an artist of the first rank and certainly the foremost folk singer in america with an evergrowing repertoire of songs she has enchanted audiences all over the united states canada africa and europe displaying a strong multicolored voice of an overwhelming intensity odettas forte lies with negro songs take this hammer john henry im going back to the red clay country but she is quite convincing interpreting other american folk tunes as well as those of other lands especially of british and irish origin a large woman whose closecropped hair styling and regal deportment is suggestive of an african princess her very presence on stage creates excitement and when she gives forth with her powerful contralto voice and rhythmic guitar she is a selftaught guitarist her listeners cant help but be captured by the honesty and depth of feeling in the moods she creates in fact there are few singers of any persuasion who can match odetta in this area she is a magnificent creator of moods who can at one moment drop an audience into the depths of sorrows dungeon and in the next instant elevate the audience to the heights of joy she can speak tenderly of love john riley then in her next number cry out in anguished protest of mans inhumanity to man he had a long chain on odetta was bom in birmingham alabama december but moved to los angeles at the age of where she was educated and where at a very tender age a musical interest was awakened in her this interest took her into the glee club in junior high school and upon graduating from belmont high school in she received the high school achievement award presented by the bank of america which enabled her to study at los angeles city college in preparation for a career in the classics in referring to this period of her artistic development she says if it wasnt classical i didnt want it however two years later after she had made her initial professional appearance as a member of the chorus of the west coast production of finiaris rainbow she discovered folk music while on tour in san francisco with finians rainbow jo mapes a folk singer and former high school classmate of odettas brought about her conversion in her own words i hadnt heard of folk singing until jo introduced me to it but i was sold on it when a group of her friends sang folk songs for three hours late one night i was converted this conversion gave birth to a dedicated artist who is constantly looking for new material and one who researches a song thoroughly before offering it to her public odetta goes deep into the background of a tune to get its feel and this is why when she sings for example the negro work song take this hammer she involves her listeners in a profound emotional experience it conjures up in ones mind a man breaking rocks on a chaingang and his utter disdain for that hammer those cold iron shackles and his overall contempt for the manner in which his situation has reduced his humanity when her stay with the company of finiaris rainbow ended odetta returned to los angeles where she worked for a while as a housekeeper after which she moved to san francisco accepting a job there at the tin angel it was at this point that she began to gain fame as an exponent of work songs blues ballads and spirituals a monthlong engagment at new yorks blue angel gained her a following on the east coast as well as the respect of such renowned folk artists as harry belafonte and pete seeger after her eastern exposure odetta returned to california to sing a moving version of the sea chantey santy anna in the film cinerama holiday she then appeared for two years at the turnabout theatre in los angeles before coming east again when she did return to the eastern part of the country it was to appear at the gate of horn in chicago at which time the fall of she

tunes as joshua easy rider shame and scandal and hound dog reviewers raved over her initial recording effort making special mention of her striking contralto voice and electrifying sincerity a second album odetta at the gate of horn tlp was received with the same enthusiasm as ballads and blues some of these selections were timber greensleeves and chilly winds on the strength of these two collections her fame increased and in april of she made a highly successful debut at town hall which drew the acclamation of the critics john s williams writing in the new york times of april had this to say a highly cultivated singer bringing to everything she sings the strong imprint of her warm positive and enormously skillful musical personality odetta has a large following among the college set and makes numerous appearances each year on the campuses of the country but whether performing before a gathering of in a college auditorium or a throng of as was the case when she sang at the march on washington in the summer of she can reach an audience like few have been able to do in the history of singing in this respect she belongs in the same class as billie holiday mario lanza marian anderson huddie ledbetter and ray charles on december odetta was exposed to a national television audience on tonight with harry belafonte a show in which her performance won a sylvania award it was belafonte who did the liner notes for her vanguard album vrs my eyes have seen released in stating that especially in negro folk song her distinctive touch has awakened her listeners to the deepest appreciation and most thorough insight into the very core of this music a review of this album by robert shelton in the new york times read in part the most glorious new voice in american folk music she has a voice so large and a physical presence so commanding recordings have yet to do her complete justice a few of the tunes here are ox driver song down on me ive been driving on bald mountain and waterboy odetta was presented in recital at carnegie hall may an appearance which caused the critics to heap more praise on her and which further entrenched her in the hearts and minds of folk music devotees and patrons of the arts in general in this performance as in her concerts and recording dates during this period she was assisted by a very splendid musician and composer bill lee whose driving string bass had become an integral part of her presentation the year was a very big one for odetta she recorded ballad for americans made famous by the great paul robeson in the s with symphony of the air and decormier chorale some of the other american ballads appearing on this vanguard album vrs are this land on top of old smoky dark as a dungeon and going home the philadelphia inquirer had this to say of this album one of the finest albums of the year done with beauty of voice and all of the rich resources of expression and sympathies embodied in her personality she was seen along with the baritone william warfield on the w n b c tv half hour special parable in the park her portrayal of the murderess nancy in the film version of william faulkners sanctuary showed her to be a very proficient actress odettas performance at the newport folk festival in june impressed one critic thus the focus of the first concert was on odetta whose mahoganyhued sonorous voice offered what this listener felt was the crowning performance of the weekend a typical odetta concert runs the emotional gamut she can make one cry laugh hate love in recent months her performances have been augmented by bruce langhorne a very sensitive guitarist and les grinage bassist there is no better measure of an artists worth than to view that artist in a program with others in her idiom in january odetta appeared on the television special dinner with the president which featured an impressive array of folk singers including the everpopular josh white even in this noble company she towered over her contemporaries as the mountain does the molehill i am not prejudiced although martin p luther king might think so i am as lib e ral thinking as any man if they dont bother me i dont bother them the thing that puzzles me is why the agitators dont let us work out our own problems now take my neighborhood for example we live only a few blocks from them and usually dont have any trouble at all just the other day i stopped and gave one a lift when his car stalled we talked for awhile and got along fine i explained to him how i had some of them working for me and that i treated them as well as the rest of us he was a rather quiet onei guess it was because he was worried about his car so i talked a lot i told him how my father had come to america about fifty years before and worked so hard to become a foreman at the stockyards he and mother still lived in the same house where we youngsters were born dad and mother would die rather than move everyone of us kids was born baptized and married within five blocks of our house dad said we should all be proud of the opportunities america gave immigrant folk to make good i told him how dad had explained to us about race it was beautiful the way he told us how birds and butterflies have wings but it didnt mean they were the same although god had made both of them the fellow must have been a sensitive one because he kind of choked up i couldnt be sure but he seemed to glow from down under his skin he probably had never heard it put so clearly before i was really proud of dad at that moment of course the guy didnt quite understand he mumbled something about what do birds and butterflies have to do with people then he said something that sounded like parallel evolution i wish dad had been along he could have explained to the fellow better than i did roy that was his name and i got along fine although he was kind of shy we stopped in the restaurant across from the gas station and had a cup of coffee while the tow truck went to bring his car roy emma shes the waitress and me had a good time teasing each other while we waited i called emma shanty irish and she called me a name and roy said he had to use the washroom when he got back i told this joke about how there were three kinds of irishmen shanty irish highclass irish and bicycle irish emma fell for it and we really laughed when i told her bicycle irish were the kind that made your ass tired well roy didnt laugh too much maybe he had heard it before some of those guys dont have a sense of humor dad says they would be better off if they learned to joke more instead of taking things so seriously we ate a couple of hamburgers and i took roy to the bar next door where we had a couple of beers the bartender is a swell guy he waited on roy right awayeven served him before me i didnt mind a bit but i wouldnt let roy pay the bill although he tried hard tom hes the bartender and he owns the place too stayed right near us all the time we were there and smiled a lot more than id ever seen him do before he made roy feel right at home its funny because tom had always impressed me as feeling rather strong about the race problem it just shows you cant go by what folks say they cant hold their liquor too well because roy started talking after awhile you know how they talk fast and use words that no one but them can understand he kept doing something with a piece of chalk said something about being a student mentioned interracial parties kept talking about hypocrisy and got all hot under the collar well tom got kind of excited but i was on roys side its funny how little things can show what a mans made of by the time we left i was the only man there who still liked that boy ill tell you why something happened and i remembered what dad had once told me the local punchboard had come switching into the bar to see if she could hook someone all of us had given her the eye to make her feel good roy just sat there i watched him like dad had said roy never let his eyes move from the lip of his beer glass the whole time the girl was in the bar the boy was all right no one noticed it but me thats why i was mad when later the guys started needling roy i told him lets leave these creeps besides it was getting dark and i didnt want him to get into trouble we got back to the station and he was about to drive off so i told him how id watched him real close when the girl was in the bar i reached to shake his hand he must not have seen my hand because he gave me this coin instead looked at me in a real strange way and drove off i guess he was stoned why would anybody color lincolns face white on a penny the idea had been growing in lukes mind so long until now it seemed to have been forming since the day he was born not the whole thing but bits and pieces which sometimes met and held or as was more often the case simply vague notions which danced through the brain leaving only bare traces of their handiwork but this morning as he looked up to see his old pal buddy york fresh out of the county farm walking toward him the shutter in his mind clicked for the final time and he knew he was going to do it he had to it was one of those things a man just had to do if he were to keep on calling himself a man they came together eyed one another for a long moment then broke into sudden laughter you home for good luke asked finally man i hope so buddy answered but i doubt it every time something happens they come and grab me i know luke agreed his massive head nodding sympathetically they used to pull that crap on me but i got em off my neck for good now you sure did but howd you do it buddy asked his voice filled with muted admiration im thinking bout hopping a freight maybe some other place i can make a new start luke laughed it was more of a squeal really without humor and raw with sarcasm you dont really believe that now do you man you like me you doomed from the day you born you just hafta learn t keep em off you as long as you can then when its time to go take as many along with you as you can take man theres lots of room in hell so take em all if you can he said giving that peculiar laugh again buddy gave him an odd look you sound like you know something he said finally i know a whole lotta stuff if you wanna know the truth luke said moving off and indicating by a nod that buddy should come along with him and i got a real big plan in mind he continued what i need now is a partner i can trust you interested yeah im interested buddy answered promptly if theres any dough in it at all my old lady just throwed the book at me this morning i gotta get a job she says she cant afford to support me and dave too dig that will ya where in hell im gonna git a job in this hole luke nodded a bland look on his broad face well you gotta look at it from miss matties side too i reckon dave aint gonna be no good for a long time now all that education he got is just gonna rust in his head man its too bad a smart one like him had to go marching against them fire hoses hed a been better off if theyd put th dogs on him man the way they smashed him up against that wall musta left a hole bigger than a watermelon the nogood bastards i betcha one thing youll never catch me marching and singing and being drenched and beat like a buncha cattle when i used to join them sitins i had a grenade in every pocket one of them mothers had hit me too hard and we all was going to glory hows old dave making out he inquired they were walking fast now heading out past the desolate shacks in crabtown hes still outta this world most of the time buddy began ma keeps on mumbling to th lord about what they done to her child and when is he going to be well again but if you ask me he aint ever gonna make it you cant dig a mans brains outtathe wall and stick em back in his head and expect him to be like he was thats what i know luke said coming to a stop before a small dollsize cabin i reckon miss matties about half crazy herself by now she had so much faith in old dave yeah buddy said slouching down on a big rock in front of the shack and you know shell never understand how it was him and not me got his brains busted out luke grinned you aint had any to start out with like i said you and me we doomed only thing we got to worry about is how many can we take along when we leave this glorious land of golden opportunity for everybody white he chuckled pleased as all get out with the impression he was making on the highly impressionable buddy then with a great flourish he poured some of the bootleg liquor hed brought out from under the steps into a paper cup and handed it to buddy who took one swallow and nearly choked his eyes quickly filling with tears man this stuff is strong he said its good though he added hastily white lightning luke said my special brew which i only serve to special folks man you being honored buddy nodded and took another sip much smaller this time they were far back on top of the hill with the entire town spread out before them the shacks of crab town came first like so many mangled toy houses each with its tiny outhouse which tinted the air with the perpetual odor of lime and human refuse then the main us highway swung through this disarray whanging the shacks off from an abandoned golf course where white men formerly played until the courts ordered it integrated beyond the course now overgrown with tall yellow weeds to the right were the small houses where people such as buddys mother and bushwacked brother lived poor folks they were but better off than the wretches who inhabited the shacks to the left a few blocks down another thoroughfare were a group of mediumsized wellkept houses where the welltodo negroes lived as a rule luke seldom thought much about these people who almost never thought about the likes of him at least not in charitable terms to say the least he viewed them with mixed emotions then far beyond this small island of black respectability and rising on a slight incline was the white mans world a world that luke was bom resisting and one that he had long yearned to destroy in the very center of this universe lodged the county courthouse which luke detested with such an unrelenting passion that it sometimes made him sick the business district spread around the courthouse in a haphazard desultory fashion like so many greedy fingers clutching a dying mans throat but the one building that always claimed lukes undivided attention was that which held the great southern national bank ten stories high and loaded with money it had always drawn his imagination like a supercharged magnet his eyes fastened on it now in total fascination what you staring at so hard buddy asked holding his cup out for a refill luke came back to his immediate surroundings a faint smile on his lips just enjoying the view man just enjoying the view he said pouring more of the clear liquid for buddy you sure got plenty of it buddy admitted tasting his drink with caution i aint been way back up here since i was a kid man you can see all over the damn place and things dont look so bad from up here not even that trap i live in luke shrugged howd you like to live in one o them shacks freeze your tail off in th winter time i reckon so buddy conceded then nodded his head back at the tiny house behind them you dont live there do you man i live everywhere luke bragged you know wherever my hat lands thats home the liquor began working on buddy now he felt loose talkative you know what everybody say about you luke hell man luke began i dont care what nobody say about me but what they say that im evil damn right im evil if i wasnt id never stayed alive in this rotten town for twentysix years buddy looked at him a curious mixture of doubt and admiration in his eyes what about that white boy that time luke what really happened a slow grin broke on lukes face as his mind moved back nearly fourteen years what th hell you think happened i drowned his ass thats what happened he was white wasnt he the sonofabitch you mean you did it just because he was white asked the astonished buddy can you think of a damn better reason luke asked calmly they lynched my old man because he was colored didnt they they butchered your brothers brains because he was black didnt they and didnt they kick manda johnsons belly out because she was colored and had the nerve to want to vote so what th hellte you talking about man dont start talking no mess to me you sound just like miss mattie buddy was silent for some moments well i guess if you look at it that way he said finally well what way you been looking at it luke asked harshly buddy squirmed i dunno man i mean i guess i tried not to think about it what good do thinking about it do no damn good luke admitted thats why they demonstrating and gitting their heads tore up but like i said me i got the best plan of all im gonna blow the whole goddamn town down buddy laughed man thats an idea now luke stared at buddy over his paper cup which still held most of his first drink he wasnt much of a drinking man long ago hed discovered the hard way that drinking and getting things done didn t go together too well he could tell buddy didnt believe what hed just said which was all right with him he wasnt sure he wanted buddy to know about his plan until he was ready to put it in action but he did want to sound old buddy out to see if miss mattie had washed all his brains out with all that waiting on the lord crap you think im talking crazy dont you man i dont know buddy began i mean i heard a lotta stuff bout you over th years but well you know how people are in a place like this they got nothing to do much but talk about each other and talk to the good lord luke added buddy grinned then my old lady says if you dont turn to god soon luke you gonna die a violent death all deaths violent luke shrugged and we all gonna die and the lord aint thinking about us black folks down here any moren them people up in washington are hes white just like the rest of them mothers and they all singing the same old tune go slow gradually man we been going so slow so long we aint even got one toe on the mothering bus he said making an obscene gesture with his hand then turned his cup up and drained it i been wondering luke buddy began howd it feel the time you drowned that fay cat i mean howd you do it anyway luke grinned his face glistening with perspiration man it felt good he exclaimed damn good believe me it was easy too the little bastard kept after me to teach him to swim dont you know but i couldnt be bothered then one day i was walking downtown and saw him with some of his friends and he acted like he didnt see me course that didnt bother me i was acting like i didnt see him either but later it got me to thinking about a lotta things i remembered them hooded mothers dragging my old man out in the middle of the night when i was four and i remembered a damn sight lotta other things too if you know what i mean and i know you do buddy nodded and held his cup out and luke filled both cups then went on with his story well would ya believe it the very next morning th little pecker comes around again begging me to show im some strokes is the way he put it barney was his name you remember maybe barney stokes i see his old man sometimes now he works over at the plant and he always give me this funny look he dont say nothing for it aint nothing he can say for at the time some old white cat was riding by on a horse and swore the whole thing was a accident and i was trying to save old barney luke gave out with that eerie laugh and slapped his thigh hard but how could you fool im luke i mean the man musta seen what you did didnt he well you see luke grinned then drained his cup a second time you know where we were over at that old swimming hole which the university bought up later he paused then his eyes roving way across town and lighting on the state university which sprawled like an octopus in all directions the souths seat of culture he mumbled making the obscene gesture again when i git through with that culture seat they wont need no army to integrate it theyll need a magician for it aint gonna be there and that precious hospital neither thats right next to it and that your ma thinks is so god almighty fine yet they wouldnt take her son in when his head was smashed like a rotten tomato he turned to stare at buddy then man where your ma git all them aunt jemima ideas of hers from buddy shrugged they all got em he said in philosophical resignation your ma had em too she damn sure did luke groaned till the day she died she swore i drowned old barney and it was gonna be with me the rest o my life he gurgled like a fat baby it damn sure is thank the good lord and for the longest kinda time it was the onlyst thing that kept me going now though he added giving buddy a sidelong look ive sent old barney a whole heap of company and pretty soon hes gonna be damn near crowded outta hell but to git back to that day i showed him a few strokes on land telling him id just had my tonsils out and couldnt get wet i swore the water was only two or three feet deep and that he could sorta wade in and practice the strokes id showed him he fell for that crap buddy asked i mean i thought everybody in town knowed that thing was deepern twelve feet all over luke grinned that dumb sonofabitch didnt know from nothing he stuck his foot out and went down like a bag of rocks i pretended i wasnt looking in case somebody else was and he stayed down so long i thought he wasnt coming up then up he comes like a wet rat grabbing air and trying to drink the whole damn thing dry i ran and hopped in and went straight to the bottom and then got over under old barney and took this one foot when he come down and kept him down there awhile then i moved away from him surfaced and made like i was trying to find him then i went under again but couldnt even find him i had to come up three times before i finally saw im all tangled up in some kinda mess inner tubes i think and i brought him up then thats when this white cat comes by and helped me pull old barney out man you shoulda seen him he turned my stomach but i was glad i was thinking this is one bastard what wont lynch nobodys father he damn sure wont buddy agreed then stood up dusting his pants off i gotta be gitting he said slowly its near twelve my old ladyll be home soon wondering why i aint done nothing round the house since i aint working aw sit down man luke said here give me your cup and lets finish this up theres plenty more where it come from buddy did as luke suggested his eyes filled with deep admiration for the larger man but you know what i dont git he began after luke handed him his drink is how could you carry grenades in your pockets and nobody not know it luke aw man luke began waving a long hairy arm youd be surprised what modern science can do and alreadys done you see all you little old fresh kids when you got throwed outta school the same as me all you could think about was having a good time now i went to the liberry and got some books and kept on learning i was always good in science class you remember that buddys eyes popped you mean you made them things hell no luke growled what i mean is by keeping up with whats happening in the world i know such things can be made so i got me somebody and had some made and a lotta other things too he gave buddy another sidelong look man ignorant folks dont know from nothing whats going on in this old world buddy sat very still hoping luke would go on but luke wasnt about to not yet anyway come on man he urged drink up we both gotta be gitting in a minute what about this partnership you talked about luke you still mean it sure i mean it man why you think i brought you up here just keep your mouth shut and your eyes open ill tell you more bout it later maybe tomorrow if things are going th way i expect then he saw the look on buddys face and realized what was on his mind he reached in his pocket and brought out three limp dollar bills here show this to yer ma and tell her you did some odd jobs for some folks out on the edge of town buddy pocketed the money eagerly thanks luke thisll keep her mouth shut for a coupla days when luke met buddy several days later buddy could tell by the grin on his face that things had been going well for him everythings just about in th bag man he said as they started off in the direction of lukes place but what i aint figured out yet is how we gonna git a car what we need a car for buddy asked surprised luke stopped and stared at him we need a car for ten good reasons he said finally how you think we gonna git the stuff set up hauling it on a bicycle look man you aint told me nothing bout your plans remember i dont know what stuff you even talking about yet luke gave that odd soft laugh thats right i forgot i been thinking bout this thing so long i guess i thought everybody knowed about it ill tell you all about it once we git up to my place but right now who you know got a car we can borrow or steal real easy i dont know man buddy began thoughtfully them people mama work for got a old rattle trap hes a intern at th hospital you know but when he come to see dave on thursdays he drives a new one he borrows from somebody at the hospital i reckon yeah luke got that calculating look on his face i didnt know old sawbones was still coming to see old dave buddy nodded the old lady would die if he didnt i dont see it doing no good though dave still just sits there and stares at the walls all day long thats a goddamned shame luke fumed young guy like him just outta college and as smart as a whip now all messed up for life most likely man thats what i been trying to tell you these crackers aint from shit theyll bust your brains out all over the place if they think you intending to use em that buck carson and his storm troopersll never git their hooks on me i betcha he stopped again and reached in his pocket you see these he asked bringing out two little colored objects about the size and shape of an easter egg buddys eyes bulged as he gaped at the sinisterlooking little balls yeah man whats them things them grenades you talked about th other day something like em luke grinned baby bombs old jake calls em you mean crazy old jake the pne who kept trying to integrate the university and they kept putting in the nut house till he cracked up luke stuck the eggs back in his pocket man crazy jake aint crazy hes got more sense than einstein ever had thats just an act he put on so theyd leave him alone and sos he could work at the plant and keep in touch with the latest scientific happenings buddy laughed man you let old jake goose you them things aint nothing but kids toys baby bombs he said laughing again yeah luke snorted they toys all right remember them two bastards what beat them colored girls up that time and how one day they just sorta disappeared in th thin air car and all luke asked bringing one of the little balls out again well one of these little toys sent them two mothers down to keep old barney company and i could tell you bout a lotta others keeping old barney company too that these little toys blasted to hell but im gonna let you see for yourself you dumb ass the look on lukes fa e and the tone of his voice sent chills through buddy he didnt really believe luke but still there was something about him evil his mother always said and people who tampered with luke usually ended up missing or dead but nobody could ever pin anything on him even old buck carson and his troopers didnt bother luke much man you could git in a heap of trouble with them things buddy said at last luke gave him a scorching look you mean to say after all these years you dont know you born in trouble if you black hell man dont say nothing more to me every day you sound more and more like miss mattie you wanna forget the partnership they stood on the corner staring at one another as the blazing july sun beat upon them then suddenly buddy turned pale and began trembling slightly and luke looked around to see buck carson and three of his boys pulling up to the curb beside them what you two doing buck drawled luke stared at the red puffy face and saw the mean glint in the small watery blue eyes and it was all he could do to keep his itching fingers from one of the little balls in his pockets we demonstrating he said finally verry verry funny buck said not the least bit amused howd you two like to make a coupla bucks tomorrow night luke pretended to think about that for a moment doing what he asked finally so look whos being particular buck snorted luke raised his hands slightly but kept them near his pockets we cant afford to be otherwise folks round here might git th wrong idea they see us doing business with you they figure you and your dogs and your fire hoses and lectric prods belong on one side and us on th other bucks face turned redder its my job to preserve law and order i do it any way i can he snapped luke shrugged we figure you aint too concerned bout law and order when th klan go marching in them bed sheets without a permit bucks head snapped back as if luke had struck him nobody tells me how to run my business you wait boy youll see then angrily he nodded toward the driver motioning him to drive off a terrible look transformed lukes face as he made the obscene gesture with his right hand no mother you wait and see im gonna git you befo this weeks out then he turned on buddy who had finally got his voice back and was about to say something shut th hell up luke snarled and come with me if you aint too goddamned chicken thursday morning buddy met luke at the appointed place an abandoned shack out near the plant where luke squatted near the steps between two soiled bulging laundry bags he gave buddy one of the bags and as they walked along heading for buddys house luke explained part of the plan to him buddy was astounded you mean we really gonna blow the whole town up his eyes popped his legs grew weak and he stopped walking and gingerly set his bag down suppose these things go off before we git em set up and suppose somebody sees us luke luke gave him a withering look man you ask more questions than a goddamned gallup poll i told you th other day if you too chickenhearted then git the hell outta my way i know what im doing and if you so scared of them white mothers you cant even take a leak for wondering if they gonna see you then go on bout your business they gonna hang your ass anyway man you know that but you too damn stupid to even fight back go on home and listen to your ma talk about waiting on the lord and see where that gits you go on he repeated and reached for buddys bag aw luke i was just wondering is all i mean i dont wanna back out now then come on and shut up luke muttered already it was getting hot and luke was still thinking about buck carson and how much he was going to enjoy blowing that fat bastard to bits and along with him the whole stinking town and wasnt it too damn bad he couldnt blow the whole state to hell especially the capital the goddamn mothering capital with that peaheaded rattlesnake of a governor who would make such good company for that mothering barney maybe if they got the car and things went well here maybe they could run up and pay old gov a visit the nogood mother he turned to buddy who walked beside him like a man in a deep trance what time you say old sawbones usually comes with th car about one or two buddy said then clamped his mouth shut to keep a whole bushel of questions from tumbling out luke nodded that gives us lots of time it aint even leven yet however when they rounded the corner where buddy lived they saw the car parked in front of the house and luke swore out loud buddy looked at him his eyes waiting for luke to blame him for this unexpected turn of events but lukes mind was working in other channels he suddenly realized that this was better yet the sooner they got the show on the road the sooner it would all be over come on he said to buddy lets stick this stuff in the back of the car and go on in the house remember what i told you now once you trip him on the steps leave the rest to me and if miss mattie comes down let me do th talking once they went into action buddys stage fright vanished completely and vaguely at first he began to perceive just what luke had been preaching the last several days then when dr pattersons big foot stepped within the circle of black rope and he pitched through the air as buddy yanked on it with an abrupt motion buddy nearly clapped his hands in ecstasy it was indeed good to hit back at last then while he was disposing of the rope luke disposed of the doctor buddy wasnt sure just how luke did it or exactly what he did but it was done so quickly that when miss mattie came hurrying down the steps the man was out cold and perhaps dead for all buddy knew miss mattie was horrified when she saw her employer sprawled on the floor but luke smoothly assured her that it was nothing really the doc just had a little fall and he and buddy were going to drive him back to the hospital and then the one thing they hadnt foreseen cropped up to haunt them miss mattie insisted on going with them and they had no alternative but to take her along she sat up front with luke her mouth pressed into a thin worried line and the doctor who now buddy well knew was quite dead was propped in a corner of the back seat with buddy when the car started the corpse lurched forward and frantically buddy grabbed it and held on as luke rounded the corner on two wheels miss mattie turned to look back her eyes bright with unshed tears that poor man looks just about dead she sighed luke she began her voice sagging with despair i know youve done something to him youre an evil man luke im just so glad your poor mother didnt live to see whats become of you boy her voice grated on lukes nerves especially since he hadnt really decided just what to do with her a man has to be evil to survive down here miss mattie he said wearily these white folks wouldve got me long ago if i wasnt it takes evil to deal with evil if you know what i mean she shook her head sadly her hands tightly clasped on top of the pocketbook in her lap you should love thy enemy luke besides all white people arent evil the way you think lukes odd laughter rumbled through the car and in the back buddy giggled as he hung onto the swaying corpse then luke glanced at her quickly i love them just as much as they love me miss mattie and they love me so much it hurts in fact i hurt all the time he said then let out a low whistle as buck carson and the three troopers shot by racing in the opposite direction and one of them noticed luke driving the doctors car oh my luke began up jumps the devil way head of time as usual he pressed down hard on the accelerator and the automobile leaped forward as the police car made a uturn and siren blasting took off after the speeding black sedan buddy was really enjoying himself now virtually jumping up and down in his seat as the movieland chase hit full stride how come they aint shooting at us he asked finally luke

three more and im gonna work on you plenty when i git there mother and he still laughed as the car struck the water and disappeared with barely a sound only a yellow puff of smoke and then absolute silence a great poet has been living in our midst for decades and is almost totally unknown even by the literati even by poets can this be possible in the age of criticism and of publication unlimited it is not only possible but highly probable poetry today is an established institution which has many of the characteristics of a closed corporation one of the rules of the poetic establishment is that negroes are not admitted to the polite company of the anthology poetry as we know it remains the most lilywhite of the arts a novelist and pamphleteer like baldwin is world famous m b tolson easily the literary equal of any number of baldwins is less honored in his own country than the most obscure poetaster yet not all poets and critics are at fault tolson has been recognized by eminent men of letters for a long time and at the extremes of the literary spectrum allen tate paid homage to him in an introduction to libretto for the republic of liberia an essay which is more famous than the poem william carlos williams in the fourth book of paterson salutes him in this way and to tolson and to his ode and to liberia and to allen tate give him credit and to the south generally selah theodore roethke selden rodman robert frost john ciardi and stanley hyman have also tried to bring tolson to the general literary consciousness but with little success in a time when liberals are falling all over themselves to shake hands with negroes when a dusky maidenly model may even be hired for tv commercials when black skin is the literary rage poetry by gentleman of color continues to be ignored and it is ignored far out of proportion to the common indifference to the art it is one thing to accept an artist on the grounds of his art regardless of race and creed as long as the artist can adjust to the ruling grecojudaicchristian culture it is another thing to accept an artist who contravenes that culture tolson belongs to the second category he is in effect the enemy of the dominant culture of our time and place he is to use the term he prefers an afroamerican poet not an american negro poet accommodating himself to the tradition it is probably for this reason that the libretto despite its success destime failed to tickle the sensibilities of the literati and the professoriat the libretto pulls the rug out from under the poetry of the academy on the stylistic level outpounding pound it shocks the learned into a recognition of their own ignorance harlem gallery his new collection being published by twayne in march pulls the house down around their ears tolson writes in negro walter savage landor told thomas hardy almost a century ago that english was a dying language english poetry and angloamerican poetry continue to bear out the dismal prophecy the glorious shreds of english are in our century daintily stitched together by the campus muse while the new language undergoes all its multiple birth pangs england is the mother of our tongue but nobody knows who the fathers were or how many it is a somewhat chaucerian situation bawdry high learning grammarlessness history myth all crying out for a jongleur or a poet it is not enough to equate tolson as his best critics have done with eliot or hart crane the cantos or ana base to make him equal is to miss the point just as it would be to make him better than tolson writes and thinks in negro which is to say a possible american language he is therefore performing the primary poetic rite for our literature instead of purifying the tongue which is the business of the academy he is complicating it giving it the gift of tongues pound eliot and joyce did this but with pernicious nostalgia that all but killed the patient tolson does it naturally and to the manner born here it is irrelevant to argue a thesis but apropos to suggest common sense the history of the negro places him linguistically at the center of american culture as it does no other nationality or race negro survival has depended upon the mastery of the gradations of english the negro has in his possession a gradus ad parnassum of culture which no other minority or majority can conceivably encompass this is the significance of allen tates salute to tolsons libretto only a southern intellectual and poet would be in a position to welcome a tolson albeit at the white front door one can practically feel the beat of walt whitmans wings against the dome of the library of congress the harlem gallery will not make matters easier massive as it is it is only a beginning of a greater work a kind of odyssey of the american negro of which this is the prologue the gallery returns to the basic themes of the libretto one of these is the accusation of gertrude stein that the negro suffers from nothingness written in a style conforming to the ode form of the earlier poem it is in fact a narrative work so fantastically stylized that the mind balks at comparisons the milieu is harlem from the twenties on the dramatis personae comprise every symbolic character from the black bourgeois babbitt and the lenox avenue poet to the alienated negro professor and sage who sits in the bar and elaborates along with the curator and the zulu club wits a platonic dialogue the giveandtake ostensibly moves on a level of talk about the artsa floor which is constantly caving in and plunging the reader into the depths of metaphysical horror which journalists nowadays refer to as the race question but like so many great works of poetry it is a comic poem it is funny witty humoristic slapstick crude cruel bitter and hilarious the baroque surface of the poem modifies none of this the harlem gallery is as if improvised by one of the great architects of modern poetry it may be that this work like other works of its quality in the past will turn out to be not only an end in itself but the door to poetry that everyone has been looking for despite all the stumbling blocks professional jealousies and race hatred negroes have always managed to carve a special niche for themd selves in attaining worldwide fame and acclaim since many years back joe louis in boxing and other boxers before him ben barek in football louis armstrong in jazz josephine baker as a singer and dorothy dandridge lena horne and eartha kitt as more decorative members have been accepted public figures whose road to glory was not a cinch but they made it as did many others despite the odds their individual contributions have added to the overall splendor of the public professions although the above singled out personalities and scores upon scores of others have been household words throughout the world little known is the fact that negroes also have excelled in the death in the afternoon art the first negro who gambled his life in the bull ring for a chance at fame and fortune was a peruvian named angel valdes born in the tiny village of palpa back in by some unknown chemistry the youngster was scarcely six when he began to wave a cape before tired old cows and bulls and yearlings as usual everybody in the backwoods peruvian village laughed at the pretensions of the eldest valdes son he has no shoes on his feet scarcely a shirt on his back taunted children and chortling adults and yet he talks of being a great torero it is just too funny and we will die of laughter where will he ever get the opportunity no one ever comes to this godforsaken dustladen village but young angel supported the taunts and the many fights with youngsters his age when he could stand their goading no longer for the grimly determined angel there was no schooling but he never ceased his dogged practice with the hapless cows sometimes an aging bull would haphazardly and halfheartedly charge the boy then angel was in his glory showing off his footwork the ridicule of his neighbors did not daunt angel and their laughter had a hollow sound before long for by the determined angel made his first bull ring appearance in the town of acho even dressed in a creditable fashion for the period there was an element of luck in all this for a mexican one jose maria vazquez happened to pass through palpa looking for fiery bulls no longer a bullfighter because of frequent gorings vazquez took to the young colored lad decided to teach him the art of the matador angel was an eager pupil of course in his first appearance in the acho bull ring angel played second fiddle in the cuadrillas four man teams of local toreros but soon eminent bullfighters of that period in peru such as salamanquino gonzalo mora and pedro fernandez added young valdes to their staff the youth was not interested in being little more than a stable boy or one who disengaged the attention of the bull when the torero had completed his passes adopting the name of el maestro the master young angel turned matadora killer of bulls his style was none too distinguished and valdes relied chiefly under the name of the negro from havana actually he was a descendant of the incasas were most of the other peruvian negro bullfighters who fought in their native land and in spain the most outstanding of the colored bullfighterswith peru contributing the greatest numberwas rafael santa cruz rafael was an automobile mechanic who first donned the gold embroidered finery of the matador on march and he went on to the biggest success of all achieved not only in the lima bullring but in spain where he went in his accomplishment was the greater since he appeared with such idols of the ring as joselito alvarez pepe escudero brother of the beloved manolo and joselito torres of all the colored bullfighters santa cruz develooed a style and presence and a devilmaycare courage that appealed to the crowds but a few years back santa cruz decided he had earned more than enough to last him the rest of his days he is now retired and engaged in business in lima this brief and not exhaustive history of negro accomplishments in the bullring a little known phase of activity of colored men is interesting in that never once dating back to over a hundred years ago when angel valdes first paraded into the bull ring was there ever even a hint of racial prejudice the colored fighters were booed and hissed and sombreros were thrown into the ring a sign of great displeasure when the toreros work is mediocre however this was not because they were colored but because they displeased the audience by their performances as bullfighters finally the bullfight sport has remained impartial to all in recent years there have been oriental aspirants risking life for big money and possible immortality when sports writers wrote about colored bullfighters and their earnest dedicated if not always skillful efforts they always referred to them as these colored bullfighters with white souls whose courage never falters and of course to top it all off there has been an entire slew of white americans trying their luck in the ring also with most indifferent success about the only thing that does give a charge to mexican bullfight fans is the constant stream of american girls short on technique but long on curves revealed to best advantage in tight bullfight costumes for these the fans have a very special ole that somehow emulates that wellknown sign of appreciationthe wolf whistle in recent news reports the congolese have been pictured as savages and the belv gians as civilizers yet historical records show that king leopold of belgium while pretending to civilize the congo cut and mutilated people and separated wives from husbands if they refused to be his outright slaves historical records also reveal that the congolese had a civilization of their own which was quite well developed and needed least of all the european civilizers there were several large kingdoms in the area we now call the congo the kingdom of ansika was comprised of the people of the bateke and bayoka whose artistic talents were very remarkable near the center of the congo was the bakuba kingdom or bushongo noted for its unity the excellence of its administration its art its craftmanship and the beauty of its fabrics the encyclopaedia britannica attests to the fact that most congo people are exceptional craftsmen ironwork knives spears arrowheads bracelets attains an extraordinary variety outstanding carvings are known the bushong culture kept its records and transmitted them almost intact to modern research the bakubas are an ancient people whose power and influence once extended over most of the congotheir history can be traced to the fifth century at the top of the bakuba hierarchy was the royal court composed of six dignitaries responsible for cabinetlike matters such as military affairs justice and administration at one time there were in the royal entourage other functionaries including a master of the hunt a master storyteller and a keeper of oral tradition or historian in the sixteenth century the bakubas ruled over a great african empire the memory of their glorious past is recalled in the tribe with historical exactitude they can name the reigns of their kings for the past years the loyalty of the people to these rulers is expressed in a series of royal portraitstatues dating from the reign of shamba bolongongo the great and best known of the bakuba kings shamba bolongongo was a peaceful sovereign he prohibited the use of the shongo a throwing knife the traditional weapon of the bushong this wise african king used to say kill neither man woman nor child are they not the children of chembe god and have they not the right to live early in the twentieth century when the european writer emil torday was traveling through the congo collecting material for his book on the trail of the bushongo he found the bakuba elders still singing praises of shamba bolongongo much of the history and civiliza tion of central african and east african areas was revealed by the study made by the portuguese african explorer duarte lopez in his book history of the kingdom of the congo he went to the congo in and stayed for many years from his study and description of the congo we learn that the kingdom of the congo included the territory formerly known as the congo angola and parts of the cameroons according to lopez the kingdom of the congo at the time measured miles at the time of lopezs year stay in the country the kingdom of the congo was divided into six provinces the province of bamba was the military stronghold of the kingdom and was capable of putting well disciplined men in the field in henrique the portuguese name for the son of the king of the congo was sent to lisbon and to rome to study theology in pope leo appointed henrique bishop of utica and vicarapostolic of the congo this was more than years before leopold king of belgium came on his socalled mission to bring christianity to the congolese at first there was peaceful commercial and cultural trade between the people of the congo and the europeans but later the dutch and the portuguese began their slavehunting they stripped whole villages of people they stole the riches in the form of goods and art objects they plundered for wealth in whatever form they could get from no european source was there an outcry against these savage acts to the contrary the european scholars clergy kings and merchants proclaimed to all how wonderful it was that they were civilizing the savage congolese those who proclaimed this were called by the prestige title historians but now they are being revealed as mere scribblers surely the greed for quick wealth blinded the eye of the european to justice soon treachery robbery and executions compounded the chaos in the congo violence became the order of the day as various assortments of european mercenaries vied for control of this rich area of africa in the ensuing struggle many of the christian churches built by the portuguese were destroyed not only were the physical structures of christianity destroyed but so was the faith itself when the clergy were silent about the grievous wrongs done to the congolese people they were not successful then in winning the congolese because they were often mere agents of the europeans in their plunder for wealth the congolese wondered why the white clerics were silent in the face of all these wrongs and then turned away from them perhaps these historical aspects have lessons for todays current events then came king leopold of belgium on the scene he was a shrewd business man who had a love for money and the commodities that it could purchase he followed events of his day carefully and knew that europeans had gone to africa for quick riches the time was the middle and late s so accordingly leopold called an international geographic conference of scientists scholars and business men addressing this conference leopold posed as the great civilizer and said to open to civilization the only part of our globe where it has not penetrated to pierce the darkness which envelops whole populations is a crusade if i may say soa crusade worthy of this century of progress before the conference adjourned it set up the international association for the exploration and civilization of africa with this fine cloak as a missionary leopold sent his troops to the congo and took possession of it he then forced each village to pay taxes in the form of rubber and ivory those who refused to deliver their quota of rubber and ivory were tortured by leopolds troops who mutilated bodies cut off hands and separated wives and children from husbands and fathers thus did the great civilizer bring civilization to the congolese people reports of leopolds agents bringing baskets of amputated congolese hands are many during the decade of to the need for rubber increased and the belgian kings profits from this item alone were million dollars this figure does not include the profit made by the american congo company to which leopold had granted concessions the methods of this company to collect rubber were similar to those used by the belgians when todays headlines scream about savage congolese it is well to remember the true facts of history the truth is that the congolese had a fine civilization of their own much before the europeans came to the region the truth also is that the europeans did not bring civilization to the congo they brought savagery in their torture and mutilation of the congolese in conclusion one must certainly ask who were the civilized and who were the savages history that is true history makes the answer apparent in huge letters reflecting upon harvey wishs the negro since emancipation prentice hall i am struck with the fact that the title is quite misleading this is so because the book is not primarily concerned with the negro since emancipation but with the ideas of prominent negro spokesmen since emancipation i believe a more correct title would be the one mr wish uses as a subtitle in his introductionleadership strategy protestfor in the anthology which follows he presents selected works of negro leaders manifesting these elements at certain times in american history as mr wish states the controversial picture of the passive negro content to let the northern or southern whites decide his destiny and fight his battles simply is not true and is everywhere being challenged of late his selections are from those negro leaders and writers demonstrating this fact and also demonstrating the shadings and differences which existed and do exist among various leaders of the negro movement at any given time in geographically charting these differences mr wish makes something of a contribution to the growing mass of literature about the negro it is generally felt among historians that one has to arrive at historical detachment before one can present a valid history of a trend an era or a culture nowhere is the validity of this theory better proven than in mr wishs book dealing with men and their ideas of years ago mr wish is on very sound ground he presents sharp clear illustrative passages from the men in question clearly supporting the points of view with which history credits them the more contemporary negroes are not so easily handled time has not allowed us to form a perspective on these men and mr wish selects passages from their works which may or may not be truly representative of the thoughts and trends they represent i sympathize with the task which mr wish undertook perhaps his choice of men and ideas is as good as any available at this time it is by no means the final word nor do i think he intended it to be however what is rather unfortunate if not unforgiveable is certain errors which occur for example the march on washington is dated august when in fact it took place on august later in the book the statement appears that martin_luther_king jr found a madetoorder situation to test gandhian techniques this is of course not altogether true first the situation found king he did not seek the situation second there is much evidence to show that king at the time of the montgomery boycotts did not have a clear idea of what gandhian techniques if any he would employ despite my criticism of certain areas of mr wishs work i still feel that it is a very valuable handbook to aid in the pursuit of trends in negro leadership strategy and protest from frederick douglass to booker t washington to du bois and down to the present it is short enough to be read with ease and reliable enough regarding early history to make the effort worthwhilebrooks johnson
the white race is your enemy those are pretty strong words arent they your words are mild but your eyes condemn me as something less than human a monster completely lacking in love for my fellow man your eyes condemn me and withdraw into themselves in pity and dismay loath to bear witness to this creature unable or unwilling to acknowledge their part in its creation how dare you judge me how dare

opposite effects once i used words like blackhearted blacklist black as sin black mark blackball black sheep black market black friday black magic blackmail white mans burden little white lie pure as the driven snow not realizing that each phrase was a razors edge scraping at the raw flesh of my pride you used the same words but with opposite effect with a swelling of pride a satisfying reinforcement of your inflated sense of personal worth you called me nigger savage and ridiculed my blackness the fullness of my lips my heritage you stole my food and gave me crumbs you stole my clothes and gave me your leftovers you stole my home and gave me a slum but i forgave your thievery and i thanked you for your gifts not realizing that as you strengthened your foothold on life i moved toward limbo i walked through doors those you sanctionedoffice doors restaurant doors merchants doors bus doorsto be met with your stony stare your halfhidden snickers your insults and rudeness and i pretended insensibility and i forgave you for seeing only a mass of blackness where there actually stood a black person or what remained of a person and i thought look at me look at me why cant you see me but you turned your back and again i forgave you not knowing that we were on a battlefield with my pride as the victors prize there were no doors for you only open doorways and smiles and greetings and you lapped it up and your ego swelled and you looked at my people and said in disgust they have no pride i looked at my people and i looked in the mirror and i said in shame we have no pride then you smiled and you said im your friend im doing all i can to help you and you shook our hands and addressed us formally and made promises but we said show us and you regarded us with sad eyes hurt eyes and you said you are too suspicious i looked at my people and i looked in the mirror and i said we are too suspicious and i said again and again as time passed we are too suspicious then i asked are we too suspicious and i answered we are too trusting too blind too deaf too vulnerable too numb the living dead a living death or monstrosity that is our alternative i have chosen monstrosity as have the thousands of negroes who are demanding instead of requesting their rights as have the rebels whom your psychologists label antisocial you have forced the choice you have stood on the sidelines and thrown rocks and closed your eyes and forced the choice there is no happy medium i cannot accommodate you by setting the selfrespect regulator at happy medium too much to become a burden to you yet not enough to resent the role youve assigned me i must guard my selfrespect with all my strength or i will die as many of my people have died as many of our children are dying i must

allow wellmeaning adults to teach my children to be intelligent swallow your pride and never show anger to have a sense of humor laugh when whites ridicule you to act better imitate whites to feel responsible for every misdeed committed by a negro to take credit for every accomplishment by a negro i must somehow teach them to walk the fine line between gullibility and cynicism though i myself

delivering the message they can also deliver my message i refuse to play the caste systemstatus game since i was automatically eliminated at birth as a possible winner and because one of the few

team and run the ball up and down the field unless i am welcome at the team banquet i refuse to become your yoyo allowing you to jerk me into and shove me out of your life at will i refuse to shoulder all of my responsibilities and have none of the privileges i refuse to believe that you can pinpoint nonacceptance by the family as one of the chief causes of antisocial behavior in the white individual and yet cannot extend this theory to cover a large number of people who are never allowed to forget that they are not really part of the world in which they live i also find it difficult to believe that you are completely unaware of the adverse cumulative effect of years of innocent allinfun ridicule i refuse to pretend that a few jobs a few integrated schools and a superabundance of

understand you in psychological warfare as in a shooting war it is fatal to pause for philosophical reflection on the enemys plight once i had a dream you murdered it ive buried it collective bargaining the key to a decade ago two groups could be seen marching handinhand in the fight for full equal rights for the negrothe middle class white liberal and the negro civil_rights leader the famous segregated school case provided a microcosm of this community of intereststhe key lawyers were thurgood marshall and robert carter negro and jack greenberg white both black and white social scientists did the background research which helped convince the supreme court to issue its unanimous decision and yet some ten years later the two groups have splitthe negro civil_rights leader bitterly criticizes the middle class white liberal for his hesitance and caution the white liberal stands bewildered attacked by the negro activists the white conservatives and also by his own conscience this conflict stands at the center of much that is wrong with the civil_rights movement in america today for the tragedy is that both sides are right and that a congenial meeting ground has to be reached the main source of the conflict is quite simple the negro argues that he wants his full rights not tomorrow or next week but today since he should have received them yesterday moreover he does not want them as a result of the white mans benevolence but rather because as a human being he deserves them the courts have ruled that he should have them the congress has passed laws asserting these rights and the american conscience demands them the negro correctly questions the morality and the justice of the white community that has taken so long in giving him what should be his since they wont give these rights he will take them and where does the white liberal stand on this issue he too agrees that the negro should have all of the privileges of any other member of the society butand this is crucialthe white liberal in america is basically a pragmatist who believes in certain values and goals but usually feels they take time to be achieved he argues that there should be no poverty today and there is that there should be no threat of war and there is that there should be no prejudice in this world and there is the pragmatic white liberal consequently fights poverty war and prejudice but is under no illusion that these problems can be wiped out today or for that matter tomorrow he hopes to move steadily in the direction of justice but does not expect justice to arrive fully grown immediately and this is his dilemma in dealing with negro rights he does not question that the negro ought to have these rights today that he should have had them yesterday but claims that anyone who argues this way is unrealistic if not irresponsible what must be done is that steps and perhaps the size of the steps and their direction differentiates the white liberal from many white conservatives have to be taken in the direction of full equality but that is all that can be achieved democracy said a famous negro jurist is a state of becoming and to this assertion the white liberal would add his fervent amen and there they stand the two groups who should be working together instead see a widening chasm appearing between them the negro leader shouts bitter epithets and drives for immediate and complete goals the backlash of their drive affects the whites the problem is that both the negro activists and the white pragmatist are right but how to join both approaches is the key tactical issue in the civil_rights struggle one place wherein an answer may be found is in an analysis of amen can history professor howard zinn does this in his interesting article abolitionists and freedom riders the tactics of agitation which appeared in the summer issue of the columbia university forum he offers the abolitionists as a model for the freedom riders todayas a lesson to be learned from history without challenging zinns evaluation of the contribution the abolitionists made to bringing about the end of slavery the ultimate price paid was a civil war but what was purchased with blood was not even equal rights for the negro as the continuing struggle for civil_rights today indicates the blame for the civil war does not rest on the abolitionists but surely the methods used by both sides offer us no lesson that we can learn from the past except how not to resolve basic conflicts if civil_rights agitators today want to learn any lesson from history would suggest that they move from the chapter dealing with the abolitionists over to the one dealing with labor history and learn the tactics unions and management have developed to resolve what some observers once thought would be an irreconcilable conflict between two classes labor unions and workers had to suffer many of the same indignities both legal and ideologicalas the negro in the beginning of american history courts found a legal basis for granting unions no rightsarguing that the very fact that workers joined together to seek benefits made the unions a conspiracy and consequently illegal under the common law moreover society developed a rationale to explain why unions and their members were inferior and not to be accorded the same privileges others in society had first there was the economic rationale if workers joined together to seek higher wages they were violating a dismal law of economicsnamely that workers ought to be paid only enough to subsist if given more they would not really know what to do with it instead they would have more children which would create even greater pressure on a limited sum of money available and this would result in depressions and even worse conditions for the foolish workingmen who did not know their place if this law of economics were not enough darwin provided a biological rationale for fighting unions and for deeming workers inately inferior the socialdarwinists argued that in the struggle for the survival of the fittest obviously those who were at the bottom of the pilenamely workersdeserved to be there while those at the top also merited their exalted level to help the downtrodden either through social welfare assistance or through union activities was to violate a law taken from biology namely the poor who remained poor deserved to remain poor if law economics and biology were not enough to provide an explanation for opposing the rights of unions then religion was called upon judge george baer president of reading railroad in wrote in response to a request that he help end a strike that the rights and interests of the laboring men will be protected and cared fornot by the labor agitators but by the christian men to whom god in his infinite wisdom has given control of the property interests of this country and thus a large share of american society viewed workers and their unions as inferior beings who would receive benefits only as a result of the largesse of management who in a paternalistic fashion might help their workers these managers felt that they and their workers were a part of one big family with papa management knowing what is best for his boys and girls the workers they pictured the union as the villain or outside agitator who would lead their children from accepting their place in society down the unhappy road toward juvenile delinquency and toward becoming uppity once a union arrived these managers felt that unrest developed a peer group outside the home became more important to the children than the parents the fathers powers were challenged the child began to think his goals were not synonymous with those of the parents he even wanted his allowance raised and perhaps worst of all he wanted to have his voice heard in how the family was run but before the worker could have his voice heard through his unions society and management had to accept the role of labor organizations and this proved not easy rarely would a firms executives initiate the steps necessary for negotiating with their employees leaders instead workers had to lash out at management government and society as being part of a conspiracy to exploit the workers even the relatively conservative american federation of labor included in its preamble to its constitution written in these bitter words whereas a struggle is going on between the oppressors and the oppressed of all countries a struggle between the capitalist and the labor which grows in intensity from year to year unions would therefore adopt such measures and disseminate such principles among the mechanics and laborers of our countries as will permanently unite them but words quickly proved insufficient to turn pious platitudes about workingmens rights into realities and as a result laborers launched demonstrations and these strikes though often peaceful were frequently bitter and bloody the explosion at haymarket square the massed battle at homestead and the mob action against railroads in the pullman dispute are just a few instances of the violence that punctuated labor history as unions sought their rights in our society in doing this they often indiscriminately attacked all police all government all courts and all businessmen but fight they did and eventually win they did for by the mids partially as a result of the backlash caused by the great depression which turned liberals and others against management the people speaking through the wagner act came to accept the fact that unions had a right to exist and that the process they wished to use with management to resolve their disputesnamely collective bargaininghad a legal place in our society and should be protected but the passage of the law did not mean that all firms accepted this new condition for a few years following the passage of the wagner act unions still had to fight for the right to organize and the weapon they frequently used was the sitdown strike and mass demonstrations but unions finally assumed their rightful place in our society and most managers however ruefully came to accept this place as the process of collective bargaining has become increasingly institutionalized the bitter conflict once so common has become far less frequent now responsible union leaders negotiate with responsible management representatives and generally come to terms which both sides will accept conflict still erupts but it most commonly arises now under certain conditions when unionmanagement relations in an industry or area are at an early stage for insecurity breeds violence in industrial relations when unions are democratic and the workers can and do refuse to abide by their leaders recommendations when mistakes in strategy are made when no real collective bargaining takes place because one side or the other believes it knows truth and the other does not when either side is not really negotiating with the other but instead issues statements directed toward its own members or the public and when both sides have stronglyheld opposing philosophical commitments on any issue or issues but even with sources of conflict still present unions and management use a process by which despite its faults they can negotiate their differences problems still remain not all workers have their rights protected some of them have even been taken away by the organization structured to protect themthe unions not all workers receive an adequate income not all workers feel secure in their jobs not all workers have ceased to be degraded by the kind of work they do or by the treatment they receive but a process for resolving conflict for protecting rights for bringing about progress has been evolvednamely collective bargaining and what better alternative has there been offered for resolving civil_rights disputes arguments from analogy are full of perils perhaps their main value is that they provoke thought and surely there are many analogies between the fight by workers for their rights and those by negroes for theirs the workers had to face stern opponents who used legal economic biological religious and paternalistic arguments whose goal was to keep employees in their subservient place so has the negro the workers had to use strikes boycotts demonstrations and violence against those who also used similar tactics against them so has the negro the workers had to face complaints that outside influences were leading them astray so has the negro the workers had to learn to cooperate with nonworkingclass liberals in order to secure their rights so has and must the negro the workers had to reject the ideas of those within and outside the labor movement who tried to subvert the justifiable aspirations of the working class into an instrument for bringing about their own vision of a better worldbe it a return to an imagined better society that presumably existed prior to the industrial revolution or as a stepping stone to a marxist revolution so too must the negro reject the reactionary goals of the black muslims and the revolutionary goals of the various branches of marxism now active in the civil_rights groups the workers had to learn to fight and win prolabor legislation but not think it enough so has and must the negro the workers had also to learn that there is a difference between ultimate goals and immediate realities and that there is a process that permits a somewhat orderly progression by which the gap between goals and realities can be narrowed and that process is collective bargaining so must the negro learn this lesson and this is the most difficult lesson to ask him to study for it requires him to accept less than he merits and the difficulty is compounded by the fact that the lesson must also be learned by the white community for negotiating means that at least two sides have to be ready to sit down to talk and to act so far the whites have been much slower than negroes in their willingness to discuss their differences but regardless of what the white appears ready to do the negro has to differentiate between minimum and maximum goals to demand the latter and accept no less than the formerfor example in education all negroes ought to have the opportunity for a completely unsegregated education in fact society in order to compensate for the culturally deprived background of many of the negro children ought to be spending more money on their education than they are on the white children but how does one immediately end segregated education for example in new york city the answer is one cannot one can only move in that direction what does this entail on the part of the negro civil_rights groups since the white community has moved tragically slow when at all it means that the negro groups have to place pressure on the white leadership to sit down and negotiate steps that will lessen segregation as well as improve the educational level of those schools that are and will continue to be predominantly negro for some time to come this entails negotiations that result in an agreement a contract to use unionmanagement terminology that would last for a period so that the education of the children can proceed without the turmoil that has so far often hindered rather than helped the students by this i do not mean that the negro community should accept these terms as final but merely as a meaningful compromise until the next negotiation when increased demands must be made and a still better settlement achieved let us take another exampleemployment the negro unemployment rate is shockingly twice that of the white which also is too high how do we solve this immediately we cannot to say we can is unrealistic and ridiculous even if as a matter of policy firms decide to hire more negroes than whites to compensate for past ill treatment the unhappy fact is that the negro is still inadequately trained for the kinds of jobs that are available consequently instead of demanding that the pie in the sky should be eaten today negro civil_rights groups should pressure management and unions to agree to open doors for negroes for jobs that communities including schools unions firms and all levels of government develop training programs which will teach negroes specific job skills adaptable skills and job responsibility and that the negro community sponsor more of these programs on their own all of these demands require negotiation by responsible leaders capable of coming to decisions that will hold for a while and permit some progress to be made thus what is needed is some process by which groups can negotiate their differences and convince their followers that the compromises accepted are important worthwhile and steps in the proper direction what this means is that on all levels negro and white leadership must be able to sit down and communicate with each other and make some resolution of their differences that will be accepted by both sides for a given period this does not mean that the negro groups should stop talking about maximum demands in collective bargaining one does not start ones negotiations with the minimum one wants but the negro leaders have to be ready to accept less and sell this acceptance in their communities they may be called uncle toms as a result all union leaders at one time or another have been charged with selling out to management and some have but as long as these leaders feel that what they have gained is the best that can be achieved at that time and place and that they have made a major step forward then it is their responsibility to accept the epithets of their followers even though i doubt if they will receive as many as some fear at times these settlements will be rejected for good or bad reasons but this is true of all settlements the fact is that one of the major frustrations facing the negro masses is the lack of progress the lack of settlements the lack of real leadership white or negrowith some notable exceptions some orderly procedure resulting in progress is essential to lessen the justifiable distress within the negro community for rising expectations without any way of really knowing whether these expectations can ever be achieved or without learning what progress has actually been accomplished can only result in frustration that explodes into violence and the resulting insecurity also partially explains the backlash among the whites since they too do not know what is going on but are frightened by the fact that they wander between two worlds one dead the other powerless to be born but a procedure has to be evolved by which the old world that is dead can be buried and that a new world can become mature enough to be born and grow and to secure this negotiating procedure the civil_rights groups have to fight with all their might as this is the one issue concerning which there can be no compromise for it is both the minimum and the maximum the labor movement recognized a similar issue as basic and would not give in concerning it as a result unions fought hard resolutely and met violence with violence for the right to organize to form a union and why not to bring about a marxist society not to bring about land reform and cooperatives but so that their leaders could be recognized as their spokesman and speak collectively for them with management and the government and negotiate terms that would result in improvement of their lot they would accept no less management did not willingly give them this right labor had to fight for iton picket lines and in legislative halls and in this fight they generally had the support of the liberals this too is the main fight that the negro has to wage today he has to demand of the white leadership in every community on every school board in every firm in every union that it be ready to sit down with the negro leaders and negotiate conditions that will bring the negro closer to the full and equal citizenship that he demands and is justifiably his right and these negotiations should not be buried in the human relations committees springing up in numerous communities with power to do naught but advise because consent to the status quo is all they normally do the whites have to represent the white power structure the negro his power structure with some inevitable jurisdictional disputes it would be nice if there were no such differentiated structure but it is a fact that there is to argue for example that the white leaders at this time in history have the interests of all citizens at heart is as nonsensical as the statement that management has the interests of its workers at heart the latter is at best partially true in that many managers do concern themselves with their workers welfare but the executives main responsibility is with other problems and issues similarly the white leader may wish to help his fellow negro citizens but he too has other problems and other interest groups to which he feels responsible these interfere with his often seeing eyetoeye with negroes concerning how to resolve difficulties to argue further that such a collective bargaining structure would inevitably remain with us forever and consequently we will never be able to rid ourselves of the problem because each side will continue to make demands regardless of the need is like saying we ought not to have nations today because if sometime in the future we have world government and with it peace and understanding nations will not be necessaryin fact may provoke problems both arguments are at best utopian and at worst are rationalizations for inactivity moreover the history of collective bargaining indicates another alternativenamely that labor and managements goals and practices will become more and more alike as they have and that bargaining will not be an instrument of conflict but one of cooperation this too could be the final result of negrowhite bargaining until then however people with power have to negotiate with people with power people with responsibility and a willingness to take the lead the credit and the blame have to deal with people having similar characteristics both sides have to be willing to come to terms imperfect terms to be sure and sell these settlements to those whom they represent that sometimes they will fail in this task and conflict may result is inevitable and justifiable for such a procedure will in the long run not end disputes but rather reduce the number of intense conflicts after all for a while this will be a new process in which both sides will be insecure the masses may not agree with the settlement for good or bad reasons there will be mistakes in strategy one side or the other may really fail to bargain and each side may be bitterly and philosophically opposed to the position the other side takes but as we have already discussed this is still true in collective bargaining between labor and management today and yet the process of bargaining does result in major benefits to workers and is one method of institutionalizing and resolving disputes and as collective bargaining is only one course by which employees try to make advances and to settle their problems for example negotiations can only cushion the impact of technological change they cannot solve it so the civil_rights groups have to fight other battles elsewhere in legislative halls and in the courts as examples but collective bargaining between negro and white leadership would permit the stepbystep peaceful progress so necessary today if both groups are not to be so estranged that even if the negroes achieve all the rights they merit the chasm between the groups would be so great and the hatred so intense that progress will have poverty in intergroup relations as its handmaiden and from where will these negro leaders come in some instances the white community must seek them out in others they will arise themselves as they have in the past out of the already active civil_rights organizations the negro churches the labor unions the industrial firms the schools youth groups and the local communities the real problem has been that the negro leader has been unable to point to many concessions or improvements for which he could claim credit and thereby secure the support of the negro community one reason for reverend martin_luther_kings power among the negroes in the south has been that he could point to the role he and his organization have played in securing progress for he has indeed often bargained successfully one negro intellectual pointed to this dilemma when he charged that the riots ought to be part of the message to the white power structure the white power structure itself diminished the influence of the negro leaders by refusing to make the necessary concessions to them this is a must for negroes if they are to retain their influence otherwise the masses of negroes will rise up in disgust and frustration and follow those negro leaders among the black muslims and elsewhere who so accurately reflect this disgust and frustration and offer such simple answers to such complex problems to blame and hate all whites for ones inadequacies and problems is as simple an explanation as to blame and hate all negroes the answer we are proposing is less simple and less satisfying to ask the negro to fight for evolving rather than complete solutions for becoming rather than arriving is not easyparticularly when suggested by white liberals who do not have the problem to solve but the white liberal must strive along with or as a part of the negro civil_rights groups to force the white leaders to be ready to negotiate and to make worthwhile settlements he must do this otherwise the white liberals argument that complete justice will not come to the negro today or as a result or immediate or unrealistic demands becomes only an excuse for inaction an apology for delaythus to bring tomorrow closer to today requires the acceptance by whites and negroes of some procedure like collective bargaining by which differences can be settled and progress made otherwise the sun will stand still in the heaven while both sides struggle below tomorrow will take longer in coming and the price we will pay for this delay is obvious all around us listen know old dear i youve been working for whitey the liberal for five long years now and have only received one raise at the time of the fare hike last year but you mustnt be too discouraged and you did right to tell him go fly a kite with your stingy raise busterbehind his back of course because you couldnt very well refuse the damn thing unless you had some other better place to go to and besides that fare boost had sorta put a crimp in your budget remember but what im really wanting to say is this that here in our affluent society which has an antipoverty war going full blast on paper you simply cant afford to get too uppity because youve got to remember your place in fact being black and female youve got two places to remember one lower than the other if you can possibly get that far down which is why so many of yall walk around all bent over i guess youve been so low so long so you see when you hear the liberal and miss ann telling people why some of our best friends are colored and you know theyre talking about you you ought not to let it get your goat much yes i know youre one of the most overworked characters in history overworked and underpaid too and i know that every time you pick up a book magazine or playbill theres sure to be at least one little thing about the negro maid but really old dear you must learn to bear fame with grace then when the liberal is entertaining the press and he casually mentions his wife whos out cooking the dinner and you who are out bedding down the brats and his filipino man who is out fixing the drinks and then just to demonstrate his wry humor he tells a little story concerning the shoeshine boy who in real life is your yearold husband dont you look mad when you bring the er little darlings in to say good night you smile er i guess grinning is more in tradition that way you just might get one more of them pay raises and then too if you keep the liberal feeling good hes going to go easy on miss ann and she just might give you one more of them dresses of hers i mean they look real nice on you even if you do sorta hafta add a little piece in the side after all if you hold your arm just so nobody can ever tell the difference but to get back to my point and your two places here in our great society which have given rise to the theory that you meaning all yall should be a sort of spiritual sponge for your husband yes thats right they mean punching bag now what im trying to point out to you is this dont you pay that crap no attention when you come home at at night after being on your poor aching feet practically since that morning and racing round like crazy because miss ann imprisoned in her own place which is under the liberals big foot is most certainly going to keep you reminded that you are under her foot and she gets every pennys worth out of you every day you are ready to hit the sack so when you get home and there sits your husband who tells you hes hungry and if you dont hurry up and fix him something to eat hes gonna go up side your head him whos been warming a chair bottom all day only shining a shoe now and then except for that brief moment around noon when he hopped up there and cut them few steps when the liberal flipped him that quarter tip he is going to sit there while you make a hour day well listen old girl you just march on out there to that kitchen and fix yourself a big pot of steaming hot watery grits taking your own sweet time of course and when he comes out there to give you whatfor you let go with them grits and then start working out with that pot believe me old dear you wont hear no more about him going up side your head not ever again and oh yes should the opportunity ever present itself dump some of them grits on old youknowwho will you the loveliest day before i got to be such a sharp and wise fellow of about or i used to visit with my grandfather on his farm every summer we had some pretty good times together and i miss it all but most of all i miss an inner quality of myself thats gone forever but its nothing new its an old story out of a new time i dont know exactly why im telling it and i dont know why you may listen but ill tell it and i hope youll listen as we did every morning on this particular morning we were up before sunrise milking the cows and feeding the animals while my grandmother cooked breakfast when we finished with this work we went in and ate and all during breakfast i kept looking at the rifle that leaned in the corner and caught a straight line of sunlight on the dark blue barrel after breakfast we were going squirrel hunting we had planned it and talked about it as we cut the weeds out of the young cotton and during the two or three days we spent thinning the corn it was an event that we had looked forward to like having ice cream sometimes on sundays after dinner well boy we go see what you can do today he was looking at me smiling and i smiled back and waited with a deep anticipation he was a tall dark man with big shoulders and gray closely cropped hair something in his face was strong and stern but his brown eyes were soft and loving and i respected him and loved him after eating we put the saddle on his horse there was only one saddle i rode bareback my grandmother fixed us a lunch and put it in a flour sack which was hung over the saddle horn and in the cool earliness of the morning we rode off down the road about eight oclock the sun was getting hot but we rode in the shade of the trees that branched out over the road and so it wasnt so hot i looked back and could see our tracks fade out in the red dust behind us my grandfather rode in front and i watched his back and listened to the squeak of the saddle as we went along finally we turned off the road and went into the woods and high above the tall tree tops against a spot of blue sky i could see a strong black bird circling at a tremendous altitude when that passed there were only the green tree tops and the blue sky on the side of a hill that overlooked a misty river bottom we came upon a cluster of old trees that were mingled with large dead and live limbs there were about four or five squirrels playing on the branches we slid down from our horses and walked slowly and as quietly as we could up to the trees we took aim and fired at the same time two fell the others ran into the hollows and cracks in the trees now we had to wait for them to come out we sat with our backs against an old log without saying anything and there were only the sounds of the woods the singing of birds and locusts sounding out clear against the green hot quietness the time seemed to dream away and we waited but the squirrels didnt come out but still we waited and watched the trees and looked out over the river bottom that lay beneath us in a humid hot mist and a wide cluster of dark green tree tops the sun got higher and hotter then one came out we looked at each other and silently decided that i take him i put my sights on him and eased in on the trigger and watched him fall against the ground and then the wait began again after the sixth one it was decided that that was enough it was almost midafternoon and we started back home by another way when we came to a running stream just off the road we had a cool drink and ate our lunch the cold buttered biscuits with the scrambled eggs and ham tasted very good when we finished we just sat there saying very little and watching the water go by four white people drove down the road at first only one of them saw us then they all turned and looked i thought nothing about them they were gone from my mind as fast as the car was gone from my sight we skinned and cleaned the squirrels and rinsed them off in the stream and went on up the road to where it crossed the main highway there was a store there and the white man who ran it asked me if i was a pretty good shot i said i was and he offered to give me a bottle of soda water what kind do you wanta red and i said that was the kind i wanted because that was the kind i wanted at that moment and that was all that mattered to me outside my grandfather talked to some people that we knew and i sat on the running board of their old pickup truck with my old straw hat pushed back on my head and drank my soda water and watched the cars go down the highway i felt fine sitting there in the afternoon shade with a nice cool drink and hearing the voices of the old people as they talked it was a lovely day one of the loveliest ive ever had but as the years have gone by ive learned new things such as a red bottle of soda water is a joke that theres a difference between white people and black people other than the color i learned about lynchings and a lot of other things now theres a second thought about anything red when white people look at me suspiciously they hang in my mind long after they are gone sometimes and now i wonder about the importance of a lot of things that i didnt even bother about at first that arent even important and i know it but they worry me a little sometimes i told this to a modem and educated young man one day and he said ignorance is bliss i think not i said ignorance is hell i knew what he meant but he didnt know what i meant and i didnt want the essential part of a real but dreamlike day to be equated to ignorance what does is mean to be txt an egg what is it l w lik tthese are questions which i am never asked at cocktail parties or in polite company nice people simply do not just walk up to one and ask these questions they are burdened by the fear of offending they would be stigmatized by the wellknown dictum that to ask such questions immediately differentiates the egg from other people they really dont care because they themselves will never have to experience being an egg and in fact they do not wish such an experience to be aware of what its like might cause them to suffer the experience and might cause them to be notsonice people in addition in order to maintain the standards of todays cocktailparty sophistication it is essential to pretend under any circumstances that one already knows all about such things and has no need to ask questions finally i am never invited to cocktail parties if i am present it is not as a guest but as an entertainer and i am purchased not present socially who does ask these questions well some people dothe sociologists for example not all sociologists but only those specializing in the field they come around with pads of paper and pencils and ask a multitude of questions of a crosssection of eggs they then publish a crosssection of the answers in little scholarly journals which may be read by a crosssection of the sociologicallyoriented public but which are more usually read by a crosssection of fellow sociologists specializing in the same field my own uninformed opinion is that such studies do not quite serve the purpose of familiarizing the general public with the real lifestruggle which faces every egg from birth to death psychiatrists ask these questions at least my psychiatrist does he probably knows more about my life than i do because he knows how to interpret my overt thoughts and actions and to discover the subliminal truths which cause me to think and act as i do but then he is also an egg and whatever i communicate to himwhether consciously or unconsciouslyis a professional secret i have been asked such questions by noneggs who are interested in our cause but these are few and far between and they are always marginal noneggs who do not belong to polite society and cannot communicate their knowledge to any but other eggs and equally marginal noneggs then again except in very rare circumstances they also suffer from the fear of offending and differentiating the egg from themselves they are determined to prove that eggs and noneggs are basically the same there are i suppose others who would ask the questions but i have never encountered them so much for that i am avoiding the point of this paper which is to describe just what it does mean to be an egg well to begin with you are born you emerge from the womb and are exposed to life for a while you are coddledim sorry you are cradled and fondled and treated with love and affection by your mother but soon you have to make your own way and thats where the trouble starts you have to make a living somehow so you set out with great ambitions and dreams you have ideals you of all other eggs whove ever lived are going to become somebody you look around you and see your friends having the same ambitions and dreams and ideals surely such a mass of idealists will change the course of history and you will march forward unspoiled towards achievement what happens you have to make a choice you have to choose a way of living and the sad thing is that your choice is not free in spite of what the constitution says you cannot choose to become director of a large company or even plan on aiming someday to be director unless its your own company or one owned by another egg you cannot expect to become president of the country so you give up that dream you cannot really get anywhere in the nonegg world because noneggs represent the majority and you can be so easily crushed broken drained so you look around at whats left open to you you see other eggs going out and you see them regimented boxed sold beaten whipped fried scrambled boiled poached and powdered some achieve a certain distinction but always at the cost of their own personalities the majority are simply cookeddevoured by unthinking noneggs who couldnt care less find me the nonegg who pities or sympathizes with us other than those marginal noneggs previously mentioned and ill show you a saint noneggs do not mind killing us because for them we are not human what else can we do we can degrade ourselves by playing the fool and allowing ourselves to be ridiculously dressed as party favors and easter eggs we are never asked about our own religious preferences we can become the momentary attraction by being rolled roughly across lawns or carried on spoons but again the only outcome of these occupations is tragedy none of us has ever survived such an ordeal in one piece in the end we are a lost race there is not much more to be said we have tried to be patient we have endured torture and ridicule without protest some of us have avoided being broken by the noneggs but not many and of these who have done so most have in the end relinquished their dignity and become rotten adding their foul odor to the stench exuded by all hypocritical noneggs we must resist but we must do so proudly there resides within each and every one of us a rich untapped reservoir of strength the core of our salvation lies within each of us as an individual we can only help ourselves by developing that strength to its utmost by working and striving to become strong tough and rocklike we must take the line of most resistance not the compromising approach which leads to the degeneration and decay of ones internal spirit we must in the final analysis face up to the choice and decide just where and how we are going to overcome thus i urge every egg young and old alike to take up the rallying cry petrify not putrefy as the meek proper a young man who sud denly explodes into vi olent rage in leroi jones dutchman young robert currys performance was widely acclaimed as chicagos most spectacular in quite a spell but ive never thought of myself as an actor said the yearold bundle of nerves and ambition on a recent visit to his native chicago slight and bespectacled curry fidgeted as he confided his desire to be a successful director he discussed plans for directing off broadway productions and explains quite bluntly why he deserted chicago for the big city i dread the thought of new yorkits a dirty placebut it has money life and possibility of recognition he said chicago critic richard christiansen called curry a performer of truth in the review of dutchman he praised the young actors coming to the play with limited acting experience and performing with incredible honesty and stunning power currys affair with the arts dates back to his teens while attending chicagos morgan park high school he had two short stories published in science fiction periodicals at the citys wilson junior college he became president of the poetry club and gained his first acting and directing experience as a member of the schools reputable drama group after wilson it was on to roosevelt university where a musical scholarship brought him within nine hours of a ba in piano and composition his accomplishments also include writing the libretto for an opera as well as two plays basically i want to directi know i can says the confident virtuoso determined to be a director having outgrown ambitions of being a chemist astronomer and pianist curry discusses how some of his earlier interest in science led to directing science contributed logic he says a director must have a sense of casting an imagination he should be scientist artist musician and psychologist he believes the theatre has a new attitude towards the negro today that affords a great opportunity and he would love to direct in tv and write for movies someday but he shies away from all suggestions of acting in either medium nevertheless he is an actor asked if he identified with the character portrayed in dutchman currys personality was transformed yes i did identify and as he explained his expressive eyes and gesturing arms suggested passion not unlike that memorable scene from dutchman when the negro heros frustration and bitterness exuded from him as naturally as springs grass turning green though he will concentrate on directing he does not intend to forsake his writing he admits that reading chekhov inspired the two plays he wrote while in school you find yourself by writing other peoples playsyou copy people till your writing becomes you he adds now i am ready to write myself everybody tries to shatter and shock you these days he continued everybody is afraid to be human curry hopes to complete a book of short stories based largely on the weirdos who have been his neighbors in chicagos heterogeneous hyde park community how does he feel about those weirdos oh theyre beautiful people ultrahuman people i enjoy them a rather human young fellow himself this summer he was cited as one of chicagos best people by a local magazine with talent warmth and abounding spirit he now has invaded the big cityhoping it will be so kind chester himess satirical novel pinktoes grove press has finally made it across the atlantic europeans have enjoyed the civil_rightssex spoof for years but in this country infested with hypocritical ignorant selfrighteous unnecessary censors these delays have become commonplace by now they may be gimmicks used by overzealous ad men who know that you can withhold social philosophical moral or political books from the american reading public without arousing the slightest interest but tease them with a sex book and slavering readers will strain at their leashes to buy it anyway pinktoes is here its not really a novel but as times reviewer sniffed a dirty joke times dainty man neglected to consider that dirty jokes are one of the most ancient and entertaining products of the human imagination pinktoes flaw is not that it is a dirty joke but that as a dirty joke it lacks variety in proportion to its length and it lacks oomph at the punchline but it is funny its one of those books that make people laugh aloud page after page the heroine mamie mason a harlem society matron directs a pack of black and white sex hounds through a maze of bedroom encounters the caricatures of hungup black and white integrationists are shuffled well but unlike a deck of cards you really stop caring what suit they come in mamie herself is a soupedup aunt jemima substituting anatomy hers and her friends for pancakes and like her prototype shes a bit of a servant too letting her dignified lecherous whites act out their fantasies on andor through her negro men and white women work the same routineonly in reverse as it were thats pretty much the ball game of course there is a message all of these characters are debased to the extent that racism has played havoc with their sexual thus total psyches just as it does in real life unfortunately to disillusion those who think pinktoes tells it like it is civil_rights groups do not engage in wideopen integrated orgies as described by himes that would represent an advancement toward social sanity

own joe is brought up successively by a group of women then by a sexseeking woman named sally buck who joe thinks is his grandmother well brought up is the wrong phrase here joe is sort of left to make his own way provided with food and clothing and shelter and virtually nothing else he is not particularly bright a fact which might not be so unfortunate under the circumstances a bright joe buck might very well have ended up by taking his revenge on a neglectful society joe stumbles into sex and his natural inclination is to want to love the little nymphomaniac then when the yearold girl is taken off to a sanitarium joe briefly makes love to one of the fellows who has befriended him by this time joe has bloomed into one of those tall leanhipped young apollos out of the west and

he has cared he has lovedhwf there are a lot of people who feel that the fact that jews have suffered their own kind of suppression and subjugation automatically qualifies them to understand just how the african or the negro feels in a similar situation this is only true to a limited extentcertainly not to the extent that we are led to believe in reading froma sands my son africa sherbourne press in my son africa the author goes to some pains to prepare the reader to accept the fact that as a jewish woman the principal character can fully identify with and understand the rejection pain and special panic of the south african blacks she befriends in attempting to pull this off she relates experiences of her jewish parents and the nazis that there are similarities cannot realistically be denied but they are not exact parallels to the situation facing the black african in south africa in south africa the black african is the majority who is subjugated by a white minority on his own land the horrors that the jews have suffered over the years have been numerous all too numerous but the most heinous crimes have happened in countries to which they have migrated however the african is bullied by migrants to his lands there are perhaps arguments to demonstrate that this is a minor difference but it is a difference and coupled with other differences of degree it makes a rather strong case against part of the authors basic thesis in this book despite w hat controversy the basic tenets may bring on i think there will be less objection to the style of the author her story is rather easily and fastmovingly told in many respects the hand of a woman is very evident in the style but like most good women writers the author escapes the fatal fault of being too feminine in her handling of her effort the book has certain elements of sex violence racism and excitement that are very professionally mixed and strategically deployed to keep the reader interested and entertained the reader comes away with the feeling that he might have been the willing subject of a kind of literary shell game the crucial and central point is that the reader willingly participated and perhaps that is why recommend the book despite some basic uncertainties i still hold for it brooks johnson the one hundredth anniversary issue of the nation is a rich incomparable collection of essays by distinguished american writers and it is worth buying and treasuring for its breadth and depth of concern with those subjects and those problems which exercise the liberal conscience but if not for these reasons this handsome sleek page edition of the famous old weekly is worth buying because of the revelation it offers of the low point to which a great american negro writer can stoop in an effort to justify his posture of aloofness from the negro struggle ralph ellison one of the ablest writers in the world today wastes his enormous talent and energy on a silly apology for his not having spoken out in behalf of the black revolution in almost eight pages in a piece called tell it like it is baby mr ellison succeeds in saying only what he might have said more fruitfully and more simply in a paragraph his message is that the whole racial problem in this country is so complex that he being a sensible and cautious man lacks the audacity to attempt to state what he believes to be its essence thus he continues his subtle aboveitall warfare with those writerswhite and blackwho are engaged in the struggle against racist evil and mr ellisons ridiculous piece should be compared with the lucid human moving article by george w broadfield a different drum describing how this brilliant and highly talented man he designed the first domestic peace corps found his way back from a bitter alienation spawned by the very racism mr ellison pretends he cannot judge it is worth spending to read and compare the two articles but of course there is so much more the authors represented here include howard zinn dan wakefield harvey swados c vann woodward alfred kazin harold clurman and robert alan aurthur among some altogether sometime negro digest contributor john oliver killens black mans burden is represented by a provocative piece of filmland called hollywood in black and white for this special issue the regular editor carey mcwilliams turned over the chair to david boroff who died last may before the special issue was wrapped up the magazine stands as a fine memorial to mr boroffhwf the civil_rights issue is the most significant moral crisis in the history of our country it is a national problem in some respects more crucial to every american than the implications of the bomb in recent weeks the problem exploded in our faces the fact that congress has passed the civil_rights act is not enough each individual must pass his own bill within his heart we are all aware of this whether in a vague sense or with complete consciousness of it the recent outbursts of emotion even in the enlightened liberal north have made this woefully apparent still most americans look at the south and its people as the sole violators of human justice william faulkner was a southerner who happened to be a writer to imply the reverse would be erroneous because the mans writing became what it did because of his background and birthright not in spite of it his life was begun mostly spent and concluded in mississippi a part of the world that is no loneer so much a state of the union so much as it is an emotional idea a symbol of intolerance and social backwardness it is one of the last strongholds of southern resistance to a heterogeneous and assimilated society mississippis dilemma was faulkners dilemma and bill faulkner wrote with an honesty and penetration into his own mixed feelings that few contemporary novelists have equalled there are two critical approaches to such an authors work the social and moral implications contained within or the purely artistic the ageold question of whether or not the writer successfully achieved his object since faulkner was a moralist who felt a compelling need to resolve the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself we should perhaps concentrate on the former consideration in his entire literary career faulkner wrote novels and short stories the vast majority of his writing dealt with the problems of the south not just the racial problem but with the entire social structure that was and still is founded upon memories of precivil war agrarian days and was beginning to crumble in the face of a new increasingly urban and industrialized socioeconomic scheme he embodied the entire deep south within his wonderful and terrible yoknapatawpha county which he created out of his mind and experience and committed to paper his characters lived in yoknapatawpha county they never stepped outside its boundaries except to go to war or to nearby memphis for a big weekend yoknapatawpha is the deep south as faulkner knew it likely enough he knew it better than most as his work when conceived as a whole shows that he never stopped thinking about it the sound and the fury deals with the compson family and their moral destruction the dilemma is centered in jason who despises negroes yet allows himself to be directed by dilsey the housekeeper who has become a mainstay over a period of many years with the compsons jason wants desperately to restore the family to its original status but feels everyone is thwarting his efforts to achieve this goal them new york jews back east are responsible for his poor investments in the cotton market and his kitchen full of niggers forces him to work in a general store so that he can feed them jason does not recognize his own cruelty and depravity he is so smallminded that he is incapable of selfrecognition intruder in the dust contains faulkners strongest statement concerning the negroes and the southern position relating to them lucas beauchamp a thoroughly unlikable and highly admirable negro is about to be lynched for the shooting of a white man a crime that everyone knows he did not really commit despite the circumstantial evidence that exists lucas is an inflexible obstinate individual who refuses to be what his white neighbors want him to be he neither defies nor compromises his composure and dignity infuriate the white citizens of yoknapatawpha county every white man in that whole section of the country had been thinking about him for years we got to make him a nigger first hes got to admit hes a nigger then maybe we will accept him as he seems to intend to be accepted in essence lucass behavior does not in any way reenforce the stereotype on the contrary it contradicts it and fans the flames of guilt lucas is able to endure even in mississippi where he is not only an object of hatred but one of guilt faulkner shows immense admiration for the negros ability to endure and survive the injustices inflicted upon him so mercilessly he is also careful to emphasize the sense of guilt and shame that lies deeply buried in the white southern conscience this is a major part of the dilemma perhaps the essence of it as we see it recorded almost daily in the press the white southerner who deems himself a practicing american and yet does everything in his power to prevent the negroes in his community from exercising their rightsin short from being themselves practicing americansis another illustration of guilt it is a clearcut seemingly impossibletoresolve conflict between reality and dreamthe reality being that negroes as american citizens should vote and the dream of course is the fondly clenched myth of the negros inferiority a myth that proves to be just a little more so with each passing day it is this type of conflict that lucas represents to the white community pragmatic evidence clearly points out that he could not have murdered the man but it would be a relief to see him proven guilty and hanged as it would prove that the negro who refused to follow the stereotype who insisted upon his individuality as a human being was in essence a nigger the negro strength is a primary theme in faulkners writing and should not be overlooked at any time although the sound and the fury was written in faulkner added an appendix to the novel during the late s at the publishers request this addition introduces the members of the compson family from their beginnings in the eighteenth century to the year the reader sees a pattern of progressive deterioration within the family alcoholism insanity incest and crumbling moral strength reduces them to their woeful status at the beginning of the novel the last characters to be outlined are the negro servants luster a man aged who was not only capable of the complete care and security of an idiot twice his age and three times his size but could keep him entertained dilsey they endured the preceding comment makes faulkners respect fairly obvious it is interesting too that the appendix was written so many years after the body of the novel within the book dilsey is certainly the most forceful character the guiding force who keeps the compsons living from day to day in faulkners mind these negroes did endure the appendix is a monument to those negroes who years later were objects of his respect and admiration it is conceivable that he returned to his novel and discovered a striking parallel between dilsey and countless negroes in and around oxford the writers home the appendix then became an amen to his original observation of dilsey and the negroes of oxford mississippi the negro strength is portrayed even more vividly in intruder in the dust by lucas beauchamp who serves as a reminder and example to everyone especially the whites sambo will suffer it of course there are not enough of him yet to do anything else and he will endure it absorb it and survive it because he is sambo and has that capacity to endure and survive but he will not be thrown back decades and what he survives to may not be worth having because by that time divided we may have lost america faulkner shared the dilemma experienced by many southerners the attempt to defend the ideology and ritual of inequality and separation of the races which is rubbed raw by the conscience that knows this defense is inherently wrong the result is a deep sense of guilt shared by enough individual southerners to be considered collective psychologists argue that people conceal their guilt feelings through acts of compensation the most apparent compensation in the south is perhaps the almost blatant southern hospitality and the compulsive need to boast about it this is not a thorough psychological analysis but the concept is sufficient for an insight into faulkners writing william faulkner the writer constantly fought those tangled feelings within the heart of bill faulkner the mississippian like most southerners he gloried in the past the legends and myths of the old south meant a great deal to him the past was also his source of guilt slavery lynching and violence are all a part of the past that the southerner both longs after and tries to evade these factors constitute the southern dilemma that faulkner so desperately tried to portray in his writing it is because he was a southerner first and a writer second that he spoke so eloquently for his people even those who attacked him as a nigger lover he held a strong conviction that the south could and should solve her own problems concerning racial tensions thats why we must resist the north not just to preserve ourselves nor even the two of us as one to remain one nation because that will be the inescapable byproduct of what we will preserve which is the very thing that three generations ago we lost a bloody war in our own backyards so that it remain intact the postulate that sambo is a human being living in a free country and hence must be free thats what we are really defending the privilege of setting him free ourselves which we will have to do for the reason that nobody else can since going on a century agothe north tried it and failed so it will have to be us soon now this sort of thing the possibility that lucas beauchamp will be lynched wont even threaten anymore it shouldnt now it should never have this presents a lucid insight into the white southern position we can see that the southerner knows that his society is warped and functioning out of joint we can see that faulkner is brutally aware of the dilemma for he does share it with his fellow citizens like all southerners he was a product of his segregationoriented environment it would be a romantic falsehood to assume that bill faulkner did not have at least a particle of jason compson in himself how much we will never know and then a yankee will talk your head off about niggers getting ahead get them ahead what i say get them so far ahead you cant find one south of louisville with a blood hound because when i told him uncle job the negro handyman about how theyd pick up saturday night and carry off at least a thousand dollars out of the country he says dont begrudge um i can sho afford my two bits two bits hell i says that dont begin it how about the dime or fifteen cents youll spend for a damn two cent box of candy or something how about the time youre wasting right now listening to the band dats de troof he says well ef i lives twell night hits gwine to be two bits mo dey takin out of town dats sho then youre a fool i says well he says i dont spute dat neither ef dat was a crime all chain gangs wouldnt be black jason of course merely concludes that negroes are worthless and that northerners do not know the black man as intimately as southerners who by and large claim to know those people part of the vast defense mechanism built to support the whites behavior and actions faulkner is careful to inject his opinion in the ironic remark of uncle job there would indeed be plenty of whites breaking rock if being a fool were a crime faulkners inner belief in the equality of the negro never completely asserts itself he states his belief in equality but continuously resorts to white southern platitudes in an attempt to give valid reasons for the racial injustices that occur in mississippi his attempt to reconcile his attitudes is admirable however it is this very attempt that made him the artist that he was his effort to understand the negro as a human being was a lifelong struggle as an outsider he could only walk around the negro mind and catch an occasional glimpse into it we can detect this effort in the portrayal of lucas beauchamp who out of necessity has built a wall around his true feelings lucas is neither defiant nor obsequious he is not arrogant at all and not even scornful just intolerant inflexible and composed faulkner strove desperately to come to grips with his dilemma he knew that the negro was equally entitled to freedom and justice but william faulkner the writer was after all bill faulkner from mississippi the dilemma can be traced not only through history and contemporary events but through literature mark twain portrayed it vividly in huckleberry finn in this novel we see jim the runaway slave and huck as friends both of whom are running away from civilization yet huck cannot rid his mind of the idea that jims blackness marks him as inferior after playing a cruel trick on jim huck feels that as a friend he must apologize then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there without saying anything but that was enough it made me feel so mean i could almost kissed his foot to take it back it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humble myself to a niggerbut done it and warnt ever sorry for it afterwards neither both twain and faulkner knew that the idea of negroes being subservient was completely wrong although twains preoccupation with race was far less severe than that of the latter faulkner as far as can be told was aware that the negro was equal and should be treated as such the statements made in intruder in the dust would certainly indicate this however his characters are not able to reject the idea that negroes should know their place if he would just be a nigger first just for one second one little infinitesimal second these words are spoken by yearold chick mallison whom faulkner places in much the same position in which twain places huck both boys must struggle with their consciences both boys are violating the mores of their society in attempting to help a negro it is impossible to credit faulkner with a final solution to his dilemma he never arrived at one as a southerner he had a strong pride in his birthright an awesome feeling for the land the crops the woods the nearby delta region and the tense silence that the smalltown and rural southerner feels in a way that few other americans do he also felt the dark shameful side of his heritage that produces a builtin sense of inferiority in so many southerners as a writer he not only shared these feelings with his fellow mississippians but probably felt them even more intensely a recent article in time magazine which used faulkner for its cover stated his dilemma with wonderful clarity for him the crime of the south was chattel slavery and the white mans denial of the negros equal humanity was an ineradicable curse on the land and its people ever since faulkner argues the white southerner has been burdened by a crippling unacknowledged guilt as intimate and inescapable as if taken in with the milk of his motheror of the negro wet nurse intruder in the dust indicates that the negro is a living breathing reminder of the white mans guilt lucas beauchamp becomes the symbol of the guilt that all white men feel when they look upon him or any negro lucas beauchamp once the slave of any white man within range whose notice he happened to come now tyrant over the whole countrys white conscience no writer in our time knew the south and wrote about it as vividly and as searchingly as william faulkner he never solved his own conflict any more than the south has of now perhaps his insight and honesty can be summed up by another statement from the time magazine article he desperately urged his fellow southernersand himselfa change of heart he never on the evidence quite managed that change himself but if he left a message and a legacy it was to urge upon his fellow southerners and the nation the imperative necessity for that change william faulkner is no longer in this world in the physical sense of the meaning of life but his writing lives on and will no doubt survive as long as literature exists as a valuable part of mans cultural and emotional experience now perhaps more than ever before his novels and short stories take on their true meaning and stand apart from all others in their honesty and their urgency the man is dead the dilemma is still very much in the minds of men and for this reason above all others perhaps we should all read or reread william faulkners wordsand take them to heart the world of jazz has long been racially the most completely t integrated segment of american society the beat move ment taking its cue from the jazz world in this as in many e other respects is likewise racially integrated from the enc j aves of the sexual underground it is no exaggeration to refer to this influence as the negrification of american morals the american negro was for years or more proselytized by the christian churches particularly by the protestants in the south where the negro was in chattel slavery for all but the last years of that time the preachers performed the role assigned to them by the slaveholders to keep the negroes in a state of chattel slavery to convince them that this was the status allotted to them in holy scripture that the slaveholders were their divinely appointed masters and that any revolt or even secret grumbling was a sin against god and his dearly beloved son jesus christ along with these preachments went the whole bag and baggage of the judeochristian moral code and the negroes were warned on pain of eternal damnation to a hell of fire and brimstone and unending tortures to observe the moral code of christianity and forget their tribal sexways to this end families were broken up as a matter of calculated design and the result was a successful eradication of language and customs but ancestral lifeways are not so easily stamped out the negroes accepted the christian religion which had been forced upon them but they could not help imbuing their own version of it with characteristics which can to this day be traced to african sources they also put their own stamp on the ritual and liturgy of the church giving their worship an unmistakably erotic emphasis that is especially prominent in their music the negro spirituals gospel singing and the blues which followed became important elements in the growth of jazz these influenced white musicians everywhere in the country it strongly affected not only their music but their lifeways and sexways as well and always in the direction of a more natural expression of sexual needs and drives in the early fifties all these influences culminated in the renaissance of poetry and later in prose which was called the beat movement and is now simply referred to as the new writing the role that jazz plays in the sexways of the beat enclaves is crucial in early new orleans the name of the music is lost in the shrouds of mystery that still cover most of the negro history in america in the middle west and in other parts of the country among the white population jazz became very early a synonym for the sexual act jazz me blues is one title which suggests that the words jazz and the sex act were indeed synonymous in early usage the negroes under constant surveillance for anything that might be used against them by their plantation masters and afterwards by the klan and the police were accustomed to disguising their meanings in language even in their private conversation nevertheless the erotic element comes through not only in their blues songs but in their dance and their instrumental music the blues were couched in language that everyone white and black alike could easily translate into words of common usage when music is used as a way of breaking through inhibitions and releasing the life force of the libido it has the effect of a religious catharsis not unlike that of ritual drama this is one reason why the censors and religious bigots react to jazz with fear and fascination bigots are awkward and guiltladen their arms are knives their fingers all nails when they try to make love they hurt each other they torture themselves with shame and pride with time clocks and unattainable ambitions they drag themselves over miles of broken glass and stone themselves with false confessions their usual remedy is to throw themselves on the analytical couch or sneak away to peep shows and stag affairs and burlesque houses jazz presents them with too direct a challenge to face headon it entices them to muscular and sexual reactions they cannot admit even to themselves let alone display openly on a dance floor they prefer to think of it as below their cultural standards as sin and sexual depravity in their african origins the musical rhythms and the dance movements from which jazz originated in part were part of the sacred tribal dances as a sacrament it enjoyed the sanction of the group it had the force of religious magic and social consensus not in the eyes of missionaries and white overseers of course to the slave traders we may be sure it was nothing more than pagan superstition unworthy of serious study something to be stamped out as heresy in the eyes of every good christian jazz is still under a cloud in fundamentalist circles it is still confined for the most part to night clubs and theaters only its cleanedup forms in the hands of white musicians are fully accepted in american musical circles many negro musicians have crossed over and disowned the erotic origins of their music at least within hearing of their white agents white music critics and white audiences in many circles however white and black it still remains a secret music with an erotic mystique of its own in fiction the subterraneans by jack kerouac offers the best treatment of the effect of jazz and the liberating effect of negro morality on the american youth kerouacs description of the people in the beat underground of san francisco in the fifties is found on page one of the book julian alexander is the angel of the subterraneans the subterraneans is a name invented by adam moorad who is a poet and a friend of mine who said they are hip without being slick they are intelligent without being corny they are intellectual as hell and know all about pound without being pretentious or talking too much about it they are very quiet they are very christlike nowhere in america has negrowhite integration become more complete than in the subculture of the beat enclaves as the definitive solution of americas race problem the mattress solution as portrayed in the subterraneans and in all of the prose and poetry of the beat leaves little to be desired nowhere is the negrification of american morals portrayed with greater candor with all its heartaches and successes than in the work of the beat writers it reveals a world in which racial prejudice on every level is no longer a problem for white or black historically there has never been any successful solution of the problems of nationality race religion or color that was not sexual in character it is becoming clear that the us will be no exception jazz music was indeed the opening wedge toward the mattress solution in the us its enemies among the racial bigots north and south were perfectly right in fearing this would be the caseliberation from the antisexual judeochristian ethos may yet prove to be attributable as much as anything else to the influence of the negro in america this influence along with the retribalization of american society through the formation of enclaves of sexual and social experimentation may well be the decisive ones in the making of the new morality in his novel go john clellan holmes attempted a clinical diagnosis of the beat generation which was to become the nucleus of the beat enclave in his novel get home free holmes carries a similar story on into the sixties it is the story of dan verger and may delano who are trying to put off the whole armour of god and achieve orgastic potency in and out of bed by overcoming the character attitudes and the muscular straitjacket of sexual repression which still inhibits them and keeps them from experiencing the apocalyptic orgasm they expected always anticipating the gun salute and worried if it doesnt happen as rollo may describes it disappointed by the failure of their efforts each goes homedan to connecticut and may to louisianain the hope of finding fresh supplies of orgastic energy at

read greenwich village was full of ambrose bierces all of whom were once admen or kid movie stars or communist intellectuals in mays world in louisiana she found herself drawn irresistibly into a

significant passage in get home free is the one in which paul hobbes a white disaffiliate from new york who has come to louisiana to find sexual liberation from a scrupulous christian upbringing encounters a yearold blind negro blues singer of whom he says to may im just studying with him in a waylike i used to study with irwin edman youre crazy i said with a laugh i hope was warm but dont you ever miss new york every time i go into brentanos i expect to see you hiding among the textbooks sometimes when it rains but he was staring at turtles glistening blonde pageboy and the carefully folded monogrammed handkerchief with which tp was surreptitiously wiping the perspiration from his forehead and at lawtells college ring and emmys charm bracelet but then orkie at which he snapped back with the old rather naive almost schoolboy eagerness in his eyes that had once made all of us unkindly call him the cheerleader but say what do you think of him though isnt he great hes just nineteenorchid small thats his given name you seeorchid yes actually so everyone calls him little orkieand hes got a strange touch with flowers tooi mean they seem to understand himhe tends someones garden for moneyyou probably know them i cant rememberbut i stick with him thats what im saying growing confused and pausing to gulp at his new bottle but what he was singing there its all all rightremember he says that all the time when you ask him when you talk about things no need to shake hobbesy he says and he means dont worry dont get nervous dont shiver that way laughing in the middle of it to hear how silly it sounded but thats what he believes i mean about everything so just go along waiting for him to show methis yearold nigra the word sounding curiously ugly because he had no drawl no but really im just studying with him in a way like i used to study with irwin edman he wiped his palm over his grizzled cheeks blinked sniffed and stared at me with a trace of his old embarrassment well get to the end of my mind these days and theres nothing else to do but sleep so you and dan didnt make it eh so pointed a change of subject that i felt called upon to explain in a few sentences well you know dan all those new england preoccupations he cant swing loose from them he cant stop caring i mean youll be drunk and happy and then hell say but can ail this lead to a new morality it just got pointless he came out of the bathroom shirt back on but unbuttoned an indefinable languor to the soft pad of his sneakers though he looked sick to his stomach and his hands shook as he lit a cigarette oh wellpahpah lets see no not working why it was surfeit i suppose i got surfeited he glanced at the sign over the bureauhis selfconscious motto his reminder of something he easily forgot do i know nature yet he murmured by rote do i know myselfno more words i bury the dead in my belly staring at the sign reflectively and my arm he added with a little wince and then looked at me with a gloomy smile rimbaud i was always taught to identify sources its the hardest habit of all to break the sign of a ghoulish civilization i mean ephesus and rotterdamseparated by twentyfive centuries and yet theyre both just unpiled stones when you think about it no but surfeit he repeated brushing the tangle of hair off his forehead thats the word i got surfeited with literature and surfeited with politics and surfeited withwell just words you know for six years i read four newspapers a day i kept up i cared i squandered my nerves shaking his head and sniffing the way you do when you remember the obsessive emotions of an old love affair its funny to think about it now i used to be positively melancholic because of the czechs or the bantus or someone honestly i mean it as if he were confessing to a folly of which even he could not quite believe he had ever been capable but you want to know something sometimes when im alone or very hung over or prescient from wearinessthe way you get sometimesi think were all going to wear ourselves out here in america just burn ourselves right up i have this vision of the nerves of america all the butchered ganglia the flayed tissue the teeth ground to powder in the night the cindery brains that are starting to run amok from the tension of life here now and i find myself thinking that well never make it in this century because weve lost touch with somethingsomething wild and natural call it bliss or reality a capacity for spontaneous love whateverbut its the only thing that can renew the consciousness when its exhausted by anxiety and i get scared real fleshfear my body telling me to stop something before i go too far rubbing his forearm painfully so i suppose what im really doing is searching for the natives for the lost america but like a schweitzerinreverse you see because i want them to help me because really only rebels and oddballs and outcasts can still feel freshly any more the ones the general and his crowd who are the deacons of the last american church social dont care aboutwho represent no power or influence and have no public interests and dont really give a damn about abstractionsthe one who are still free enough to perceive the wonder in whats left of the flower blinking selfconsciously at his own rhetoric and sniffing wella drunken sleep on the beach thats best followed by a sheepish smile see i never did get over quoting other mens truths i quote orkie the same way these days how could i describe it or the incalculable aura of careless anarchy and underground freedom of whim which pervaded it it was as if you had gotten beyond all eyes at last all restraints all codes all dreary necessities and reached that oasis of overripe green and sensuous shadow that exists somewhere in every deserteven a desert as limitless as our lockstep ageand had nothing but yourself and whatever was inside you all that rich mystery of individuality that the penitentiary of modem society is bent on narcotizing to rely on a strange excitement tinged with unease roused in me no mere wisecrack would arm me here let joy remain confined mumbled hobbes pedantic throaty voice from somewhere i couldnt see thats what the general would say if he could only speak cause joy smells of body odor and irresponsibility it stinks of the unreconstructed individual who wont play bingo and that could wreck the republic it could level topeka giggling to hear himself for dan and may the search ends in failure except for one thing they know now why they failed that the search for the new morality was too much for them that they are doomed to be among its casualties not its successes the erotic revolution offers no guarantee of success to anyone the search for the new morality claims its failures but it also rewards its successes it is the function of the writer to mirror both with fidelity and devotion to truth if the stories of failure are more numerous in contemporary fiction than the stories of success it is because most experiments are failures in sexual morality as in everything else for some as we have seen sexual experimentation is not as difficult as it is for others as the judeochristian ethos continues to lose its grip on our educational institutions on government police and the law as its vested interests fall into decay and its diehard defenders retire from their rearguard positions through defection or old age the new morality will show a higher and higher percentage of successful experiments until no one will think of them as experiments any longer and the vision of the new poets and mythmakers of today will finally be seen as a prophecy of the new lifeways and sexways of tomorrow mama george frederick whispered when we gonna stop and rest sweat was running in little rivulets between patches of hair down to his brow and she noticed he needed a hair cut wheres your hat georee frederick i dont know he shrugged his shoulders i couldnt find it when we were leaving libby frowned at him and swung the baby onto her shoulder carefully pulling the ragged flowered bonnet over his face to keep out the sun if he had a hat at least nobody could tell he needed a haircut she looked down at the children who clustered around her wishing she could hurry up and see the while peeling sign that said health clinic all she saw over the tops of the childrens heads was the fiat dusty road and the grayish red dirt that settled between the toes of her sneakers and made her childrens canvas sneakers stiff with grime mama im getting tired wicker caught hold of her hand and tried to slow her down were almost there now she said when we get up to the filling station well rest and dont any of you start begging me for a coke either we cant afford none the small group of children looked at her sadly cant we even split one wicker asked his mother patted the baby on the back and ignored him the little group walked along much slower than before and a few yards ahead libby could see the curb of the service station and the row of chinaberry trees that lined the turn oft stopping at the esso station always made her feel a little uneasy back when she was first married and hal was still going to school some he used to work there after classes still the station was a good halfway place to stop on the way to town and the kids liked to see the cars go up and down on the elevator she walked slowly changing the baby from arm to arm but before she could settle him comfortably on her shoulder they were at the station the children ran immediately to the trees and played under the dark green leaves that made a pleasant canopy of shade she sat on the curb far away from the main working area rocking the baby who had started to fret the baby was a solid lump in her lap and she was too hot even to care libby watched her children who now that they could rest were chasing each other around the chinaberry trees she was just sitting still staring down at the curb when she saw matts grinning face and waving hand pointing toward her in school matt and hal had been best friends when matt graduated from high school the white man mr sommers had kept him on at the station he had a good job and she used to go with him in elementary school last summer matt sent them an invitation to his wedding when he married that girl from chesterfield county but she couldnt go because they didnt have any extra money to buy presents she watched matt look around to see if any customers were coming and then he bypassed the gas pumps to the curb where she was sitting he stooped and peeped at the baby sure nice he takes after you as if he had spoken a magic word calvin smiled and his dark eyes followed the oily finger that matt swung over his head that boy of yours come back he asked suddenly becoming serious she shook her head no you know where he is again she shook her head that damn son but before he could finish libby pulled his arm and pointed to the children who had stopped playing to watch their mother i dont want them hearing none of that the children stood waiting until their mother shooed them away hasnt sent you any money either i bet matt squatted on the curb beside her if you need anything right now you jet me know and if you dont hear anything from hal soon you see those county people we dont need to be on no welfare she interrupted hell anybody can be in trouble for a while beside you got to feed those kids i got me a job working in town she tried to keep her voice from breaking your mamas not going to keep that baby forever shes getting too old to be picking up after little children thats not your business libby answered quickly nobody told you to get mixed up in my business all right all right matt stood and in the sunlight he appeared as a black shadow hovering over her and the baby but if you need anything promise me youll let me know libby sat on the curb not looking at him trying to keep her tears from falling on the baby shed promised herself she wouldnt be bothered thinking about hal and here she was crying like a fool baby while she sat still letting the heat dry her tears matt treated all four children to soft drinks he made meetrie bring one to her and then they were ready to start walking again f v the county clinic was on the second floor of the courthouse building as the children climbed the steps she tried to freshen them up sticking in wickers shirt tail and trying to keep hamlet still enough to brush the coca cola from his pants not until she passed a clear glass pane on an office door did she see her own reflection the shoulder of her cotton dress was wet where the baby had burped she herded the children together and let meetrie lead them up the stairs past the main waiting room into the cubby hole that served colored nine other people were in the waiting room ahead of her and there were only two seats left she took one chair and meetrie and wicker squeezed into the other seat libby reached over wicker who was leaning on the chairs arm and picked up a copy of the post the magazine was the same one she had read when wicker had hay fever maggie haliday one of the maids in this building told her once that the magazines were only put in here when the white people were finished she saw a life on the other side of the room but didnt feel like walking to get it or to start up one of the children all of whom had chosen this moment to be quiet she looked around at the other people waiting to see the doctor trying to decide if she knew any of them one of the women the one with the hair in little sausage curls reminded her of hals aunt but of course she wasnt hals aunt lived in bethel the woman looked up at her and smiled libby smiled back all these children yours the woman asked yes libby turned calvin around in her lap this one she said pointing to meetrie will be ready for school next year one more off your hands the lady began chuckling but i guess youll have enough on you anyhow the woman had a thyroid condition she said and whatever the doctor gave her didnt do any good last night shed had one of those attacks and the first thing this morning shed come to this place and look at her shed been here since eightthirty and already it was eleven minutes to ten while she talked a nurse came in and asked who was next a pregnant woman stood and shuffled toward the gate that separated the waitingroom from one of the inside offices when the woman was safely inside the office the nurse turned and pointed a finger toward libby you she said in an expressionless voice keep that child out of the ashtray libby turned in time to see george frederick digging in the sand of a tall cement ashtray she was too embarrassed to do anything but grab him and sit him down beside her the other children were becoming restless now and she knew that if the doctor didnt see them soon they would be a problem in such a cooped up space all your children sick the woman asked her libby sensed that she just wanted someone to talk with no theyre pretty healthy she said mr johnson said positively meetrie couldnt go to camp unless she had some kind of shot he said with the others running around outdoors all day they should get shots too guess the nurse will know what to give them she doesnt look old enough to be off from home by herself in response to the womans thoughtful stare meetrie began wiggling in her chair oh shes not going away from home shes just going to day camp mr johnson he works with the community fund got her a scholarship she said proudly white folks are always packing off peoples children to camp seems like they could think of something better to do with their money libby nodded and both women were silent your husband work around here no hes working up state how come he left you by yourself suddenly libby was tired of listening to the woman she certainly wasnt going to get a complete stranger mixed up in her life calvin here was too little to travel so i stayed with the children her words were curt but the woman paid the tone no attention guess you miss him but with all those children its a good thing hes up north working i bet he sends you more money than he brought home when he was working here libby did not say anything but shifted calvin to her other shoulder and picked up the old copy of post from her usual way of feeling time pass she guessed they had been sitting in the waiting room for over an hour a man with a swollen foot began smoking and since there was no ventilation unless the door stayed open cigarette smoke hung heavily in the air she wanted to ask the man to stop smoking because the baby was coughing but he was so much older than she that finally libby decided to walk up and down the hall to get some air she ordered george frederick and meetrie to watch out for the younger children and walked out the door she had just started down the hall a second time when the same somberfaced nurse stuck her head out the door immediately libby was conscious of some one sniffling your kids in here raising sand the nurse said we ask you people not to deposit your children in the waiting room when only ones sick why dont you leave the rest home meetrie started it she heard wicker say just as the nurse shut the door she saw meetrie lean over and kick george frederick then meetrie fell on top of the boy and began pounding him with her skinny fists meetrie libby screamed get off that floor she looked for some place to put calvin afraid to put him on the chair because he might roll off george frederick was still on the floor and she hated him for pretending to be hurt quickly she bent down to pull up both children and almost dropped calvin george fredericks yellow pants had splotches of dirt from where he had rolled on the floor she pushed the children together and made them sit in the chair the funny thing was that they hadnt disturbed anyone in the waiting room everybody sat quietly hoping to be called in to see the doctor libby felt the minutes ticking away wishing that some of the people in the crowded waiting room would leave and come back tomorrow if the nurse didnt call for them soon she knew theyd have to go home she hadnt thought to bring anything for a lunch and they couldnt afford to buy anything out of the cracker machine libby could hear feet moving around in the next room and each time the footsteps approached the waiting room she felt her muscles becoming tense the children were getting edgy and george frederick had started sucking his thumb the same hand that had scooted in and out of the sand she started to reach out and remove his thumb but decided that at least this way he was quiet she raised forward on the edge of her chair to relieve the strain on her back feeling the cloth of her dress stick to the plastic back of the chair calvin had fallen asleep but he seemed to be heavier when still libby knew he would be hungry when he awakened but there was nothing to feed him that she could afford she found herself offering a prayer to be next feeling that right now she would promise god anything if she could hurry up and leave this clinic it occurred to libby that thinking and dreading today so much probably made her nervous her mother was bound to ask if hal had sent her an anniversary card and all this week shed expected to hear something from him then this morning came and she stood ten minutes on the front porch waiting for the mailman who rode by without even leaving one of those advertising circulars she felt her stomach grumble and swallowed hard to stop the noise if she was hungry she knew the children soon would be begging for something to eat as a last resort she decided to think only of happy things but that too was impossible everything she thought about seemed to have happened after she was married and not before she looked down at the baby remembering when she had sat in this room pregnant with meetrie it was in the hospital that her mother seeing meetrie for the first time had slipped her own bent wedding ring onto libbys finger because hal had not yet bought her one she looked down at her finger seeing the narrow gold band dull after six years sometimes she felt that she had a wedding ring and that was all in the middle of her thoughts she was aware of someone pulling on her sleeve mama wicker whispered i gotta go to the bathroom get meetrie to go with you and unbutton your pants meetrie looked up at her mother i dont want to go in there all by myself libby didnt much blame her the lightbulb usually was out in the toilet and regardless of the disinfectant the room smelled awful mama i gotta go bad wicker was standing on one foot and then the other libby stood and grabbed him by the hand she couldnt take all the children with her or she would lose her place in line yet if she left them alone they were bound to start up something the toilet for negroes was all the way down in the basement and if she didnt get wicker there soon he was likely to wet right in the middle of the floor suddenly the woman she had talked with earlier was at her side you take him on downstairs she said picking up calvin and ill watch them up here and save your place libby smiled her thanks and hurried wicker from the room knowing that george frederick would have to go by the time she returned she pulled him along coming back upstairs libby walked so fast her legs ached when she reached the second floor she couldnt risk having the little boys see all those candy and snack machines maybe if they didnt see food they wouldnt be hungry the big clock over the main door read twelvefortyfivethey already had been waiting over three hours after the lady had been so nice to take calvin libby felt she ought to introduce herself im alma courts the woman answered and he was a real sweetheart she settled in her chair expecting libby to continue their conversation although talking to mrs courts helped time pass libby didnt want to be questioned too closely she found her place in the old magazine and began reading she had not finished the first column when the nurse popped her head inside the door you people go on home and come back monday she said huh a man said and a few people raised out of their seats cant come back on monday his voice was joined by a chorus of me neithers libby stared at the nurse as if the woman were crazy and she wanted to knock that silly starched cap from her head she coudnt come back on monday and bring all of them there was no telling when shed have another saturday off the nelsons hardly ever went away for the weekend the doctors are leaving early the nurse continued as if no one had interrupted her speech you come back on monday and theyll try to see you then she closed the swinging door and the people in the waitingroom heard a key turn in the lock well aint nothing we can do the man with the swollen ankle said cept come back i already lost three days off the job dont guess one more day will make no difference he stood and grimaced in pain shifting his weight to the foot that was not hurt libby stood and immediately the baby began hollering she felt his rubber pants and saw that they were heavy there was nothing to do but change him in the waitingroom mrs courts looked at her sympathetically and wiped calvins slobbering mouth with a slightly soiled kleenex sometimes i wonder why more of us aint dead i could of had an appendix going loose inside me and it wouldnt made no difference to them you know anybody going to fir town libby spoke loudly enough for everyone in the room to hear no mrs courts said dont kuovv nobody with a car going that way since no one else seemed to be paying her any attention she stationed herself by the door nobody was going even part of the way in her direction libby prodded george frederick forward and handed meetrie the diaper bag to carry down the steps the clock on the first floor said twothirty the wrong time of day for her to try and catch a ride nobody she knew who worked in town got off from work before four on saturdays she hustled the children out the door and headed toward the corner while they were walking meetrie pulled away from her side and started to run across the street libby gave the child a jerk that almost made her lose her balance meetrie stood still rubbing her arm and looking as if she might burst out crying libby knew that when one child started up the others also found something for which to yell she bent down and touched meetries head waiting anxiously to see if meetrie would stop sniffling for an instant libby thought about keeping straight up the main street and walking around the shopping center she hadnt been window shopping in ages but keeping up with her children wasnt worth the trouble of seeing new clothes besides it was way past time for them to eat and the sooner they passed somebodys peach tree the better she shifted the baby to the other arm caught hold of wicker who was walking slower than anyone else and started home ooden bridgelandmark it hoods the narrow stream poking out of the neck of the lake like an ear out of the past two boys and a little girl running down the road toward the crossinggiggling they stopped running hey yawl the bigger boy yelled better keep up else i run off and leave you on this side he zigzagged once in a while across the road rubbing his rolledup sunday school lesson along a dilapidated fence that ended abruptly when the road sloped downward you know what happen if we dont cross all three together he picked up a rock and threw at a bunch of blue jays squawking in the trees talkin bridge talk a spelt on you hey bubba the shorter boy whispered he was dressed in a faded pair of pants from his back pocket a broken slingshot dragged the ground every once in a while he picked up a stone examined it and added it to a bulge in his pocket he wore a dirty brown shirt with a worn collar and the brown of his skin blended with the shirt what asked bubba wait for me the little girl her thin blue dress splitting slightly at the waist seam skipped to keep up vaselineshiny braids hugged her scalp in neat lines she watched the birds more than the boys down the hill a mocking bird lit in the road just for a second then flew away across the water what you want hey look he said tucking in the slingshot and nodding toward the girl lets do somethin what lets he pointed toward the bridge lets throw essie in the water it was a quiet area the feeling one got was like the feeling that comes when one is standing beside a still pond staring at a school of hungry minnows here where the rotting planks stretched over the life in the green water distance broke through and for a while north and south and east and west filled the eye naw just for fun whats the matter w you jimmy croon the south end of the bridge gaped open like a mouth out of it the road leaped downward undulating into the low country like a tired tongue the heat of the louisiana summer pressed in upon the bridge buckling it and sometimes making it squeak ah you scared taunted jimmy

throwing his arm around the shoulder of bubba who pushed it off lets see if this ole bridge talk a spell on essie when she go over bubba pushed him off the road jimmy sprang back elbowing bubba in the side they began to snicker jimmy broke away and ran toward the bridge saying say goodbye to your sister and pushed her off the road as bubba leaping after him shouted if catch you you dead stay off the bridge essie jimmy laughed loudly and scampered onto the wooden planks essie whimpered and locked her lips she halted a few feet away from the bridgethe thin noon shadow of an oak sliced the front of the metalbraced rails and cut the planks travelling at an angle until it fell off into the water below the old bridge rested on log beams many of which needed replacing several stumps slanted out of the water marking where floods had raged by leaving memories in the form of wreckage essie pouted near the edge now she watched jimmy then leaned over to peer into the water a water strider skated out of the way of a swarm of gnats and a mocking birds shadow glided across the hood of the bridge a green frog heaving its balloon sides from behind a clump of lake weeds darted a tongue out and a bronze fly disappeared from a leaf jimmy ran to the wooden rail leaned over turned and beckoned to essie as she began to back away from the bridge bubba leaped upon jimmy what you doin jimmy croon dont mess with me boy said jimmy ha who you didnt know did you well im the law ha you mean the lie okay sposin you was emmett till what you do when somebody throw sheet over your head take my knife and cut right out of it how come he aint do it how come somebody aint help him shucks i told you white folks got him and they get you too tryin to scare somebody small as essie i aint scared her yet he punched bubba sharply on the arm they tussled stirring up dust under the shed essie stood entranced at the edge of the hoods shadow a pebble lodged between the planks fell plop into the water she jerked nervously and squeezed her sunday school lesson bubba she whispered what he grunted still scuffling with jimmy im scared jimmy laughed eluding bubbas grasp for his neck bcause you little miss essie till she aint grunted bubba i aint you is she aint he succeeded in locking an arm around jimmys neck suddenly jimmy let out a long choking growl he was pinned to the rail then heaving his chest he lunged outside the railing bubbas leg came half way through with him essie hollered you give shouted bubba still holding jimmys neck hey screamed jimmy they were falling essie hollered again and suddenly they were pulling up together essie stood behind them at the other end of the rail and began watching the shadow of her little purse every time she swung it out over the rail the shadow formed like a dart a licking tongue on the rail and water below hey shouted bubba whos that down in the water you and jimmy was upon him again emmett bubba gagged they were falling again you give naw said bubba essie ran to them im gonna tell mama on yawl she looked at the shadows struggling on the water they seemed to be drowning you give naw jimmys shirt hooked on a sharp splinter and ripped

bubba look and they peered at their reflections in the water three blue jays flew overhead in a clearing across the bridge a mocking birds trill pierced the summer heat essie coming close to the boys began to chant ole jimmy croono nothin but a coono then suddenly she stopped she leaped up into the air her feet came down stomp on the planks as she yelled boo and skipped over the wood the boys flinching only a bit at her scare never looked away from the water bubba saying we quit essie now dont cross too soon jimmy mouth open and eyes peering watched the rings made by falling pebbles how

around bubbas shoulder we didnt did we jimmy repeated essie looked at jimmy then at bubba he didnt push me in the water like they did before did he bubba bubba looked across the marshes at a flock of birds a mocking bird sans near by huh he didnt did he naw they all were quiet for a second moving away from the presences the sounds the memories bubba stopped listen he whispered that old bridge talkin listen feel sorry for anybody cross it now they listened a pebble plunked in the water a fish splashed somewhere perhaps the bridge squeaked faintly hush said bubba looking over their shoulders they stepped forward cautiously suddenly they giggled and broke into a fast fast run he was marias cousinshe begged me to giv her mothers sister child a job so i tof her to bring him alon and i would see what j could do for himwhich she promptly did the following day he was over six feet tall and well built belonging to the basuto tribe but bearing more resemblance to a zulu his teeth were white and perfectly shaped setting off the darkness of his face which was pleasant and shining with cleanliness while an abundance of wellgroomed woolly hair neatly clipped and telligent eyes met mine without a waver as he stood hatinhand in front of me so youre charlie i said smiling to put him at ease yes madam im marias mothers sisters child he answered in a deep voice and good english and where have you worked charlie in zeerust madam have you a pass charlie yes mam he said handing me his reference book i flipped the pages of this nocuous brown book that caused more sorrow and bitterness than anything else in the country his picture was on the front page also his thumb prints and all the necessary information about chief kraal date of birth and tribe i turned to the back to see the name of his last employer and was unable to decipher the name whats his name charlie i asked pointing to the scrawl coetzee madam but that man does not write so well now i write with great beauty madam and use to help this white baas fill in the other boys passes who worked for him but i could not do my own the police would have noticed i nodded understanding and what work did you do for this man charlie on the farm madam but i do not want to work on the farm there is no money and i am educated standard six madam i went to the mission school and i want to do other things and live in joburg madam he spoke well without a trace of nervousness which was rare in my experience of interviewing africans in need of a job knowing of the different laws that were applicable to the blacks yet not knowing quite how they affected individuals i asked him if he was allowed to work in johannesburg oh no madam he replied calmly and if im caught ill be sent to gaol then back to zeerust but charlie i exploded you know that i cannot hire you if your pass is not in order if i do we will both get into trouble you know it is against the law oh yes madam but maria tells me you can do many things to help us africans you can get me a new pass he said simply but i cant charlie you know how strict the police are soon as you try and register at the pass office theyll put the handcuffs on you and you will get three months in gaol and when your sentence is finished they will send you back to zeerust please let the madam try he pleaded i want so much to stay in joburg i want to learn typing in the night time i sighed i knew that it was rather hopeless for i had tried on a number of occasions to get permits for africans who lived outside of johannesburg to work in the factory and i had never been successful he stood eyeing me hopefully alright charlie ill try but if they arrest you its your own fault he beamed maybe madam can take me home with madam in madams car they wont arrest me he was right for the police rarely arrested an african in the company of a white assuming the african to be legally employed i smiled inwardly he was not lacking any answer that was certain maybe its better if madam phone first to the pass office what a shame i thought by the readiness of the boys answers here was someone that was bright and intelligent and because of the colour of his skin he was not permitted by law the choice of working where he wished he was kept back in some dorp to work as a menial or on a farm digging in the fields i telephoned the pass office and asked to speak to a senior person was it possible i asked sweetly in afrikaans to get a boy with the necessary qualifications that required for the factory a pass to work in johannesburg could see in my minds eye the man shaking his head as he answered in the negative if you have such a boy he said it is your duty to see that he goes back from where he came or call the police he also warned me that i was liable to fifty pounds fine if i employed him i gritted my teeth with frustration with charlie watching me closely a confident look on his face as if i were going to perform a miracle now continued the man if you live in a periurban area and you require someone to work on the land there might be a chance that you could get permission to keep him but then you must apply at the nearest pass office to your home i thanked him knowing that it actually was not his fault that charlie was unable to work at the factory however i suspected that he was in agreement with the village laws controlling the africans as most of the police and pass office personnel were supporters of the government i repeated to charlie what the man had told me he was undaunted by the news but madam lives in the periurban area i can work for madam in the house im a first class worker and i can wait at the table i have done this work plenty times i burst out laughing first of all charlie it is not certain that i could get this permission secondly charlie i have a houseboy who waits at table and i also have two who work in the garden so what am i going to do with you nonplussed he answered madam has a big house maria told me madam has nyasaland boy working maria tells me can show these boys many things they do not speak english too much they dont know too much like me the latter was true as far as the houseboy was concerned not that he was unintelligent but he knew very little english and most of my instructions were given in mime with a bit of fanagelo simple type of african dialect used mainly on the gold mines thrown in the houseboy incidentally had also been a straybrought by one of the garden boys as much as i wanted to help charlie i certainly did not require another servant in the house for i also had a cook a woman which made a total of four servants but i felt so sorry for him let me think of a plan charlie today is friday ill think over the weekend and if youre not arrested by monday i will let maria know if i can do something he smiled broadly thank you madam oh many thank yous madam god will bless you i could see that in his mind the whole problem was solved now charlie dont go setting your heart on staying im going to try and think of something maybe my friends need someone but maybe they dont and then you will have to return to zeerust we parted he with optimism and many thanks and me with something else to worry about we lived twelve miles from johannesburg in a large house in threeandahalf acres of ground it was summer which meant that the weeds which grew at a fantastic rate from the rains were in profusion the two garden boys had their jobs cut out in keeping them down that evening walked around the grounds eyeing the vegetable patches trying to find justification for hiring charlie if no one else wanted him i was lenient with the servants allowing them the responsibility of doing their jobs without constantly telling them what to do the head gardener lucien was a wonderful worker diligent and hardworking taking great pride in his domain c planting and sowing the various crops on his own merely telling me what seeds he required he supervised the second gardener who was younger and a more recent addition to the household and in fact another stray i knew that if i brought charlie into the garden picture there could only be one boss around and it would end up being charlie this i felt would be unfair to lucien it was early saturday morning and i was sitting in the garden having a cup of tea i glanced up the drive and who should be walking down with a sprightly air none other than charlie carrying a large suitcase the dogs rushed out barking furiously enough to scare anyone especially an african for they are extremely frightened of dogs more so if they are large ours were enormous but charlie just kept on walking as they rushed up to him he put his hand out and patted the largest animal the animals stopped their barking and walked next to him sniffing at his heels good morning madam he called out while still some distance from me youve a big house just like maria told me he turned his head taking in the expanse of the grounds and nodding approvingly good morning charlie answered quite amazed at his appearance and what have you come for i told you i would let maria know on monday if i had a plan and today is only saturday well madam thought i might be arrested by monday you know that they often raid the township over the weekend he answered putting his suitcase down this i knew only too well well he continued thought in your house i would be safe and if i were around you would not forget me and you would remember to think of a plan i chuckled dont worry charlie even without you around was remembering but if you were worrying about getting arrested why did you take a chance and walk in the streets and go on the train and the bus i wondered how he would account for this logic on my part without hesitating he replied i thought of that madam and decided if i was to be arrested it might as well be on the way to your house madam than in the township alright i said throwing up my hands its against the law but since you are here you might as well stay go and speak to julie the cook girl she will give you something to eat but remember charlie dont go making trouble with the other servants dont tell them that you have come to work for me and since you will have to sleep in simons room ask him if it is alright and also help him for this is the cooks weekend off oh thanks madam many thanks to you god will shine upon you and bless you he said his face wreathed in smiles picking up his suitcase he disappeared around the back of the house and soon i heard loud talking and laughing charlie was getting acquainted when simon the houseboy was on duty on the weekends that julie was off we usually had to make do for he knew little about cooking and i had to see to the meals but this weekend was different charlie took over an hour after his arrival he came outside sprucely dressed in one of i presumed simons white uniforms for it was about threeinches short in the arms and legs he wanted to know what we would be having for lunch i was somewhat taken aback can you also cook charlie oh yes madam i can do many things madam just tell me and madam will see for herself i told him what i had planned for lunch and he went off whistling confidently the lunch was a great success very well prepared and tastefully decorated simon instead of being upset beamed with pride at the obvious effects of charlies handiwork she too good boy medem said simon later as i entered the kitchen she i replied is a he simon and he does seem good oh yes medem she is a he she one good boy i gave up most africans call both sexes she arent you worried ill keep charlie and let you go back home simon i said laughingly a look of puzzlement passed over his face i asked charlie to explain to simon in his language what i had said as charlie translated simon laughed no medem medem not send simon back medem keep charlie to help simon more to myself i said aloud you just cant win a week passed and no plan matured with regard to charlie all my friends who might have been able to employ him since they lived in periurban area had enough staff meanwhile i knew that if the police came to the house and found charlie working without a pass i would be fined fifty pounds charlie settled down and never broached the subject of pass job or wages he simply took over the management of the other domestics lives with apparently no ill feeling on their parts when he had been with us about three weeks simon came to me one evening with a sad look on his face and a letter in his hand medem me go home my father she very sick i expressed my regrets and asked when he wanted to go me go two days time me come back after and work for medem alright simon when your fathers better you come back its lucky i added to make him feel better that we have charlie oh yes medem now i not waste time to train other boy two days later with fond farewells ringing in his ears from the household i took simon to johannesburg station to catch the train to nyasaland it would take him a week to get there and six months would no doubt lapse before his return now i would have to try and get charlie a pass i took the morning off from work and went to the pass office nearest to our home which was at alexander township the huge location where some nonwhites lived in one squaremile in utter squalor where crime was rife and the law abiding africans and nonwhites lived in fear of their lives a large number of africans were waiting to be attended to as i walked through a doorway marked european and i was immediately approached by a clerk i handed charlies pass book over he i had left in the car outside and stated my case telling the clerk what the man from the main pass office had told me theyre wrong said the clerk that law about being able to work in the periurban area was rescinded some six months ago youd think the joburg pass office would know this he scratched among some papers and found a form here it is in writing he said showing me the paper then what can i do i pleaded i do not have a servant and i need this man he is intelligent and a wonderful worker half laughingly he replied take a chance on being fined fifty quid pounds if they catch him you mean there is nothing i can do legally to keep him even though he wants desperately to work for me and i need him urgently im afraid not madam i know it is a shame when you can get someone good and you are not allowed by law to keep him he shrugged his shoulders but thats the law what will happen if he is arrested i asked he will be gaoled for three months i interrupted and when he is released he will on his way from the prison be rearrested and sentenced to a further three months and this can go on ad infinitum im afraid so said the clerk and what is more i should by law have this boy arrested now he looked me in the eye i dont know your name i dont know where you live in fact you have not been here i thanked him and departed quickly for fear the police would arrive i decided to take a chance and charlie worked as before except we arranged what his wage would be i told him that if he left the premises he was liable to be arrested and i would be fined it was a terrible way to live but he was very willing to work under such conditions three days later charlie came to me with the request that i buy him a red sash to wear across his shoulder like all the head waiters wore in the hotels he felt that our position and his capabilities warranted this these were not his words but he implied them with a lot of smooth talk he took over simons white uniforms and laundered and starched them to perfection he was rather impressive in this role of headwaiter and we began to feel very posh on the fourth night after seating ourselves at the dinner table i was handed a typewritten menu by charlie who stood on my right with a napkin draped across his arm i could not refrain from laughinghe looked so serious and professional did you type this charlie i asked looking at the neatly spaced lettersasterisks and dashes liberally decorating the top and the bottom the words were correctly spelled while a few a las gave it a french flavour yes madam i found the typewriter in the study and thought it was well for the master and madam to read what you were going to eat thats very nice charlie as long as you do not neglect your work you can use the typewriter i said oh thank you madam ill take good care of it he said with his usual warmth and flicked an imaginary crumb from the table that evening the meal was one of the most amusing we had ever had in our own home for we could hardly contain ourselves from laughing out aloud everytime charlie whipped the menu like a real professional before our eyes the menu had everything right down to cheese and biscuits something which we kept in the house but seldom had more than one to choose from charlie had discovered all my good imported cheese that i kept for occasions and at the end of the meal he proudly placed a cheese platter before us that would have been the envy of a toprate restaurant parsley sprigged and all on the menu was typed cheese various charlie was fascinated with the typewriter all his spare time was used in typing and think that he typed letters to every one of his acquaintances throughout africa for every morning he would give me at least two letters to post since he could not venture from the property months later we found out from the cook that the moment we left home in the morning charlie would sit down in the study and type most of the day after working for us for about three months he became enamoured of one of the girls close by and this was his downfall one evening he came running into the lounge breathless and fearful oh madam he cried the police have come with a girl to catch me this girl she say am father of her child she wants me to marry her i say no and now she come with her mother and a policeman my heart stopped for a moment then quickly i shouted to julie the cook tell lucien to go to char lies room and if the police want to come in say it is his room and julie if the police ask you about charlie say he left a week ago tell the others to say the same our front door bell ranggo upstairs charlie to my bedroom and stay there he bolted upstairs like a rabbit bereft of all his selfassurance i went to the door and opened it my own assurance wavering on the porch stood a white sergeant and an african policeman with two native women standing a few feet from them good evening madam we are sorry to trouble you but these two women the sergeant pointed toward the two who shuffled into the shadows have laid a complaint about your boy charlie and whats the complaint enquired acting surprised the young one says he is the father of her expected child i laughed with bravado first of all if she is in the family way it must only be a few weeks and its her word against the boys and secondly i took a deep breath charlie disappeared from here about a week ago and now know the reason i finished with a laugh the sergeant laughed with me and looking at the girl who was very thin said youre right madam there are no signs as yet and with such a prospective motherinlaw i dont blame the boy running away he directed the african policeman to tell the two women what had been said the women of course had a good idea of the discussion but it was duly translated to them the sergeant meanwhile apologized for bothering me stating that a complaint had been made and that this sort of thing was always happening and all he could do was to investigate i assured him that it had been no trouble wondering if the look of relief was visible on my face for the two women eyed me suspiciously then with some more bravado i said to the policeman you can question my other servants and search the quarters if you like oh no madam that wont be necessary he said and turned toward the two women in a harsh voice he told them they would have to find someone else to pin the blame on and for them to be off a whites word was always believed over that of a nonwhite and i felt ashamed and sorry for the two women but it was either them or charlie and in this instance the paternity case would not have meant a thing for the moment they found that he did not have a pass to johannesburg that would have been his biggest crime and no one would have gained a jot except the south african government the police left and i went upstairs to my room expecting to find charlie he was nowhere to be seen charlie i called and from beneath the bed came a muffled yes madam i laughed you can come out charlie they have gone he crawled from beneath the bed a sheepish look on his face but he soon regained his composure that girl madam shes alright its that mother all she wants is lobola and the girl is only fifteen years he clicked hau these days a man must be too smart smart i snorted you mean have a smart madam who is getting grey hair every time she sees a policeman and then lying to the police on top of it i clicked the way the africans do when annoyed if i go to prison charlie wholl get me out he laughed loudly and was very amused hau madams too clever to go to prison i hear madam talk to policeman i listen at the window only hide under bed when madam say police can search for charlie hau madam one clever one one week later poor charlie was arrested he had not been out for three months and then he went to see his cousin maria a gamble which failed to come off and there was nothing i could do since i had already broken the law twice our home was never quite the same without charlie we all missed him some three months elasped and charlie turned up to get all his belongings for when they arrested him he told them he had just arrived and thus did not give me away as having illegally employed him asked him what he was going to do for he had every chance of being arrested again and he told me that he was going to borrow some money and that if he could find such a one to lend him this money he knew of a plan that could keep him in johannesburg how much charlie i said knowing that i was going to be the lender his face lit up five pounds madam ill pay the madam back one day he twisted his hands nervously as he looked me in the eye not certain if had really agreed i could feel the tension for his plan could not be acted upon unless he had the money and five pounds represented a whole months wages to charlie had a faint inkling that the five pounds was to purchase a forged pass book for other africans had told me this was often done and was not often detected if obtained from the right source you want this money for a pass book charlie i asked haul he exclaimed shaking his head a very surprised look on his face madam know about getting pass books this way yes charlie just see that you get a good one he beamed oh thank you my madam oh thank you i pay you back one day he mopped his brow miraculously his nervousness had gone as i went inside to get him the money i heard him shouting out his glad tidings to the garden boys way down in the land that was the last i saw or heard of charlie not his fault im certain i just think that the forgery was not up to standard poor charlie his aspirations were high but the land where he was born only allow those with white skins to aspire
the negro half a man in a white world during the harlem riots last summer a black boy with tears streaming down his face taunted the police shoot me shoot another nigger when they did not comply he moaned im not even man enough for them to kill what the hysterical youth was expressing was the psychological castration which faces the negro male every day of his life in which he is barred from attaining the traditional american ideal of manhood dorothy canfield fisher states that our society puts negro youth in the situation of the animal in the psychological laboratory in which a neurosis is caused by making it impossible for him to live up to our national ideals as others do those glorified ideals of manhood are providing security and protection for ones family fighting injustice striving towards success with honesty defending individual liberty ones honor and ones country but for the negro physical and psychological violence leaps at him from every side to restrict these manly pursuits historically the emasculation of the negro began with slavery negro families were not only separated forcibly when they were brought to this country but continually throughout slavery as they were sold on the trading blocks whitney young of the national urban league points out that the negro family is the only ethnic group in world history which a consistent and deliberate effort has tried to weaken and destroy even after slavery young says the negro male was consciously kept at a lowpaying level and humiliated daily to prevent him from getting out of place and attempting to affect change after the slave trade was abolished by congress in fear that the supply of slaves would become exhausted led to promiscuous breeding as an economic measure john hay lincolns biographer wrote that virginia was converted into a great menagerie where men were reared like oxen for the market and young negroes called stud men were treated as prize bulls in black odyssey roi ottley relates that these stud men were carefully fed exercised regularly and subject to as little brutality as possible one named joe who lived on fayette jacksons place was considered bout de breedingest nigger in virginia joe had no work to do he was allowed to stay in his quarters and sun himself until called for his duties nine months after one weekend in a suffolk nursery babies were born on the same day to women with whom he had been mated ottley also reveals that maryland enterprisingly brought out a fancy line of stockchildren of indentured white girls mated with stud men undoubtedly licentiousness among breeders played no small part in the mulatto production which incidentally gave maryland traders a jump on their competitors negro studs were treated like precious animals but not like men throughout the ages notes playwright leroi jones one race of mankind has enslaved another but the victim was still considered a man it was left to the christians of the new world to dehumanize the negro and read him entirely out of the human race this dehumanization was reinforced in by the constitution which labeled the negro three fifths of a man in the supreme court stated in the dred scott decision that negroes were so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect in a book published by the american book and bible house the negroa beast popular among churchgoing whites argued that the negro was not the son of ham or even the descendant of adam and eve but simply a beast without a soul if the negro studs were dehumanized the other slaves fared no better along family lines marriages were ignored if performed at all and paternity was not recognized children were traced through the mother the unity of the family was destroyed to facilitate the buying and selling of individual slaves only the most elementary motherchild unit with the father absent unknown or if present incapable of wielding any influence was allowed to survive unlike the negro male who had only utilitarian value the negro woman had more opportunity for emotional interaction with the whites for two reasons one was as negro mammy to white children and the other was as a sex object the plethora of laws prohibiting marriages between the races is eloquent testimony that the white man found the negro woman sexually attractive physical compulsion was often necessary to compel compliance of the woman and historical evidence is plentiful on this point j a tragic example is the love story of benjamin banneker astronomer and mathematician as told in his biography your most humble servant by shirley graham banneker constructed one of the first clocks made in america and assisted in the survey of washington d c born a free negro during slavery banneker fell in love with the beautiful slave girl anola and sought to buy her to make her his wife but when her master saw anola he wanted every sweet curving inch of her for himself anola outsmarted her master by drowning herself in consoling banneker an old slave woman told him she be free now son ole massa nevah make huh his slave dey stole huh body and dey lock huh up from you but she wan you to know dis one thing she free to die in proud shoes pauli murray relates the rape of her great grandmother harriet a slave married to reuben day a free negro when her owners son desired her harriet was brutally beaten and raped but before that reuben day was ambushed by the two white brothers who whipped him to ii deaths door and ran him off the plantation in other instances the mere prestige of the white race was sufficient to gain consent from negro women they felt such selfcontempt that a drop of white blood in their offspring raised them in the scale of humanity then too the white master was the protector as well as the oppressor and as such was an idealized as well as a hated figure often there were concrete advantages to be gained by a negro womans surrender in some cases it meant freedom from the drudgery of field labor and elevation to house slave and there was the hope that her mulatto children would enjoy added privileges from their white father and might even be emancipated this usefulness of the female as a concubine increased the white mans fear of her legitimate mate the negro male his fear of retaliation led to the fantastic exaggeration in his mind of the negro males sexual ability and the need to protect white women from him this guilt and anxiety necessitated even more repressive measures against the negro man during reconstruction peonage reduced the negro to nearbondage and the threat of sudden death kept him in his place western mobs preferred hanging and southern mobs delighted in burning in the memphis press printed a graphic description of the lynching of ed pierson fifteen thousand men women and children cheered as they poured the gasoline on the ax fiend and struck the match they fought and screamed and crowded to get a glimpse of him and the mob closed in as the flames flared high and the smoke rolled about their heads the negro lay in flames his hands crossed on his chest if he spoke no one heard him over the shouts of the crowd he died quickly though fifteen minutes later excitable persons still shouted that he lived when they saw the charred remains move as does meat on a hot frying pan a mob near valdosta georgia lynched three innocent negroes when they could not find the man they sought for murdering a plantation owner as told by langston hughes in the story of the naacp the pregnant wife of one of the three wailed at her husbands death so loudly that the mob seized her and burned her alive too as the flames enveloped mary turners body her unborn child fell to the ground and was trampled underfoot white parents held their children up to watch during the years from to the naacp records that men and women were lynched the negro man already treated by the white majority as less tnan a man is further depreciated by his women because of his uncertain employment more than per cent of the negro labor force is in the three lowest occupations as compared to per cent of white workers the unemployment rate for negro mens times greater than for whites onehalf or the negro families in america receive a week or less money income compared with a week for white families the negro womans chance for employment is better than the mans there is always a demand for domestic work and she has greater opportunity to complete her education the negro working class woman holds the purse strings she usually works until much longer than does her white counterpart this difference expresses the greater economic security of the white male negro women head the family in one out of five families as compared to one in eleven for whites the negro woman loses respect for her husband whose economic condition prevents him from acting according to the accepted white ideals she is frustrated in her feminine wishes to have a man stronger than she and often betrays these feelings in contempt for the man this contempt is reflected in sissie a novel by john a williams when her husband cant find work sissie wonders at what point had she become the man and he less the man he had seemed to be when sissie tells her husband that they will have to move to a cheaper flat with no furnace and shes going to take in washing at home he explodes im a f g man whats making it so that i cant be one because masculinity is closely tied to power in every form in our society the negro interprets his economic failure as a loss in masculinity his frantic efforts to maintain a dominant position in the family often end in failure and despondency leading to divorce or desertion accounting for the high number of broken families particularly in the lower classes and the negro father who abandons his family is himself likely to have been the product of a broken home or one damaged by a weak father image a youngsters strong identification with respected and loved parents enables him to control eventually his rebellious feelings but for many a negro child the father cannot be idealized as protector and provider for he is neither parents cannot help their children gain status and social and economic satisfaction for the parents themselves are members of a despised group their ideal is spoiled by the stigma of inferiority in a broken home situation the negro boy is often reared by his mother and grandmother in an atmosphere which does not exalt masculinity on the contrary these frustrated women often make disparaging remarks about the inadequacies of the negro male making it impossible for the boy to identify with a positive father image and derive self esteem from such identification often he is brutally informed that he is no good just like his father inner tensions accumulate and the home fails to be a protective environment the boy feels frustrated dependency and hostility rage however the certain knowledge that he will be punished if his hatred is discovered produces guilt for having such emotions in order to survive the negro suppresses his rage replacing it with submission or ingratiation while scraping and bowing may save his life they help to murder his manhood deeply frustrated by his ego deflating role and unable to express his hostility toward whites the lower class negro often unleashes his fury in violent attacks on other negroes to bolster his bruised ego he may dress flamboyantly straighten his kinky hair prove to himself that he is not invisible a magical aid to selfesteem is gambling where he has the chance of beating fate of being the favored one if just for a day or he may seek escape from his intolerable situation in alcohol narcotics and crime all negroes do not succumb to these problems those raised in stable homes are generally able to develop psychological resources to withstand these effects but discrimination and segregation create a type of family disorganization which causes many negroes to be especially vulnerable nor is the middle class negro exempt from a loss of masculinity he goes through the same cycle of suppressed rage guilt and self rejection because despite his wealth and education and conformity to middle class standards he is not accepted by white society e franklin frazier states in black bourgeoisie negro men are frustrated because they cannot assert themselves or exercise power as white men do the conservative and conventional middle class husband often sits at home alone impotent physically and socially and complains that his wife has gone crazy about poker and society and constantly demands money for gambling and expenditures which he cannot afford ignored by the dominant society they engage in an intense struggle for status reflected in their conspicuous consumption of material goods in an attempt to compensate for the contempt of the whites frazier also notes that in the south the middle class negro male is not only prevented from playing a masculine role but generally must let negro women assume leadership in any show of militancy this demoralizes his status in the home and further emasculates him dr abram kardiner and dr lionel ovesey psychiatrist and sociologist who pooled their resources while both were on the staff of columbia university to conduct a study on the personality of the negro observed there is not one personality trait of the negro the source of which cannot be traced to his difficult living condition there are no exceptions to this rule the final result is a wretched internal life negro self esteem cannot be retrieved nor negro selfhatred destroyed as long as the status is quo they can never be eradicated without removing the forces that create and perpetuate them what is needed by the negro is not education but reintegration it is the white man who requires the education although the negro has fought valiantly in every american war he has been discriminated against in every war and this has been a frustrating blow to his manhood last december a special committee reported to president johnson that discrimination still exists in overseas military bases and that the national guard segregates negroes ami not a soldier a man and a brother not if you are black america answered on the eve of world war ii a negro could die for his country but he had to do so in certain restricted menial jobs in the navy and coast guard in two infantry and one cavalry regiments in the army he was excluded from the army air corps the marine corps and from the tank signal engineer and artillery corps of the army in yancy williams a howard university student filed suit to compel the war department to consider him for the lilywhite army air corps the naacp was threatening lawsuits against local education boards which provided vocational defense training for whites but excluded negroes when pearl harbor was bombed the naacp issued a call to all negro citizens to support the war effort in the south where most of the negro troops were sent for their basic training a negro soldier who entered a white uso or service club might be arrested and court martialed southern police and civilians inflicted brutal treatment upon the negro gis who were ordered by their commanding officers not to retaliate they were beaten shot and murdered in southern railway station restaurants german prisoners of war were served promptly while the negroes guarding them often had to go hungry the negro soldier bitterly wondered who really was his enemy twenty six thousand white workers making bomber engines at a packard motor plant in detroit in went out on strike in protest against the employment of negroes a striker in front of the plant yelled id rather see hitler and hirohito win the war than work beside a nigger on the assembly line that summer a bitter race riot held up war production for two days overseas the situation between white and black troops bordered on armed warfare in guam a long series of attacks upon negro service units led to an investigation by the naacp stones and hand grenades were repeatedly hurled into the negro camp and a band of marines ran negroes out of agana when two drunken marines killed a negro soldier on christmas day in and later a machine gun loaded onto a jeep sprayed bullets into the negro camp the negro soldiers decided they had had enough they boarded a truck but were arrested before they reached agana charged with rioting attempted murder theft of government property and unlawful assembly they were court martialed and sentenced to prison the naacp took the case all the way to the white house before the verdict was finally reversed not until the battle of the bulge in december did white and black soldiers serve together but in separate platoons negro riflemen were moved into the white divisions of the first and seventh armies general patton and general eisenhower praised these colored troops all of whom had volunteered for combat duty and major general lathan told the riflemen i have never seen any soldiers who performed better in combat than you many of them lost their lives but when a movie spectacular recorded the heroic deeds of this invasion recently not one negro soldier was portrayed the red cross was also rigid in upholding jim crow it offered separate and inferior recreational facilities for negro troops and at first refused to accept blood from negro donors for its blood bank ironically the blood plasma project was originated by a negro dr charles drew later the red cross accepted negro blood but segregated it according to the wishes of congressman john rankin of mississippi who claimed that not to separate the plasma was a communist plot to mongrelize america at the wars end parades and brass bands welcomed the white war hero the familiar pattern of violence and intimidation greeted the negro isaac woodward jr discharged from the army only a few hours earlier was on his way home when he had his eyes gouged out in batesburg south carolina by the chief of police the atlanta daily world in georgia commented on november that some atlanta police are reported to be beating up discharged and disabled negro veterans at the slightest provocation and practicing a gettheminlinewiththepostwarattitude am l not a veteran a brother and a man the answer was still no the negro has a long list of grievances he complains of police brutality inequality before the law and complex social discrimination which closes to him doors of opportunities which are open to others poverty condemns him to inferior housing health and schools his lack of education confines him to the least desirable jobs his low status deprives him of political equality his lack of equality degrades him and confirms his separatedness from whites who gain in selfesteem if in no other way than through his debasement at every turn this vicious cycle stalks him standing between him and the cherished ideals of american manhood today the emergence of the african nations has helped rescue the color black from the outhouse giving the negro a new sense of dignity writers like james baldwin are telling the negro to find his own identity and tohellwithemulatingwhites in a recent look article he said white people seem to ask us if they ask us anything come into my nightmare with me be like me have abortions like me instead of illegitimate children but we dont want to be like you there is no reason whatever for negroes to want to enter white society nurtured on the disillusionment of their wartime parents todays generation is increasingly aware of its psychological handicaps and determined to grind to a halt the resultant chain reaction nonviolently or otherwise that is why the negro laughs with derision when wellintentioned but unthinking people tell him hes going too fast how can one go too fast to prevent even one little black boy from becoming half a man in a white world the negro woman exj ploited by white men t jl and women resented eereais and brutalized by her own men of color has marched down through the pages of history proud and unbowed by all the indignities heaped upon her by every segment of a truly hostile society in a nation that is largely antifemale and totally antinegro the negro woman has almost singlehandedly kept her family together mainly on coolie wages and in most instances has brought her children up to be hardworking lawabiding citizens but has she received any credit for her wellnigh impossible achievements certainly not if historically white america has either ignored or lynched the black male it has used and abused the black female with all the vigorous cruelty of an incredibly vicious people yet without exception this nation has blamed the delinquency of our black slum children on the working negro mother instead of placing the blame where it squarely belongs on its own bigoted shoulders and likewise these experts never blink an eyelash when its pointed out that there is as much delinquency among the middle and upperclass white youths whose mothers do not work and in reality there is more speaking in actual percentages but money and unorthodox police methods manage to hush much of it up but despite these concealments all honest observers are deeply concerned over the cancerous state of this so called affluent society and how ironical that this nation was so rapacious it could not forsee that to enslave murder rape maim and rob a whole race of people would surely one day cast its evil spell on the entire country corrupting its favored children and their children and their childrens children then too in this lilywhite society simply being black is reason enough for nabbing many of our negro males of all ages on suspicion and hauling them down to the precinct where an appalling number wind up with cracked heads compliments of the uniformed racist thugs who cruise this infected land north and south east and west night and day forever and ever and what have our black experts had to say about our courageous unsung heroine since slavery time our families have been mostly matriarchal many of them cry happily though in the new industrial class and expanding middleclass larger numbers of negro men are assuming dominant family roles these experts exult in the next breath neither economic necessity nor tradition has instilled in the negro woman the spirit of subordination to masculine authority the late e franklin frazier once wrote obviously none of our black male experts seem to realize that the concept of male supremacy is as reprehensible and obsolescent as is the concept of white supremacy which they have always so eloquently railed against indeed one of our most renown negro authors had one of his female characters exclaim more than once in his book im just another colored girl to these white people nowhere did he have any of his male characters say im just another colored man it is plain to see that this author doesnt realize the negro woman as do other human beings always thinks of herself as being just that a human being it is only to our illustrous black author and his bigoted white countrymen that she is thought of as being something other than a real person to be sure our social scientists aping their white colleagues who spend much of their time extolling the virtues of motherhood and female servitude to the male never miss an opportunity to throw brickbats at the negro woman one such authority complained bitterly that the negro woman doesnt want to be financially dependent on the male well why should she since she is neither child nor serf nor idiot because no matter how its dressed up and this nation has an astonishing ability when it comes to finding euphemisms for evil thus slavery has become the peculiar institution and murder if your victim is black is not murder but a deprivation of civil_rights being financially dependent on anyone is to be indentured to that person or group surely these experts must know that inasmuch as theyve largely been dependent on the white man for nearly four centuries and remain at the very bottom of the social and economic structure and are sinking lower if such can be imagined and these same bucolic authorities let out anguished cries of outrage when they note that many negro women have outstripped the black male in certain areas instead of giving credit to the female and encouragement to the male and female for goodness knows our people are far far behind in virtually all fields in this great society these th century theoreticians seek to elevate the black man by debasing the female of course as has often been pointed out no group is really desirous of other groups becoming its equal they are concerned with being superior however and this is especially true of the majority of negro men in america being secondclass citizens themselves they are hellbent on making sure the female remains subservient to the male and when the negro woman rejects this intolerable situation for there is no more unendurable hell on earth than that of being a doormats doormat she is called unwomanly castrative or masculine by our black and white experts and just as an overwhelming majority of white people become outraged whenever black people aspire to anything above the mop and bucket brigade so do all except an extremely small number of men become incensed when any female seeks to shun the shackles of the kitchen and make her way in the world at large and this is doubly true for the negro woman who remarkably has taken these obstacles in her stride and is even now demonstrating in ever increasing numbers that her brain is as good as anyone elses and that she intends to utilize it to the utmost labels and namecalling she realizes are for the frightened and the insecure to take refuge behind and like sticks and stones she knows they can neither break her spirit nor stop her march through history as one of our most enduring examples of courage for all time hazards of forming a single rights group night is turned to day in the glare of the bombs a mighty cannon roars and men and earth are replaced by a gaping holea giant period that marks an end to the statement of life sighs of the dying mingle with cries of the living but both are drowned out by the screaming shells a mans finger slowly squeezes the trigger and his rifle barks a question a ball of lead speeds toward its target seeking an answer it finds its mark in a human heart and the answer is death this is warhotwise words and pictures change mens ideologies and beliefs the intangible fingers of propaganda reach out and capture their minds an upheaval in politics gives birth to another revolution a little island miles off the florida shore is our enemy and another miles from the western coast is our friend democracy and communism vie in a contest to make leaders look east or west in this contest the soldiers are replaced by diplomats and the guns give way to words this too is warcoldwise that vacancy is filled insists the personnel manager and a man keeps walking come back tomorrow says the foreman and a man must move on there are no openings at present a negro college graduate is told in these ways are the long unemployment lines formed and the men who face deceit who stand in those lines and walk those streets are citizens of the richest nation in the world but they are denied entrance into the mainstream of the good life the doors close in their faces the employers turn them away and they must struggle to survive from day to day when all the tokens for the busses and subways are gone they walk the streets in despair searching for ways to earn their fare this is yet another warjobwise yet important as it is the latter war is only one phase of the negro revolution as we all are aware there exist numerous other phases such as education housing and use of public facilities now with so many prime fronts to be attacked does it not seem tactically feasible to have a number of groups prepared to assault those fronts for example consider the air force army and navy they are separate branches of the united states military establishment but during times of war they all coordinate their efforts to defeat the common enemy the fact that the negro revolution embraces different groups with unlike methods is certainly not a hindrance in itself conflict normally arises only when one group criticizes anothers philosophy or methods essentially the goal that they all seek to attain is the same on the contrary it is the methods and philosophies that vary yet as other wars and other revolutions have proven it takes a variety of efforts to obtain even a single victory history tells us that the roads were varied and many but they all led to rome though the sights and sounds on each were different they all ended at an identical place so may the various civil_rights groups lead us down different paths by different methods to the same destinationequality for every man and if each of us chooses to follow a separate group that should not detract from our progress after all as individuals we all differ and the sights and sounds of a particular road may attract one and repel another but let us not criticize those who go by a road other than the one we travel for we all shall meet in rome by and by now let us suppose that all negro revolutionists began traveling the same roador more aptly suppose that the civil_rights groups were to merge forces such an action would naturally raise many psychological and practical questionsquestions that should be answered long before the action is initiated it is certain that a merger would produce numerous organizational problems we need not concern ourselves with specific descriptions of those problems but only with their effect in zen buddhism there is a belief that small children always look at the finger which points rather than at the thing to which it points it is fact that most adults also become much more preoccupied by the pointer than by that to which it points if now the civil_rights groups were to merge would it not generate many complex organizational details like the people described in zen buddhism would the combined groups involvement with the finger of detail cause them to lose sight of the ultimate goal for the danger is that they might become so wrapped in the cloak of organizational complexity that they will devote more time to the finger than to the fight moreover as various demonstrations have shown emotions are the very substance of the negro revolution for our struggle involves a great deal of idealism and idealism is primarily based on emotions though tempered with a certain amount of objectivity emotionalism remains the moving force for instance consider the great march on washington though conceived and executed in an objective manner it still depended on emotionalism for its accomplishment only emotions could have bridged the gap between such a conglomeration of people and caused them to cooperate with so much success no doubt there are those among us who can remember when the corner grocery store was an intimate friendly place it was there that we stood and swapped stories and joked with the proprietor say mr jones then as the store grew larger we noticed that mr jones had no more time for jokes and began casting disapproving glances at those who came primarily to stand and talk and as the store became larger and larger our standing talking and joking were no longer tolerated even that simple example serves to show that the larger an organization grows the more objective it must become to operate effectively so may the merged civil_rights groups move to a higher plane of objectivity the question which arises is this would such a move cause a decline of emotions in their thinking and activities if so a great deal would indeed be lost also to be considered are those participants who have allied themselves with one particular group as stated previously the sights and sounds of a single road may attract one and repel another so a reason able assumption is that some individuals are not only committed to achieving the ultimate goal of the negro revolution but are also committed to certain leaders principles concepts methods and other facets of a specific group and in committing themselves to the latter they have probably established identities with their chosen group and have developed certain images regarding their role in the civil_rights battle since a merger would result in the groups being united indistinw f i guishably it is likely that such a union would precipitate an entirely new group image which would differ from any of those projected by the present organizations it is apparent then that a great many persons would have to realign themselves with the new union and would also have to create fresh images of their roles but when faced with the actual transition how many would or could willfully and completely cast off the old images and identificationshow many would or could attain and maintain the new ones and mainly how many would lose the old and reject or find unattainable the new finally how many would be left to flounder in the clutches of confusion and be left with nothing at all let us also briefly consider the leadership aspect if one of the present leaders were elected to head the group would the effectiveness of the remaining ones be somewhat impededwould their personalities be somewhat impaired as previously indicated some participants are especially allied with certain leaders and if those leaders were given seemingly lesser roles than they now have would their staunch supporters tend to resent that subordination would their resentment manifest itself in covert rebellion against the newly elected leader and in a general lessening of interest and effort regarding the combined activity it is probable that such manifestations would tend towards anarchy and would detract from the overall effectiveness of the group itself though this limited inquiry points toward the many questions and problems that would probably arise from a complete merger of the current civil_rights groups it is not meant to discourage or demean cooperation between those groups after all if the branches of the u s military can function effectively under a department of defense it seems feasible that the various rights groups could also operate properly under a similar authority for if the leaders of those groups would come together and form let us say a council of coordination many questions and problems in cooperation would no doubt be eliminated they could then coordinate their efforts and plan a common strategy which would determine what targets are to be assaulted and which group would be primarily responsible for the assault this strategy would evolve from the locale of the target the required number of participants the best method of attack and other pertinent factors on the basis of such plans it appears that they could attack each separate front without duplicating efforts and without coming into conflict with one another even though the negros struggle has spawned various groups could not the philosophies and methods of each be accepted and applied towards a successful end to our great venture for it is only fitting and proper that we use every legal and honorable means to succeed in our endeavor now is the time when we like shakespeares character should realize that there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their lives shall be bound in shallows and miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current as it serves or lose our ventures american history j abounds with success stories v they range from the fictional exploits of horatio alger to the very nonfictional success of andrew carnegie who rose from his start as a poor scottish immigrant to amass one of this countrys greatest fortunes we also have albert e watson im not equating watson with the legendary alger or the superaffluent carnegie but he does have his own cinderellalike success story its the story of how watson rose from a doortodoor sweetmeat salesman in the bayou country of louisiana to the owner of a successful meat processing plant in los angeles watsons success is also the story of what we at the small business administration are doing to help develop a strong stable negro middle class by helping negroes survive in the sharply competitive world of small business albert watsons new meat plant was tooled with the latest equipment in the trade his home is in baldwin hills suburban area which has its scattering of private swimming pools and boasts of a panoramic view of the city but for the year old watson it hasnt always been that way he started out as a small boy knocking on doors in houma louisiana selling unwanted byproductssuch as liver hearts and brainsfrom a nearby meat packing firm he combined his initiative skill salesmanship and assistance from the small business administration into his present operation with its employees at the age of he learned the trade of boning meats and for the next years he worked for a number of packing and processing firms learning more and more about the business while working he took care of his education by going to school at night his teachers started him in the seventh grade in and four years later he had received his high school diploma and had launched himself in college eventually he got a diploma from pepperdine college where he majored in business administration and american history in watson decided to bew come his own boss his first business venture was a single table cutting his own meats in six months his business expanded and he had to move to larger quarters after six months he moved again in he came to sb a to borrow to again expand his business he repaid the loan in full in and a little later again borrowed from sba this time the largest cash loan ever made by sba to a negro businessman this loan financed his new plant although it shows dramatically what can be done in business unfortunately albert watsons success is not typical of the negro small businessman the condition of these businessmen is shown by a single set of statistics negroes represent about per cent of the national population but they own less than two per cent of the nations million small businesses and the businesses that negroes do own have only about half the income of their white counterparts on top of this they have an extremely difficult time getting credit for expanding modernizing or starting a new business there is an urgent need to inject a massive economic stimulus into our negro population centers as a means of developing economic power among negroes this power isneeded not only to assure the survival of small businessmen but to provide the core of a healthy negro middle class which has been described as the stabilizer and social harmonizer since i became sba administrator in august we have been trying to break the ice that has long frozen the negro small businessman into an inadequately and ghettoized pattern of operation i think we have made considerable progress in this direction but we dont have the luxury of indefinite time to establish a viable negro small business class it is ironic that the civil_rights legislation which seeks to insure equal social and legal rights for our negro citizens also puts the pressure on the negro in the market place in enacting these safeguards of justice and equality the law weakens the wall which has long protected the negro businessman oriented toward the negro customer from white competition the negro small businessmans enterprise grew out of the segregation pattern and in its present form is almost entirely dependent upon it gradually as this pattern disappearsand it is in many areasthe negro small businessman must cut his racial ties and move out into the mainstream of commerce it is one of the major missions of our agency to assist in this process considerable progress has been made i believe that the reason we have progressed in this effort is because we view it not as simply a way of helping a business but also because we are seeking to help the individual behind the business and we are working to build a force for stability progress and creativity in a deprived community what specifically are we doing first we are providing credit on terms that emphasize a mans character rather than his collateral and at a reasonable rate of interest that will take him out of the grips of the loan sharks initially this took the form of what we call the by program loans up to for years it was started in philadelphia on a pilot basis in january the chief purpose was to make financial assistance available to the very very small businessman particularly the negro who found it virtually impossible to get credit from the traditional loan sources we also felt that many negro small businessmen who had the ingredients for success were unable to meet the more stringent requirements of sbas regular loan programs for example in the decade prior to setting up the by program only seven loans to negro businessmen had been made in philadelphia in just one year of operation of the special program such loans totaling were made in philadelphia to negro businessmen interestingly enough one of these philadelphia loans is probably the smallest federal loan made in this billiondollar era the loan for went to help two young women start a childrens day nursery for the working wives of the neighborhood in another case again in philadelphia a by loan made it possible for a year old father to go into business for himself the young man after going to school to study automobile transmission repair went to the bank to borrow money to take over his fathers auto repair garage because of debts he was turned down instead of being discouraged he went to work to pay off the debts and came to sba for a loan impressed by his ambition and the fact that he went out and earned the money to repaydebts we made a loan of for his business the by success story was repeated in several other large cities where the pilot program was set up to meet negro businessmens needs we were most gratified by the success of the program we were even more pleased when the by program became the basis of title iv of the economic opportunity actbetter known as the war on poverty legislation this section adopted the character principle of the by programbut on an expanded basis the legislation raised the loan limits to a maximum of for years again negroes were quick to respond to the broadened program and the first economic opportunity loan by sba went to a negro bakery cooperative in louisiana and one of the first community organizations set up to screen these loans for sba was established in harlem while we are pleased with the reception these programs have received we are not confining our assistance to negroes to special devicesas the watson loan shows and we are not seeking a strictly money answer to the problem of helping the small businessman in our efforts to provide a wide range of assistance and services to the negro business community we have established the office of special assistance for minority groups this post is held by randall l tyrus through his office sba makes a concerted and sustained effort to stay in personal contact with the negro leaders and organizations sharing our concern about the future of the negro business community and our desire to do something about it this liaison has resulted in substantial benefits in many areas and has led to direct cooperation between sba and negro leaders to set up active financial and management assistance programs for those needing such help recently i had the pleasure to appoint the first negro regional director for the small business administration james bruce llewellyn who has full charge of all sba activities in cities of eastern and southern new york including all of long island and staten island as regional director he will be in charge of employees including technicians his region has an estimated small businesses many of which look to sba for financial and other assistance we feel that we have made a sound beginning toward providing sustained effective assistance to negro small businessmen and by widening our horizons beyond this task we are seeking to make our agency a model of equal employment opportunities for the nations youth there is no certainty that our efforts will result in the story of albert watsons becoming typical but we are confident that we are on the road to making his story less unusual in hollywood released one of the most chilling movies of all time the invasion of the body snatchers grown men and women trembled even fainted as they watched giant podlike creatures from outer space duplicate individual humans and irresistibly insinuate themselves into the bodies of sleeping americans the transformation was undetectablethe victims looked sounded and moved as they had before but they were actually the spirits of the pods invested in human bodies and naturally in their dealings with earthlings their sole aim was to help a fellow creature become similarly incorporated until the whole earth became their home but the audienceonce out of the theater at leastrecognized this as a piece of fiction in however just two years later a former massachusetts candy bar businessman claimed that humanlike creatures called communists possessing neither consciences nor morals had taken over about per cent of america whether or not this man saw the horror movie is not determined but whatever his inspiration he asserted that any one of these communists can control or convert a hundred to a thousand completely misguided americans furthermore he continued it is almost impossible for the ordinary citizen to recognize these communists because they are too slippery for you to put your fingers on them in the ordinary way he doesnt wear any label he usually lives up to the appearance of excellent morals and you will usually find him in church on sunday morning maybe even a catholic church but as a member of the united states senate running for the presidency and smart enough to know the strong communist support behindthescenes which he will have to have to get nominated in such an amoral man can do a tremendous amount of ballcarrying on behalf of the communist aims here in the united states these are the words of robert welch founder of the john birch society a master of the halftruth and implicit smear welch directs suspicion fear and hatred against any group or individual opposed to the reactionary rightwing in the quoted passage for example welch does not make the propagandists mistake of naming anyone who fits the description of a catholic senator running for the presidential nomination yet his description fits only one man in the history of the world the late john f kennedy whose memory said a birch leader will be cherished with distaste of course the slain president is not the only one doused with the birchers red paint one learns from them that martin_luther_king jr dwight eisenhower john foster dulles albert einstein earl warren adlai stevenson humphrey bogart eleanor roosevelt and countless others with hardly anything in common are dedicated or manipulated agents of a communist conspiracy to subjugate the world through fallacies and falsehoods undetected by the untrained or muddled minds of their often wellmeaning followers birch leaders convince their gullible flock that communists are behind the civil_rights movement the un income tax fluoridation of water sex education the supreme court the clergy the press congressin short they are told that communists control the country how can so many americans believe the birch barking one reason is fear for fear is the child of ignorance and superstition and birch leaders preach to each member that more than half the people he sees may be suspected as members of a conspiracy to enslave him this fear begets hatred and intensifies the alltoohuman weakness of fearing hating and attacking ideas and people unfamiliar to or different from oneself a man who believes he is threatened by something he can neither see nor understand is a ready tool for the hands of demagogues and so upon learning that dag hammarskjold ralph bunche and former howard university president mordecai johnson have publicly advocated the doctrines of communism the confused young couples patriotic grandmothers zealous lawyers insecure immigrants tightfisted businessmen and hardbitten racists feel over whelmed and surrender their minds to powerhungry rightwingers sensitively aware that they are the butts of jokes and the victims of rash attacks birchers instinctively huddle together they enjoy thinking of themselves as an oppressed minority group of americanists but it is a mistake to ridicule or smear the birchers and a greater mistake moreover to ignore the fact that the dedicated core of leaders and organizers who plot and carry out the brainwashing of americans and sabotage of the constitution plan to inflict a repulsive tyrannical form of government on this country not only the fifth amendment but also the first freedom of speech religion press and assembly the sixth right to confront accusers in court fourteenth and fifteenth against voterdiscrimination graduated income tax article four the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states and many other constitutional provisions would be subverted by the birchers armed with catchy slogans and an expanded budget they play upon the insecurity of many americans who have recently gained middle class status they help these citizens decline the responsibilities of their status by occupying much of their time with reading matter and cunning projects like writing birch letters to liberal industrialists jamming the lines of phonein radio programs distributing stickers support your local police removing books they dislike from libraries erecting billboards and infiltrating the pta but their main strategy now is secretly to foment racial strife and thereby discredit liberal politicians who pass legislation designed to bring about a more democratic and just relationship between black and white with an increasing number of policemen falling under their spell birch leaders know that it is relatively easy for them to set the races against each other and spark a riot not only without police intervention but perhaps with police collaboration and then in the confusion and hysteria the rightwing will offer to the white majority a candidate who promises to smother civil_rights and other liberal protests once and for all too many americans believe that true conservatives like the birchers could hardly be involved in such a foul scheme but despite the patrioticreligious sounding names of their many front groups the birchers are definitely not conservatives they are made up to look that way but it is hard to teach an old bawd new tricks and ever so often the cosmetic facade of a birch group melts down its face exposing the flesh underneath not only do they cavort with outspoken racists like lester maddox the atlanta exrestaurateur but also with men more powerful and competent than maddox and who constitute what has been called the militaryindustrial complex this complex of active and retired rightwing military and businessmen is similar to the group which brought hitler to power these are the rich men who are not used to being questioned men who do not think of their fellow citizens as political social or moral equals and who resist the struggles of the oppressed many of these men are white supremacists it is significant that the klan was founded by an exconfederate general a negrotrader nathan bedford forrest whose methods of driving people into the klan corral were almost identical to welchs birch tactics said forrest in in each voting precinct there is a captain who is required to make out a list of names of men in his precinct giving all the radicals and all the democrats good guys who are positively known and showing also the doubtful on both sides and of both colors this list of names is forwarded to the grand commander of the state who is thus enabled to know who are our friends and who are not said welch in the john birch society will function almost entirely through small local chapters each will have a chapter leader appointed by headquarters another thing we should do and one badly needed would be to start shocking the american people into a dawning realization of how far and how completely communists and communist influences have crept right into communities institutions and activities where the general public does not have the slightest suspicion of such infiltration the best way to do this is by exposure which is why the communists just had to get rid of mccarthy the parallel is more meaningful when one notices that it is over racial problems the birchers most often trip sen james eastland mississippis bulwark is one of their experts on the american race problem and south carolinas strom thurmond is another birch booster the racist government of south africa is their prime example of a stable anticommunist regime and during the summer of welch urged birchers to contribute to the coordinating committee for fundamental american freedoms which spent half a million dollars fighting the civil_rights bill this committee pumped into a chicago polish newspaper alone thus by wooing policemen in big cities and by playing upon inferiority complexes of disadvantaged whites the birchers prove themselves adept at hitlerian tactics welch reveals his true nature in his a letter to the south on segregation addressing white people as he admits welch tells his followers that during the civil_rights movement a great many negroes are going to become very foolish indeed before this rising storm is over he tells his white readers that they form an elite and must meet the civil_rights advance with self control and constructive labor this is so far not rabid talk but a little further into the letter after implying that negroes use bathtubs less frequently than whites welch claims that the easygoing colored man of the south is being inflamed by communists the ordinary colored people of the south can easily be misled by clever agitators but truly in most cases they know not what they do he then argues that the phrase civil_rights is actually a communist slogan and informs his readers that those who approvingly use the phrase are attempting to put on pressures that will force you to armed resistance with the appearance in the minds of most people not close enough to be truly informed of right and justice on their side communists according to welch forced negroes to seek the supreme court desegregation decision even though school integration embarrassed negroes certain negroes like the ones who worked around his fathers north carolina farm but never tried to eat beside him in a restaurant are approved by welch he approves of the rev j l ward leader of the prince of peace goodwill movement in memphis he even put rev wards picture in a widely published birch society circular rev ward says welch has common sense despite his considerable difficulties with his plurals and his tenses welch printed the following statement of rev wards as typical of the negro with common sense we are asking the negroes of the south in the publishing of this literature let us remember that the lord brought us this way through the leadership of our southern white friends who knows us who helps us who has built our schools who has helped our churches who has given their monies and some have given their lives the birchers also approve of the rev uriah j fields in rev fields was a secretary of the montgomery improvement association unsatisfied with his role fields charged that rev martin_luther_king jr had misused funds collected to provide negroes with transportation during the bus boycott segregationists eagerly snapped up fields and he appeared as a witness for the prosecution before a grand jury which indicted king and other negroes when it became obvious that the charges would be proved false fields retracted his accusation and apologized to the innocent civil_rights workers he was not sued because king believes law suits are incompatible with the philosophy of nonviolence now fields lives in los angeles and is a member of the birch societys speakers bureau which sends him around the country exposing the communist plot behind the civil_rights movement he fields must be doing well now says a la newswoman hes driving a big new cadillac a negro woman mrs julia brown also of los angeles is another member of the societys speakers bureau denying that she is a member of the society mrs brown adds but i would consider it an honor birchers and their sympathizers enjoy mrs browns speeches in omaha neb she told them there are many communists working for negro voting rights because thats where the dirty work is so i can appreciate governor wallaces being tired of voting rights demonstrations martin_luther_king jr and james farmer are aiding the communist conspiracy the southern white man is the negros best friend mrs brown was once a paid informer for the fbi selling them information about alleged communists who were her former friends in the cleveland ohio i area other negroes whom the birchers have linked with themselves in the literature they pass out are the rev c fain kyle of richmond calif and his daughter gwendolyn rev kyle heads a group called discard dedicated independent society committee against racial demonstrations inc another group called the conservative christian churches of america and five other predominantly onemanshows miss kyle received the birchers first annual manning johnson scholarship award upon receiving it she told newsmen martin_luther_king is not what he appears to be to many people i think highly of the birch societyits doing a tremendous job telling the american people about the communist conspiracy in the civil_rights movement in america neither past present nor aspiring member of the society kyle says he has been used by birchers who figured that a negro conservative was a good drawing card kyle refused to become a member of the speakers bureau because people would say i was saying something because the society was paying me to say it kyle says he antagonized birchers by criticizing the antisemitism of some members and the fanaticism of others who he says get hooked on the organization most of them are fine people kyle believes but theyre over zealous because they look to a man as a leader and not to god but robert welch the man the birchers look to thinks of himself as part of some mighty purpose beyond our understanding by his present understanding this mighty purpose is to lead his followers in a fight against evil incarnated by people he calls communists he is a friend of the negro he says to the degree that the negro keeps out of the civil_rights movement for the civil_rights movement is part of a gigantic conspiracy to enslave mankind run by men who are utterly ruthless gangsters willing to use any means to achieve their end with sublime illogic welch says that these communists have no real dedication even to communism welch himself longs for that western europe of the nineteenth century when white men had the power and desire to bring civilized rule to the settled natives on all continents of the earth present day america according to welch is suffering from cancer and needs drastic surgery which can be provided only if birchtype americans become conspirators against established government hitler it should be remembered saw his mission as a historic revenge entrusted to us by the creator a revenge which involved regenerating germany from the disease of democrats marxists jews masons and other criminals and hitler as time has proved also believed in drastic surgery but the american radicalright does not have a leader with hitlers outspokennessyet today welch sounds more like the klans first grand wizard n b forrest sounded when he plotted against the abolitionists in i loved the old government in i loved the old constitution yet i am opposing only the radical revolutionaries who are trying to destroy it men who would hesitate at no crime and who have only one object in view to enrich themselves i want you to understand distinctly i am not an enemy to the negro we want him here among us he is the only laboring class we have smple and tragic the storyan old one jerry chatman and one robert shuler are young negroes under sentences of death for the rape of a white woman the letter came as attorney tobias simon with florida law students were completing a statewide investigation as part of the naacp legal defense funds campaign against the discriminatory application of the death penalty against negroes in rape cases the defense fund handles virtually all of the civil_rights litigation in the country the attorneys were in a difficult position the client wanted to give up the fouryear battle for his life he simply could not take it anymore yet the attorney knew it might be proven the state had no right to execute him fortunately it was resolved when he changed his mind and the federal judge in charge of the case took this into account and ordered the defense to continue the state had argued that chatmans letter gave them the right to execute him scope of the legal defense fund program besides chatman and shuler eight other negroes are on death row in florida for the rape of white women two others have asked the legal defense fund to defend them to protect the others the fund made a plea to the governor not to execute any of them until the chatman and shuler cases concerning the states right to execute are settled the governor agreed to withhold execution pending disposal of the issue the fund also represents twelve other negroes under death sentence for rape in six other southern states others may also be under death sentences who dont know help is available importance of the statistics the extraordinary thing about the chatman and shuler cases is that florida is the first and only state in the nation for which defense attorneys have gathered statistics that blanket an entire state and compare the conviction and death penalties for negro and white defendants records in each of counties had to be examined in addition to the records of three state agencies a complete factual picture is crucial for the supreme court of florida seven years ago turned down two defendants because the data they offered to prove discrimination was incomplete these defendants had presented the total number of executions but not the total number of convictions both were executed florida death penalty rate over the last years men have been sentenced to death for forcible rape six were white and were negroes this is against a background of an almost equal number of convictions between the two races white men convicted and negro men convicted of the six whites sentenced to death the supreme court of florida reversed the sentences of two and the pardon board the last hope of the defendant commuted the death sentences to life for three of the remaining four therefore only one white man has actually been executed for the crime of rape and this defendant raped an yearold white child and was about to commit sodomy on a young yearold boy who was also present this defendant joined an allstar cast of twosince only one other white man had been executed before of the negroes sentenced to death have already been executed and are now on death row six others had their death sentences reversed four by the supreme court of florida and two by the supreme court of the united states out of appeals by negro defendants the pardon board has granted mercy in only two cases the board evidently considers rape by a negro more serious than murder for it has granted commutations for per cent of the murderers sentenced to death who appealed to them who were the victims no white man has been sentenced to death for raping a negro woman although were convicted of the crime of the six whites originally sentenced to death four attacked white children and two jointly raped a white adult but the only one executed raped an yearold white child no white man has died for the rape of a white woman the rape of a negro woman is not considered serious even when the rapist is a negro for the rape of negro females by negro males only three men were sentenced to death and two of these were child rapes the conviction of the third was reversed by the florida supreme court thus to date no negro has died for the rape either of a negro adult or a negro child the picture shifts sharply as regards rapes of white females by negro men in convictions defendants or roughly per cent of those convicted have been sentenced to death only one of the involved a white child all the others involved white women the negroes executed were drawn from this group of defendants what will be argued in court the struggle with florida which may end in the supreme court of the united states could save negro defendants and ultimately white defendants if successful the fund will argue that the rape statute has been used solely to execute negroes while sparing whites charged with the same crime thus denying the equal protection of the laws that is guaranteed by the federal constitution it will also be argued that killing the defendant when he has not killed anyone is cruel and unusual punishment also barred by the federal constitution both arguments could if accepted protect the white defendant from death as well to take a whites life where he has not taken a life would likewise be unlawful cruelty further the state would naturally not be able to execute a white if the penalty could no longer be applied to negroes rape international and national the united states is only one of the five out of nations in the world that still demands capital punishment for a rape where no one was killed within the u s only southern or border states carried the penalty and two delaware west virginia have dropped it since negroes and whites have been executed surprisingly the federal government primarily for the military and the district of columbia still maintain the death penalty for rape fiftythree men race unknown and three negroes and two whites have been executed under federal law can a negro receive a fair trial the injustice of the death penalty is acute for widespread racial prejudice makes a fair trial unlikely juries are generally all white and may have been rigged that way judges are elected by the local community and white lawyers dont like handling unpopular negro defendants in the face of such massive hostility many negroes lack hope and feel powerless when confronted with official intimidation one negro family in folkston georgia came to the legal defense fund only two days before a relative was to be executed for rape fortunately he was saved by attorneys moving rapidly but the case is not atypical group punishment when a negro is tried for attacking a white person his whole racial group is really on trial it is his group who the authorities feel must be warned against like attacks by the swift harsh treatment applied to him naturally when one group tries another it becomes less important to have the actual perpetrator of the crime any representative from the minority group will do the laws of the south are quite concerned with prohibiting interracial sex states make voluntary sexual contacts or even marriage between negroes and whites a crime rape by a negro is the deepest cut of all the crime triggers hysteria and latent sexual fears and the personal route for thinking about the crime is there what if it had been my wife or my child delaware and west virginia are the only southern states that have abolished the death penalty for rape in the last thirty years because it has been a weapon used liberally against negroes five southern states alone have executed negroes for rape but not one white man since rape is the end horror official excesses aimed at getting the accused are tolerated the famous groveland florida case arising in the same county where chatman was convicted is an example there four young men were accused of raping a white woman one was killed by an armed posse which claimed he resisted arrest the other three were convicted in a community where the ku klux klan ravaged negro neighborhoods in revenge for the crime two of the defendantswalter irvin and samuel shepherdreceived death and the third charles greenlee a sixteen year old was sentenced to life imprisonment shepherd and irvin won new trials from the supreme court of the united states because the jury had been selected in a racially discriminatory manner sheriff willis mccall on bringing the two defendants back to the county for retrial shot both of hem he said they were trying to escape shepherd died instantly but miraculously irvin lived on his hospital bed and near death irvin said they had not tried to escape but that mccall had stopped the car mumbled something about niggers giving him a hard time and shot them at the time they were handcuffed to one another wrist and ankle irvin was tried and sentenced to death for a second time but later became one of the only two negroes in floridas history to have his sentence commuted the shuler and chatman convictions are being challenged on the grounds that falsified and suppressed evidence was used a statement by the victim to the prosecutor that shuler had not touched her was never divulged to the court two former county deputies supported by fbi agents are now willing to testify that two of the deputies faked the footprints that were supposed to have come from the victims yard the two deputies claim a right against selfincrimination under the florida constitution and have refused to testify possibility of error the chatman and shuler cases show that the innocent may be falsely convicted but apart from official obstruction of justice motivated by racial prejudice there are two other possibilities of error florida unlike many other states does not require that the womans claim of rape be supported by other testimony showing that it actually occurred this leaves a defendant negro or white greatly at the mercy of an unbalanced a mistaken or even a revengeful woman a negro may be afraid to tell about a secret affair with the accusing woman since southern juries may find that very notion more repulsive than an attack further doesnt the crime of rape itself particularly that of a child raise serious doubts about the sanity of a defendant in the face of the implacable and deadly hostility of the white community a negro who still attacks a white may very well be acting out of uncontrollable compulsion or derangement indeed it may be an attempt at suicide no state permits the insane to be executed yet the high rate of negro execution would indicate that whether the defendants were mentally disturbed has not been given sufficient attention where does it end the picture is a shocking and grizzly one southern regions which have kept negroes out of lowly hamburger stands have allowed them full and preferential access to the electric chair open and uncontrolled lynching has steadily fallen into disreputebut what can it matter if a racially bigoted community can use the judicial system to commit murder as surely as the mobs of yesteryear is not the whole of american justice menaced if onethird of our nation is permitted to continue with absolute racial carnage how many more jerry chatmans must there be wdjshen i was invited to write this book i did not have a favorable w i impression of ulysses s grant the school books of the days of my youth led me to associate his name with corruption and cigars intoxication and failure i know now that this picture is as accurate as the impression of the blind man who grasped an elephants tail and thought he was holding a rope the uses of history are varied but most important is the understanding of the present in terms of its being the product of the past history is primarily a human product in two senses men live it and men write it i have tried my best to give an honest picture of the man who led the victorious armies in the last year of the civil war and then became the president during whose administration we lost the peace if my picture differs somewhat from that which school histories have led you to expect it is possible that the men who wrote them were giving expression to their prejudices or accepting too uncritically the product of the prejudices of others to the extent that i have helped the reader to learn a great deal about a man and something about an era that have been dealt with unjustly by historians it may be that i have helped to meet some of the problems of today and tomorrow there can hardly be a time more important than the present for directing attention to the affirmative aspects of grants life and character as a son as a husband and as a father he was guided throughout his life by a morality that transcended a mere desire to please this same quality enabled him to show what his new england abolitionist contemporary thomas wentworth higginson called the moral insight to see that the mexican war was a contest in which his own country was wrong and to have the courage to say so this aspect of his character will also explain grants understanding of the difference between a peoples war and a mere contest of soldiers as colonel higginson wrote with the special insight into that difference that he himself gained in his leadership of an exslave regiment fighting for their peoples freedom grants dedication to a peoples government is shown by this citizensoldiers recognition of the subordination of the military to civilian rule so long as i hold a commission in the army i have no views of my own to carry out we are not often told of these aspects of grants military career nor are we told in learning of his political failures of the genuine aspirations for fair play and reconciliation that moved this man before and during his presidency let us have peace was his campaign slogan and his epitaph but he wantedand fought as well as he could forjustice as the only possible foundation for a peace that would be durable one skilled contemporary observer put it prophetically as we are now learning any postponement of justice is a postponement of peace these were the words of georges clemenceau a young political exile in who was reporting american reconstruction for le temps and who was to lead his own country half a century later in a war that brought no peace freedom is never wholly attained but always must be pursued so it is with justice and so too with the truth about our history if you learn from the life of the soldier who was a pacifist the failure who was a success the man of action whose last victory was as a man of letters that there is more much more to americas heritage than you thought i will have achieved my purpose in the book it is time that justice were done to the man vilified beyond his deserts by those embittered not by the mistakes he made but by his supreme achievement the ratification of the fifteenth amendment to our constitution it was that guaranty of the right of all men to vote however humble their origin that he called for in his inaugural message as an instrument of peace he hailed it when ratification was completed in words that have not been remembered from until say man where you been all week i been tryin to call you since monday but youre never home well it like this man i got to thinkin bout how

in the throes of decolonization since america first put pen to paper this literature began as a countrycousin literature of england we were beholden to england for culture and broke with that culture through politics for the great literature of this country until lately is political in fact it is the great political documents of america which have broken the back of cultural slavery all over the world the writings of jefferson the constitution the emancipation proclamation are the basic artifacts of american literature decolonization is born in these documents we are just beginning to feel the consequences we are still at the dawn of those fabulous political words three hundred years passed before the first words of cultural independence were set down three centuries of holding on to the old world the european mother we might have been a french country or a spanish country or english like canada but we turned out to be none of those one of the main reasons was that we had slaves we had negroes the presence of slaves forced the ideal of liberty to its conclusion when america decolonized itself from europe from england it opened the door to decolonization everywhere we pressed a button and opened the pandora box it is this country that gave france the example of revolution and even today we are the admiration and the horror of the old world we have not broken with those documents we were englands robert frost said we were colonials when we stopped being colonials all hell broke loose to be colonial means to live in a faraway place and to long for home american literature was this way until little more than a century agountil a few writers began to say like emerson europe is not home until thoreau pulled back even from the village of concord until whitman rewrote the constitution in poetry and sang the one great poe lincolnto be colonial means to hold onto the umbilicus of home and also to create the native america created two natives the indian and the negro the indian was banished to the unconscious mind of america what is left of the indian is a record of cultural shock which is phenomenal in modern history but the negro could not be banished he was an industrial army fuel to be burned and to be replenished of itself he was the american native richard wright called his first novel native son he understood native but we were still colonial when we began to write we would even send a negro slave girl to england as a poet in the eighteenth century i want to quote verbatim the biographical note from an old anthology of negro poetry edited by langston hughes and arna bontemps in this is colonialism in a nutshell phillis wheatley senegal west africa was captured and sold into slavery in early childhood and brought to boston in she became the property of john wheatley of boston whose wife and daughter soon noted the alert sensitivity of the young african girl and encouraged philliss efforts to acquire learning within a few years she was completely at home in the language and literature of her captors she began writing poetry and in at the age of seventeen published a poem by phillis a negro girl in boston on the death of the reverend george whitefield when her health began to fail phillis was advised by doctors to take a sea voyage this was arranged by the kindly mistress who also gave the girl her freedom before she sailed for england in london phillis was a success it was there that her only collected volume of verse was first issued under the title poems on various subjects religious and moral then one by one the patrons of this talented exslave girl died and she returned to boston her marriage was unhappy and she died as a servant in a cheap lodging house at the age of thirtyone the ironies of this footnote are staggering and would require a dostoevsky to handle them phillis wheatleys poetry is as bad as all colonial eighteenth century poetry though better than that say of the hartford wits which isnt saying much yet this experiment in colonial culture contains a message the message is negative all down the line slavegirl boston at the dawn of revolution guilt about rebellion from the old world neoclassical poetry the kindly mistress and so on in every case except ours a new culture is based on home country settler and native but in america nobody knows where the home country is for the settlers come from home countries all over the world and the natives are no more we have no natives and no common home country we have no peasantry we have only expatriates and exslaves this is a country of runaways and captives when the literature of america got under way it fascinated the world runaways and captives cops and robbers cowboys and indians palefaces and blackskins jews and goyim syndicate and chamber of commerce nobody wanted to be a nativethe natives were dead and done foreverybody wanted to be a settler those who would not settle went back to some old country of the mind eliot santayana pound hemingway henry james others mourned their rootlessnesswe have a whole literature of that the cultural history of our country is one of decolonization every element trying to sever itself from its origins we are something like the white australians who are not eager to trace their ancestry back more than three or four generations because that original ancestor will have been sent over in the hulks the convict ships which were sent from england to the farthest place england could think of every ffv in australia was a convict we are in the same boat we have only a paper aristocracy and our aristocrats were revolutionaries who fought for their lives in this sense the daughters of the american revolution are subversives only they have forgotten what their ancestors were subversive about our literature took a long time to decolonize from english literature and the process hasnt ended yet in the beginning we were anglosaxon about percent for the blacks were not counted in the population and the immigrants hadnt arrived excuse a few statements of facts which i think mean so much a generation after independence the germans and irish began to arrive in force before the civil war hordes of irish dutch danes swedes norwegians swiss and jews swarmed in toward the end of the century came larger waves of italians russians poles austrians bohemians and hungarians a smaller number of asiatics seeped in for this country is still antiasiatic we invented our first concentration camps of american citizens of japanese ancestry during the second world war in all this the english element was inundated and contaminated the language of the king was lost in the shuffle a language in itself is nothing a literature in itself is nothing a literature is the expression of a nations soul and a great literature leaves nothing outthat is its greatness but to leave nothing out means to go against the grain it means to dissent our modern literature is a literature of dissent monotonous and endless dissidence this dissidence gives modern literature its authenticity yet this literature of dissent is only in its infancy dissent is contagious and every day we find new areas of eruption everywhere in the world but dissent is also a drop in the bucket of literature a drop of pigment in the skin or in the blood american literature is unique it is the only literature i have ever heard about in which all elements have tried more or less simultaneously to decolonize themselves it is the only literature which practices cultural amnesia as a doctrine the two famous american writers henry james and t s eliot who refused to surrender the past who insisted on memory surrendered their nationality to the idea of european cultural supremacy they could maintain a continuity with europe only by becoming european again english literature is a dead literature in america a memory the english language is practically a memory only a few english professors in this country pretend that english and its great literature are continuous with ours a decolonized literature in an african country or in a free arab country or in israel is different from ours those nations have a culture to go back to they go back to where they began when history interrupted their life in israel the hebrew language was reinvented overnight after a sleep of two thousand years it seemed the most natural thing in the world for it was that language and its great book which held those people together who became the new israelites in india people fight in the streets to retain their ancient tongues the source of their culture in africa french and english will not long remain the medium of literature not in the european forms at least but in america we have only vestiges of culture to which we do not wish to return the first thing the american immigrant tried to do was to prevent his children from inheriting the old language the old culture in my case for instance yiddish was used as a private language of jokes and confidences which we third generation americans were not supposed to know i have found the same to be true with students of mine who are of czech descent or swedish or dutch or greek in a sense all cultural languages are banished from america a country settled by runaways and slaves did not carry much high culture with it and the tides of immigration engulfed what high culture there was the halfeducated american has long been a byword abroad in fact it is impossible for the american to be educated in the european sense we cannot be nor do we have to as ask my fellow teachers in what way am i to present say english poetry to the grandson of a latvian farmer from a ranch in western nebraska as the poetry of his culture in what way am i to present chaucer or t s eliot to my negro students is that their heritage is the great complex of european culture their heritage and do they have any such heritage at all even to me an english projessor and a writer of the english tongue all things english are foreign i gather from sartres recent writing about africa that european culture is no longer capable of influencing world culture europe is now the colony it is european culture which is thirsty for replenishment from outside american culture shows a similar thirst for replenishment but can slake this thirst from within the great theme of american literature is rootlessness and this fact also makes us unique many writers have even said that there is no relationship between the american and the land it is as if the spirit of place were hostile to us we become the greatest technicians and mechanics because we fight the spirit of place we are bent upon conquering place by force we have never made peace with the land but have taken it by storm d h lawrence felt about this as miller and faulkner have in their books the urban poets who have forgotten what a tree looks like substantiate it in their dusty poems the price our writers have had to pay for rootlessness for cutting ties with all the different pasts behind us is the neuroticism we know so well in our literature and yet we have no choice insofar as the american writer is true to his situation he is a neurotic ridden with the anxieties of separateness from the past freedom is one of the beneficent symptoms of this anxiety we are suddenly confronted with an alphabet of freedom ranging from civil_rights to freedom of the banned book and the spoken obscenity our literature is engaging in a socratic dialogue with all previous values we do this with increasing recklessness and frequently with cynicism for what is there to lose the fact is that there is no place to go back to we have nowhere to go but forward we cannot help ourselves that is our condition so long as america held onto the mother literature it was colonial this was the case until the twentieth century and even into it the criterion of the poem was the english poem of the novel the english novel the exceptions are few and can be counted on one hand it was only with the recognition of rootlessnes that a strong and massive american literature came into being this theme coincided with all the forms of radicalism which swept through the intelligentsia in the early years of the century anarchism various forms of marxism and more recently existentialism are all expressions of the rootless those peoples set adrift by history who have nevertheless become articulate the jewish writer was among the first to speak from this void the jew is the mythic wanderer but the american jew is the one who has forgotten where he wandered from the american jew has no longing for israel and possibly only an intellectual sympathy with it he has little or no cultural memory of the religion or of the tradition all he has is the invisible yellow badge which still shows up in certain lights this badge this psychology of selfconsciousness make the jew want to be absolutely visible he insists on his identification he is the opposite of ellisons invisible man if the jew does not stick out like a sore thumb he is very restless hence all these books by and about jews why does the irishman james joyce choose a poor uninteresting jew to be his main character in ulysses because leopold bloom not only has a faulty memory of his fabulous past as a hebrew but because he is lost bloom is a symbol of the modern bourgeois drifter he doesnt belong in ireland or anywhere else he is cultural ectoplasm in america we are all cultural ectoplasm and the jew can stick out his sore thumb look in a mirror and say like job whence cometh thou i dont want to give one more book review of the now famous and brilliant novel herzog but cant resist a sentence or two herzog the neurotic professor and intellectual is having a breakdown ostensibly because of a broken marriage but the marriage is secondary he is having a breakdown because he is herzog american jewish intellectual like leopold bloom he is discovering that he is adrift he has no place to go back to neither his home from which he has been locked out by his bitchy wife nor his world of ideas which has fallen all over the floor of his study and all he can do is write letters to the living and the dead trying to make a contact somewhere with all those broken wires it is almost a formula of the american novel what is the fascination for the jewish american writer today it is the fascination of the american for one of his own types the man who at last debates with himself the question what does it mean to be a jew an american a negro an american jew an american negro an afroamerican an american of jewish descent etc what it means of course is that the question has been raised the question was not raised in the nineteenth century except perhaps by walt whitman and the question refers art back to the political artifacts are those things real do they mean what i think and hope they mean the constitution of the united states has been backed into a corner by writers no constitution can answer all the questions we are asking it every time the constitution answers a question it asks a new one but americanjewish writing is already obsolete the jew qua jew is no longer a major premise in the creative equation the jewish writer can in effect sit back and chew his cud and watch the negro the jew has achieved decolonization in america not by himself it was going to happen somehow i lived through it and even had a hand in itmaybe i should explain that very early in life i decided upon being a poet i wont go into the motivations of being a poet which are very complex and also irrelevant here knew only one language english and so fell in love with english poetry falling in love with english poetry which is still my old flame meant living an imaginary english life living an imaginary english life meant living a phony life of the mind for i was not english in any sense of the word and living a phony life of the mind meant eventually becoming an english professor i have no rights to the title one day when had learned how to write poetry i had to make a decision about my name nobody in the oxford book of english verse was named shapiro in fact nobody was named shapiro except tailors and junk dealers what was to do change my name this was my first crisis as a poet in those days believe it or not it was impossible to get a poem published if you did not have an anglosaxon name but decided to stick to my name that decision made me jewish and since i had made the decision i wrote poems about jewishness my name itself had not content whatever most jews names are more recent than the last names of negroes that is most jews got names when napoleon broke the ghetto system in europe and the jews were either given the names of a german or polish town or made up one shapiro is named after a german town named speyer am told i hold on to vanderbilt or r j reynolds it was the foreignness of the word i hung onto that i wanted to know why my name was a kind of curse years later published a book called poems of a jew that was when i was finally decolonized when i printed that book i was already american was as rootless as a texas millionaire with negro and indian blood in his veins when our literature got under way it began like a census to list our cultural deaths there was the grand gesture of whitman like a captain on the bridge waving goodbye to the past there was captain ahab hunting down the great white blood consciousness and sinking the ship of white civilization along with it there was huck finn who lit out for the wilderness running for his life like his author from respectability there followed that long recital of the failure of the american hero the epitaphs of spoon river and winesburg ohio the brutal caricatures of the american bourgeois the salesman the evangelist the politician the corruption of pioneer and settler by the rootless materialism of the new world hemingway assaults the virility of the american male faulkners vast gallery of southerners portrays the decline and fall of a world under a cursehe calls it rightly the curse of slavery of the heroes of the american novel only the artist is left unscathed he is ishmael in the cultural desert it is the motif of rootlessness that gives our literature its greatness to the outside world whatever the value of literary prizes consider the names of americans who have been awarded the nobel prize for literature eugene oneill pearl buck hemingway faulkner and steinbeck eliot i take it is not american these writers deal mainly with modern man in the void if they are part of what is called the western tradition they lie at the very edge of it each phase of american literature marks a further step away from that tradition as each colonial group in america finds its literary voice we are moved deeper into the void huckleberry finn ahab joe christmas herzog it hardly matters who the hero is he leads us on the search for his authenticity it is the unauthentic american artist who reaches back to the tradition the martinique writer and psychiatrist frantz fanon who died four years ago says in his book the wretched of the earth that when the african native begins to pull on his moorings and to cause anxiety to the settler he is handed over to wellmeaning souls who in cultural congresses point out to him the specificity and wealth of western values and he adds but every time western values are mentioned they produce in the native a sort of stiffening or muscular lockjaw the cultural conference or congress is a twentieth century institution which has never been looked at squarely i myself make it a point to avoid those conferences but i have attended enough of them here and abroad to know that they represent a more or less official machine dedicated to the status quo they seek to hold the line for traditional values for this reason the culture conference is supported by governments by foundations and by writers and artists who have a stake in the tradition the culture conference is opposed to decolonization at least the decolonization of culture the hidden premise on which it operates is the superiority of european culture it must therefore work hard to reconvert the native and bring him back to a sense of cultural inferiority i attended once one of these conferences in tokyo where it was agreed beforehand that politics could not be discussed here were a multitude of writers from all the world among them some of the most famous and some of the most political who voluntarily emasculated all discussion at the outset instead they talked about the art of translation and had a similar experience last summer a group called the congress for cultural freedom was to meet in west berlin to honor poets from the new african nations i was invited to speak on the first day along with a negro poet whose language was french and a negro poet whose language was english that is they were colonials in the throes of decolonization evidently the berlin meetings were to restore the faith of the africans in european culture but why was i asked to open the meetings along with the african poets because i was an american jew supposedly assimilated into the american or as the conference perhaps thought western tradition intended to go having never been to germany or having met poets of africa immediately upon my acceptance however i received a letter from a french writer in charge of the affair who began to caution me what to say and what not to say that struck me as a bit odd coming from an official of an organization that used the word freedom in its name nor would he be specific in one letter he would flatter me by saying that he knew i was a great fighter or words to that effect and in the next he would indicate that the meetings must be kept friendly i was never more puzzled in my life nor more offended our correspondence went on all summer ending in a flurry of cablegrams in which i finally declined to come to berlin if were to be gagged and what was it the congress of cultural freedom which was entertaining poets from the new africa refused to have discussed the race question had i been a believer in the tradition and its values i might have served the congress well might have told how a jewish poet born in america made a rapproachement with the tradition but i have never made such a rapproachement they had invited the wrong man as tennyson said about the charge of the light brigade someone had blundered is negro literature possible a few years ago one could ask in all seriousness is a negro literature possible in america the question implied a negative i am among those who felt that the negro had nothing to gain by becoming literary that he had nothing to say according to the tradition of letters as we know that tradition he could only create a pseudoliterature the novel and poem according to uncle tom we had seen this happen with paul laurence dunbar and the early slave poets between a transliterated negro dialect itself a phony dialect and oxjord book english there seemed no choice if there were to be an authentic negro medium where would it come from obviously it could not come from the standard classics of american literature poetry or prose perhaps something could rise from the church spiritual a form of poetry which worked upon secret levels of meaning or more likely from the blues but almost nothing of the sort appeared to be happening a literature is not created in a vacuum it is created out of love for its medium could and should the negro love the angloamerican language or was it possible that he had his own version of it as the jewish writer had his version but a literature is more than a version of language a novel or poem is more than a work of art literature is an accurate transcription of the quality of thought and feeling of the writer and his people what audience would such a literature have if any was there a negro audience to read native son or invisible man or tolsons libretto one suspected there wasnt that such works would be for a small white or mixed audience the publication of native son was a great shock to the white reader not only because of what it said but because a negro had written it negroes didnt produce works of that calibre nor did they read them literature so the mythos went wus white mans business even the books by richard wright were in the white tradition his audience was the traditional audience as were the values implicit in the work ellisons invisible man which i wrote about elsewhere as the great american novel is a masterpiece but again in the white tradition ellison might even be called a white negro neither what he says or how he says it is without precedent in the general literary consciousness like wright he corroborates the white liberals worst fears like wright he illuminates the guilt of the settler visavis a native in fact it seems to me that there is more negritude if i may use the word in faulkner than in either wright or ellison faulkner is better able to present the sensibility of the negro albeit the mississippi negro because faulkners characters are not always at the point of dramatic crisis what wright and ellison proved was that the negro can write a novel as good as a white novel as good as anything in the tradition but this obviously was not enough especially as the tradition was beginning to come apart at the seams for a negro literature to come into being it had to start from the bottom not from the top all great poetry comes from the bottom homer dante chaucer whitman all went to the language of the street for their great poems a negro poetess could prove that she could win the pulitzer prize but nobody has been able to prove that the pulitzer prize is worth winning embracing the art of writing at some time in its career a people makes a decision to embrace the art of writing it has no obligation to at any time the jews produced virtually no literature after the old testament except commentaries the jews were in a state of cultural withdrawal all during the diaspora scholars will disagree but cannot convince me that the jews produced any literature or art or music worth mentioning until the great revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries freed the jew from cultural bondagelt is in our century that the jew has suddenly begun to sing and paint and write for this is the century of cultural liberation all over the world ours is one of the greatest periods of art in history and it is great insofar as we have broken with the tradition to break with the tradition does not mean to annihilate it it means to place new values upon it it means to pick up the pieces and maybe throw them down again malraux means this when he says about the greatness of modern art the fragment is king negro literature in america had to begin with the fragment not with the whole form having proved out of pride that it could handle the w hole form like wright or ellison or gwendolyn brooks or langston hughes it must then throw down the formsfrom the top of the empire state building i think that is what baldwin is doing critics say what a shame that baldwin should give up the novel for the polemic and the pamphlet i dont think that is any of our business what if the novel has proved unsatisfactory to him what if the poem has proved the same arent all the great examples of art and literature of our time antiart the greatness as well as the horror of the twentieth century is that it is a last judgment it is a time when every value is called into question everywhere and on every level of the human experience it is the genius of our age to question the racial revolutions of our age are more effects than causes they are the result of universal indignation over the failures of our culture one country famed for its music and its philosophers tried to destroy a whole nation in its midst by murder another country famed for poetry discovered that it held a large part of the world in virtual slavery another country famed for its sense of liberty and its adoration of the arts suddenly collapsed from internal weakness and corruption these were all european countries of great antiquity in the east rose a superpolice state with a paranoid belief in its historical destiny in america we assembled and exploded the ultimate weapon the generation that inherited these acts of the immediate past was catatonic people referred to them as the silent generation and they were ten years ago i went to the campus at berkeley california to teach one of the professors in my department cautioned me that it was hard to do any work there it was a lotus land and so it was not only the faculty but the students were somnambulists then a young man across the bay in san francisco published a poem which was heard round the world it was scream of anguish it was obscene and american and innocent aggressive and angry it was the first shot in the new revolution of the word and it was a signal for a general awakening of the consciousness of a new generation a generation got out of its convertibles and went on the picket line i dont think this an exaggeration about allen ginsbergs howl it was a poem that flatly refused to accept the premises about decorumliterary political racial cultural it was a poem of refusal and of absolute commitment a san francisco earthquake in the rhythm of leaves of grass the defenders of the tradition the cemeterykeepers hurried to defend their cemeteries they brought up their heavy artillery but it didnt matter almost simultaneously the civil_rights movement appeared on the horizon the two things are related one forbidden book after another some of the great classics of our age passed through the courts victoriously and so forth and so on up to the present free speech movement which is shaking educational institutions to their foundations for many years i have been trying to loosen the hold of the academic or colonial mind over poetry not only poetry but the entire literature of reference the kind that refers back in every case to prior commitments historical religious or philosophical in a sense it is a useless battle attacking the establishment only tends to strengthen it it would be better to ignore the existence of the literature of reference and to create whatever we think valid than to go on tilting at windmills this is what the beat writers did they were successful because they refused to take part in the academic dialogue if someone asked one of the usual deathly questions such as what is the role of the artist in the modern world they would be likely to answer something like fried shoes refusal to play the game kept them safe refusal to play the game won freedom for india and is winning freedom for the american south refusal to play the game will turn the dehumanized multiversity back into a place of learning the importance of the negro writer in the world today is far out of proportion to the number of books we have to go by but the significance of negro writing today is paramount because everywhere not simply in america the negro is in the position to ask the questions the hyphenated jewish writer is no more time has solved that problem the jewish writer is either assimilated into the modern bourgeois world with all its neuroses or he is a settler in the biblical land carrying on skirmishes against the philistines or the egyptians as in the days of old a few american jews try to keep alive the mystique of the diaspora but with little success most modern jews themselves reject the myth of the dispersion for our time they go to israel and have a look and then hurry back to detroit or omaha today the american negro faces the same dilemma richard wright baldwin tolson know that mother africa is not for them and the africans know it too everywhere decolonization is taking place we find the disappointment of the visitor who feels rejected from his dream but this is part of the awakening part of the process of freedom itself if the african looks down on the american negro he has earned that right if the afroamerican feels out of place in nigeria or even liberia he knows at last the limits of his dream we can witness at the moment three phases of decolonization in our culture nostalgia assimilation and negritude nostalgia is homesickness not for the good old days but for the bad old days assimilation means a cultural entente at the expense of any mystique negritude means assertion of the realities historical and mystical as well the early literature of america all of it is nostalgic for the worst it is as true of anne bradstreet as for phillis wheatley and in fact the masses of people at any time fear the heavy responsibilities of freedom and pine for the bad old days when all choices were made for them to not have to choose is a freedomthe freedom of the slave the negro poets who cultivated a slave dialect were in fact in accord with their condition they consented to the cultural authority of the whiteprosody as the white colonials acceded to the cultural authority of the old world the nostalgia of assimilation but assimilation too is nostalgic it was often said of german jews before hitler that they were more german than the germanswhich didnt stop hitler from rooting them out the nostalgia of the american jewish writer who is assimilated into american literature is curious i was talking with a famous american writer who had made jewishness the theme in his books speaking of the new jews the israelis he said but they arent jews anymore i agreed those new jews had lost their consciousness of the diaspora they had fought their way back into the mythical homeland and were lost to the old jewry but cultural assimilation of jews into american life was relatively easy and has all but been accomplished a jew has not the problem of the hindu the oriental or the negro the jew looks more or less american anywhere he goes even his name is not held against him as it once was but cultural assimilation alo means national oblivion for the nation assimilated one can only pretend to act like a jew the writer and artist can do this easily because that is his business the american jew of average sensibility on the other hand experiences the common cultural amnesia of americans of any extraction while the american jewish figure in fiction has a cultural nervous breakdown over american twentieth century values he longs for the bad old days when his father was a bootlegger or a peddler because he was suffering the crucifixion of the culturally underprivileged the father would do anything to keep his family jews to turn them into doctors and lawyers or rich merchants with economic freedom they could then be jews only it didnt work that way for jewishness meant suffering and an unsuffering jew was an anomaly an unsuffering jew is a goy hence the nostalgia of the assimilated the negro is luckier he can never disappear from his condition in the caucasian world any more than a hindu or a japanese there he is unassimilable and unnostalgic the biggest fact of life in the modern world the ideal of negritude j our century is very great because with us all the chickens have come to roost because great men of goodwill statesmen presidents leaders of men artists and young people have demanded the exaction of promises made to nations by visionaries and the spokesmen of freedom this is happening under our eyes we are all a party to it nostalgia is obsolete assimilation may well be neither is of vital importance i prefer the idea of negritude at least it is the first great idea or concept that can deal with the biggest fact of modern life without trying to water it down i will give three examples aime cesaire leopold senghor and m b tolson cesaire is a caribbean senghor is a senegalese and tolson was born in missouri the first two use french for poetry tolson uses english or american my designation of tolsons language is that he writes in negro or rather all three of these great poets write in negro that is what negritude means in literature it does not mean accommodation to the standards of the settler or to his nostalgia for the mother or father country it does not mean making peace through disappearance into the scene nor as senghor has shown so nobly in his political writings does it mean war it means insistence on the pride of selfhood without hatred no oppressed people in history has had less sense of revenge than the negro retribution is not negro negritude is simply decolonization under the positive aspect senghor has no grudge against the tradition as l do or against modern technology on the contrary he welcomes everything which will make possible the greater harmony among men this is the wisdom of the french in the decolonized man the daring of the french to push an idea into action as far as it will go there are i believe no african poets of the english language of his stature the english are still the heirs of apartheid cesaires discovery of negritudehe is pinned as the inventor of the nameis that of the disaffected assimilationist the parisian from the colonies who became a marxist and by nomination a surrealist even though surrealism is taboo among communists surrealism is a luxury of the white civilization a toy of people who can afford unconciousness it is also a desperate attempt to rejoin civilized brilliance with a raison detre surrealism is an adrenaline shot in the heart under superb cultural conditions it revives a culture which does not really want to live cesaire as i understand it did not rise to the bait when andre breton elected him to the surrealist school i am not criticizing surrealism which is of fundamental value in all modern arts i am pointing out the naivete of the french in enlisting colonials in esthetic causes which were far from the realities of the african or the american negro negritude in the famous poem cahier dun retour au pays natale memorandum on my martinique is one translationnegritude is the realization of pity for the modern world with its great inventions and its great alibis it shouts hurrah not for the steel blue speed of the modern but for those who have never invented anything hurrah for those who never invented anything hurrah for those who never explored anything hurrah for those who never conquered anything i know of only one american poet who in genius and experience even approaches the concept m b tolson and tolson knows that the concept is different with us in american culture according to the groundrules there can be no separatism even by race and color what then is there a long road of assimilation and miscegenation ahead can there be an american negritude tolson is an american who is also the poet laureate of liberia he lives in oklahoma in an allnegro town where he was once mayor he is sixtyfiveyears old in various capacities as editor i have published more poetry by him than anyone in america he has a superb reputation among poets and critics but is unknown to students and to the general reading public this is not because he is difficult to read which he is for difficulty of text is the stockintrade of the poetryteaching professiontolson is not read because he is a negro a blind spot in the white literary eye will not recognize a great negro poet the white professional mind thinks that poetry is written by englishmen or their descendants and imitators tate looks at tolson to complicate matters tolsons libretto for the republic of liberia commissioned by the first african republic has in its american publication an introduction by allen tate mr tate is a confederate of the old school who has no use for negroes but who will salute an exception to the race he sees tolson as an exception because for the first time a negro poet has assimilated completely the poetic language of his time and by implication the language of the angloamerican tradition mr tate invites mr tolson to join his country club tate is one of the canniest critics in the business the american t s eliot as it were but the crux of the matter is that tate says the distinguishing negro quality is not in the language but in the subjectmatter for subjectmatter can only deal with ones suffering and contaminate the beauty of poetry i have tried to correct this statement in my own introduction to tolsons recently published harlem gallery tate considers that the use of negro subjectmatter in poetry which he calls the tragic aggressiveness of the modern poet limits the negro poet to a provincial mediocrity i will not trouble you with my opinion of the modern classicism which mr tate represents have written more than one book about it except to point out that this powerful critic does not consider the theme of negro suffering good enough for the art of poetry just as though the theme of america was not a good enough theme for the poet hart crane but in trying to assert that tolson has been assimilated by the angloamerican tradition he puts tolson in quarantine and destroys the value of the poempossibly this critics conscious intention thus it took a southern intellectual and poet an antinegro poet to introduce tolsons libretto that was the only possible literary context for a great negro poet ten or fifteen years ago he must in that context be captured and returned to colonization to that tradition which had enslaved his ancestors and would continue to do so if it could manage it the refusal to see that tolsons significance lies in his language negro and that only that language can express the poetic sensibility of the negro at the door of freedom is a final desperate maneuver to contain the negro within the traditional culture and for that it is too late the tradition is already antebellum the falsification i speak of is that of trying to assimilate tolson into the tradition when he was doing the opposite the fact that tolsons libretto is unknown by white traditionalists gives the lie to the critics assertion that tolson has risen above negro experience to become an artist the facts are that tolson is a dedicated revolutionist who revolutionizes modern poetry in a language of american negritude the forms of the libretto and of harlem gallery far from being traditional are the negro satire upon the poetic tradition of the eliots and tates the tradition cannot stand being satirized and lampooned and so tries to kick an authetic poet upstairs into the oblivion of acceptance but the negro artist wont stay in the attic anymore than he stayed in the cellar i was less than enthusiastic about spending the summer back home in gravesville alabama after my perfectly marvelous freshman year at columbia u i felt that there was a great injustice here i had friends going to south america europe and god knows where all else and there i was in young healthy and alive with nowhere to go but gravesville maybe it was my boredom that led me to do what i did exactly when this crazy thought first entered my mind i cant really remember but i believe it started one evening in june about eight oclock i was glancing over the ladies home journal when a young woman about years old burst into the house and announced lord somebody done stole my husband like everyone else present thought she meant that the man had been purloined however she clarified the matter by adding that lowdown levi stole him in the left side my uncle who then immediately understood that her husband had been shot without being given a fair chance to defend himself proceeded to call a doctor as she related the tale to us and to half the neighborhood who had followed her in hungrily seeking details i stared at her she was only seven years older than i but she looked much older early marriage just ruins a woman then that neighborhood she lives in its just around the corner from us but there is a world of difference i asn sure you do you think i would be seen on the public streets in an old faded cotton dress like that and those dirty socks and rundown loafers sucre bleu charlie mae the young woman with the stolen husband was a high school graduate and typical of what kelley street colored high turned out that was my school too but i dont mind saying that i was the exception there rather than the rule i lay awake half the night that night and many nights that followed trying to decide what i could do to improve the socioeconomic status of the negroes of my hometown i ate breakfast that wednesday morning about seven oclock it was a very satisfying breakfast grandma could make pancakes that would make you love your motherinlaw i could hear the sound of leather striking human flesh and the scream mama i aint goin do it no mo from next door about the time that an elderly woman a friend of my grandmother came in in a dress that almost reached her ankles and a scarf or rather in the vernacular a head rag tied around her head miss arlethia walked slowly and with a limp it was not a bit unusual that she should just walk in this way everybody did the door stayed open until oclock at night when we all went to bed this is partially attributable to the fact that we owned the only telephone in the neighborhood and the entire community used it lord ha mercy this mus be the baby she acknowledged upon seeing me honey dont these chillun grow why i remember when this chile was bon the conversation continued along this vein as finished the dishes then went out on the front porch and sat in the front porch swing wonder what alex my sophisticated boy friend from chicago would think if he could see this place i laughed to myself at the notiona committee of unwashed juveniles approached me from the street is there any haints in that ol house on cooper street the spokesman wanted to know you mean are there any i started was going to give her a better sentence for the same question but i didnt know quite what to do with that word haints if i said supernatural beings i was certain she would not know what i meant there is no such thing as a haint stated yeah it is the one in the patched shorts protested my daddy says it is are you sure your daddy said this yeah he say one night a big green haint wid long purple fingernails come out of that house and chase him all the way home ooowee the others exclaimed they jumped off the side of the porch and ran off to a game of grandma gray can i go out to play which was just as well because there was no point in arguing with a testimonial like that segregation thats what caused all this segregation leads to inferior schools inferior schools lead to inferior education and inferior education invariably leads to ignorance and poverty besides just the year before the supreme court had ruled that there was no such thing as separate but equal why i bet these people never even heard of brown vs the topeka school board yes it was the handwriting on the wall gravesville alabama must be integrated if i could integrate gravesville it would be an example for the rest of the state alabama would then be an example for the south and i would be the liberator go down moses and tell ok pharaoh to let my people go now surely the town officials around here are not beyond reason after all they are supposed to be the most intelligent people in gravesville i went to the booker t washington branch of the library and requested that some books giving statistical data about gravesville be brought from the main library which citizens of color were not allowed to use i stayed up nights preparing information that no one could argue with showing that economically segregation was ruining the south integration was the only thing that could save us and gravesville would lead the way excitement bubbled in me during those days like hot custard on thanksgiving eve by independence day i had completed my report but i decided to save it until after the fourth i told no one they wouldnt understand besides these uncle toms didnt know what was good for them about the sixth of july i tried to get permission to see the mayor and got nowhere fast this was a great disappointment it ruined my entire plan but as my grandfather would say there are more ways to kill a cat than choking him to death on hot butter i placed the papers in a manila envelope and mailed them to the mayor who returned them within a week without so much as a comment what would moses have done if he had this sort of problem with of pharaoh i remembered that knew mrs ruby lee gibbs who was mayor dewberrys maid went over to try to persuade mrs gibbs to let me work in her place for one day in fact i begged desperately the speech i gave that woman would have made daniel webster sound like a prep school debator after making promises to her among them that i would let her have the money i made i talked her into it i donned the uniform which was too large and papers in hand went to work i fixed mr dewberrys breakfast and was pouring his second cup of coffee when he realized that i was not mrs gibbs wheres ruby lee he wanted to know she is ill i shall be executing her duties while she convalesces i said giving him the statement that i had prepared for the occasion oh he said and went back to his newspaper i decided to wait until he got home that evening as he evidently was not the most pleasant of men when he got up in the morning besides this would give me the time i needed to prepare the day passed quickly in the old antebellum mansion dewberry came in for dinner about five oclock he saw me pretty much as part of the furniture as i served the evening meal when i had cleaned the kitchen i came into the den and made a request i would like a few moments audience with you please i realize this was a little formal but for gods sake the white people around here already think were all semiilliterate what is it he asked really looking at me for the first time well i have some papers here hey you going to be working here regularly honey honey now i was really set aback what did this fat middleaged halfbald white man mean about the papers he said if youre in some kind of trouble sure i can do you a favor if youre willing to do me one i didnt like the implication here at all you dirty old man i screamed and with the papers still in my hand i ran out the door and all the way to the bus stop when i got on the bus i sat in the last seat this was contrary to my purpose but hell i was tired i could start fighting segregation again in the morning as i lay in my bed that night still shaking at the thought of that tobacco stained old clayeater i considered the possibility that i was going at this whole thing from the wrong angle this is still a democracy and the will of the people is still supreme while the population of gravesville is of course predominately white we have more than the usual percentage of negroes found in a small southern town if we demanded our rights we would be bound to be heard who knows it might be easier than one would imagine tomorrow i would go visiting after breakfast i kissed grandma on the cheek told her i had some business to take care of and hurried out the door before she could ask questions i would start with the people most affected by segregation and show them that there was something better to be had i would go to the pockets of degradation and poverty such neighborhoods are easily recognized for every woman you see will be pregnant carrying a baby or both the place i selected was called thirty row thirty row was an unpaved community of thirty cracker box houses most of the window panes had been shot out or rocked in saturday night brawls and were replaced by pieces of cardboard everything on thirty row the people included was filthy beyond description any and all vegetation had long since been trampled down by the herd of little tshirted barefoot black humanity which conducted a neverending stampede across what might have been lawns at the first house i was greeted by a crude but friendly woman who invited me in after i introduced myself the room where she bade me have a seat seemingly served as living room dining room kitchen and at night bedroom i would not have been entirely surprised to have seen a toilet over in the corner as i talked to her she finished her breakfast of cold margarine mashed into alaga syrup and sopped with bread i wanted to create a pleasant atmosphere how is your family i asked jesse thats my husband well jessie been laid off from his job but he been doing yard work for some white folks til they takes him on agin the chillun is all right my lilest he was all stove up wid a col las week but i grez him good wid vics salve and he a whole lot better now good i smiled and wondered what the people who so painstakingly labeled the product vics vaporub would think if they knew that in certain circles it was known as vics salve tell me what do you think of the idea of your children going to school with the white children i asked lawd no they don wont our chillun goin to school wid thim of course it will take a little time for them to get used to the idea i explained no we ain spose to be goin to no school together miz rosemary green thats the lady i works for she say if the chillun start goin to school together theres gonna be mixin of the races then after a while everybody would be colored and if god had wanted us all one color he woulda made us that way the reasoning here more than slightly astounded me however i found myself incapable of producing a successful rebuttal i keeps miz greens il girl for her she went on and miz green say she trus me wid lil alabam jus like she trus husef but she jus don blieve in no mixin of the races you mustnt be persuaded by what others think i argued but alas in vain i left there and tried another house with similar results after a third try proved unsuccessful i decided maybe i was working with the wrong income bracket the next day i visited a few members of the if youll pardon the expression black bourgeoisie typical of the reactions i got was i know how you feel child but i just cant afford to start any mess with these white people my husband would lose his job and wed have the ku klux klan breathing down our necks on top of it we have three little children and we just cant afford to get involved i meditated on the whole thing for about three days it was now beginning to irritate me like a rash something had to be done why i had never conceived of such complacency and apathy i was ready now to lay my all on the altar as much as i hated to do it it looked like a civil_rights march was the only alternative i needed help not necessarily intelligent people just warm bodies to carry picket signs the next day i managed to talk some of our less intelligent high school students into helping me they didnt understand what this was all about but they loved getting something and they didnt seem to be scared of the proverbial redheaded devil i made and distributed picket signs after i finally impressed upon them that the idea was to walk up and down with the signs we began our demonstration in front of city hall we were viewed curiously by passersby for about fifteen minutes when i observed a number of police cars stopping nearby when the policemen came out and approached me i was ready to announce that we would stand our ground it was then that i noticed that it was no longer we but the rest had fled at sight of the police cars i was arrested and taken to jail where i demanded a writ of habeas corpus after the chief asked habeas who i decided the notion was best abandoned my uncle came down and after some tall talking persuaded them to let me gohe drove me home and then raised whitehot hell just exactly what in the devil did you think you were doing i explained just exactly what in the devil i thought i was doing after a twohour lecture he told me that he had promised to be personally responsible for seeing that the incident was not repeated for the rest of the summer i had to give an account every time i left the house the month of august passed quietly i spent it reading and knitting occasionally people would come in and pump my grandmother for the details of my arrest i had the distinction of being the familys only criminal rumor has it that my greatgrandfather had a brother who was hanged for being a horse thief but i dont know i felt very relieved as i sat on the new yorkbound train and watched the world speed past in the opposite direction the summer was behind me and my sophomore year at columbia was ahead of me sophomorethat comes from two latin words sophos meaning wise and mows meaning fool well i dont know about the sophos part but have certainly proven myself to be as big a mows as ever drew breath looked up and there she was the great city of new york we reached the station i stepped off the train and back into my world i remember thinking that i had never seen such a poorly child as ella mae the first time i laid eyes on her jim paul thats my man brought her in the cabin one night and said pearlie mae joe stevens fell in his well and drownded ella sue she was joes woman must have tried to get him out cause she drownded too they aint nobody over there to care for this youngun so i fetched it home i guess well have to keep it until we find somebody to raise it jim paul i said how you expect me to care for this youngun our own minnie belle aint but three weeks old i cant do for two babies neither one of em crawlin yet all jim paul said was somebodys got to do for it and were the only folk anyways close around here besides thats joe stevens youngun and joe saved my life onct im going over and do whats to be done for joe and ella sue most likely some of ella sues people will come to take the youngun in a day or so anvhow then he left well ella maecourse that wasnt her name then we give that to her laterwas just eight or nine days old and like i said i aint never seen a sicklier lookin baby jim paul said it looked to him like joe and ella sue must of drowndd sometime the night before and the youngun hadnt been fed or cleaned up since then i cleaned ella mae up and when i put her in the water she let out such a whoop i knowed right off that other than bein hungry and scared nigh to death they wasnt nothin wrong with her it was just about time for me to feed minnie belle and she let the whole world know it well to tell the truth i felt kinda queer about feeding ella mae she bein such a funny looking thing but i put minnie belle to one tittiei know it maybe aint nice to say such things but i always have been plain spokenand ella mae to the other one i never did have no shortage of milk that ella mae like i said before her folks must have died sometime the night before and she hadnt been fed since she really went to town when she finished she give me such a smile that got all quivery inside well you can ask any woman and shell tell you it takes a plumb unnatural female not to love a youngun onct shes nursed it i knowed right then that if joes peoplerather ella sues people didnt come for her real soon she was going to be mighty hard to give up it was late when jim paul got back and even though he didnt say muchjim paul never was one for too much talki knowed he was i taking it real hard jim paul and joe had growed up together hunted and fished together and gone to the army together neither one of em talked much about it but somehow or other joe had saved jim pauls life over in korea and jim paul wasnt the kind to forget something like that finally jim paul came to bed he told me i took joe and ella sue down the mountain to percy browns undertaking parlor he said hed try to get in touch with ella sues people if he could you know this mountain aint goin to seem right without joe on it me and him been through a whole lot together why we growed up together havin joe moren made up for me not havin a brother of my own im sure gonna miss that boy i got up to look at the babies and what i saw made me call jim paul to look too they was layin there in the cradlejim pauls greatgreatgrandaddy had made it hisself an it was plenty big enough for the both of eman they looked so pretty an peaceful laying there just like two angels they looked standin there an lookin at em made me go warm and fluttery all over jim paul stood there lookin at em and he put his arm around me i looked up at his face and i could see tears shinin in his eves i aint never seen jim paul cry but he was mighty close to it then they was one other time i saw him close to cryin but they was different tears ill tell you about that when i come to it anyway jim paul was stand in there with his eyes all shiny and i could feel where he had his arm around me that he was all trembly i heard him say kinda to himself like joe i promise they buried joe and ella sue three days later we went i was holdin minnie belle and joe had ella mae it was real sad at the bury in ella sue an joe were so young an things was lookin so promisin for em it was sad but beautiful in a way im just an ignorant hill womani didnt have too much schoolinso i cant say in pretty words what i mean but if you could of seen jim paul standin there with ella mae in his arms and her just layin there so peaceful and safe youd know what mean by sayin it was beautiful too well they never did find any of ella sues people and all joes kinfolk had been dead for a long time didnt nobody even know where ella came from joe went off one timehe never did say where and when he come back ella sue was with him they kept pretty much to themselves except for us an of course wed never ask about anything they didnt mention themselfs ella mae was a real comfort to us and since the good lord didnt see fit to bless us with any more younguns she was company for minnie belle you know how lonesome it can be on a mountain minnie belle an ella mae was just like twins them bein just a week or so apart they was crazy about one another right from the start i mean it why if one of em was hurt both of em ud cry time went on and we was all doin fine we aint never gonna be richthe lands hard up here on the mountainbut we aint never been hungry neither everything was fine until one day a man come to the house a city man he was wantin to take ella mae away he said something about it bein for her own good i bolted i ran out in the field where jim paul was work in and told him i said it would be like losin my own flesh and blood if anybody took ella mae away i never will forget the way jim paul looked when i told him he gritted his teeth and stood there for a while not sayin anything then he spoke aint nobody goin take ella mae nor minnie belle away from us not while draw breath joe meant for this mountain to be home for ella mae and by god so do i besides promised joe id look after her jim paul talked real polite to the stranger when we got back to the house but could tell he had his stubborn up i guess the stranger could too jim paul stood there his eyes flashin and told him mister i reckon you mean well otherwise id run you off this land right now aint nobody takin ella mae nowhere this is her home if she wants to leave when she gets growed up thats her business but til then this is her home the man looked right funny like hed swallowed something that didnt want to go down but he left it didnt seem like no time at all before they was ready to start to school and that was the other time i saw jim paul almost cry it was just last week but it seems like it was a long time ago some of the folks down in the valley got talkin and they wanted to send ella mae to school in the next county well aint never seen jim paul that mad he turned plumb white and was tremblin like a leaf in a high wind we all got in the truck me and him and minnie belle and ella mae and drove down to the schoolhouse jim paul had throwed his rifle in the back of the truck when we started off and i dont mind tellin you was scared i knowed if he got mad enough jim paul would use that rifle and it aint often he misses what he shoots at we pulled up in front of the school and marched up the steps down the hall and in the principals office jim paul had left the rifle in the truck so i felt some easier we stood there in front of the principal all four of us and when jim paul got to talking i was so proud of him my heart like to busted he told that principal mr jones i hear theres talk of sendin ella mae to school somewhere else well i pay my taxes regular and in this county and us mayberrys been payin taxes in this county ever since they been havin em why my daddy helped build this school and both my girls are gonna go to this school or else aint nobody gonna go well that principal he hemmed and he hawed but jim paul he wouldnt budge finally the principal he seen it wasnt no use so he told us hed talk it over with the school board and let us know we went on home and the next day a man came to the house and said it was all right ella mae and minnie bell could both come to the school they been goin ever since there come jim paul and the girls up the path now thats ella mae in the yellow dress and minnie belles got on the red one they go with jim paul every evenin and put flowers on joe and ella sues grave just as long as theres any kind of flower growin jim paul made em bury joe and ella sue up here on the mountain cause its so far to the colored buryin ground
one of the wisest people i ever knew once said to me if you care at all about living in this world you must also re enough to help save it from its own wilderness get those words i shall never forspoken by my mother as we sat watching an oklahoma sunset more than thirty years ago it was just before i returned to college for my final year and it seemed to me that she was giving me my own special commencement address albeit a bit prematurely the words she used in bestowing her benediction on me reflected her own experience in the early days of oklahoma when as a teacher in the indian territory she had witnessed one of this nations last battles against a wilderness frontier although her language was evocative of the continuing american struggle to beat back the wilderness and to plant a civilization we both knew that she had something else in mind she was in fact talking of the responsibility of every human being to venture toward new wildernesses toward new frontiersand to help create there a new meaningful pattern of life this would in turn help solve some of the problems that perennially seemed to engulf the world the context in was the worldwide depression the darkening shadows of the barbarism of nazism and the ugly conduct of the american racists who had snatched a negro youth from our college campus the previous spring and lynched him the problems were old only the setting was new a generation has come and gone a great and tragic world war has been fought a score of new nations have emerged new wildernesses have been discovered and conquered we have entered an exciting frightening nuclearspace age the power of man either to destroy his world or to transform it into a material paradise has multiplied enormously one need not be ashamed to admit that it is a rare and wonderful privilege to be able to witness the marvels of this age even the least observant among us has seen a dozen miracles that would eclipse the ingenuity of a leonardo da vinci or strain the credulity of a jules verne the more naive among us can say with alexander the great that there are no more worlds to conquer or with frederick jackson turner that the frontier is indeed closed but the changes of the last generation however dramatic and worldshaking have neither eliminated all the frontiers nor saved the world from its own wildernesses the rivalry among the nuclear powers has created a new wilderness while the new means of automation have had in some quarters a chilling and depressing effect this is not to say that we have made no progress in the art of utilizing our resources in the fundamental task of creating a peaceful world this is not to say that we have not made a start toward creating a society in which the fundamentals of decency in human relations might be observed but the progress has been minimal and the frontiers beckoning our discovery and assiduous efforts are numerous as a people and as a nation we have been attracted through the years toward what can be called frontiers of freedom the earliest settlers sought religious and economic freedom the founding fathers fought for political freedom certain basic freedoms in the form of the bill of rights were early written into our constitution at times we sought to justify our expansionist policies on the rather shaky ground that we were seeking to extend the area of freedom now and then some americansall too frequently a courageous minority have spoken and worked for complete human freedom these stands for freedom going far back into our history suggest that as the peoples of the world seek a better order we in this country have some qualifications for taking the lead in seeking out new frontiers of freedom and doing battle against the wildernesses that surround them up to this point in our development however we can claim more credit for eloquence than for precision of concepts more credit for zeal than for its effective and purposeful use almost two centuries ago we declared that all men were created equal but the concept of equality did not extend to everyone from that day to this we have experienced the greatest difficulties conceivable in attempting to establish a society characterized by real equality and real freedom ttiis is because of that early faltering when we showed so little understanding of the meaning and dimensions of freedom it is remarkable how in the name of freedom we fought so valiantly for our political independence and at the same time renounced the one great opportunity to show that we were committed to human freedom it is worth noting that one of our most vigorous thrusts toward equality was jacksonian democracy but this great upsurge of the common man did not even address itself to the most vital challenge that democracy was facingthe challenge of slavery a generation later universal suffrage seemed to be at hand but new and ingenious devices were invented to exclude millions from that high privilege and so the opportunity for real equality and real freedom to become the central feature of american life and institutions got lost in a maze of racism that in turn created a veritable wilderness if that wilderness was to be won for freedom it would require courage and resourcefulness to say the least the curious thing is that as a people and as a nation we have taken pride in our advocacy of freedom even when our actions have betrayed an ambivalence that was as full of wonder as it was lacking in merit for centuries not a sufficient number appreciated the violence that this ambivalence was doing to the nature and character of our society to do anything about it instead with a pride that was somewhat vainglorious if not altogether false we began to proclaim to the world that our social order had achieved a perfection that commended itself to the entire world with a perfect society or one that was nearly perfect americans saw no reason why they should not share their blessings with others lacking the capacity to criticize the imperfections of their own society they became its evangels proclaiming freedom and democracy for all the peoples of the world thus in recent years we have been engaged in a gigantic task of extending what we call the area of freedom we have done this by providing billions of dollars worth of military technical and economic aid to many nations of the world in our moments of charity we call them the underdeveloped nations in our moments of reverie we call them the freedomloving peoples last week i returned from another visit to some of the nations that are the objects of our concern on the basis of my quite inconclusive observations and conversations i am not persuaded that they are either underdeveloped or freedomloving in the sense that we use those words to be sure many of them lack scientific and technical skills but their leaders are wise in the ways of the world and are as sophisticated and cunning as our most wily political masters their peoples may not be free in our sense of the term and they might even be freedomloving but their aspirations to freedom bear little if any relationship to our own as often as not they want to be free of any influence or domination including that of the united states they want to be free to make the critical decisionseven if they are wrong decisionsabout their own future they want no neatly wrapped packages proffered to them by us or someone else they want to be free to select the things that appeal to them and reject those that do not a few days ago the minister of education in a middle east country sought to explain this stance to me having spent some time in the united states he drew his illustration from american higher education we are like your undergraduate student when he begins to make out his program of courses the minister said he has some freedom of choice on the basis of his background tastes and interests he takes certain electives we must have at least that much freedom in making the choices before us the analogy is not very strained and on many an occasion we as a nation have watched with the greatest interest and anxiety as people like the ministermake their choices if they do not choose as we had hoped we are inclined to fret and to wonder if they really did have freedom of choice in our moment of pique we fail to ask ourselves such important questions as were we offering the kind of aid the kind of values the kind of institutions that had meaning and substance for the prospective recipients what kind of quid pro quo was involved in the offer if there was one did it involve demands that left little if any free choice we see then that in two vastly different areas of activity a great and resourceful country like ours has real difficulty in discovering those frontiers on which to carry on an effective battle for the freedom of mankind at home our early inconsistencies and our unwillingness to establish and maintain a concept of universal freedom did much to create a wilderness on that allimportant frontier of freedom in our dealings with other peoples our inability to see the ideal of freedom in their own frames of reference has created problems that remain unsolved despite our vigorous efforts to cope with them it is for these reasons that it seems to me we should seek new approaches new frontiers on which to establish and maintain not only the ideal but the practice of freedom it is by no means easy to seek out new frontiers and pursue them but we should care enough about our future and the future of our world to make the attempt it hardly seems necessary to observe that for several centuries our search for such frontiers has been negligible or halfhearted during those years we defined freedom in rather narrow terms two centuries ago religious freedom meant that the puritans could worship god as they pleased but not the quakers a century ago real human freedom was for whites but not for negroes privilege was for gentiles but not for jews the same has been true in our dealings with other peoples we have managed somehow to convince ourselves that other peoples become free when they accept our way of looking at things or even our leadership as well as our material aid we have convinced ourselves for example that extraterritorial agreements and status of forces legislation required of other countries by us do not challenge the integrity of the peoples whose freedom we supposedly champion and our soldiers technicians and advisers deployed all over the world and enjoying special privileges of every conceivable kind simply do not convince their hosts that they are there to act as equal partners in a common enterprise implicit in our attitudes is not merely failure to appreciate the concept of equality in a common cause it also smacks of an ethnocentrism that fails utterly to comprehend the fact that fresh invigorating concepts of freedom can indeed come from other societies it implies certain basic reservations on our part regarding the place of equality and freedom in the lives of the peoples that make up those societies it also indicates a smugness and a certainty with regard to our own position that are not all justified in the light of our experience frankly i do not know what the longrange impact of our contact with other people will be and i doubt that anyone knows the task of transplanting into a quite different social order our own notions of freedom and equality and justice however estimable is staggering to contemplate the forces of resistance in the societies themselves and by others with different concepts and programs are powerful indeed and our own blurred concept of what freedom is and how it can be universally applied merely compounds the difficulties what we really need to do is to clarify our own view of the nature of freedom and to identify the new frontiers on which it can be applied if freedom is anything at all it is the opportunity to seek complete personal fulfillment so long as it does not deprive others of the same opportunity in this context public restrictions are minimal and personal responsibilities are maximal public or private actions or conspiracies to reduce the freedom of any person or group are socially irresponsible actions conversely the use of ones own freedom to advance the freedom of others is on the face of it socially responsible the extension of the principles and practices of freedom acknowledges a universal character that is the very hallmark of freedom there can be no double standards for freedom freedom cannot possibly mean on the one hand every opportunity for the enjoyment of privilege on park avenue and on the other the deliberate creation and maintenance of blight and poverty in harlem it cannot mean the grafting of american values through the preponderant american presence on the developing countries and at the same time showing an utter insensitivity to the values and aspirations of the developing countries themselves the commitment to one standard of freedom for one people or one place and another standard for others is itself a clear denial of free dom what we need to doindeed what we must doas socially responsible people is to seek new frontiers of freedom not merely for the sake of others but for ourselves as well we can begin by extending and enlarging the areas of freedom in the harlems across this nation if we do not know what our impact can be on the faraway frontiers we can be certain of our impact on the frontiers close at hand people on these local frontiers already have the same values the same aspirations and indeed their notions of freedom are a part of the same culture as the rest of the country we know from experience that whenever we have assured complete freedom to people in our midst the very recognition of their right to be free and equal has had a salutary effect on the growth and development of our social order yet in the face of this rich and positive experience we have failed to complete the task of eliminating the privation discrimination and the denial of equality that stalks our land it can be arguedindeed it has been arguedthat a commendable beginning has been made and that is indeed true but a beginning is not enough there is no legitimate halfway station between slavery and freedom george orwell has suggested the absurdity of trying to make a valid distinction among wouldbe equals and there is the same absurdity if we should seek to make invidious distinctions among those who would be free we who have a sense of responsibility in the search for new frontiers of freedom must therefore become totally and unequivocally committed to total freedom and the best place to begin is here and now in this community if we accept this responsibility acknowledge the fact that any freedom worth cherishing must be universal and work diligently to destroy inequality discrimination and segregation in our own communities we shall be well on our way toward saving our communities from their own wildernesses only then will we have gained the experience and indeed the right to extend the areas of freedom beyond our own borders only then can we face the world and declare that by experience and by example we have proved that human beings can live in a world where there are no reservations in the right to enjoy total freedom i suspect that such a stance will itself provide new resources with which to extend the area of freedom you who go down from this place today have i believe not only a vital interest but a vital stake in the search for new ways to achieve freedom the wellbeing of this community depends in large measure on the manner in which you and others like you assume your responsibilities the peace of the world depends among other things on what all of us can do to carry forward the objective of freedom and dignity for all peoples and thus to save the world from its own wilderness this informal f np i article is an at ii f tempt to share some of the impressions and ideas which result from about six months residence in south carolina during this period i have been working as educational consultant in a coeducational liberal arts negro college with an enrollment of students the purpose of the assignment was improvement of academic standards my conclusions are drawn largely from experience with this educational institution although community relations are reflected in my judgments it should be remembered that i came not as a militant integrationist or as a crusader from the righteous north to a sinful south my mission was that of dealing with a limited aspect of the larger problem the objective was the academic improvement of a specified college any involvement in the total race problem is incidental or reached through necessary connection with higher education one of these necessary connections is that in this society the whole range of educational accomplishment especially at the secondary level in negro schools is shockingly low when one writes about the inadequacy of preparation for college work it appears to be merely a repetition of the nationwide lament of college officials but the degree of failure in our situation here is so great that the word inadequate has a different meaning imagine one half of the entering class unable to write an intelligible paragraph add to this the inability to construct a simple sentence so that aggregations of words without subject and with mismated verb forms must serve the vocabulary is extremely limited with frequent replacement of an intended word by one of somewhat similar sound an honor senior student trying to convey to me his lack of prejudice came out with i am trying to be just as objectionable as possible reading as the art of gaining ideas from a printed page is equally deficient the college with which i am associated does not use college entrance examination board scores in a similar institution the verbal average is below compare this with bates average of over on a scale with as top score the citing of these sad facts does not imply any endorsement of nonsense about an inferior race with low mental capacity the southern white student shows a similar though less extreme disparity when rated on a national scale undoubtedly the negro student had as good a mind at birth as the average child and there are only the usual variations nevertheless at the present moment so far as achievement in education or meeting competition in a free society is concerned the negro student is in practically the same situation as he would be if he were mentally deficient many doors are closed many elements of a curriculum cannot be used by him as a means of selfdevelopment and growth the allimportant difference is that something can be done about it so far as youth is concerned education is the key instrument a cultural deficiency can be overcome by any normal individual with ambition and energy provided the right institutions and methods are available and utilized we have every reason to believe that a considerable proportion of young negroes will emerge from a disadvantageous background with capacities developed for full and rewarding participation in american life the next long step toward such a goal is dependent chiefly upon negro colleges under competent negro leaders with the present and future overcrowding of highly selective white colleges possessing an established clientele and with high costs it is only the rare southern negro who will find his way into one of them the attempt of some northern universities to establish special programs for the inadequately prepared negro applicant is a generous gesture of good will but like so many of our futile efforts it is essentially one more random activity confusing and weakening our central purpose it is positively dangerous in its tendency toward perpetuating double standards at the very best these efforts can meet so small a part of the need that the direct result is negligible the negro college has been attempting to meet the problem of poor preparation in one of two ways the first is the establishment of adequate remedial courses with which the student by greater intensity of effort or by a longer time span is brought to the point of a legitimate bachelors degree the second method is the offering of a low grade curriciulum of inferior courses and a low standard of grading that demands little effort until the candidate is given a pseudo ab or bs the second type has been somewhat acceptable in the past when its graduates went back into a depressed group there they could exert to a certain extent the leadership expected from them now we are intent upon making nonexistent the depressed subgroup and if we are successful there will be no place for such graduates in a free society all must meet in open competition hence the second type of negro college or white has become useless and injurious it must be reformed or removed it is a positive block to genuine integration legislation and good will can open opportunity for the competent but no amount of either can open a magic path for the unprepared a considerable lifting of the level of the general negro group must occur before the potentially superior individual with qualities which our society rewards can emerge in significant numbers this elevation is the opportunity and duty of negro colleges sheer physical integration in residence area church or school is more consequence than cause we need to develop a concept of integration much more profound than mere abolition of segregation we idealists easily overestimate the readiness and eagerness of the great mass of negroes apart from intellectualists and activists to join in important aspects of a predominantly white culture at the operative level or in a spiritual and deeply personal way this genuine integration must be clearly distinguished from the superficial level with which most popular discussion is concerned some few negro students of college age can now feel comfortably at home in a white college but in the deep south their number is small the emotional and psychological factors are more clearly evident in a church situation why should a family leave a church whose ways are familiar in which friends of long standing are met each sunday in which there are tender memories of weddings and funerals in which leadership is exerted and offices held how can the loyalties thus engendered be replaced by affiliation with an organization in which the same conditions cannot exist for the present generation the more intimate and personal the relationship the more deeply rooted in sentimental and personal values the more difficult and prolonged is the process of genuine integration nearly every negro can appreciate the privilege of entrance into good stores though the economic realities prevent much buying i have heard a negro professional man relate repeatedly and with great gusto of his meeting with a mixed professional group in one of the finest and most expensive hotels and how he leaned back in those big stuffed leather chairs these superficial aspects of a surrounding culture from where there has been exclusion rank high in the minds of most men the slow effort of growing into the sentiments attitudes and skills required for their production recedes into the background the desire for economic equality with the successful members of the society is predominant and most of the privileges sought are steps to that end or indicators of its partial achievement personal prestige is so closely linked with economic status that the two cannot be separated in motivation the drive for personal prestige is immediate and powerful while it is in the center of thought little effective attention is given to the obligations required for being at home and competent in the new social complex the merging of a subculture with the dominant surrounding one demands a certain amount of mutual accommodation and modification neither culture will be precisely what it was before however one or the other will be predominant with its mores and values setting the general pattern may we not assume when integration is completed that our industrial technological scienceoriented urban civilization will persist and that all persons must adjust in varying degrees to its standards if this is true then the distinctive task of negro education is the development or inculcation of qualities and attitudes as well as skills required in such a society this should be accompanied by the personal enrichment that we believe to be the function of liberal arts and accomplished with the minimum destruction of desirable elements characteristic of the subculture but it must be accomplished whether we personally like or dislike this civilization is irrelevant it is folly to suppose that in any foreseeable future it will be replaced by a more easygoing one that makes less demands for individual and corporate selfdiscipline racial in tegration will not stem the prevailing trend my thesis is that the new society will be essentially as it is continuing in the same channel and developing in the same pattern those who are successfully to share in it and in its rewards as the negro wishes to must accommodate themselves to its demands this does not deny individual variations or modest changes initiated by gifted persons it grants the right of any individual who does not value its rewards to set up his own private domain and to live independently so far as is possible in a society upon which he is so largely dependent such quasiindependence is not the ambition of most negroes i find three ways in which the negro as i have seen him must be reconditioned educated if he is to become reasonably adequate in our society i hope the examples cited do not seem trivial it may be that any one standing alone is not sufficiently indicative but in the aggregate they show traits that are supremely important let it be clearly understood that there is no intention to impute blame but only to recognize significant facts of a present condition first perhaps underlying the others is a basic habit of living in a world of illusion a daydream world by which there may be relief from the unpleasant impact of stark reality in my experience this year so long as the usual appurtenances associated with the image of a college are present what lies beneath is largely ignored colleges have sororities fraternities and impressive athletic teams so we must have them very much in view considerable sums of money are spent on these features though the poverty of students is so great that tuition and academic fees are paid on the installment plan administrative offices are equipped with the latest intercommunication system for my own office a dictating machine was proposed although my secretary is not trained to transcribe from the device the catalog contains a large selection of courses which have not been given for years the most elaborate registration card i have ever seen is used in spite of the fact that very few students can master its complexity sufficiently to fill it out correctly honors are granted to certain graduates upon very easy grounds in short by surrounding ones self with the paraphernalia and procedures thought of as pertaining to a regular college it is forgotten that they do not constitute a college there is a feeling of satisfaction that the correct image is presented to the public and visitors are properly impressed the appearance becomes subjectively the reality windowdressing serves in place of a stock of educational goods if the southern association of colleges penetrates far enough to take a dim view and accreditation is imperiled there is recourse to the feeling that racial prejudice and discrimination are at work when for many generations a people has lived in a situation which denied participation in the good life so richly apparent on every side some compensatory defense mechanism must be built up religion so easily and so often distorted to serve such ends becomes a prime source of comfort prevented by the selfinterest of the dominant group from having application to the righting of social wrongs it finds expression among negroes in emotional perceptiondulling worship soulstirring escapes from trouble and miraculous transmutation of fortune reported in biblical tradition are embodied and relived in song poetry and sermon all the usual otherworldly aspects are exaggerated and emphasized when the present world has consistently presented harsh denial of universal human hopes the human spirit finds relief in the only realm easily available the world of imaginative illusion out of this habit of the elders the college is in all things most religious but without consequences in overt behavior it may be noted that the younger generation is becoming increasingly restive with this diet of husks its apparent irreligion may be useful until religion again becomes worthy of devotion such a realm of illusion is not compatible with the world into which the negro is now being introduced any successful career demands a careful analysis of facts faithful acceptance of them and rational conduct based upon actual relation of a present situation to the desired result in this respect integration is a oneway road the negro must be conditioned toward the facing of hard facts there will be disaster for those who fail to make the transition the plight of the unadaptable will be worse than in the past since the old protective walls of race solidarity will be gone most of the retraining will take place in the education of youth this creates the opportunity and obligation for negro colleges adequate leadership must be found many smaller colleges without alert leaders will remain unaware of the nature of the crisis until the tides of social change sweep them into oblivion these colleges for nearly a century have been accepting candidates utterly unprepared for college work giving them four years of undemanding curriculum and a purely gratuitous degree then the graduate most often has gone into teaching to continue the bad tradition such a college finds it hard to realize that the role it has been playing no longer serves any useful purpose the second set of attitudes which must be changed if wholesome and successful union is to be achieved integration at a far deeper level than mere ingestion of negroes into localities institutions and industries are those relating to ethical conduct we are here on very delicate ground and must avoid harsh judgments when people have been systematicallyover a long period deprived by a group with power over them then two things occur there is a strong feeling of justification for almost any means of defense which furthers the interest of the ingroup against the outgroup the concept of ethical obligation becomes inoperative toward the offenders it seems right to use any means to establish a better balance of advantages then practices justified for group advantage are transferred for the benefit of the individual as against other members within the group our whole society is so weak at this point that the analysis of any subgroup is indeed throwing stones from a glass house however my recent experience leads me to believe that there is a more than usually complacent acceptance of institutional practices based upon the fact that elementary ethical conduct is not to be expected when my office was furnished the pen was chained to its socket to prevent theft by student janitor or other raider before the first chapel service the amplifier system was stolen from the building a special police officer is on duty during reg istration when fees are being received in registration it is recognized that special precautions must be taken to prevent fraudulent change of schedule after approval by adviser indicative in another direction is the strict requirement for certification of freedom from venereal disease before admission regulations are more honored in the breach than in the observance procedures clearly stated in the catalog have not been observed for many years it is hard to draw the line separating laxity or inefficiency and actual dishonesty in some of these matters either is unacceptable in business and professional life today here is another oneway road in integration the third set of attitudes is indifference to time failure to regard engagements as important and habitual tardiness deadlines have no meaning procrastination is the order of the day consequently nothing gets done properly every action is a temporizing patchwork of emergency measures to meet the crisis induced by previous delay or neglect a request for a report from faculty members on a matter for the benefit of their respective departments met with a per cent response by the date set catalog material known a year in advance to be due at a certain date is in process of revision weeks after that date nearly per cent of the students were late in completing registration the penalty prescribed in the catalog was not imposed on anyone apparently the majority of the college community is sufficiently satisfied with conditions to prevent any urge for change perhaps we all would like to live in such a nevernever land and avoid the necessities of the modern timeoriented world the difficulty is that it cannot be both ways an orderly productive efficient society cannot be a disorganized chaotic drifting society the results of the latter will not be the results of the former for good or ill our social order is working toward the former and accepts it as an ideal once more there is a oneway road in conclusion and summary i confess again the limitations of my direct experience both in duration and extent however the sar npling observed has a considerable geographical distribution and represents a better status than the average among the mass of negroes in the deep south therefore there seems tc be justification for the conclusion reached that conclusion is based upon the premise that a subgroup incorporated into another group dominant in numbers resources and achievement must largely conform to and accept major standards of the dominant group dominant in this usage carries no evil implications the wish merely to participate in the benefits without sharing in the process is utterly futile the necessity of acceptance is not dependent upon the perfection of the ways of the dominant group nor upon whether we or others approve them these ways are stubbornly given the negro group of the deep south through its actions expresses three traits which are incompatible with the prevailing american outlook they are preoccupation with a world of illusion certain standards of ethical conduct and disregard for the importance of time and order the existence of many greatly admired negro individuals who do not show these traitsand of many individual whites who dodoes not negate the conclusion as applied to the major body of the group in the south the segregationalist assumes these traits are innate not capable of change so he rejects the possibility of successful integration this paper on the contrary is based upon the premise that they are the result of social conditioning hence modifiable by that further controlled social conditioning which we call education integration in any meaningful sense of the word can occur only when this reconditioning has happened upon a large scale for a long time the greater part of this education must be carried on by negro colleges to find leadership for these colleges is a most important step at this moment the finding of money for them is almost but not quite as urgent northern good will might be best expressed by affluent colleges that would deny themselves some contributions from philanthropists or foundations so that large grants can be given to the negro colleges that are aware of the role they must play last january as i was preparing to go to nigeria to do a television film thomas o echewa a nigerian published in negro digest an arafricans vs afromr echewa did not bond between us as much as he described how superior africans think themselves to negroes his article was an unjustifiable piece of misplaced snobbery it made me angry for you see there is nothing like a trip to africa to make an american negro realize just how american he isand i had spent four months there in and was returning within six months later on my trip i met malcolm_x in lagos he was just beginning to turn the corner to brotherhood i dont know if africa did that on my last journey i met and talked at length with james meredith who had started out to do two years in ibadan in nigeria he lasted months i dont know if africa did that many of my good friends went to africa disgusted at the way things were going here for negroes all have returned gladly did africa do that too one thing africa does make the most oppressed american black stop and think i was not able to answer mr echewas article when it came out but i want to do so now i am not an expert on africa i was in ten countries longest in nigeria but before i ever thought of going to africa i had worked as information director for the american committee on africa i was not therefore naive about africa i am not naive about anything i had known enough about africans and their politics not to look for any special favors because i was black i think this background gives me the credentials to answer mr echewa he chides us for assuming that we negroes mistakenly believe every african to be the son of a chief or village head that is not our fault that is the fault of the africans for spreading that hogwash among us believe it or not the first twelve africans i ever knew all claimed to be the sons of tribal chiefs one must understand the historical and almost psychopathic desire for status among africans to make allowance for the young men who announced themselves as the first sons of chiefs i understand it but i wont allow mr echewa to place the fault where it doesnt belong the day i arrived back in nigeria i called on my friend chinua achebe the novelist his first words almost were john whats this i keep hearing about negroes and africans disliking each other i was a little surprised but we are good enough friends not to throw curves at each other yes i said there is a lot of talk and i think to a great degree it is true but lets get it out in the open and have done with it get about the business of really creating a bond between us history shows us how white people have always fought like animals with each other and their bond was color very often we dont want to make that same mistake we cant afford to achebe agreed i think these words apply to mr echewa to every african and to every afroamerican we have to face it the negroafrican romance that began in when ghana became independent is over finished too many negroes have been to africa now via the peace corps usaid state department etc and they know despite what mr echewa says that africans by and large do not like american negroes much of this is history the african knows very little about our history of slave revolts of our total participation in all of americas wars they know only what they read and that is slanted poorly written and serves only to make the african feel superior because after all he is on that continent which is more or less politically independent the economic situation is something else when an american negro shows up in mr echewas home without ties to the us government he is a paradox how can a black american so poor so brutally treated at home so deprived afford to come to africa the obvious answer is that what the african reads today may not be valid tomorrow and one must remember too that the tradition of tribalism in africa is deeply historic and may even be powerful enough to destroy those nations that now have independence tribalism has caused nigeria a tremendous amount of trouble and europeans and white american policies have taken advantage of it the american black being without tribe or clan but being black all the same is considered a lost soul in the eyes of the african a man without a tribe is next to worthless a tribal society does create builtin superiority complexes i asked a highranking official about the closeknit families among the ibos of eastern nigeria the ibos are a gentle people and one senses a great depth in them the official said haughtily that the ibos were different from the rest of the nigerians he you see was a yoruba from the west with such an attitude it is quite clear that despite what mr echewa says he and most africans do mean to offend american blacks when they say they dont want to be referred to as negroes but i want to remind him that the europeans could not have drained africa of millions and millions of people to become slaves in the west if african leaders and chiefs had not helped them it is easy enough to blame the british french dutch portuguese and spanish but the africans have to share that blame as well tinubu square in the heart of lagos honors a woman who sold her own people into slavery contempt mr echewa should be deserved over the years ive noticed other ways in which the african communicates his contempt for american blacks he will have little to do with a negro unless he is told that the negro is suchandsuch and does soandso mostly the african will ignore the negro like a block of wood a few years ago i had a party in my apartment i believe it was when togo became independent many africans came i noticed as time wore on that there was a fellow who was flicking his cigarette ashes on the floor instead of in the ashtray finally he ground the cigarette underfoot and walked casually away incensed i followed him and told him in no uncertain terms that my apartment was not a grass hut and to take himself out of it i thought that was an isolated instance since then a host of people who have had africans in their homes as guests have noted the same thing this is not carelessness it is calculated contempt perhaps this contempt lies in the fact that so many african nations are now independent it would be unfair not to point out that many negroes felt a bit of jealousy when the african nations started down freedom road we wanted full citizenship first but we have gotten over that generally mr echewa africans do sympathize with our struggles but specifically they dont give a damn and i for one am a little tired of hearing africans rant and rave about climbing into boats and coming over here to rescue us what damned boats what damned armies when you free angola and mozambique and south africa when you finally put an end to the slavery that still flourishes when you either eliminate or ameliorate tribal differences then ill listen to you right now your mouth is moving but you arent saying much i agree with mr echewa that an unfriendly encounter between an african and a negro should not be the basis of a blanket opinion that africans are a pretty rotten lot let me set down the basis for my opin ions first i was there second i have many friends who were third i have nigerian friends and friends in other countries africans all who are there i think i have a lot of facts mr echewa i do not believe that the current attitudes of antagonism are the result of a single bad encounter on the part of a great many visiting negroes they are the result of many many bad encounters fifty times a day every day you are in africa a thumbnail sketch on nigeria since that is mr echewas home i arrived at kano at in the morning kano is ghastly hot and dry and the largest city in northern nigeria one of the customs officers tried to take my typewriter the other my camera i refused to let them and refused to pay them dash the old african bribe money that left a bad taste and to see africans who cry how free i am all the time uncle tomming white people all over africa sickened me no negro in a private capacity can expect to be served before a white man in africa it just isnt done enough no i have been to a good many places in the world and the most rascally cab drivers so far are nigerian paris cabbies dont even come near them new york city drivers would be completely wasted more in nigeria people who are poor seem to expect you to give them something just because you have it and they dont tribalism again but a great irritant in a country struggling to make good its independence it is nigerian tribalism that would keep mr echewa away from gangs of toughs unless he frequented such places as the kakadu or the caban bamboo in yaba a suburb of lagos where women are concerned class barriers fall with a resounding bang mr echewa seems really concerned about appearing to be white and being involved with white people so much let me be crass the upper echelon nigerian is more british than black just as the upper echelon senegalese is more french than black africans are not fools they woo the power structure in america and so far that has been white but since the american society from the s has been mostly concerned with social changes or progress it seems inevitable that before long power will be shared with black americans mr echewa you had better look to it in i took an extensive trip around the nation usa by car i stopped at many colleges and universities wherever i went except in the south i was asked why it was that the african students preferred the whites to american blacks the question was asked of me often enough to have validity especially since it was asked not by negroes but by whites themselves living in new york it has been my experience that africans will attend mixed gatherings but seldom will appear at an allnegro one this past spring an official from the mission of an east african nation agreed to speak before a group of negro women the man did not show up call to apologize or send a note fifty women all colored in new york city now have a very embittered view of africa and her people since most of the africans who live in new york tend to have diplomatic status they do not live in negro neighhoods occasionally they get waylaid and beaten up and they raise hell but they will have little to do with our civil_rights groups being diplomats they should not but if they believe that color is an important thing then their behavior in having as little to do with groups of this type is unforgivable ralph bunche never found it difficult i have heard a negro usia official tell an african to wear his robes when visiting america so he would not be mistaken for an american negro the state department people also handpick the negroes and negro organizations for the visiting african to see firsthand one african friend told me the average african visiting new york or chicago is more afraid of his own brothers than the white people who have caused both our conditions i think this is true negroes never will get to know africa better mr echewa unless africans become more willing to let them instead of avoiding them the truth is that a visiting african may give one impression but he knows very well that the africa he boasts about has a long way to go and it doesnt matter if he himself has three large houses and two mercedes with a house full of servants the average african still lives in a mud hut with a thatched or corrugated metal roof the mud houses are not a put down they are in fact quite cool and sturdy the average african coming to a large city like lagos still may have to sleep in the street next to an open sewer the poor american black on the other hand usually has what he needs to be a member of his society near at hand through some social agency africans tend to hide this disparity if you get to know them well you get to know this and they dont want you to many feel ill at ease if they have to take you to visit their relatives who still live in the huts and rather than do this many will drop you as a friend another nigerian friend of mine who almost singlehandedly wiped out corruption in lagos which is an augean task and who did it so well that he was sent packing up to kano introduced me to his family there were two wives and many many children the house was partly of mud and the lighting was provided by candles this man had no sense of shame as he should not have had i enjoyed his family and i think they enjoyed me i felt the richer for the pleasure of meeting them and it was only the second time i was ever invited into the home of mr average african the african like the negro deals with white values he should be ashamed he thinks and he is because his relatives live in a mud hut and a mud hut is a sign of savagery in white terms i think the african has just really started to gobble up white values negroes are further down the line they know them for what they are now mr echewa you know as well as i do that africans are as sophisticated and as crude as any other people probably cruder let me cite an example during my last trip to nigeria two people one british one american complained about africans going to parties drinking up all the whiskey that in itself was not bad but the fact that the africans seldom invited them to parties made the africans appear to be parasites they also complained that africans spoiled excellent cognac by mixing it with ginger alea most valid complaint to my mind both were going to buy cheap cognac so the africans could mix their gingerale with that now that doesnt sound like sophistication to me i have seen the sophisticated african at work and play and i am not impressed i have seen him suffer twenny hungry that is running through his civil service pay so quickly that he was hurting for the th of the month payday to come around again those africans who bear in mr echewas words the trade mark made in great britain or made in france are the beentosthe people who have been to england or france to school a takeoff on bantu a racial designation i have seen these fellows mr echewa with their briefcases filled with sandwiches pacing up and down the streets with a great deal of impatient sophistication nowadays the negro takes the fact of college education in stride he needs no labels to proclaim the fact that he is going or has gone and it seems to me that this is much closer to the sophistication mr echewa writes about the fact of hip that mr echewa discusses in his article is badly misunderstood hip always meant that a person was aware jomo kenyatta doesnt do the uncle willie or the monkey either but hes the hippest thing africa has turned out in recent years i confess that i was surprised at the way mr echewa employed the term negritude which as a doctrine is as racist as white supremacy most nigerians leave negritude to the french africans in case mr echewa doesnt know it yet the spokesman for negritude on the african continent leopold senghor is in the process of refining it he feels that the bantu peoplesand this includes people in the southern areas of nigeriaare inferior to the hamiticsemitic types such as the senegalese m senghor is the president of senegal my friend achebe believes that it is the white people who have caused and are still causing the gap between negroes and africans it is they after all who control and disseminate the word but now that we are aware of the fact of dissonances between us is there not something we can do first we can stop lying to each other in speeches african leaders say that they want their afroamerican brothers to return home that they are welcome realistically negroes would find little room in africa because there are not that many jobs available second because american education is rated tops in the world africans have a certain natural reluctance in competing with them two negro women both toplevel social workers in the states tried to get jobs in nigeria they were turned down cold not because of money they didnt want that muchbut because their educations were superior to the people with whom and for whom they would be working if african leaders truly want negroes it is within their means to invite them and devise programs in which they can make full use of their talents so lets stop lying about that on our side lets stop lying about flocking to africa in droves i met james farmer in nigeria in february and he had made a series of trips around africa and planned to organize some kind of program whereby negroes could go to africa i believe less and less that black americans have the desire they once had to quit the known for all its dubious qualities for the totally unknown so lets quit lying about that too another friend of mine a negro who once worked with the satellite tracking station near kano quit in order to work with the people they would have none of his engineering skills they made him live in a section of town reserved for those people who have no relatives the last i heard of this man he had moved down to lagos and was selling american chickens in a supermarket africans are going to have to stop speeding on the new jersey turnpike and spend more time with negroes they are going to have to show us one of these days mr average african not the glamorous africa with its new rivieratype houses or swanky and impossibly expensive hotels they are going to have to look at americas ne groes as realistically as white americans do and they are going to have to do that pretty quickly i do not think it is any accident that a major negro magazine failed to do well when it was published specifically for africa african leaders could not afford to let their people see just how well american blacks are doing in spite of racism in this land in addition to that perhaps africans just didnt care mr echewa saysand rightfully so that negroes have to expend more energy getting to know africans i think i may have pointed out already however that it is largely the african who is preventing us from doing just that furthermore africans dont know other africans that well most of the contact is made between africans of different countries from the top but not in the middle if there is such a thing and certainly not at the bottom i wrote a book on africa for children which is being used by three nigerian teachers in africa to instruct their pupils on the rest of the continent mr echewa is right once again when he suggests that we rid ourselves of the ignorance that lies between us he himself is woefully ignorant of just what does lie between us for example we are not as unprepared to rid ourselves of ignorance as he seems to think i would remind him that the currents of african independence began here not in africa at the first meeting of the panafricanism congress convened in london in by the late w e b dubois one historian noted that at the outset panafricanism was a simple manifestation of fraternal solidarity between negroes of african descent from the british antilles and the united states of america to put it bluntly not a single africans presence was recorded at that first meeting in fact not until at the fifth congress did they appear and among them were kwame nkrumah and jomo kenyatta i am glad mr echewa wrote his article otherwise i never would have written an answer to it many negroes who have been in africa refuse to let mr charlie know their true reactions to it and its people we have kept silent not so much for ourselves but because of our brothers back home but when the brothers play on the fact of our silences to put us down that is another thing finally i must note with cold objectivity that if africa produces such wisdom and sophistication and snobbery as mr echewa boasts why ever in the hell did he leave it to come to these united states the answer is obvious this racistridden land has something to offer even to mr echewa john a williams makes a very strong pointif his point is that nigerian social standards are not as high as those of the u s he goes into some unnecessarily painful detail in making his point such as it is however as an answer to the article i wrote last january and within the clearly defined context of that article his letter is an exemplary piece of unbridled irrelevance perhaps mr williams has an argument to win hence all this vehemence and invective unfortunately nobody can win this argument because for every experience that illustrates one point another can be cited to illustrate the opposite if my intention were to champion the african side of the dispute then like mr williams i could assemble a vast amount of unilateral evidence to make my point on the contrary my intention was and still is to indicate the attitudes and tendencies which lead to the misunderstanding between africans and negro americans not endorsing these attitudes in either party but just pointing them out accordingly my tone was quite tentative mr williams must not close his eyes to the fact that few negroes have had the privilege or the bitter and disillusioning experience as he would probably call it of visiting africa so the battle ground is here not in nigeria the problem i treated concerned primarily the odd africans who are in this country the type of africans that the average negro can meet and probably has met this type of african is young a student and probably aboveaverage in his own national context some africans falsely claim to be the sons of chiefs however the status is often foisted on the rest of us by people who think we must all be princes to deserve to come to this gods country the african student here deals with all classes of negroesoften with the lower class ones i mean the cats with tarred hair needlesharp shoes red socks and sun glasses day and night dig then check it i am sure that mr williams will agree that there is a social and intellectual disparity here to give him a chance to get even i will concede that the average african can be quite primitive but he is not the kind you are likely to meet on main street i wonder why the obsession with mud huts and poor relatives oh well it is true that some africans pretend to many lofty things personally i will go as far as who goes the farthest in condemning such pretence nigerian social amenities bear no comparison to those of the u s however u s affluence worsens rather than mitigates the negros situation for as mr williams surely knows the most likely way for the average negro to get into one of those towering skyscrapers is as a janitor as for me i would always rather be a nigerian andlive in a mud hut than be so deprived in the midst of plenty i have a feeling mr williams and i will disagree on the definition of the average negro i hesitate to define one but i know he is not a college graduate far from it it is not unusual for professionalclass negroes to apply everything said about the negro to themselves forgetting that they are a negligible percentage of the negro population funny but i think that many professionalclass negroes are more ashamed of their poor relatives than the africans mr williams cited in his letter besides the negroes tend to have a complex about it whereas africans accept the inescapable tribal or familial bond with their relatives no matter how poor they are since mr williams is plagued by a common american malady a temptation to reduce all values to dollars i will introduce him to two very important notions notions which contribute very strongly to the pride of the african the first is the personal concept i exist i have a right to be i esteem myself highly one of the saddest aspects of segregation in the united states is that many negroes seem to have accepted and made peace with the degradation and secondrateness which the white society has forced on them africans on their part do have some unspoken inferiority complexes but theirs are not nearly as numerous or intense as the negroes at least not any more in this era of african independence we are exerting ourselves fully and projecting the african personality everywhere so the african one meets here usually has a proud carriage we have a lot to be proud of mr williams he is assertive and does not ask anybodys permission to be equal he takes his equality for granted many negroes on the other hand are still trying to run away from themselves from their color from their past they dont accept themselves as they are it is not news to anyone that lighter colored negroes usually consider themselves a shade superior to the darker ones they usually marry other lighter colored negroes they perform plastic surgery on their features i have been told that a leading negro university in this country used to be a blue vein school frankly i dont have much patience with people who are trying to be white but cant quite make it the second concept is one of belonging i belongto my family to my village the name of my village is umuamadi which means the sons of amadi we are about strong and live together this is home to me no matter where else i may happen to be living i belong to my town clan tribe country time and time again i have tried to explain to some negro friends that the american concept of acceptance has no meaning in africa the tribal groups may not like one another but it is no groups prerogative to accept or reject the others tribalism is universal right here in america you have your wasps and wops and polaks and irish etc all sharing some sort of fellow feeling for members of their particular group and holding the rest in some sort of contempt elsewhere french canadians are fighting englishspeaking canadians flemishspeaking belgians are feuding with their frenchspeaking compatriots the english and the french hold one another in an unspoken mutual contempt these mr williams are examples of tribalism do you have a more civilized name for it in any case what has tribalism got to do with the friction between africans and negroes in the u s i daresay the accusation of wooing the power structure is a little incorrect as a foreigner the african often has to deal with the power structure as it is the word is deal not woo african governments cannot cater in detail to the interests of the negro because the racial problem here like the one in south africa is an internal problem it is useful to note anyway that prior to african independence the u s had no one to answer to for its atrocious racial policies where private individuals are concerned mr williams needs to be reminded that africans do not come here to be absorbed into the negro subculture this is the rude fact as julius nyerere once said we know our friends but it is not up to our friends to pick enemies for us for many negroes this division is often arbitrary and why should i a foreigner lose my head literally and figuratively in the civil_rights fight my calling is elsewhere weve got problems of our own let me just say that as a committee chairman in the notre dame civil_rights commission it was sometimes my onue to kindle some of your whats happening stalwarts africans do not consider themselves negroes in the american sense of the word in as much as the word means black then we are negro otherwise no for example in hattiesburg miss two years ago a certain gentleman usurped my seat as i stepped down from the bus to take pictures as i tried to reclaim the seat he thumbed me towards the back of the bus he quickly discovered i wasnt a negro now for my credentials i have been here four years i spent the better part of two summers touring the country using the greyhound seeamerica ticket days of unlimited travel on either occasion i have been in most of the states i have been a door to door salesman currently i work parttime as a bartender at smokes flamingo the best restaurant operated by a negro in south bend in conclusion i am forced to wonder what nigerian taxi drivers custom officers cheap cognac and ginger ale have to do with the point in question the argument begins to get ridiculous with such assertions as who started whom on the road to freedom on the overqualified sociologists it is likely they had nothing we could use nigeria does not have social problems comparable to the u s scale finally to what seems to be the climax of mr williams arguments namely the reason hell i am here why ever in the oh well i already anticipated that question in the january article the actual reason i am classified wise lets here for more than two centuries prior to the founding of the association for the study of negro life and history the american negro from the point of view of history lived in an era of inhumanity of culture the failure was due to many factors slavery ignorance total disinterest in fact disbelief in the negro as a human being historical distortions and grossly false myths until the th century there were no negro historians of note to avoid the negros total eclipse into inhumanity in there was born a negro boy in virginia carter g woodson son of slave parents he was unable to attend school regularly and was forced to teach himself while working later he attended high school and college parttime and worked parttime he however was possessed of a brilliant incisive analytical mind he earned his bachelors and masters degrees at the university of chicago and the coveted degree of doctor of philosophy at harvard in this man dr carter g woodson became americas greatest scholar and authority on the history of the american negro and the contributions of the negro to americas history and progress as well as an authority on the negros african heritage he was a scholar who truly enlarged human understanding dr woodson was a selfless man he devoted his whole life his energies and his material wealth to the lonely search for the truth about the people whom he loved so dearly he had a profound belief that what he found and what he was telling america during his all too short life could only be as effective as the accuracy of the glorious history revealed by him during his nearly years of painstaking research those scholars who have studied and reviewed more than a score of volumes of his history and his more than articles on the american negro and the negro of other lands will say that posterity is heavily indebted to dr woodson for the revelations of his impeccable personal research into years of negro history in september we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the association for the study of negro life and history the child of the efforts and the brain of this great historian and coincidentally the ninetieth year of his birth this event should be a challenge to every negro to know his own history better and indeed to make it irresistibly attractive and respectable as dr woodson has done we have for many years been involved in the fight against the bigotries and hatreds stirred up in a pluralistic society where the ethnic and religious minorities must fight for a firstclass citizenship which in democratic theory is theirs to the neglect of knowing our own history a fact which gives comfort to the bigots this mistake has been a great loss to us in the lack of knowledge of our race and pride of race we must redress the lack of pride of ancestry too long ignored and thus overcome the deceit of those who would deny us a place in history we must give to the millions of negro children who because of circumstances over which they had no control do not know the chance to emerge from the darkness of ignorance of their own ancestry we must give them the access to history as well as to life which is the heart and soul of the american dream our responsibility is to support in this fiftieth year of our struggle for culture with all our might and means this great association for the study of negro life and history to commemorate the name and memory of a great negro american carter g woodsonand to create a foundation to encourage other woodsons now in our schools or yet unborn to further study the life and history of one of the earliest races to inhabit the american continent the knowledge of the history ot the negro will tear away the many false faces and myths that have so long obscured the truth this the way it was fnr j done call thenwhat we guidance and counseling now down our way someone who saw something in you were a preacher or walked up and asked what you want to be and you told them if you were a girl that you wanted to be a teacher or a nurse if you boy you said a lawyer a a doctor after this you proceededjust proceeded with good fortune i harbored a boon that would insure my choice of vocation in addition to the question i had an older sister who was two grades ahead of me when i reached the fourth grade i began to welcome her intention to learn me the choice assignments that the teachers learned her for instance everyone in the school knew that miss daisy ill call her required the sixth graders to recite i sigh for the land of the cypress and the pine where the jessamine blooms and the gay woodbine instead of reciting a wise saying like good better best during morning devotions i lorded my prestige over the fourth graders by saying all of the cypress and the pine this pattern persisted when i was in the fifth grade my sister had to work the good and bad road problems in the seventh grade i worked them too when i was in the sixth she was in the eighth way on the other side of the track in high school thats when she began stuffing my head with home x she knew how to cream the butter how to make white icing stay on a cake and how to make shredded coconut stay on the white icing so i didnt bat an eye i had no cause to when my seventh grade teacher handed me my promotion card and asked the question i spoke right up and said i want to be a home x school teacher she smiled and patted me on the back being intelligent enough to know i thought that i was more than ready to proceed three months later one nevertobe forgotten september morning in i left my homeroom class for the home x building but they didnt have it spelled over the entrance arch the way my sister called it i didnt have time to write down what they had up there because the crowd shoved me along too fast before i could walk independently i was inside a spacious room with scores of sleeksurfaced oblong tables with chairs all around them i had never seen a schoolroom without desks in fact i had never seen a room like this one before we huddled in littlegirl clusters for security while the teacher waved her arms as if she lashed mosquitoes girls girls girls my my she held one side of her face as if she had the toothache sit down at the tables she whisked through the narrow passes between the tables dropping a neat stack of paper slips on each table last name first first name second middle name last we sat there like victims of battle fatigue not rallying at all to what she had just barked out for heavens sake im asking each of you to write your own name cant you do that she sat on the corner of the desk waiting how you want us to write it a girl asked listenno ill write on the board she wrote a name on the board is that your name another girl asked yes the teacher replied and now may i give you the requirements for this course yes maam someone answered she shook her head then told us what to expecta notebook being one of the more important demands she made a smile then read from a small notebook with checkered design food is any substance we sat with undivided attention girls please open your notebooks when i begin dictating again i want you to write it down let me begin again she said food is any substance which when taken into the body is capable of one or more of the following functions first building and repairing tissues i could scarcely hold my peace what was this woman up to i asked myself id wanted to learn more about making good cakes and she stood there all prim and cool and tall laughing with her medium brown eyes and passing her hand over her straightened slick bob never caring at all about creaming the butter thats what i wanted to do thats why i had chosen home x as my vocation building and repairing tissues she had said whod ever heard of food doing that when we ate at home we didnt eat to build or to repair anything we ate to fill our stomachs where had she been where had she come from not to know what food was really for a girl raised her hand breaking the spell what was the last thing that you said she frowned building building building her proud square nose was wrinkling as she spoke if im not mistakenline up come by the desk with an armpit set to meet my nostrils mum is the word they sell it you buy it you use it she sat down for the sniffing exercise never fear my heart whispered as it bumped sounding like raps on a big bass drum you cleaned your body with care and i had i had scrubbed carefully with warm water and octagon soap i had deodorized my armpits with arm and hammer baking soda to be sure i had sprinkled a little between my toes to keep my brown oxfords sanitary on the inside so there had been nothing else that i knew of that a yearold could have done to make herself dainty i marched along hearing my fathers voice and finding comfort in the sound et too brewtay he had told us that that was all a man could say when he found out that his best friend had helped to stab him to death this lady was the one to help me be what i wanted to be already she had become enemy number one there was nothing to say but et too brewtay as my father said when someone he liked pushed him to the wall no one she said after sniffing thirtyfour armpits maybe someone slipped out she counted the slips on the desk yes thirtyfive but dont get happy ill catch her if she stays in this class believe me in the name of health and sanitation i mean for you to look clean be clean and smell clean on and on the password was mum mum was the password as we took notes on food for three weeks as we worked three weeks on our kitchen outfits and as we went to the kitchen to learn to cook cooking was my hope for realizing the joys of home x the kitchen with its peculiarities caused me to wonder if i would succeed after our first briefing for one thing the stove cooked with gas before anyone could ask a question about what the teacher had said she looked at me and said sweetly you light the oven i turned the gas on scratched a match as she had done because the pilot wasnt working and applied it underneath i only lost my eyelashes my eyebrows a halfinch of hair from the line and a week from school to soothe my face from the blown heat with cocoa butter just before the end of the first nineweek period the teacher announced that we would make lemon meringue pies for the superintendent and members of the board of education who always dined in the department of home economics after the official annual meeting a crew of including the teacher turned out the day before the visit in whitestarched cooking aprons and headbands to make a dozen pies i looked around feeling pride even joy on being one of this group i stood there dreaming of the beautiful pies wed make get the lemon squeezer dont just stand there get the lemon squeezer i said i mean you jackson the teacher stood akimbo her dark skin darkening even more as i froze i guess you dont know where to find it all right its in the other room thirtyfive pairs of spotlights hit me as i turned to fetch that lemon squeezer once i reached the dining room i sensed relief because a ninthgrader was in there polishing the table wheres the lemon squeezer i asked her lemon squeezer she loudtalked me you tell me girl you dont know a lemon squeezer when you see one the teacher heard her and picked up on the cue ahhah you were going to fool me you dont know what a lemon squeezer is ahhah i cowered in the other room as another member of the cooking class got the lemon squeezer thank you dear she used her best speaking voice girls she continued you ought to pay attention to what your mothers teach you pay attention i had to pay attention and to adhere to my mothers teachings just as she had been taught to obey her mother there had been generations of obedience but neither of our mothers would have recognized a lemon squeezer had it been the size of one of the modern football bowls even though embarrassment stung me regularly because of a previous lack in homemaking knowledge and skills i took home economics for four years learning mostly what negro women on my side of the track couldnt know and though i knew that me and home x had parted company as lifelong mates the very minute i left the other room i have never stopped thinking of the teacher as the emancipator who helped us to become american women for lafayette porter life is essentially hapa painter his of the world is expressed in vivid colfrolicsome designs selforganizes his own life around his work his material needs are simple and they are satisfied through nontaxing work which pays the bills but allows him to reserve his emotional energy for painting working in tempera porter achieves a musically gay effect not unlike what some of the best of the current op art would be were it more seriously conceived and more diligently refined an excellent talent for simple drawing is one of the sounder bases of porters ultimate success a sense of the whimsical and the absurd animate his figures porter is an original artist who follows no school and is not consciously influenced by any other painter or style he terms his own approach to painting as progressive and leaves it at that progressive art moves forward in the expression of ideas is the extent of his explanation a native chicagoan porter has traveled in europe lived precariously in greenwich village and now lives and works in indiana thief drunkard brawler it was the lot of frangois villon fifteenth century french poet to write one of the loveliest evocations of the ubi sunt where are they theme in all poetry in the middle ages with their preoccupation with death this theme was especially frequent and wyndham lewis has called villons ballade of dead ladies one of the master songs of the world with the exquisite ache of its music caressing and soothing to dreams and its lovely refrain it has recently been translated again by richard wilbur and by galway kinnell but the most familiar version is by dante gabriel rossetti just as the ubi sunt theme was prevalent in the middle ages with their concern for mortality another theme which i may call the hie sum or here i am theme occurs again and again in american negro poetry oppressed ignored and deprecated the negro seeks identity and pride not by regretting or mourning past glories but by bringing them back to the present and identifying them with himself whether or not the poet is conscious of this theme and this tradition it is an understandable psychological reaction to a social situation one of the first and bestknown poems with the hie sum theme is langston hughes the negro speaks of rivers in which the negro invests himself with the dignity and depth of ancient rivers as long as the poets working this tradition bring to it something newminted and unique to themselves it will not become a mere formula like the imitations of villon birth love death are recurrent themes of poetry but the other day i was thumbing through old numbers of the crisis and found a poem using the hie sum theme that was full of cliches the poet called himself crispus attucks and harriet tubman and all the other stock figures clothed in stock language of negro history week the theme of hie sum with its search for identity and pride need not be confined to negro poets we find it in the poem hebrews by samuel oppenheim we discover the hie sum theme even in the work of the jaunty optimistic white american walt whitman but he inverts the material instead of identifying the past with himself he rejects it and claims the present pancho villa bandit and revolutionary successfully thumbed his nose at a punitive american force led by general john pershing is now subject of a campaign in mexico where he is made out to be more saint than sinner pancho villa is rising in mexico as a sort of mexican legendary robin hood dogooder who never shed blood for pleasure who stole from the rich and befriended the poor whether this version is true or false is something that cannot be verified most of villas contemporaries are dead and in the eyes of a younger generation he is a legendary figure who could have whipped the gringos had he received cooperation instead of persecution from fast tumbling regimes during the turbulent days of the mexican revolution and the legendary figure has a lilting name to go with his exploits pancho villa a name that was not his own for the unimportant doroteo arango raiding and running from the law almost six decades ago in the states of durango sonora and chihauhau was rebaptized by a puerto rican negro an adventurer and guerrilla who fought against the french when maximilian was emperor of mexico the negro francisco villa came into doroteo arangos life when the latter was a fugitive from justice he had killed the seducer of his oldest sister still little more than a child was jailed but managed to escape into the durango hills in the rugged durango fastnesses still inaccessible even in this day arango when not fleeing from the rurales kept himself going by being a cuatrero this is a slang expression of that day meaning nothing more than a cattle rustler the real francisco villa who was an adventurer and professional soldier wound up as a guerrilla fighter in a band captained by a woman the legendary apolinaria garcia dedicated and unyielding in battle against french forces and turncoat mexicans who acknowledged emperor maximilian in the territory of durango zacatecas and chihuahua mounted at the head of her guerrilla band apolinaria garcia distinguished herself for her courage and audacity in raids against the french she was not always successful but she was a disturbing influence harassing the french invaders in a skirmish at a site known as silita in the state of durango apolinaria garcia was killed and with her death the guerrilla band disbanded soon after with emperor maximilian executed and the mexican republic restored a peace of sorts came to northern mexico francisco villa tried to lead a life of peace tilling the soil but he was not cut out to be a farmer and hearing of the small marauding band of doroteo arango villa abandoned his plow for the gun once more legend has it that after one cattle raid with the bandits spending the fruits on tequila a slightly tipsy francisco villa said i dont like your name it has the ring of a schoolteacher or a respectable man to it you need a more fitting name than the dull even vulgar doroteo arango i know what i will give you my name from now on you are pancho villa and so it was the negro and the mexican related only by their mutual need for excitement and scorning of the law agreed that pancho villa was a name that had a warriors ring to it even if the warrior was nothing more than a bandit and cattle rustler shortly after this rebaptizing of doroteo arango the bandits were flushed out by rurales and in the running battle that followed the negro francisco villa was slain he never lived to see how the name he had given on a whim gained more and more stature in revolutiontorn mexico substantiating the renaming of arango as the second pancho villa is jose cruz cervantes a grandson of apolinaria garcia who never came to know her because he was a youngster and she was always on the march now living quietly in mexico city with his memories cervantes was one of villas highranking officers from until the bandit chieftain and revolutionary surrendered to provisional president adolfo de la huerta retired to life of a rancher only to meet death by assassination in a ambush according to cervantes pancho villa boisterously took on the name from his colored companion in banditry perhaps he had not meant to continue using the name but when the real pancho villa was slain somehow the joke of two pancho villas became a permanent one historians in trying to trace the name have delved into records and come up with fact that doroteo arango was born on june and they have also followed the theory that the mexican pancho villa got his name from stepfather agustin arango who was the bastard child of augustin villa all this fuss about making pancho respectable and all the bother about a name would have only irritated him said cervantes he was a lusty man and a heavy drinker and he formed a strong attachment to the real puerto rican francisco villa you know how men are in their cups the idea was suggested of a rebaptism and doroteo roared it was a good idea and when the puerto rican was killed he just naturally became pancho to his band somehow those days of fury and bloodshed and frenzied hatreds and barbarous actions seem far away today id like to forget about them but my woundsmy body shows the scars of seven bullet wounds and an equal number caused by knife slasheswont let me forget in the damp weather they act up give me no peace perhaps it is a punishment of sorts i do not know the old man shook his head reflectively why was i saved i was unimportant and fully of my family including father uncles and other relatives died in revolutionary combat now they say they want to erect statues for pancho villa to commemorate his name i do not know whether this is right or wrong as i do not know if what we did in the bloody years of revolt was right or wrong it was so long ago cervantes who is said all i want is peace i am an old man now and it all seems so unimportant today although then we thought we were very very important negro cowboys neg roes were pertinent in the old west they helped to open the west and they helped to build the west exploring the western plains and mountains the negroes dug for gold and silver and they trapped wild horses negroes found what is now los angeles they were with the lewis and clark expedition they were in the gold rush and they rode the pony express in the days of the old west negroes acquired the reputation of being outstanding bronco busters but some ranch owners found them too valuable to use in this capacity it was a time in our history says two ucla researchers when a texas rancher might assign a amonth white cowboy to ride a bucking outlaw horse with the danger of rupture mutilation or death rather than risk the investment he had in a negro cowboy negroes rode the plains from n v texas to montana and they were as popular in their day as the legendary figures in movies and television there were negro cowboys like james beckwith who associated with kit carson there was dan diamond who made headlines in the s by participating in a denver county jail break and there was bronco sam who made a bet with other cowboys that he could ride a horse up a flight of stairs these are the facts that were discovered by the ucla researchers philip durham and everett jones when they began gathering material for the negro cowboys dodd mead it was first durhams idea to write the negro cowboys and for a long time it was just an idea when are you going to write that manuscript on the negro cowboys jones would ask durham and after many months of hearing this question durham replied i will write it if you write it with me so together they began a long two years of research putting together scattered material on negro cowboys they discovered ben hodges a negro cowboy who was known as a competent forger and cattle thief he lived in dodge city during the days of wyatt earp and bat masterson and died there in once hodges was charged with stealing cattle from a dodge city dairyman and with no friends or lawyer he went to court pleading his own case what me he cried at one point the descendant of old grandees of spain the owner of a land grant in new mexico embracing millions of acres the owner of gold mines villages and towns situated on that grant of whom i am sole owner would steal a miserable miserly lot of old cows at another point he represented himself as a poor but honest cowboy being persecuted by personal enemies and there was deadwood dick who rode and lived in the black hills of south dakota while a reward was being offered for his apprehension deadwood dick rode a black horse he wore black clothing and like the equally improbable lone ranger he wore a black halfmask many negro cowboys wore the badge of the law and still others were prosperous bill pickett is the negro cowboy who invented steer wrestling and bob lemmons is still recognized as one of the nations most famous bronco busters bose ikard was a trusted cowhand of rancher charles goodnight when we were on the trail carrying money i gave it to ikard said goodnight a thief would never think of robbing himnever think of looking in a negros bed for money another negro cowboy george mcjunkin is remembered by historians of science for his discovery of ice age bison bones in the folsom new mexico mountain area during the s the negro cowboys is a well researched book written in a noveltext book style it regains an important part of american heritage but this is not a book pleading for the american negroes in this modern day when hollywood has ignored the negro as a western hero durham and jones have written a goethean calling for more light when the west became a myth or a game of lets pretend the negro became the invisible man or at best an uncle tom says durham and jones there was no place for him in these community theatricals he had been a real cowboy but he could not pretend to be a mythical cowboy very little information if any information at all can be found in history text books on negro cowboys and even those that do mention negro cowboys fail to mention the dollar value many ranchers had for these western riders they dont recognize the fact that ben hodges was a real cowboy more real than todays roy rogers and gene autry durham and jones who have written other books have taken on a new significance in telling of the brilliant life of cowboys in the old west it presents a stirring panorama of the old west and lets us live those days again the roman satirist juvenal once lamented who

individual known to history but akhnatena physically weak and possibly unbalanced man lacked the true reformers sense of politics monkish fanatical he veered increasingly away from reality and became one of the great tragic kings of history and literature his first major blunder was the promptness with which he expelled amon then the official god of thebes he further alienated the priesthood by imperiously moving his court from the traditional capital to a new city named for him further north along the nile but akhnatens greatest folly was the unworldly indifference with which he watched the

is an often engrossing account of this anachronistic pharoah and of the great hamitic dynasty of which he was a part but available evidence concerning his motivations and even the major events of his

broken friendships broken because having been seemingly befriended by morgan during the weeks of conversation the subject often feels betrayed when he reads the article and no wonder for morgan an intelligent perceptive man with selfprofessed liberal attitudes cuts the very people to whom one expects him to be kindly and is least disparaging to those whose ideas and deeds he holds in ridicule

why direct action must not cease one of the least discussed of all the major recent events in the rv r freedom movement is the moratorium on demonstrations i i m and direct action for the period of the presidential campaign agreed to by major civil_rights organizations with core dissenting shortly after the nomination of senator goldwater in san francisco it is curious that there has been little postelection speculation as to whether that decision to halt negro militancy for days was in fact a wise course to have followed the major assumption which led to the decision to call a moratorium on all organized civil_rights protests was of course the feeling that such protests might tend to spread or deepen the white backlasheven to the point of altering the results of the presidential election prior to the election there was no method by which any certainty regarding the advisability of the moratorium could be secured and unfortunately no such postelection method has been discovered the deliberate delay of days however cannot simply be written off as an event that has passed into history the moratorium on civil_rights demonstrations during the presidential election may turn out to be one of the major turning pointsfor better or for worseof the entire freedom movement without minimizing or maximizing the presumed effects of the moratorium it seems warranted to note at least the following conclusions or inferences which may be made regarding the unprecedented voluntary postponement for three months of civil_rights demonstrations perhaps the most importanteousinference which may be drawn from the moratorium and the election is the conclusion that militant tactics by negro and civil_rights although possibly the most erron leaders in a preelection period will cause many white persons to vote against the negro cause whereas the absence of such tactics will result in a white vote not discemibly based on antinegro sentiment this conclusion appears to be widely accepted although one can argue that the white backlash would not have been significant in the vote in northern cities even if civil_rights demonstrations had in fact continued during the campaign the fact is that a feared white antinegro vote appears to have disappeared between labor day and election day did the blackout on negro militancy cause the fadeout of the white backlash one can fear that the answer to that question by countless persons would be yes and that the election may become in the popular imagination a symbol of the apparent truth however appalling and erroneous it may be that the presence of negro militancy during the period of an election campaign may elicit more antinegro than pronegro voters it must be remembered that this conclusion was the major assumption which led negro leaders to adopt the moratorium one may not therefore recoil from accepting its validation in the election results however repugnant and however open to question the validation may be it may well be that the leaders of core were correct when they refused to agree to the moratorium and when they argued that its adoption was a fundamental error but the ironic tragedy is that the moratorium on demonstrations presumably brought about within a few weeks a substantial diminution of antinegro feeling a second conclusion which may have been silently reached by many individuals is the judgment that we should be gratified and grateful that any significant white backlash vote in northern cities was eliminated from the presidential election this conclusion is premised on the assumption that the neutrality or apathy towards civil_rights by the white majority which is assertedly visible in the election results is better for the negro than a clearly antinegro vote would have been the fundamental premiseor mythwhich apparently leads to these conclusions is the concept that the negro needs friends in the white community and that the way to cultivate such friends is not to test their loyalty at the polls but to postpone negro demands during certain preelection periods those who rejoice at the absence of a notable white backlash vote in the election and who attribute its absence to the moratorium on demonstrations must also conclude that the loss of the friends for the freedom movement who would have been obtained if demonstrations had continued during the preelection period is clearly offset by the advantages to the negro people of an election where no northern communityunlike five southern statesexpressed its resentment against the negro by voting for a man who thought the civil_rights act of unconstitutional it is conceivable that the judgment of these persons may turn out to be correct but it is clear that there are so many imponderable and unknowable factors that it is simply impossible to make any overall judgment at this timeand perhaps everon the wisdom and the advisability of the moratorium what is very clear however is the fact that during the present interim period before the freedom movement resumes its militancy there are dangers fallacies and fears both for whites and negroes which need constant and careful analysis let us address ourselves to some of these pitfalls the negro backlash not many white persons have worried very much over any resentment and bitterness which may have understandably come into the hearts of negroes over the fact that their leaders felt impelled by the intensity of antinegro feeling among whites to suppress for days the negros right to present his grievances it may be that the virtue of longsuffering so remarkably present in the negro soul lias been in strumental in softening whatever resentment may have come about as a result of the addition of days to the years during which the american negro has patiently waited for freedom and equality but what can we say about the effect of the moratorium on those countless negroes who are aware of the frightening fact that the presumed extent of antinegro feeling in northern cities may well have brought about irreparable harm and irreversible trends in public opinion as a result of the disappearance for three months of a program by civil_rights organizations and ever more importantly will many negroes bowing to antinegro feeling in the white community succumb to the temptation to continue to substitute caution for courage or even try to forget the unendurability of the negros condition in america is it possible that the relative peace during the moratorium on civil_rights demonstrations could have had such an impact on both negroes and whites that most of the impetus of americas third revolution could disappear could a desire to have law and order be raised to a virtue above that of a hunger for justice could the mood of the northern white moderates dominate the orientation of the civil_rights movement could discretion be substituted for dynamism and prudence for progress as a result of the cessation of militancy for three months it is obvious that no one has the answers to these disturbing questions but what does emerge from the moratorium more clearly than ever before is the necessity of analyzing explaining and justifying the program of direct nonviolent action adopted by civil_rights leaders to bring justice and equality to the american negro relatively few white persons have apparently ever understood the mystique the purposes and the indispensability of a campaign of direct nonviolent action designed to eliminate the badges of slavery which still afflict the negro in america let us try therefore to probe deeply into the reasons why the negro feels that he can secure justice only by means of direct nonviolent action the reasons for direct nonviolent action in reinhold neibuhr wrote prophetically about the negros plight in his book moral man and immoral society in these words if anyone disagrees substantially with dr neibuhrs conclusion that the white majority will not give justice to the negro if it is not forced to do so he has a difficult and perhaps an impossible task in collecting evidence to support his view the negro leaders in america decided many years ago that the white majority would not yield if it is not forced to do so it is this fundamental premise which makes the campaign of direct nonviolent action indispensably necessary if one doubts the judgment that progress for the negro has come about only by forcing the white majority to yield he should recall the following recent events in negro history if one agrees that history demonstrates that the white majority in america must be forced to give justice to the negro the real issue then centers on the best way to bring about the required force the freedom movement has adopted a program of direct nonviolent actiona concept which needs constant explanation and analysis this program does not in any way minimize the necessity for continued recourse to the courts and to the legislatures but direct nonviolent action assumes that the ordinary political processes and the normal legal institutions of america cannot completely solve the problems of the negro prejudice is so deep white supremacy is so taken for granted and the negro is so downtrodden and poor that the ordinary legal processes cannot be expected to bring about the elevation of the negros status to substantial equality with the majority of white citizens only direct actiondramatic and continuouscan sear the conscience of the white majority and thereby bring about an improvement in the negros position direct action involves a confrontation in a positive manner requesting or demanding equality and justice it is not opposed or inconsistent with carrying on the struggle for negro freedom in the courts but it insists that the struggle must also be carried on in the streets in the parks in the mass media direct action is designed to portray injustice vividly and thereby to arouse the indignation of those in the white majority who care direct action has many faces it can be a protest against slumlords by a rent strike an orderly march on city hall to demand better schools for negroes or demonstrations at construction sites to remind the world that the unions involved in the construction have systematically excluded negroes from their membership direct action is the result of a conviction by the negro that he simply cannot rely on the moral sense of the white majority direct action is therefore a way to force the white man to give justice direct action is a cry of anguish frustration and anger from the other america direct action as employed by the freedom movement has always had the added element of nonviolence when the negroes in the late s started to assert their rights in the south by sitins and similar demonstrations they anticipated and expected violence in return from the white power structure hence the negroes resolved to resist violence with nonviolencein the noblest tradition and spirit of thoreau gandhi and all of those minorities in history who have practiced civil disobedience to unjust laws nonviolence and civil disobedience have not meant the same thing in northern cities as they have in the south in the north the law grants equality to all but prejudiced people deny equality in housing employment and education to nonwhite groups as a result the term passive resistance is probably a more descriptive and more accurate name for the program of direct action carried on by civil_rights groups in the north but the spirit and purposes of direct action in the north are the same as in the south in both places direct action is a means to dramatize injustice to protest inequality and to force the white majority to yieldthere are many white moderates and even liberals who have never understood or sympathized with the direct action programs of negro organizations these individuals are quick to criticize one of the few extremists examples of demonstrationsprobably unauthorized by any civil_rights organizationand point out the adverse effects which this protest allegedly had on white citizens but the point that the white moderate who is quick to criticize demonstrations misses is the central and crucial truth that law and morality have not solved the negro problem and that as a result the negro has quite understandably come to the conclusion that direct action is the only way by which he can secure equality and justice if the white moderate wishes to repudiate direct action as ineffective and inopportune he must first either prove that law and morality will in fact bring equality to the negro or in the alternative the white moderate must offer the negro a substitute for direct action it seems clear that there is a widespread and profound misunderstanding of the purpose and the necessity for direct nonviolent action the most fundamental cause of this misunderstanding is the common fallacy endorsed by countless americans that the negro will find his rightful place in american society just as every other ethnic or immigrant group has done although the naivete and the basic falsity of this supposition should be clear to everyone this totally unrealistic view of the negro predicament in america continues to find adherents the fact is of course that the negro cannot be analogized to the immigrant or to any other ethnic group in america the negros problems and predicament are unique and have never been experienced or confronted by any other white minority in america the negro has disabilities beyond the obvious one of color the fundamental disability or infirmity which the negro must contend with is his status as the only culturally deprived minority in the whole history of america every other ethnic group in america can trace its origins to a particular nation race and religion the negro has no ties and indeed no knowledge of the nation or religion of his ancestors he has been deprived of his culture and exists in america almost as a person separated from the mainstream of american culture both negroes and whites can sense the nobodiness of the american negro because of this characteristic the negro has a feeling of inferiority and a tendency to selfsegregation the same characteristic causes the white majority to have an unconscious feeling of superiority and an inclination to think that the negro should exist apart from or outside the mainstream of white culture it is because of this apartness of the negro from the white in america that a program of direct action is necessary to bring about equality for the nations twenty million nonwhite citizens without direct action the white majority will try to forget the plight of the negro the campaign of direct action conducted by civil_rights groups for several months prior to the moratorium in the summer of had educated and aroused the white majority more than at any other time in all of recent history in some places to be sure apathy turned into antagonism but in many other places apathy became acquiescence acceptance and even approval of the negros demands the dramatic progress of the negro in education and employment during the period from to the summer of is attributable in part to the fact that a sufficiently large number of citizens in the white community became aware of and angry about the injustices inflicted on negroes in america will that awareness and righteous anger fade away if a program of direct action is not resumed history suggests and indeed almost proves that the answer to that question is yes the white man in america will forget about the plight of the negrounless he is forced to remember direct action therefore cannot cease its necessity should shame the white man but its indispensability should never be forgotten by negro groups the immediate future will be a critically important period in the freedom movement negro organizations are understandably reluctant to reinitiate an extensive program of direct action while most whites do not have the insight or the courage to urge negroes to resume their militancy the vacuum which currently exists is a dangerous lulla period in fact when the northern counterpart of the southern white citizens council could be formed it is well to recall that the white citizens councils in the south were formed after a period of several months following the supreme courts famous desegregation mandate in may a period when a vacuum existed in southern leadership on civil_rights the white councils moved into this vacuum poisoned the atmosphere and formed a climate of opinion which has so successfully resisted the supreme courts mandate that in per cent of the deep souths negro children were still in segregated schools could antinegro movements move into the vacuum now present in northern cities due to the moratorium and to a cessation or diminution of negro militancy frightening events seem to suggest that such an eventuality is possible the passage of proposition in california by a to margin the massive resistance to the pairing of schools in new york city the fading enthusiasm of labor and industry for plans to train negro workersall of these are symptoms of the inveterate habit of the white majority to try to resolve the negro problem by attempting to deny its existence all persons therefore who are deeply interested in the future of the freedom movement must actively and articulately urge the resumption of a program of direct action by civil_rights groups the program may be modified in important ways because of the passage of the civil_rights act of but it must nonetheless be militant continuous and systematic events involving direct action must moreover be connected at least in a general way with some stated objectives direct action programs must not give the impression that they are simply the outburst of hitherto suppressed anger and frustration it seems clear that the resumption of negro militancy may depend more on the encouragement of white leaders than upon the initiative of negro groups negroes will understandably hesitate to recommence a program of direct action if they feel that only a few white leaders of public opinion will endorse and support it white leaders therefore are more than they realize the intellectual advisers and professional counsellors of the negro freedom movement the white majority or the leaders of public opinion within it are now whether they realize it or not the architects of the moral and social structure of northern cities for the foreseeable future the attitude toward negro aspirations among northern whites is at present characterized by ambiguity and ambivalence the moratorium on demonstrations during the presidential campaign has brought even more confusion and misunderstanding into the minds of innumerable white citizens in the north it is a truism to note that catholics will continue to be among the most influential leaders of public opinion in northern cities with regard to the race problem catholics in public life and in positions of influence in public and private education will have a crucial and decisive role to play in the struggle of the negro for equality in housing education and employment that struggle cannot end in victory without the active collaboration and the closest cooperation of the white majority and particularly of white public officials the world which our childrens children will inherit may well be determined by the moral climate which is created in the generation from to that climate will depend to almost a frightening degree on the attitudes and feelings of catholics in northern communities it is time therefore for catholics and all white citizens to reassert the legacy of human equality which more than any one doctrine expresses the essence of the freedom movement and it is also time for everyone who desires the negro to have full equality in american life to confess publicly that this ideal cannot be attained unless the negroes aided by their white associates resume and continue a program of direct nonviolent action without such a program the white majority will soon forget the plight of the negro and will settle down complacently into a society where de facto white supremacy prevails but with a wellorganized program of direct action the negro in america mayhopefully within the foreseeable futuremove into a world where race is irrelevant and human dignity is a respected ideal the sun striking in between the pillars of the cayuga county courthouse in the upstate city of auburn new york glinted across two large bronze plaques on either side of the entrance one honored william h seward a familiar name in history books the other plaque honored harriet tubman an unknown name it read why was this plaque to a black slave woman given such a place of honor in a northern city years ago if an important historical figure why have we not heard about her is it because she was a woman because she was a negro because she left no account of her deeds why although a fullblack unschooled slave harriet tubman was an active force in the civil war and she showed herself to be the worlds greatest heroine in the fight for personal freedom yet she has been almost forgotten harriet tubmans was not a life of service primarily devoted to the sick and suffering as was that of florence nightingale nor did she give her life in a single great burst of fanatical leadership as did joan of arc rather this runaway slave risked her life runaway times in the cause of freedom and she gave a wars worth of devoted nursing care and spying service for her country during those frothyheaded days of a century ago harriet tubman awakened the prewar era and civil war days to masterful adventure and sacrifice not knowing how to write she kept no written records of her trips on the underground railroad it was better so without looking back at the fears and hardships of former trips her faith carried her onward she lived with face turned toward the future but the lack of such records makes it impossible to recount exact detailed descriptions of her various trips with their individual crises only by piecing together the stories she told and that others recorded can a typical trip be reconstructed by morning tired they bedded down in the woods for an uneasy rest each snapping twig startled them into wideeyed fear by nightfall they were glad to be up again and on their way now they took to the dusty road harriet who had been over it a dozen times before knew her destination by dawn they reached the home of a free negro upon her signal the door opened and the group filed into the little place so many moses only a few can get into the potato hole this was a hole dug in the center of the hardpacked earth floor of the cabin where potatoes were stored it was a fine place for hiding refugees out of the wind and the rain well put as many as we can in there and the rest under the haystack by daylight there was no sign of the visitors the sunshine striking through the early mist fell on not one of them that night when they were again on their way harriet suddenly stopped and listened quickly she scuttled her charges into a thicket a baby cried she gave it a dose of paragoric it quieted none too soon the pounding of the horses hooves grew louder and the patrollers galloped past stopping a short distance beyond the little group could hear one patroller say we might as well give up after the patrollers had gone back harriet and the others laughed as they scrambled out of the bushes they say were fools but were not fools enough to keep on the road when we hear them coming she said they skirted the highway tramping through the night at daybreak harriet hid them in a clump of brush near a mosquitoinfested swamp it was the best she could do i a whispering relay would inform the slaves that harriet was preparing for another trip north they waited expectantly for her muted singing call that indicated she was ready to start finally it came a low husky voice sang outside the cabins one saturday night in the middle s the singing rose and fell with the fickle wind as it carried its message through the slave quarters of a maryland plantation moses is here moses has come to take another load to freedom on waves of the wind the singing words spread from cabin to cabin plantation to plantation dark forms shadows of the night glided silently to the source of the whispering melody taking shape the shadows became dark outlines of people who wanted to be guided north who came to plead with their moses to take them to the promised land harriet tubman the moses of her people chose her followers carefully they had to prove their conviction their courage that they had the physical stamina needed to endure the hundreds of tortured miles to freedom yet a woman with a young child might be among the travelers for harriet knew that a mother would not turn back if it meant her babys freedom when the group was selected the chosen ones went back to their cabins to make last preparations and say their goodbyes meantime harriet went to visit a free negro nearby jake well be needing your help again remember follow the patrollers and tear down the reward signs and she was gone the travelers each with a bit of food and a few precious trifles tied in a bandana listened for her whippoorwills call this signalled that moses was ready to leave the group took off through the woods on this saturday night their masters would not miss them until monday by then if all went well they would be miles away it was a cloudy night progress was slow without the north star to guide them still being close to home they could pick their way along the familiar little trails that led northward through the woods harriet tubman their moses urged them on making the most of this first night out while her followers were fresh and filled with enthusiasm for the adventure stay here she warned tve got to get us food in the village ill be back as soon as i cantoward dark dont come out you wait until you hear me sing if i singhail oh hail ye happy spirits death no more shall make you fear everything is safe but if i sing moses go down in egypt tell ole pharo let me go then you stay hidden as darkness settled over the road that evening the low sound of harriets singing told them all was well they came out to meet her she passed out the rations they ate as they trudged northward harriet tried to keep their minds off themselves by telling them tales although she herself had had little rest that day now she told them of her first trip north alone and not knowing the way or who was friend or foe i wondered if i should try itif i should leave my family behind she began as i listened to the stories told around the cabin i wanted more and more to be free one day i decided to run away to freedom it was worth it youll see while i was waiting for the day to leave i met john she went on with a sigh he was free i married him that didnt make me free but it did give me a nametubman i wanted to be free like him i got me a lawyerman he told me that my mother was to be freed when her young mistress died they never told her for they wanted her to go on working that meant i was really free i was going to be free or die i talked it over with john he was a good man but he was already free why should he run away then one day i heard that i was sold and was going to be shipped south i crept into the woods that night and ran away to freedomalone during the day i hid in the thickets like i heard tell at night i followed the north star i waded through swamps to hide my tracks from bloodhounds some people were kind and helped me but generally i didnt trust any one because id heard how even free negroes sometimes returned slaves to get the reward steps were beginning to lag theres rest ahead well soon be stopping harriet soothed the tired ones as they dragged on and then there it was the form of a house in the darkness harriet went to the door and knocked three times as was her custom no answering squeak of a door swinging open finally a head a white mans head appeared at an upstair window is before she could go on the man shouted down no he isnt he was run out of town last month for helping fugitivesand im staying here to catch the rest the window slammed down now harriet worked fast she hurried her charges across the fields keeping them carefully in a tight little group so that their shadows would not stretch out like tall men could they get away before the white man sounded the alarm they came to a river it looked broad and deep we cross it she ordered the men shrank back the women watched the men no one made a move to start into the water harriet fearful now that the hounds might already be on their trail waded in the water came up to her knees her waist her armpits her neckand then it began to recede seeing this the others followed carrying a baby high over head they were all safely across but wet and cold still there were no baying hounds to be heard but harriet would not allow a fire to be built the smoke might tell them where we are she said so with chattering teeth they sloshed on leaving a telltale trail of water behind them now worn out to fainting one man declared he could not go another step he begged harriet to take them back its better to be slaves than go on like this he pleaded im wore out you know theres no turning back if you go back now youll go to the chaingang for sure theres only one way thats ahead still the man demurred i cant go on im done in harriet was ready when strong measures were needed drawing her gun she said dead niggers tell no tales you go onor die the man stumbled to his feet the little party continued plodding northward one tired foot dragging after the other resting by day and traveling by night they were a little farther north each morning one evening harriet exhausted fell asleep without warning this was a failing of hers since a blow on her head when she was in her teens they looked at her leaning up against a tree fast asleep this was a chance for the disheartened they could take the gun from her pocket they could leave go back but they were far from home now they could not find their way back alone and during these days and nights in which she had cared for them and had told them stories of her past and of other trips their trust in her had increased they waited in a short time harriet awoke looked around and took up the march and the story she was telling where she left off as if nothing had happened she went on to tell them about thomas garrett the good quaker who gave every fugitive that stopped at his house a pair of new shoes as they neared wilmington delaware harriet knew that this time her group was too big to go unchallenged she made them remain hidden while she went for help returning with two men she divided the party into three groups each went in a different direction for two days the groups remained hidden and apart finally they met they were glad to be reunited having come to feel secure together in the early morning several men in an empty wagon crossed the bridge from wilmington to the country as they passed the sentries at the bridge they hailed them and rattled on when they returned that evening their cart was loaded with hay the sentries recognizing the men who had crossed in the morning motioned them on talking and laughing they clattered across the bridge into town under the hay the fugitives rode into the city after devious ruses the group finally reached the back door of thomas garretts shoe shop at dawn garrett led the fugitives up the back stairs at the head of the stairs was a wall lined with rows of shoe boxes the travelers looked at them greedily remembering harriets tale garrett pulled out one of the boxes but instead of opening it he tucked it under his arm then he said be very quiet for the store is right under here if you are quiet you will be quite safe he put his hand in the hole left by the empty box and the entire wall swung round gaping the group followed harriet as silently the wall swung back into place they were in a large windowless room lighted by a long skylight looking up they saw the blue sky looking around they saw a wash stand some clothing piled high on a chair and blankets neatly folded by the wall wrapping in the blankets they dropped to the floor and no longer worried about pursuers succumbed to their need of rest accustomed by now to awakening with the dusk they were up and had the blankets folded when mrs garrett brought in a huge tray of steaming food this was their first hot meal since leaving maryland as they ate she talked softly with harriet when they were finished she turned to the group try on the clothes she said and helped them find suitable outfits after garrett had closed up shop and the protection of darkness surrounded them he led them down stairs each one was fitted with a pair of new shoes refreshed reclothed and reshod they started out once more but this time it was not the disheartened little band it had been when it entered with new respectability they stepped forth from now on the way was smoother for here the abolitionists quakers and free negroes were ready to help stops were closer conditions were better and often wagon rides made the journey easier still they did not feel safe the fugitive slave law of made it mandatory for anyone recognizing slaves to return them to reach pennsylvania was no longer enough it was necessary to reach canada before freedom was sure so on through new york to albany and across the state in syracuse they stopped at larin loguens house a free negro and former slave he kept them a few days to rest as he sent word on ahead that the party would be coming in rochester frederick douglass another well known free negro took over their care finally they crossed the new niagara falls bridge they were free this reconstructed trip composed of actual happenings gives some measure of the hardships harriet tubman and her followers endured all her trips were like this in two respects the traveling was always done at night and every trip was successful although each trip was unique varying according to circumstances each weighed hope against suffering naturally details and maneuvers changed according to need for each trip had its own emergencies but harriet was able to cope with all the mishaps unfailingly she reached the land of freedom with her little groups she was never caught with her contrabands sometimes if pursuers were hot after the group it might double back on its path taking a train going south no one would suspect southbound slaves of running away in later years harriet used another device even more daring she started out with the masters horse and surrey the fugitives hidden within anyone seeing a slave driving his masters horse would conclude that he was on an errand for his master harriet had many close escapes once she carried two live chickens to distract attention as she entered a village where she had lived suddenly she saw her old master round a corner and come her way quickly she let the chickens go they flew over a fence with the negro woman racing after them the man laughed unaware that he was watching his old slave so she succeeded in avoiding him another time in a railroad station she heard a man standing near her read a description of her to his friend unschooled she opened a book she had praying that she was holding it right one of the men seeing her said this cant be the one the runaway woman cant read harriets early trips took the fugitives to one of the northern states later trips terminated in canada she remained long enough to help them find quarters food and jobs then working until she had enough money saved for the next trip she left to lead another group north to freedom vs m harriet tubman was born in eastern maryland around by the time she was sixyearsold she knew the heartache of being separated from her family the backache of working beyond her years and the searing ache of the whip cutting into her flesh she understood the fear of being sold like an animal away from her family and she sensed the cringing hatred of many slaves toward their masters although she had never been inside a schoolroom by the time harriet was she had learned much to prepare her for later life from old ben her father she learned what roots and berries were edible he showed her how to stalk silently through the woods like an indian and he taught her how to steer a course by the north star harriets weeknight education was gleaned from listening to the negroes gathered about the cabin they told of their african past and of their superstitions they told of remedies they concocted from roots and herbs to bring them back to health they talked of god who was very near to help them in their tribulations but always the talk turned night after night to slave uprisings turners rebellion and to runaway slaves reaching the north and freedom on the underground railroad they would say but nobody seemed to know just what or where this railroad was they mentioned it in reverent whispers as though when the time came god would show them how to find it and when the right time did comeharriet too followed the north star via the underground railroad to freedom she was about at the time she waded through swamps and crossed streams to hide her trail from the longeared hounds when she learned her next stop from the conductor at each station finally crossing the line to the north which meant freedom harriet looked down at her hands theyre the same black hands but im as free as though they was white reaching philadelphia harriet found work and freedom but she did not find happiness im free but theres nobody to welcome me to freedom here im a stranger up here in this strange place my home and my friends they be in maryland still a plan to remedy this soon formed in her mind she was free others should be free with her and she made her dream come true during the following years harriet used all her ingenuity her friends in both the north and the south and her money toward one end freeing more of her people over the years in her trips south she led more than slaves to the free north every trip was successful she gave counsel and directions to many groups that were responsible enough to start out without her and there is no counting those individuals who gained courage to flee to the north and freedom from hearing stories of her heroic successes each slave arriving in the north meant another crippling blow to slavery every freed slave added another worker to the abolitionist ranks as more and more of her people reached freedom in the north harriet tubman was no longer a stranger in a strange land as tales of her trips on the underground railroad became legend she became known as moses for she was the leader of the exodus of the slaves from the south she was the guide of a slave people to a land of freedom after succeeding magnificently in her efforts harriet was determined to take her parents north but they presented a problem now old they were unable to trek the long miles undaunted harriet went after them she made a makeshift wagon and started out with them reaching a railroad station she put them aboard for wilmington thomas garrett provided money for continuing them on their journey to canada by rail in john brown wanted harriet general tubman as he called her to join his forces but overwork and exposure had finally caught up with her she was too ill to join him in his uprising at harpers ferry but he became one of her heroes to whom she referred as the emancipator of my people when the civil war broke out harriet offered her services doing any job given her she managed to help her own staying close to the line she directed negroes to security as they came through harriets description of one of the battles is vivid and then we saw the lightning and that was the guns and then we heard the thunder and that was the big guns and then we heard the rain falling and that was the drops of blood falling and when we came to get in the crops it was dead men that we reaped she worked with her people in war hospitals the conditions were terrible as she describes them id go to the hospital every morning id get a big chunk of ice and put it in a basin and fill it with water then id take a sponge and begin first man id come to id thrash away the flies and theyd rise like bees around a hive then id begin to bathe the wounds and by the time id bathed off three of four the fire and heat would have melted the ice and made the water warm and itd be as red as clear blood then id go and get some more ice and by the time i got to the next one the flies would be around the first ones black and thick as ever after working in the hospital all day harriet spent part of the night baking pies and gingerbread and making a keg of root beer to sell in the camps in this way she provided for her meagre needs until then colonel montgomery enlisted harriets services as a spy in the south as a negro woman she could wedge her way into places that a white man could not enter without suspicion her courage and cunning always brought her back safely following a plan resulting from one of her spying missions she went up the combachee river in south carolina with colonel montgomery and about negro troops in three gunboats as they appeared the confederate troops withdrew from the shore putting off a few soldiers along the way they soon spread word that lincolns gunboats were coming to free the slaves the slaves came down to the river in droves hayforks still in their hands women carrying babies and food some leading animals their owners threats and whippings could not stop them the rowboats were soon loaded but by making several trips at each point all were taken aboard the gunboats on one of harriets missions the commonwealth a boston newspaper on july says colonel montgomery and his gallant band of black soldiers under the guidance of a black woman dashed into the enemys country many and many times she has penetrated the enemys lines and discovered their situation and condition and escaped without injury but not without extreme hazard harriet was becoming a legend some said that she was a man who could see in the dark like a cat some said that she could fly over rivers and see into enemy territory like a bird some claimed that she had a way with animals so that no bloodhound would trace her nor any watchdog give warning of her presence when on january lincoln proclaimed the negroes free the union had to assume responsibility for keeping order among them for supplying them with provisions for caring for them northern dogooders offered their services for rehabilitating the negroes although they knew very little about them harriet acted as liaison between these northern forces and the negroes suddenly bewildered by their freedom harriet tubman had been promised a soldiers wage the pay of negro soldiers had been cut in half but she decided to take hers and to return to her parents in the north for she was worried about them she found she was unable to collect her wages for serving as a war nurse harriet did however receive a halffare travel pass but when she used it the conductor cursing threw her into the baggage car in the doing he seriously wrenched her arm and shoulder tired and sick with aching arm the fearless fighter traveled north as baggage it was one of the inconsistencies of the war that after serving throughout the conflict without mishap that on her way home she should experience her only war injury and with it suffer an ordeal that proved to her that the negro was still not truly free on this return trip harriet anticipated making a home for her aged parents in auburn new york where through the help of secretary of state seward she had acquired a little place she hoped once more to work outofdoors in a garden it was well that she enjoyed this kind of labor for soon her home became a stopping place for the distressed shortly she was raising food and money to care for the helpless and ill who remained with her for she would not turn a needy person away as fast as she got money she spent it on others she could see no purpose in saving when others needed what her money could buy as a result she was always in need influential friends appealed to the pension committee in washington on her behalf but even her friend seward could not get the committee to vote funds for this deserving heroine who had served her country so faithfully every time the matter came up it was shelved until it took on proportions of a government scandal in john tubman harriets husband who could not go north with her who had taken another woman as his wife two months after harriet ran away was murdered so when nelson davis arrived at her home ill with tuberculosis she married him the better to care for him in he died harriet was again alone but now as the wife of a war veteran she was pensioned at first her pension was eight dollars a month since she was by now well known newspaper articles took up the pension matter finally the government acceded to popular demand and harriet was granted a month for the rest of her life in her later years she turned her attention to getting a hospitalhome for those of her race looking for a suitable location she attended an auction for a plot of ground near her home in auburn she describes herself at that auction there i was like a blackberry in a pail of milk she finally managed to pay for this land and to build the hospitalhome she had dreamed of but a few years after her death it closed its doors her energy and enthusiasm alone had kept it running she willed the home to the ame zion church the house has been repaired and is now being used as a manse for the church but one room has been set aside as a memorial museum to the worlds greatest heroine of personal freedom when harriet tubman died in auburn n y on march she was tendered a military funeral now that she was gone the citizens of the city recognized that an unsung hero of the civil war and the moses of a people had been one of their neighbors as a memorial july was set aside as harriet tubman day in auburn a memorial service was held a plaque was set up in her honor at the entrance to the court house and flags were lowered to halfmast for this black woman in a city of whites the great trees bloomed red saffron purple and gold as late fall lingered sad and splendid on old screamer mountain at clayton georgia and lillian smith anal yst artist and prophet of the south beheld the last bright blaze of the ebbing year restive in the benign embrace of old screamers gentle peaks miss smith peoplehungry in her hilltop isolation and illness nevertheless was ablaze too with work study ideas and her apparent triumph over her sixth cancer she talked with love solemn thought and a lot of bite of herself and her work of mankinds grand advance through the aeons of this piddling present person or that one of southern sins and northern complacency of teensyweensy writing by deep narrow talents of mens hostility toward serious women andwith most faith and fascinationof this crucial time in the history of humans when we are so close together as thinking beings that our intellects push and polish each other into new brilliance to light gods destiny for mental man at sixtysix miss smithwhose strange fruit shocked north and south and was read around the world in and ever since whose profound and audacious analysis of dixie killers of the dream became a classic and whose one hour was received indifferently because it was about decent upperclass cultivated southerners the northern critics dont know about and dont want to believe inwell now miss smith who never did want to write about race but just about people has decided she wont talk about civil_rights any more unless it is a matter of duty and housekeeping she explained that all her life as the middle daughter of a large welltodo highminded southern family has been shared between mary the creative one the artist and martha who tends the house and cleans up the mess often the two have merged in the demands of conscience and art and have fed one another so marthas chores helping her father after a depression business failure with a girls camp at their summer home in clayton speaking and writing for important causes nursing her mother in her last four years of illness ministering to this troubled brother sister or friendprovided experience and perception for mary miss smith considers perhaps twenty per cent of her output of countless magazine stories pamphlets seven books innumerable lectures tv and radio discussions and talks with needful groupsto be martha work such is now is the time a simple and vivid little tract as she terms it calling on white southerners after to meet the racial change with love and justice a book she feels was smothered by publishers subject to angry pressure her new book pages of monologues accompanying photographs of the negro direct action movement our faces our words w w norton written in dire illness after a precarious pneumonia may be called martha work she thinks but there is high artistry in miss smiths penetration of the aims sorrows and heroisms of black and white boys and girls pushing and enduring the movement and in her idiomatic and poetic expression of their feelings and thoughts this little book may be the truest picture of these nonviolent young revolutionaries to come out of the fearful spate of good and bad writing about the negro revolt miss smith talked fiercely and carefully and often laughing in the huge pine living room of her cabin house once a part of the girls camp laurel falls with its window wall open to the double mountain ridge and blue skya wildly gorgeous invasion of the spacious comfort and taste of the big room which a lesser woman might not sustain without draw draperies but miss smith slight and vivid in black pants and a figured shirt her strong fair face ravaged by pain and thought and crowned with a shimmering cloud of softly curling white hair her big dark eyes intense looked a valiant and vigorous match for old screamer mountain and his wild autumn she reminded me also that in her twelveyear war with cancer she always looks her luminous best under death sentence ill look lovely in my coffin she promised happily im somewhat naturally an optimist she mused thats not to say i dont see evil ive always seen evil since i was three years old and i continue to see it everywhere but ive always been positive in my feelings almost in my bloodstream that good is stronger my optimism about the world and human experience has not always been intellectually understood though i just felt it the book which has influenced me more than any other book on the face of the earth is tielhard de chardins the phenomenon of man this great paleontologist a jesuit priest believed that we can think of man in no other way than in sweeping spans of time and when i read himhe is hard i grub away at himi knew why the cynics from beatsville to sartre and existentialism were wrong because they were thinking of mans experience in time spans of maybe a thousand years when it seemed to me one must think of man in times of or half a million years chardin sees mans purpose the purpose of it allas achieving more and more complex forms of life and more quality this is what evolution is and since it is chardin believes that man was planned by the great creator finally man appeared and then a certain point was reached in this purposeful evolution when man began to think man began to participate in his own evolution man grows in his mind julian huxley is a great optimist and a stronger mind than aldous he says we must not look at one hundred years nor twenty thousand or fifty thousand years because the movement toward purpose is so slow miss smith paused and smiled relishing the huxley minds and then went on her whole person inclining persuasively with her talk her fine small hands cupping ideas and qualifications and her face smiling wondering and frowning dramatizing her sentences what has been done in the last one hundred years is the most critical point she pronounced in grave excitement change always comes in evolution the first time people get very close together and the human temperature has gone way up there is great heat in our proximity our crowding together and this is the heat that transforms us i wrote in the revived killers of the dream that man is evolving and participating in his own evolution now that he has a mind and that it is increasing rapidly in brilliance as it is pushed and polished by other minds this coming together acceleration and proliferation of thought this great change that is upon us is one reason for our tremendous anxiety today of course anxiety comes along with thought and great questions and enormous change it explains the goldwater people they realize we are at a critical point and they cant understand it so theyre using race and segregation as a dead end in which to crawl and stay out of the troubling future she talked of tired and troubled young personalities in the negro movement battered from the suffering and courage it demands in the resistant south some of whom come by to see me kids from the north and california and of more than one white southern activist whom miss lil and her friend paula snelling have entertained and mothered in the restoring haven of beautiful hills good food civilized comfort and searching talk this one poor little thing has more trouble than the movement another one has literary talent a lot of them political confusion and another one a firstrate mind real quality there are others former campers and proteges at camp laurel falls who come back for introspection talk and miss lils examination of their troubles until i sometimes think ill have to hang out a shingle and bill them for psychoanalysis miss smith made a face of distaste for the appraisal of her as that earnest little old lady up on the mountain who wants the negroes to have everything for the negroes and the witless tribe of readers and critics who stereotype her as a race writer and dont appreciate what she considers her best work she recalled her first awakening to the ugliness of color as a girl teaching music in china where white missionaries and british colonialists barred chinese from parks swimming pools and clubs she realized it was the same as the southern thing in china my brain woke up i knew the trouble was worldwide and ive never thought otherwise i never talk about civil_rights if i can help it thats housekeeping cleaning up the mess im interested in the whole thing the meaning of the whole thing that this massive defense of segregation of inhuman experience is a symptom of our dehumanization almost total dehumanization looking back on her work she made her own appraisals literary people dont like me very much she observed scientists philosophers painters people of the theater do like me in the last few years ive been so very ill with long hours of reflecting ive reread my books and evaluated them from my own point of view i would not change a word maybe in strange fruit my fumbling beginning and poorest novel might add two or three more chapters in the center because i left out a southerner of subtlety and with a complex grasp of the south which no character in the book really had laura the artist and sister of the troubled boy could have represented this southerner but it was my flrst novel and i didnt have the technique to let her into it without becoming awkwardly philosophical then this great weakness keeps strange fruit from being great it is my most famous novel but one hour is my best i think strange fruit was the first book in the united states which treated negroes as human beings she remembers with satisfaction the originality and distinction of south today which she and miss snelling published from clayton from to started as a journal strictly of literature and arts with no remote notion of discussing race at all the little magazine did however publish stories articles and poetry by southerners of both races range audaciously into race and politics and got up to a circulation of despite troubles with a friendly but horrified printer whose conscience on one occasion would not let him print a race piece and some post office censorship in atlanta which was resolved in washington and i just couldnt take georgia that year she remembered shaking her shining white head to wake up every morning to insults in the newspapers friends falling away and people turning their faces when i passed then we really knew who our friends were and there were some great ones newspaper comments on the author of strange fruit included one atlanta columnists description of the novel as an orgasm and anothers appraisal of the novelist as a sexobsessed old woman who he suggested could not attract white men and settled for negro men and in the curious southern way while miss smith was and is a favorite and favored citizen of the little town of clayton she has had three vigilante fires on her mountaintop and some property and uncounted letters manuscripts and book notes have disappeared while friends fell away and newspapers and preachers tore to pieces my reputation as a woman welltodo parents of laurel falls campers rallied handsomely only four parents withdrew their daughters and forty others applied for the vacancies and no one tried officially to ban the novel or killers of the dream in the south they just squeezed them out or smothered them at any rate she lived between brooklyn and clayton for six years of celebrity travel work and friendship with some of the top minds in the country she objects to readers calling killers of the dream a freudian interpretation of the south im a great admirer of freud a great mind the greatest of all in his field who opened the gate and explored the heart she said some of his disciples could go beyond him because he made the great beginning he failed i think on the collective unconscious and jung did things freud never got to freud was an intellectual as against jung who was more of an artist intuitively grasping truths that were lost on freud freud used reason i dont genuflect easily but i do here so that i hate to point out the gaps in his great accomplishment killers of the dream is my knowledge and understanding and interpretation of the south the way i lived and studied and experienced and know the south to be if it happened to coincide with some of freuds theories well so it did miss smith mused over current letters now and then in smiling joy and here and there in fierce distaste or weary disapproval criticism today is at a very low point everybody agrees to that no critics today actually love books rather they want to fight writers and peopleto praise or damn them personally we have a disease called faulknerism there is no future in faulkners books he never wrote about his equals he has created no decent women he loathes females and it shows in his work camus is great i dont think sartre is except in his plays and melodramas i dont like anybody really who leaves the future out of his writing were stepping into an enormous future and any great writer must have a vision of that future i dont know a single negro writer who can write about white people they dont understand them neither hate nor fear gives understanding only love does but white people have written truly of negroes because they loved them respected them and believed in them as persons thats the greatest trouble the negro artist has today his feelings against white people make it impossible to create a white character real and whole thirty years ago white writers had the same trouble and wrote of negroes only in stereotypes any valid literary creation takes love i always loved truman capote he always writes with love imagination and delicacy carson mccullers is a beautiful small talent just beautiful nobody writes better of certain aspects of life in perfectly pure memory of childhood i really dont enjoy any american literary writers very much our literary world is not very intellectual oh they have all done nice things you can relish i like european writersthev have an intellectual content we and some of the europens too are still talking about the things dostoevski talked about in were a brainless lot im not still talking in though not still one hundred years behind in thinking and perhaps that is why my writing is more recognized by scientists and intellectual people than by literary people miss smith sternly dissents from the current liberal notion that in race prejudice and negro disadvantage the north and the south are the same the difference in the north and south is the difference between a neurosis and a psychosis she said were sick people racism has made us sick at every level of our culture we kill and they dont in the north its a matter of blindness prejudice and indifference you can be merely prejudiced with out killing people but in the south we kill them then in the south not one of us has escaped in the north millions have you can live there all your life and never see harlem it wont hurt you youre not responsible for it any more than you are for china but we cant get away from it in the south many of us have tried to but every time you walk out your door there are the signs the walls the inhuman dehumanizing separation to manipulate you i could cry when i think how white children have suffered from this the north has a tremendous urban problem complicated by race but we sent the negroes up north we drove them up there the north didnt write letters of invitation asking for them now our people whom we drove away are metamorphosed into victims of the ghetto poverty crime and enough problems to beat us all to death where the north was disturbed in its own psychic organization showed in yankee willingness to be foreign missionaries to us instead of home missionaries to their own black ghettos blaming the south shaking off their own responsibility on the south this maimed the personalities of most northeners with false moral complacency regarding southern community after community desegregating for peace for profit for law and order for business as usual miss smith still thinks the south may lead the way for the nation to racial justice and amity but first she declared solemnly we must humbly confess our sins and ask forgiveness we must suffer more than we havenot because were the southbut to deny old ways and come to right and wisdom how each individual must do it newspapers must acknowledge and espouse the brave truth preachers must preach it in church teachers must teach it in school now were not doing that at all were just sweeping the truth under the rug and not acknowledging our brutal sins and asking forgiveness and our sins are terrible we must face them were moving beautifully she said with a quick bright smile lighting up her face like a girls of course in atlanta you open up everything and never think about why you closed up everything in the first place you must confess your sins and ask forgiveness well never move out of our trouble without this moral act she protested that dangerous writer ayn rand who has the strongest following of any writer in the united states with the dictum anybody who says he can live his own life and be responsible to nobody else is a wicked fool we dont have to be dependent nor can we be independent we must be lovingly and respectfully interdependent the very elegance of the human race is in the love and concern which every member of it always felt for someone else if we do not have this then we have lost our minds and have become evil theres always much talk about the south thats because its a state of mind of white supremacy but my dear always remember that theres a male and female south which are two different entities then theres a black south and a white south which are two more cleavages that makes four souths the south has usually meant the male white south it does not need to mean that any more and indeed it doesnt it is clear that miss smith knows we shall overcome from mccomb mississippi to harlem and stanleyville and shanghai and it is clear that we means gods good thinking human beings under some peculiar quota system it seems that the american public can entertain or lionize only one negro writer at a time thus the price we pay for the justifiable audience granted james baldwin is the unwarranted neglect of richard wright this is a pity because though they have much in common there is much that holds them apart for one thing as evidenced by his recent novel and play baldwin is not at his artistic best when trying in fictional form to make those objective quasiinstructional statements which his social awareness impels him to make he writes directly from his emotions and their expression is the key to what is best in his writing whereas in wright perhaps more than in any other writer of our time except george orwell the combination of involvement and detachment is exactly right to seek out meaning without the tone either of facile preaching or of jeremiad and rather than burdening their fiction it was with both wright and orwell just this seeking that gave life and drama to their novels in any case baldwin and wright are in no way interchangeable a fact that would be too obvious to mention if they were not negroes and therefore to a great part of the public mind indistinguishable aside from their talents they have mainly in common their anger but again they are negroes and writers and this is not an exceptional quality for either american literature has had after all a long train of angry writersone has only to name dreiser or farrell or fast and the negro has just gotten on the end of the train it has taken him a long time to get on board and he has done so at a time when so many of the formerly angry seem to have assuaged their wrath and to have departed for the suburbs where adultery has become the only irritant to their artistic sensibilities it is very important to relate richard wright to this american tradition of angry literature for it is this allegiance that prevents him from being just another negro writer after wright it is probably no longer possible to be just a negro writer he was an american writer it is this distinction that makes wright so important and this that creates such bias in assessing him though he could not avoid an intensely racial awareness he had escaped from the parochial viewpoint it is only a few decades from the major jewish migrations to ludwig lewisohn it is eighty years from the irish migrations to james t farrell but it is over two centuries from the great slave importations to richard wright three centuries from phyllis wheatley the cultured boston slave girl writing dainty english lyrics to the first writer whose consciousness was acutely negro and acutely american if richard wright had written only uncle toms children those four novellas with which he first attracted critical attention his place would have been clear and assured he would have been the outstanding negro writer of his time avidly read by a wide negro audience sympathetically read by those white americans who could be touched by the plight of their negro fellow citizens who could at least respond humanly to pathos as wright confessed he had written stories to make an audience even bankers daughters cry the image he had evoked had as his title indicated been handed down from uncle toms cabin and was the image of the negro maintained by every writer black or white from douglass to fast intent upon creating a favorable impression negroes were goodhearted generous wellmeaning people pathetically suppressed by southern bigotry wrights triumph as an artist was his singleminded determination to get at the truth behind this stereotype as clearly as any other this image was no more complete than the bigots stereotype was in fact compatible with it for if the good darkies were still just that after decades of persecution if they thrived on it wasnt it after all the way to handle them and behind both stereotypes lay the truth that centuries of the souths peculiar institution did more than suppress a people it corrupted them and that corruption was an irresponsible rampant dangerous thing that could destroy corrupted and corrupter alike so wright said of his first novel native son that he was writing a book so hard and deep that they would have to face it without the consolation of tears the hero bigger is a youthful criminal with no ambition except a wistful desire to be an airline pilot and no respect for home family church law or life either black or white perhaps not even his own he accidentally kills the first white woman who has ever treated him humanly but he had already been contemplating raping her he then mutilates and burns the body and tries to collect ransom from the girls father his kindly employer finally he kills his girl friend when the murder is discovered to prevent her giving him away bigger was a bitter draught for those whom uncle toms children had made lachrymose it is doubtful that any white person has ever been moved to pity bigger it is almost impossible to condescend to him that way nor did bigger sit well with those negroes who preferred white america to think black america was still content with offhanded paternalism and willing to go slow toward equality wasnt wright giving fuel to those who said the negro must be kept in his place and those to whom go slow meant at least a millenium had they read native son would not have been able to neglect bigger either they would have found him too like the demon which their paternalistic code of casual cruelty of brutal kindness of genial despotism had tried to appease and subjugate for them to read with any satisfaction wrights indictment of them for having created by that code a subnation of million biggers within the borders of the united states it was one of the constant ironies of richard wrights career that having created what must certainly be the least likeable negro protagonist in our literature he was thereafter continually assailed with charges of negro chauvinism and racial bitterness that were never raised against his first book certainly there is bitterness but it seems called for and firmly grounded in the artistic frame of the novel the charge of chauvinism seems dubious there are in all of wrights novels white men of genuine goodwill whom wright does not belittle for their inability to effect a solution what was offensive was simply the truth it had taken three centuries for someone to look in both directions across that boundary line between races and tell the truth about what he saw and the negro was as hesitant to acknowledge what wright said as was the white man because he had given away the negros most guarded secret the secret he kept because he was afraid of reprisal and which the whites would never try to uncover because their total rationalization of the negros place in american society was constructed to deny it that the black man could hate his white neighbor could envy him and was capable of wishingperhaps carrying outhis destruction multiply bigger thomas twelve million times and you have the psychology of the negro people let us not concern ourselves with the part of bigger thomas confession that says he murdered accidentally who knows when another accident involving millions of men will happen an accident that will be the dreadful day of our doom asks biggers white lawyer and the authors mouthpiece out of his anger wright was always raising this cry this warning which those who did not want to hear dismissed as a biased threat bigger is within each and every negro thus his last book before his death was titled white man listenhis last strident warning which those who preferred obsequiousness to truth took for a threat not to white america alone but to the white race to avoid tragic blindness in dealing with the new nonwhite powers of africa and asia after native son over a decade passed before richard wright published his second novel the outsider by this time wright had been living in paris for a few years and to the criticisms of the earlier novel was added the charge that he was out of touch with america actually the reviews of the outsider in the liberal white press show merely how out of touch white america was how stubbornly the import of what wright had been shouting was being ignored the outsider is not a good book although with all his fiction it shares that excitement that electrifying realism of sensation and violence which is his trademark as surely at it is dashiell hammetts to whom wright has acknowledged a debt the plot is far from simple cross damon its hero is a postal employee with a tiresome wife and a pregnant mistress through mistaken identification with a body in a subway crash he is thought dead takes another identity kills a former buddy when he is about to be discovered joins the communist party and manipulates its leaders for his own ends finally killing two of its leaders out of disgust and is ultimately trapped by a brilliant detective who is like cross an outsider it is melodramatic and strung on a series of implausible coincidences it is his one book where the intellectual rhetoric existential does not cohere to the action but these serious technical flaws aside the reviewers also found its protagonist unmotivated by they were sophisticated enough to understand bigger a poor abused slum negro a stunted brute who hardly knew what he was doing but cross damon is a highly intelligent and educated man a reader of innumerable books a man who has been to a university why should he walk out on everything live by violence disavow all moral rules a man today who believes that he cannot live by the articles of faith of his society is a criminal damon declares it is not necessary to follow the trappings of existentialist dogma that wright invokes fo realize that the negro is by this definition a criminal he has only to realize and accept it to be an outsider clearly because cross is a negro even the reviewers saw that the rules did not apply that is why they cannot see the motivation for dissatisfaction in this brilliant man with his post office job government security and potential retirement in thirty years what more could a negro want there is an implied and subtle barrier to equality of opportunity for cross which is as impenetrable and unavoidable as that in wrights autobiographical account of being forced out of a job because he expressed interest in learning an operation which was white mans work the articles of faith of his society do not necessarily apply to him this has of course been the fate in variable degree of every persecuted minority group in america but the negro has more than any other group been defenseless to its stigma unlike the other major groups only the negro has had no distinctive subcultural values toward which he could proudly turn and snub the larger society coming as captured individuals moved about as chattel having frequently no common language but that of the slavemaster no common religion but that of the slavemaster having no communal existence that was not subject to the slavemaster the negro could not possibly either have imported or created a distinctive subculture he could only adopt the forms he saw about him negro culture is a shadow of the total culture as no other american subculture is and being such its major distinction is its inferiority negro culture is a poor substitute for a fully integrated culture of black and white and exists because by its own standards its members are inferior thus the negro who cannot live by the articles of faith in the larger society must reject also his racial society and exist as an unrelated individual a criminal an outsider the district attorney who traps damon is an intellectual and a hunchback a freak in a manner analogous to that in which the ne gro is a freak in american society and he is therefore quicker to sense damons individuality damon is not able as he has been before to conceal himself behind the negro stereotype to become invisible as a person his disgust and hatred of the society that excludes him are in the open when in white man listen wright tells of the negro who accused him of giving away racial secrets by discussing negro and african psychological attitudes with a white man he is again revealing that selfsame secret that covert hatred it is what the reviewers found unmotivated about cross damon wright gives in his autobiography a terrifying account of a real variant of this type in the person of the elevator operator who short of money refused to take a white passenger to his floor until he paid a quarter for which the white man could have the privilege of kicking him he is a criminal as much as cross though he has foregone his pride to objectify his position in society and as clearly as cross out of his masochism he is making the white man pay for the punishment he inflicts the long dream was wrights last full length novel and like its predecessor it was held up as evidence of his estrangement from the american scene and yet in this chronicle of a negro boy growing up in the american south wright had written the finest and fullest exposition of the corruption of sec ond class citizenship since his autobiography useless to say as of bigger that he was only one brutalized individual caught in an hostile environment useless to exclude cross damon as a faulty abstraction in a world of coincidences the world of fishbelly the hero of the long dream is very real and fishbelly is very normal and his southern society is very real and very normal and very familiar only that reality is corrupt and that corruption is so normal to it that almost no one can consider changing it it is a society where a black mans respectability must be founded on illegal enterprise because legal enterprise would bring him into forbidden competition with whites it is a society where the local government accepts rakeoffs from the illegal enterprise and still can demand servility from the owner because he is black it is a world corrupt enough to reduce any man of goodwill to bewilderment or to cynicism thus the one white man of authority who is sincerely concerned with justice without prejudice is totally baffled and repulsed by the corrupt complex of black and white by the seemingly innate suspicion and dissembling of the negro victims he is trying to help through fear and habit they cannot escape assuming the traditional postures of stereotypes in which they can conceal their defiant hatred at the end of this novel fishbelly now a grown man is in the path of his creator on a plane bound for france wrights conclusion is clear and unequivocal it is not possible for a negro to live as a citizen in this country in the year there was still visibly andmore terribly imbedded in the heartinvisibly the poisonous blight of second class citizenship criminals or exiles this was the choice wright offered the american negro a lot had happened to america and to the negro in particular in the two decades during which wright published the three novels his autobiography and five other books four of them concerned with the black mans burden and yet so little of it is really mirrored in the successive novels it appears only by innuendo bigger is a slum negro with little education cross a lowermiddle class renegade intellectual and fishbelly totally middleclass in outlook for the first two there is no escape no exit except death fishbelly looks forward to a pleasant exile it is progress but it is not very much progress and yet the long dream was published in four years after the supreme court had handed down the school desegregation decision two years after the montgomery bus boycott a year after u s troops had enforced the enrollment of negro students in little rocks central high school nowhere does wright show a cognizance of this march of events the increasing legal economic and moral pressure for equality was wright out of touch after all no wright never lost touch with the one crucial truth that continued to concern him the truth which to him is central to an understanding of the racial dialogue and which the white man must heed at whatever cost to his selfimage which the negro must confess at whatever cost to his the existence of bigger for as wright said there are more biggers than i could count and more than you suspect wright had already stated in million black voices the aspirations of the american negro as tersely as they could possibly be stated we want what others have the right to share in the upward march of american life the only life we remember or have ever known men are moving and we shall be with them bigger said wright was trying to react to and answer the call of the dominant civilization he was an american because he was a native son but he was also a negro nationalist in a vague sense because he was not allowed to live as an american bigger then is not just the hero of wrights first novel but his spirit animates the protagonists of the other two and is the subject of the shorter fiction and the nonfiction dealing with whitenonwhite relations bigger is that quality which will not be at rest until the term negro american is no more selfcontradictory no more expressive of inner conflict and tension than englishamerican irishamerican or at the very least jewishamerican and for bigger this country has indeed shown very small progress legal equality the equality of a black man to a white man in their confrontations with private or public institutions which is now dragging fitfully toward some degree of general implementation has been implicitly resident in the constitution since the end of the civil war legal resources however cannot legislate first class citizenship the news pictures of huddled small groups of negro children separated from their white classmates by more than mere distance in tokenintegrated schools tells the story all too clearly first class citizenship is fully integrated citizenship is social equality is social integration this is the call to which bigger and cross and fishbelly respond it is the call to which wright urges the white man to listen for if the negro is beyond the pale of american society if he cannot become equal in the eyes of his fellow man its laws can never serve him equally if he can never be wholly american he must find a new nationality a black nationality and the rising world stature of asia and africa in the eyes of the west has encouraged such identification certainly with the pacifist social movements popularly associated with the name of martin_luther_king jr american negroes had at last passed not as criminal individuals but as a conscious moral group outside of american society finding in gandhian nonviolence a frame of reference to which they could commit themselves without accepting implicit inferiority and yet they had as their goal nothing more than becoming more fully american in white man listen wright ponders why the american negro is so little rebellious and concludes that he is too committed to american values even to rebel that he has to his country a negative loyalty that is a loyalty that works against him but it must be or should be becoming increasingly clear that every rejection in the attempt to move toward full american citizenship is a thrust toward negro nationalism one of the most remarkable features of the negro revolution is the rate at which the center of the movement is becoming alienated from the traditional american modes thus the naacps roy wilkins has yielded the center to rev king who five years ago was regarded by most as an ultraextremist and due in part to the emergence of the black muslims and in particular the militant followers of malcolm_x the center has now moved toward james farmer of core where the tone of protest has sharpened from prayerful remonstrance to a form of aggressively nonviolent terrorism if these are met by further frustrations there seems only two remaining positions neither of them really tenable the first is violent terrorism which practiced by a minority and one comparatively unarmed could only call forth painful repression the other is total nationalism the solution of malcolm_x and the fact that its proposal is totally unacceptable to white america is the ultimate irony of americas racial history for malcolm_x has urged not integration but segregation on a separate but equal basis what has frightened the country in this proposal then is simply that they realize he is as sincerely determined about the equality as about the separation and this includes the equal right to vote to bear arms and to defend oneself what is frightening about this is not that malcolm_x is a reckless or irresponsible man despite an unpleasant candor in expressing his hatred he has neither done nor threatened any specific acts of hostility and has refused to condemn those of others only as a way of saying that given the circumstances the outbreaks were to be expectedbut that given the proposition that a negro will defend his rights with arms if provoked the use of those arms becomes inevitable for this reason because there are fewer and fewer valid positions left for the negro revolution to take it is beginning to takeas in the core rupture with the national organization which took place this spring in new york nonviolent terrorist actions on an increasingly broad range and under less inspired or responsible leadership like the elevator operator the movement will accept suffering not necessarily directed toward any more specific ends than those of critically discomforting white america this was the meaning of the abortive threat of a worlds fair stallin last year and of course it is the meaning of the riots in the northern ghettos which are not so much against overt police brutality as against the covert white brutality that has created this ironic confrontation that is that the only white man with whom these people have any continuous direct encounters at all is the policeman the riots were not deliberately fomented by black nationalists but had there been no philosophy of black nationalism at hand it would have been generated on the spot because during the riots there was only one way the rioters could regard themselves as a subject nation fighting an oppressor they were no longer americans america did not include them it merely ruled them this is why no matter how conservative his politics the negro continues to show a mischievous satisfaction at the intransigence of countries such as red china egypt and cuba or for that matter at the intransigence of an adam clayton powell who aside from the resentment he engenders in his white political colleagues has little to recommend him to his constituency the cynicismand it is not innocencewith which powell is continually returned to congress is the cynicism of despair of those who have no hope of redress from the government and with this as wright noted in the negros admiration of imperial japan before the war comes the desire of bigger to see the white man particularly the american white man embarrassed and humbled before the dark people of the world this is the legacy of slavery carefully preserved by decades of second class citizenship the voice of bigger then is a voice which must be stilled and must if america is to honor its moral commitments be stilled by the undercutting of its justification for this voice of nationalism is a voice of desperation a voice calling to color because the cry to countrymen has fallen on deaf ears if it is not stilled it must seek exile either the private exile of fishbelly or for those who cannot follow him the exile of a nation in sullen and restless bondageblack nation of malcom x it is not a new argument the debate over the role of the writer iin relation to society dbm and his art has raged for generations and there is no indication that it soon will abate certainly in troubled and dangerous times such as ours there will be disagreement over the role of the writer there are those who hold that it is the writers duty to confine his energies to the creation of a work of art for only through such a creation can he justify his existence and also enlarge the worlds vision and there are those who while agreeing essentially with this view of the writers task see the writer as being uniquely suited to illuminate for his time those values which give dignity and depth to human life and which constantly must be defended against assault in this era of the negro revolt certain negro writers have been criticized for their silence on the other hand many critics and some negro writers have made terrible charges against other negro writers accusing them of riding to fame and fortune on the wings of militance writers like frank yerby a resident of spain have been cited as examples of one position and james baldwin who returned from french exile to add violent fuel to the bursting fires of negro discontent is held up as a brilliant example of the opposite viewpoint the argument goes on increasing in its intensity to help the readerand young writerto understand both sides of the controversy negro digest invited some writers famous and relatively unknown black and white to state what they feel is the task of the negro writer as artist on the following pages the writers speak lerone bennett jr an artist in the situation of a negro ie a situation of oppression and injustice in a segregated society which questions the humanity of all negroes whether they peel potatoes or write poems has special responsibilities and special tasks his first task i believe is to break through to authenticity as a man to hack his way through the dense undergrowth of myths which hide him from himself what is involved here is a perilous search for identity which is not by any means the same for negro artists and white artists in order for a negro artist to reach authenticity he must place himself on trial before the whole of western civilization which he is in but not of to undergo this trial in anguish and in joy to go to the end of himself in order to find the beginning of himself to go to the frontiers of man and to become a new frontier as a man and as an artist to make a new beginning and to project new endings to transcend the lies of power and to judge men by human and not by white standards to come to terms with himself and his history to accept himself to accept the color of his skin and the ambiguity and tension of his experience to see with his own eyes and to hear with his own ears and to find new language and new forms to express what he sees and hears to see negro experience within a wider context to relate that experience to the great human themes of liberation and oppression struggle and growth victory and defeat to express himself directly openly honestly and if necessary brutally without a prior check with the white other to emancipate himself from the limitations of the white culture structure and the subtle tyranny of white audiences to stand face to face with life as a man black and comely these i believe are the tasks of the negro artist beyond all that i believe it is incumbent on negro artists to involve themselves in the struggle for the liberation of man artists who inhabit a heaven called art high above harlem and white plains are deceiving themselves by their silences which echo as loudly as their words they are playing a social role serving despite themselves the interests and needs of their oppressors in sum i believe negro artists should cling to the french literary concept of engagementfor the simple fact is that the negro is born engaged and he lies as an artist and as a man if he believes he can disengage himself by adding the word artist to the word negro arna bontemps though writers are traditionally at loggerheads with their society they seldom escape its pressures and this becomes doubly apparent in the case of the negro writer in the united states as long as the society itself remains segregated in any significant areas the inner world of the writer whether negro or white for that matteris likely to reflect this condition and the selfexpression of the negro is likely to seem somewhat different however i do not think we need to worry about such difference i dont think it will necessarily be bad it may sometimes be a blessing nothing in the creative process is more important than being ones self john henrik clarke the negro writer and his people are now standing at the crossroads of history this is the negro writers special vantage point and this is what makes the task and the mission of the negro writer distinctly different from that of the white writer the negro writer concerned with creating a work of art in a segregated society has a double task first he has to explain the society to himself and create his art while opposing it second he cannot be honest to himself or his people without lending his support at least verbally to the making of a new society that respects the dignity of men the negro writer must realize that his people are now entering the last phase of a transitional period between slavery and freedom it is time for the negro writer to draw upon the universal values in the negros experience just as sean ocasey and sholem aleichem drew upon the universal values in the experiences of the irish and the jews in the next phase of negro writing a literature of celebration must be creatednot a celebration of oppressionbut a celebration of survival in spite of it nathan hare the negro writer should be i think a bit more of a rebel since he and his race have more at stake he ought to tackle the very foundations of the society that tramples him and set fire to the false notions that bind in one way or another both negroes and whites some negro writers seek safety in an artforartssake approach they have got the idea from whites that protest is not art and that a negro writer who is a negro first last and always whether he wants to admit it or not should be a writer first and a negro second part of the negro writers job then is to help shape the thinking of negroes themselves to goad them to keener indignation all of this however should reach beyond the bounds of narrow protest against discrimination and aim toward a general revamping of a morally decadent society zack gilbert the negro writer should maintain his individuality his honesty and above all develop his craft and artistic skills without art i i the protest is lost the message unimportant if the message can be put over without surrendering the art good gwendolyn brooks has many times so beautifully accomplished this in her poetry as baldwin has done with the essay and killens with the novel therefore it is up to the young negro writer to voice these things of substance with the highest literary skills possible the white writer however is not exempted because of his broader liberties he has the same obligations to deliver a work of depth and purpose to a sick and controversial society conrad kent rivers the negro writer is his worst enemy we have seen one or two survive the anger of their prose his task is to stomach his individual experience and personal history no matter how much it hurts inside if he can manage this feat then there is nothing left for him to do except to master his craft and to tell the story according to the character of his personal history this is a deathgiving universe time is short i think it takes a full life to weave a full story any writer white or black must be read on more than one level i do not believe that life has a special meaning for any particular sect a good writer spends his words but he cannot squander the good things of life harvey swados i must preface any comment on the task of the negro writer by observing that particularly at this point in american historyit would be presumptuous for any white writer to offer gratuitous advice to any negro writer however once i am asked i should observe that the first task of any literary artist is to write honestly and well regardless of who might be hindered or helped by his work in this sense the task of the negro writer cannot be said to differ from that of his white colleague the main danger for an artist working in a segregated society however is that he may permit rage to degenerate into hate rage has informed some of the greatest masterworks of the ages but hate h as poisonous and selfdefeating in art as it is in politics howard n meyer the special task of the negro writer is to communicate with the submerged masses of his people only a fraction of whom have responded to the challenge of the epochto tell them whatever the form of his art the truth about their condition in its new affirmative sense that the hope of reconstruction of society can now be a reality if they will but awaken howard n meyer a new york attorney is a parttime historian and writer he wrote the introduction to the collier s edition of col wentworth higginsons classic army life in a black regiment and contributes articles to various literary and quarterly magazines his biography of gen ulysses s grant let us have peace is set for fall publication dudley randall in the nineteen thirties richard wright published a blueprint for negro writers perhaps it guided him to his achievement but it may only have misled another writer as each has his own unique temperament education experience beliefs and vision he is not an interchangeable part to be inserted into a blueprint or a machine the commissar of culture no matter what name he masquerades under is avid to seize and manipulate power and is greedy to use the writer in his power game first he flatters and then muzzles the writer we have seen this happen in russia this creature can be recognized by his practice of dictating to others what he believes they should think or write because of this danger the writer cannot be subservient to leaders politicians critics the public or even to his race but must serve only the truth as he sees it and often the truth may be unpalatable to one or all of these in his search for truth the writer may explore the racial struggle or purely personal themes or both since he feels both external and internal pressures whatever his themes his allegiance is not to politicians popularity or power but solely to truth as he sees it by his rendering of truth he will live or die if american negro writers need examples they can study writers of other oppressed peoples since distance gives objectivity to see how they created art which works are living and meaningful or ephemeral and spurious and why william demby american negro writers are suddenly free free from the need to make propaganda free from the need to protest free from the need to dramatize sociological theses these are being acted out in realityin the sitins in the freedom marches in the demonstrations and strikes of protest now american negro writers can explore the uncharted depths of art can weave an identity for themselves and for their brothers exploring the mysteries of identity can be dangerous the rewards for the artistand the society from which he has been spawnedcan be great william demby recently returned to the u s from italy where he had lived and worked for many years author of the little known underrated novel beetlecreek he bids for fresh attention this spring with a new novel the catacombs to be released by pantheon in june gwendolyn brooks the task of the negro writer in any sort of society is the task of every writer to clarify his interior and to deliver thoroughly and only the messages urged by that clarity gwendolyn brooks winner of a pulitzer prize for poetry is author of five volumes of poetry annie allen a street in bronzeville the bean eaters bronzeville boys and girls for children and selected poems plus a novel maud martha she conducts a seminar in poetry at chicagos columbia college ossie davis the task of the negro writer is revolutionary by definitionbeginning inward he must take his consciousness of himself as a negro the specific joy or terror of what being a negro means in a segregated society and he must expand that consciousness exploding outwardhe must make of himself a hammer and against the racially restricted walls of that society he must strike and strike and strike again until something is destroyedeither himselfor the prison walls that stifle him ossie davis a veteran broadway and screen actor is author of the hit play purlie victorious which was filmed under the title gone are the days he is also author of tv scripts and of a new play tailored especially for his actress wife ruby dee his latest movie is the hill kristin hunter beyond saying that the negro writer should try to be as good a writer as he can i can hardly presume to dictate his role he may choose not to be a negro writerthat is a writer about negoesat all i think the freedom to make this choice is ultimately one of the freedoms negroes are presently fighting for but if he chooses to deal with negro materialor to put it more accurately if that is the material that chooses himhe will need every bit of his skill and a thick skin as well for he is bound to be criticizedby white liberals who think he should be more noble by black nationalists who think he should be more angry or by dear genteel aunt jenny who teaches school and thinks lowclass colored people are literally too vulgar for words if in spite of these deterrents the negro writer chooses to express the splendid negro culture of which he is a part let him not neglect the great tradition of white western culture of which he is also a part his task will be to mediate between these two cultures which have been misunderstanding and mis bill gunn his the negro writers task is to be true to whatever it is that compels him to write be it race problems love or the romance of buttoncollecting it should not differ selfconsciously because of race in or out of a segregated society it will differ from those of other writers because his experience is different i should think that anything which distracts him away from his own creative flow like paying too much attention to the publics expectations or a lack of personal discipline could be destructive to the artists individual genius bill gunns first novel all the rest have died was published last winter he is an actor of note a winner of the new york critics award and author of the plays marcus in the high grass produced in and the celebration and the ghinko trees new plays he is writing his second novel nat hentoff the basic task of any writer is to find and be himselfas deeply and wholly as possible for some that finding and growing involves commitment to some kind of social action either directly or through the use of his art as a means of awakening exacerbating or otherwise forcing others to find fzemselves in the context of the society they live in are compressed by or are accomplices of for others finding oneself may mean a retreat in one way or another from that society in aestheticism or nihilism or just plain disgust and of course there is an infinite variety of choiceswhen they are choicesin between but no matter what the choice the man making the choice is inescapably shaped by who he is where he is and the kind of society he is in therefore a negro writer in a segregated societyand obviously american society is still segregatedwill find his search to discover and be himself qualitatively different in its complications and emotional layerswithinlayers from that of a wasp or a jew or let us say from any white who has made a deliberate choice to be an outsider or from a white who has deliberately tried to see the society from below what i am trying to say is that the negro writers task is fundamentally no different from that of any other writer but his means of coping with that task almost inevitably involve perspectives with regard to his society and the ways it has operated and tried to operate on him that may lead to a much more penetrating knowledge of himself in relationship to his society than most white writers in america are likely to achieve from being forced into the role of the outsider he can see more of the whole than can the white writer because he is part of that whole at the same time that he has been exiled from his center what specific role he then takes depends on his particular background capacities temperament and diligence at selfexploration c eric lincoln the fundamental prerequisites of a work of art are two it must be a rendition of what is true it must be beautiful its truth need not be mimetical it need not be a slavish reproduction of some existing quantity but to be art it must interpret accurately some tenor of emotion or some quality of existence its beauty derives from its consistency of form and the relatedness of its parts to each other and to the whole in a segregated society the task of the negro creative writer is no different from that of the writer who lives in utopia an artist he he paints the world he sees the creative artist brings to his work a history of experience through which he sees the world his art is an expression of what he has seen what he reasons and what he imagines if it is good art it will be true and beautiful even when it wrenches the heart and tears at the soul ernest i gaines the writer regardless of his race must write about human nature he must write about mans feelings no man sings all the time or weeps all the time or hates or loves or dances all the time his lifewhether he is a peasant of the society or a member of that societys aristocracyis a combination of all these things the task of the negro writer as well as that of any other writer is to see man and write about him as clearly and as honestly as he possibly can alex haley i see as the negro writers task today the wielding of his artist influences to recast the predominantly distorted universal images of the negro we negro writers certainly are betterequipped than white writers to portray our own race we vastly better knowand were immeasurably more privy to the subject of ourselves plus these where white writers at best can only appropriate negro material the negro writer has a mandatebecause theres no nation or race today considered oppressed or inferior whose pens have created a corpus of great literature since this is the goal of every societys writers id say that essentially anyway our task isnt different from white writers but i think that we negro writers do have today an exexhilarating greater personal motivational challenge than white writers have its the challenge to do justice by all of this formidable wealth of negro material that we sit on top of its subject matter thats practically virginal by comparison with the most of white ethnic material which by now has been pretty thoroughly combed lennox raphael if the writer is honest he can perform his function as an artist and as a human being by facing up to his personal vision the negro writer however has a particular job his trumpet is his imagination and judgment as is the trumpet of any serious writer rather than his skin or the easy quotient of oppression which like a smart whore has mislaid so many negro writers if one is an artist and if one accepts this role as a vocation that is above all a gift then there is no excuse for mediocrity the writer must first of all be writer craftsman and lord of his imagination it is only from this premise that the eccentricities of his skin can be branched out as an advertisement for himself skin whether one is black or white and primarily when one is black must be regarded simply as an advertisement a publicity gimmick ones walking phallus but skin is not ones thinking and one cannot depend on skin if one intends to do battle with every foe in the literary arena the negro writer must understand that society has lent him the role of bullfighter and that in the hands of this danger he must create a thing of beauty which will lend distinction to the struggle of his people in his society there are many bulls and many aficionados but the ring must never be allowed to grow larger than ones talent for this regardless of ones skin can only mean the end of ones strivings the negro writer must learn his craft for it is craft that gives vision beauty subtlety and unhistrionic anger to ones work it is easy to be angry but it is much harder to shape this anger into something that will endure and at the same time impart an aura of humanness to ones life and work william m kelley the task of the negro writer should differ from that of the white writer in that among other things he should be addressing himself to the negro unfortunately the negro is the last person to whom the negro writer speaks so that now both the white and the negro writer address themselves to the white man the negro writer believes that he must tell the white man where its at as if the white man has oppressed the negro for the last years without really being aware of it the negro writer has turned himself into a reverse court jester he comes before the king and on cue tells the king how cruel how evil the king is when the jester is finished the king feels wonderful he is certain that any country with a king so fairminded as to permit his jester to speak to him in such a way is must be a country of justice and equality the negro writer must use his art and art it must be not propaganda to help the negro to find those things that were robbed from him on the shores of africa to help repair the damage done to the soul of the negro in the past three centuries thomas paine did not address himself to the british he spoke rather to the american colonists if he had done otherwise america today might still be a colony ronald l fair when it became apparent to my friends some years ago that i was determined to have my say as a writer those close enough to me to offer advicebeing concerned about the possibility of my having some small degree of successcautioned me not to waste my energies writing about negroes they said richard wright was the only writer who had successfully written about the negro and since i was not richard wright there was no chance of my ever being heard this of course was before the great james baldwin had been heard from well for some reason i listened to them i began a novel about white people i was half way through the novel before i realized that i had sold out myself and my people i had a long discussion with myself on paper of course and concluded that there were enough white writers distorting reality and showing the world a kind of makebelieve totally white america that never really acknowledged the existence of the negro when it dawned on me that if i had not stopped when i did i would have ended as just another tom i was furious i tore the manuscript into little pieces page by page i lit a match to it and watched it bum with all the ceremoniai intensity of an early christian witnessing the last supper i was free for the first time in my life i really knew that i was proud to be a negro and not afraid to shout it i had succeeded in convincing myself that the old belief that negroes could not do what they wanted to do unless they first had the approval of the man was a myth there was just too much that had to be said that couldnt be said by white writers for me to turn my back on it i didnt know what the future held for me as a negro writer writing about negroes but i didnt care because i was free i doubted that i would ever make any money as a writer of this kind of fiction but this didnt matter either because i would be telling it like it is i decided that i should continue on my job and write at night and that i would never be afraid to look a white man in the eye and tell him that he had acted like a barbarian i remember thinking that there must be white people in the world who would like to know the truth about what it is like to be a negro about how the negro feels with someone standing on his head and i was determined to tell them no more polite lies no more biting of the tongue or twisting of truths richard wrights death would mean something because i would keep him in mind and swing away i cannot speak for other writers we are as different from one another as we are from the society that tortures us so however i can speak for myself as a negro writer i realize that mine is only one faint voice among thousands but i must remain idealistic enough to think that my voice will be heard because it speaks the truth i must continually recharge myself with the sorrow and frustration of my people although it is painful as hell because the white man has lied for four hundred years and if he could have his way he would go on indefinitely denying that we exist i am a voice for my people and if i dont speak out they may never be heard by louie robinson a c o b freeman j y looked out across his barren the winding road and the four men coming up it and he let out a heavy sigh first there had been the long dry spell and what it had done to his crops then the store in town where he could get the most credit had gone busted and now this jacob allowed as how it was the lords right to test him but he just hoped the lord knew what he was doing straining his eyes a little jacob tried to make out just who the four men were there was first of all sheriff john holman that figured then there was ben thompson toad thompson called him and the was more or less accurateand his halfbrother will that figured too there wasnt a worse town rumor had it that either one was scared without the other which didnt make much difference since they were always together and to gether they were a terror then there was mr frank dawson that was a surprise mr dawson was the head of the bank not that this meant too much in itself banks didnt let colored people have any money but everybody else in town probably owed mr dawson which meant that he could have something to say about who could get credit where and who couldnt jacob decided that maybe this thing was even worse that he had feared at first every element of the county was against him the four men came up through the front gate and right on to the porch without calling out a greeting and jacob took this to be a bad sign in itself good mornin sheri good momin mr dawson mr ben mr will jacob called out with hopeful friendliness jacob we come out to have a little talk with you the sheriff said his voice was stern matteroffact dashing jacobs hopes well yall come up on the porch and sit down jacob said lamely waving to a couple of dilapidated chairs and the roughhewn railing on the weatherbeaten front porch we didnt come to sit toad thompson said shortly well what did yall come to talk about jacob asked hoping that he sounded properly ignorant you know clanged good and well what we come to talk about toad thompson said loudly its about that daughter of s yourn tryin to go to the state university the sheriff said she aint tryin goddang it shes there toad thompson cut in well shes gonna have to get out the sheriff said we dont intend to have any darkies from buck county startin trouble over there why i aint seen mary lou in six months jacob protested wringing his black workworn hands she didnt tell me nothin about goin to school shes been workin over at andersonville and didnt say nothin to me about goin to school i didnt know nothin about this until yesterday when somebody in town told me it was all in the papers that my mary lou had gone up there and got herself in the white folks college they said it was on the tv and everything but i didnt know nothin about it she didnt tell me she was goin to school jacob was almost pleading when he stopped talking then banker dawson spoke for the first time youve always been a pretty good boy jacob he said softly you never got into any trouble you work out here on this farm of yours and you mind your own business you never get out of your place we like colored people like that it shows those northern agitators that we can live in peace down here but you can understand how a thing like thisyour very own daughter going up there to the state universitymeans trouble jacob bad trouble now you dont want any trouble do you jacob no sir i dont want any trouble jacob answered feeling that truer words he had never spoken well then banker dawson went on what you need to do is get mary lou down here and straighten her out maybe if you get her out of that school and keep her quiet folks around town will accept that as your apology for all this fuss and wont think hard of you i think we ought to let him know whats going to happen if he dont git her out of there toad thompson said menacingly i think he may have to find out that we know what to do with uppity niggers jacob wondered why the thompson brothers were getting so riled up they and none of their kin had ever been to any kind of school so he couldnt see what difference it made to them who was up at that college i think a talkinto is good enough for now sheriff holman said but you aint got much time jacob you aint got much time at all toad thompson added as the four men turned to go will thompson hadnt said a word the whole time they had been there jacob realized but then he figured that wasnt too surprising because he hardly ever said anything usually just nodding his head and grinning while his halfbroth er talked some said that was because will didnt have half his brains some said it was because will had no brains at all but jacob freeman did not have time to dwell upon the content of will thompsons head he turned from the porch and with a feeling of deep emptiness in the pit of his stomach walked inside the old house in the kitchen fussing around the wood stove was his wife sarah at the table sat his oldest son luther who was seventeen and his youngest son simon fourteen well what are yall lookin at me for jacob said defensively yall heard em they said i got to git mary lou out from up there at the white folks school they blamin me for whats happened me and i didnt even know she was goin what are you going to do about it jacob his wife asked eyeing him carefully what am i goint to do about it jacob hollered are you crazy woman the white folks say i got to git mary lou out of there thats exactly what im gonna do no you aint sarah hissed with such sudden quiet force that it seemed that every sound and movement on earth stopped jacob was shocked he had been a bachelor for thirty of his years on gods green earth and in the twentytwo years that he had been married to sarah since then she had never once disputed him now when it meant his very neck she had decided to oppose him jacob looked hard at the small thin pecancolored woman who he had taken from a farmers cotton patch when she was sixteen and made his wife she had been quiet and obedient as a child yet her willowy enticing figure had held a womans fullblown passions and he had loved her in ways that he had never found words to tell her but nownow she stood defying him her eyes hot coals of anger her mouth set in grim determination you must didnt hear me good woman he roared i said damn you jacob freeman dont you shout at me sarah cried as tears tried unsuccessfully to escape her eyes you a big man inside this old rundown house aint you here theres just me and the children to raise your voice to but i didnt hear you out there shoutin at them white folks i didnt hear you tellin them what you was gonna do and what you was not gonna do jacob did not mean to sit down so suddenly in the chair it was just that he was so thunderstruck that he all at once lost control of his legs and had gone plop when he found his voice it did not seem familiar to his own ears have you lost your senses sarah the white folks may i havent lost my senses ive come to my senses jacob and quit tellin me what white folks say i say its time for you to stand up and be a man in front of your sons here why is it always the negro woman who has to advance the race from harriet tubman to mary bethune it has been the negro woman who has had to do it all and in this family it seems like its me and mary lou so jacob realized it had all been her doing behind his back she had been putting these integration ideas into mary lous head and even now simon and luther were sitting there looking at him with what he could only call contempt this is all your fault jacob said sternly youre the cause of all this fuss i am not the cause of it sarah said it is the fault of all the colored men since the beginning of time colored men in africa who shouldnt have sold their people into slavery colored men who shouldnt have let themselves be made slaves colored men who have been lettin themselves and their women and their children be slaves ever since you been readin that stuff in that ebony magazine about where colored folks come from jacob accused i been doin a lot of things sarah told him and one of them is thinkin and ive decided that if the man i was married to was too dumb to see that his children had too much brains to work farms and clean kitchens and wash other folks clothes then it was up to me to do what had to be done do you know what this means jacob asked slowly yes i do sarah answered it means we goin to stand up with our heads high and be able to look our children in the face as long as we live even if that aint too long i told you i was goin and git mary lou jacob said trying to get back his authority then you aint going to eat another meal in my kitchen or sleep another night in my bed sarah said jacob felt a hundred years old it took all of his strength to get up from the chair and walk out of the kitchen he had lived with white folks a long time and he had always done what he was told to do he had gotten along that way but having them down on himmaybe even trying to hurt himwas one thing and having sarah against him was something else barred for life from her table and bed jacob was an old man it was true but he wasnt so old that he didnt appreciate the fact that sarah at thirtyeight was still much of the same female he had married when she was sixteen not the little girl part but that redblooded woman part and for the first time in all of his fiftytwo years jacob considered the possibility that there were some things in this world more important than white folks jacob walked out to the woodshed in back and took down the three shotguns that belonged to him and luther and simon he got some oil and rags and things and walked back to the rear steps and sat down and carefully began cleaning the guns every now and then he glanced back through the kitchen window at sarah and then skyward toward the lord he sure hoped they knew what they were doing autobiographers are presumptuous and adventurous they serve themselves all trussed up for the reading publics appetite and have no way of knowing how theyll be digested still the demands of this literary form can give the autobiographer some guiding for autobiography requires the reporters devotion to facts the novelists sense of narration the historians grasp of the meaningful past and the stripteasers ability to exhibit private matters with taste and art considering the flavoring of autobiographical hors doeuvres dick gregorys nigger dutton is seasoned with too much narration verging towards fantasy and exhibitionism verging towards vulgarity and not enough of the other ingredients to be blunt the book is an emetic and any value in it must be derived from its medicinal rather than enriching qualities you dont digest this book you react to it you react mainly to gregorys conception of his hero himself gregory belongs to what might be called the little golden book school of biography little golden books are syrupy biographies of the childhoods of famous americans in which distorted and invented experiences of the hero as a child are slanted to explain the achievements of the hero as a man these books are geared for the minds of grade school children it is questionable however whether it is proper for an adult to write such a book for an adult audience and about himself with supreme tastelessness and unabashed puerility gregory describes his impoverished boyhood as if he were ordained by godwith whom he professes to have been on speaking termsto become a great and famous man we hear of wrinkled old ladies kindly witches in this tale who see stars on his brow symbolizing success or have visions of him carrying an expensive brown briefcase in an airplane terminal and gregory tells us about a mysterious superhuman force which he affectionately dubs the monster that seeps through him when he appears before a crowd this monster heaved up its head from the morass of squalor humiliation and shame which marred gregorys childhood environment and strengthened the young gregory as he escaped his background by becoming a big man in the public eye whether he is running track politicking in high school telling jokes or fighting for negro rights gregory describes his insatiable need for public acclaim as a result of this monsters influence but gregory is not critical enough of his monster many men including saints have attributed their actions to a forces which transcends them but is gregorys cause a holy one can one equate the monster that compels one to devote himself to a moral cause with a monster that forces one to run his guts out on the track field or to one which justifies hypocrisy in high school class presidency elections or makes one deprive his friends of needed cash so he can rent a night club gregory cant distinguish between monsters he thinks that the monstrous mon ster the child of hunger and shame which makes him a performer first and a man second is the same one which inspires him to expose himself to southern assassins and sacrifice his career as a comic on the altar of negro rights gregory in short confuses the monster of the devil with the monster of the spirit the compulsion to perform with the necessity to lead one hopes that the motivation which girds gregory when he fights for civil_rights is not so ambivalent as nigger leads one to believe during the first two thirds of nigger the reader is bludgeoned with fairy tale morality and insufferable conceit egotism overrides ethics and it is not until gregorys wallet is fattened that he begins to show some awareness of the feeling of others but even the rich dick gregory doesnt seem to be entirely aware of why he does things this is a stiff charge but doesnt come by way of character assassination the pattern of gregorys actions from child to man reveals him adapting whatever talents he has or manipulating any situation to play a role that will please those he feels to be his superiors but often hurts those he considers at least his equal the role itself hardly seems to matter it can range from a farinabuckwheat role to that of a social hero but it is always a performers role which avoids exposure of the real human being that is why gregorys childhood is shrouded in fiction that is why gregory explains his rise from rags to riches as if some mystical force animated him that is why he refuses to make clear connections between the degradation of his boyhood and his awkward scramble for money fame and at this time power and that is why i suppose he couldnt wait for a little golden book biographer to cononize him in the candy store of american fe noses of many negro children are roughly pressed against the outer pane it hurts some more than others it ennobles some and rots others some get in and some dont dick gregory got in and the fact that he seeks to change the stores interior makes him loom larger than the common contented man is his stature the result of selfinflation bigness of characteror both john woodford would you want one of them to marry your daughter james baldwin made one of the sharpest observations he has made in his short illustrious life one sunday over television when he stared long and hard at john kilpatrick southern genteel aristocrat from old virginia and stated r i matteroffactly youre not worried about me marrying your daughter youre worried about me marrying your wifes daughter ive been marrying your daughter ever since the days of slavery in the whole body of negrowhite dialogue which has collected for over a hundred years this bugaboo about marrying mister charlies daughter is the non sequitur to end all non sequiturs indeed it would be ludicrous if white americans had not made into a subjective reality that was historically an objective irrelevance the fact of the matter is the american negro is the most multicolored people on this planet and not because old black joe married missy ann or because uncle tom raped little eva so let us try to put some of these myths to rest once and for all during slavery old massa kept his white wife on a pedestal by throwing aunt jemima down on the big house bed or the trips he took down to the cabins to rape aunt hagars defenseless younguns so that while old missus was withering on the vine like a raisin in the sun the kindly master was likely to be sowing black oats and making heaps of yaller chilluns along with his son and heir and those who worked for him and thats how the american black race became so many colors from coalebony all the way across the spectrum to blond and pinkish white frances anne kimbel a famous english actress who married a slaveholding georgia plantation owner describes in a letter to a friend a conversation she had had with sophy a slave it was not an unusual conversation within the context of the southern slavery system but it serves to demonstrate this aspect of that peculiar institution sophy went on to say that isaac was her son by driver morris white who had forced her while she was in her miserable exile at five pound almost beyond my patience with this string of detestable details i exclaimedfoolishly enough heavens knows ah but dont you knowdid nobody ever tell you that it is a sin to live with men who are not your husbands alas elizabeth what could the poor creature answer but what she did seizing me at the same time vehemently by the wrist oh yes missis we knowwe know all about dat well enough but we do anything to get our poor flesh some rest from the whip when he made me follow him into the bush what use me tell him now he has the strength to make me or lend your ears to mary boykin chestnut a great white southern lady speaking of slavery as she knew it god forgive us but ours is a monstrous system a wrong and an iniquity like the patriarchs of old our men live all in one house with their wives and their concubines and the mulattoes one sees in every family partly resemble the white children any lady is ready to tell you who is the father of all mulatto children in everybodys household but her own those she seems to think drop from the clouds the mother of my maternal grandfather was thirteen years old when my grandfather was born notwithstanding the fact that he was born more than a decade after slavery kindly masters had apparently not given up their slaverytime prerogatives young master old masters favorite son raped my greatgrandmother when she was twelve and he was a gay blade of twentyone needless to say the young cutup did not make an honest woman out of my greatgrandmother that is not the way things were done in those days evolving out of this mongrelization of a proud and pure race there grew a people who came to be designated as negroes mulattoes quadroons or octoroons the dictionary is very helpful and enlightening on this subject accordingly an octoroon is a person having oneeighth negro blood the offspring of a quadroon and a white do i hear you ask but what in the devil is a quadroon a quadroon is a person who is onefourth negro the offspring of a mulatto and a white and a mulatto is the offspring of parents of whom one is white and the other a negro now let us find out what a negro is a negro is a person having more or less negro blood so you see after all the rigmarole an octoroon is a negro a quadroon is a negro a mulatto is a negro a negro is a negro is a negro is a negro any questions in many southern states one drop of black blood in your white veins makes you an american negro we black folk are indeed a powerful race of people i mean we really left our imprint on the nation and now it must be stated that although old massa or young massa for that matter never married the young black saplingofalass whom he had got in a family way he very often gave preferential treatment to her and his progeny his and hers were often allowed to play with the masters legitimate children the young bucks wore young massas handmedowns and sometimes the young heifers inherited the young missys last years prettythings they were allowed to clean old massas boots and sometimes lick them in the bargain thus was an aristocracy of color established which in many instances still persists the more you resembled the folks in the big house the better off you were you were a house nigger and you came to be contemptuous of field niggers the toilers and the sweaters who were mostly pure and black just like theyd come from mother africa but you were also contemptuous of yourself because you hated that part of you that wasnt like the master race and deep down inside you thought of yourself and others like you as bastards even though you were the bastards of the privileged you looked at yourself through the eyes of the big house people who thought of you as bastards notwithstanding with your white blood you were better off than the pure blacks working the fields of cotton thus literary myths were also created even by such formidable and wellmeaning stalwarts as harriet beecher stowe the myth that only mulatto niggers were sassy and militant and hard to control because of their white blood which naturally responded negatively to enslavement and pure blacks were meek and docile and childlike and hardworking though they were lazy and had to be driven or so the scripts of the black myths read always written by white writers but what they failed to explain was the pure blacks of the harriet tubman and nat turner ilk and all those other black rebellious souls great harriet tubman little black woman moses of her people who escaped slavery via the underground railroad but was not satisfied with her own freedom she couldnt sit still till the south was free she went back south deep down into egypt land nineteen times with a price on her head dead or alive and she led more than three hundred slaves to freedom a rifle always at her side she was the greatest underground conductor of them all her boast my train never ran off the track and i never lost a passenger and old nat turner black and strong and mighty in his righteous anger insurrectionist whose religion was freedom a religious fanatic in the great tradition of toussaint louverture and gabriel prosser denmark vesey or old john brown of bloody kansas neither could this script of myths explain those black folk who staged slowdowns all over the old plantation south when they broke the hoes and plows and other farming implements accidentallyonpurpose but the hegemony of color was established and persisted it was established by the establishment and for the blessed establishment it was a part of the great brainwash every negro was taught that the closer you were to white the better off you were in the eyes of the man the white man that is and the white mans eyes were the ones that mattered it was in him the power resided he spread the table where there were highclass crumbs for the gitting so the octoroon looked down upon the quadroon who looked down upon the mulatto and all looked down upon the low man on the totem pole who was hopelessly and helplessly black and had no one to look down upon so good hair and bad hair and high yaller became a part of the language desperate negro mothers massaged the noses of black babies trying to mold them into thinner and narrower shapes the endless futule admonitions dont poke out your mouth itll make you grow to have big ugly lips dont drink coffee itll make you black the myths of abnegation black folks study evil a black gal sleeps with her fists balled up i grew up in this kind of culture steeped in selfhatred and yet somehow our selfhatred was not as deepseated as might be imagined somehow despite the great brainwash we loved ourselves and loved each other i remember madame walkers hair straightener and i recall the aroma of burned hair and vaseline even now my mind makes pictures of tired hands and straightening combs and bleaching creams and for us boys the pomades the slickums with which we plastered our poor heads the stocking cap in which we slept all night long then up south in new york and other up south cities the process discovered to straighten black mens hair and so the conk came into vogue though it did not catch every black mans fancy it was probably at that time that many black men began to see the ridiculous lengths to which we had extended ourselves in order to resemble the master race yes old massa really started something but at this point in time and space we are ringing down the curtain sure there were negro churches in the south even in my time where a man with a black face had better not set foot unless he was the janitor there were negro colleges which had quotas for those with very dark complexions and in places like charleston south carolina or washington d c some of us were antinegro and colorconscious to a degree that bordered on sickness but we are ringing down the curtain notwithstanding the formidable debrainwashing job before us we black folk are ringing down the curtain in the west indies even to this day old massa oftentimes had thirty and forty mulatto children borne by ten or twelve black women in many of these cases though mister charlie hardly ever married any of them he oftentimes had at least one of them living with him in the big house and others stashed out vying for his favor the offspring of such situations more often than not rejected their true mothers out of hand and basked in the sunshine of their benevolent great white fathers to give the devil his due though for the life of me i cant think why i should old massa often treated such offspring more or less as his own children they came to make up the managerial class on the plantation and when the great white father passed on the plantation often went to his mulatto children this progressive paternalism has created a color caste in much of the caribbean the lines of which are drawn far sharper than any to be found in the usa many west indian mulattoes even today regard themselves as colored and look upon black west indians as negroes even niggers or darkies and obviously a lesser people yet in spite of this the establishment would have us believe that the entire struggle between black and white in this country has its roots in the determination of the whites to hold the line and maintain the purity of the races and the sanctity of the southern womanhood while the black man lives only for the day when he will catch miss anne with her restrictions down and that all else is verbiage and hypocrisy civil_rightsthe right to vote the right to work the right not to be lynched all the slogans about freedom and justice and equalityare merely part of a black master plan to get the black man into the white womans bed so he can mongrelize the races it is a peculiar fact that marrying whiteys daughter is always the first line of defense set up by the southern white man against the black yet it appears nowhere in the bill of particulars set forth by the black man in his case against the white establishment examine for days monthsyears if you willthe records of the naacp of core the urban league or sncc and you will find in none of their varied programs one single slogan about the right to marry mister charlies daughter historically it has always been a smoke screen set up by the white establishment to becloud any just demand of black folks its overall aim has been to maintain the status quo to keep the negro in his place at the bottom of the economic ladder and incidentally to keep the poor white near enough the bottom so that both of them would be shackled forever together in bondage to the southern way of life the poor white oftentimes had nothing save his vaunted whiteness to distinguish him from the black man just beneath him and what easier ruse than to convince him that his whiteness was in jeopardy that the black man wanted only to bed down with his white women to destroy his whiteness thus the black mystique had its humble beginnings as an economic and political expediency in order to carry out the grand design for exploitation known as the southern way of life you had to deny the black man any social or sexual equality because the alternative was to admit to the world and to the poor white southerner that the negro was not a beast but a man like any other man but if you kept him an animal obviously you would not be expected to invite him into your home to break bread at your table and eventually to marry your daughter or even grant him certain inalienable rightsto vote to hold office to work other than as a beast of burden to enjoy life liberty and the pursuit of happinessbecause they were not endowed him by his creator but a mystique is never static in order to maintain it you must improve upon it to the myth of the animallike sexual obsession of the black man you must add the myth of great sexual prowess he is generously equipped for the sex act like a stud horse and equally tireless yet there is this too about mystiques eventually everybody believes the myths both the victims and the victimizers the mythmakers become the victims of their own propaganda so that when whitey the last of the great myth makers comes face to face with his victim the black man he really believes he stands before his sexual superior there is yet another dimension to this portrait is it not possible that the white man sees his own lust reflected in the black mans eyes a guilt constructed out of centuries of playing the role of sheik in the great white harem where black men were eunuchs and black women were concubines and though number one wife was always white she was merely a figurehead a wife and mistress in name only the black man a eunuch no longer looks upon all this and wonders has the great white harem made loveless all of white america have americans become a people anxious to be loved but incapable of loving has the black mystique developed a feeling of impotency that borders on a sexual inferiority complex and does it not stand to reason that this has left the white woman disinterested she was never a free soul in the harem she too was one of the exploited the myth about the black mans sexual prowess has undoubtedly made her more curious than she might ordinarily have been about the forbidden is it really true is he really as formidable a lover as they say he is is it any wonder that the white man lives with a builtin nightmare of his own construction he is afraid of retributionfrom both sides having historically been the exploiter of both women and black folk economically socially psychologically and sexually the two might even band together against him this may explain why the white woman seems to have less trouble than the white man in shedding her racial prejudices generalizations are dangerous but even among young liberals and progressives the white male appears to have a much harder struggle i have studied young folk gathered in an office to get out a mailing for a civilrights demonstration more often than not the white girls mingle easily and with little or no selfconsciousness they will very usually put their heads and shoulders together with the black youth intent on getting the job done whereas you will often notice young white boys equally as dedicated and sincere much more selfconscious perhaps unknowingly they are watching for the interplay real or imagined between missy and young black joe it is the nature of the sickness of this society no soul is left unscathed the question about one of them marrying your daughter is of course a gratuitous insult to every white woman in this nation it is also very revealing of the state of mind of most of the white males in this country how came you to this abyss of insecurity where you shamelessly imply that your daughters come freedom will all dash lickety split and leap into the nearest black mans bed you have let your anxieties run away with your imagination after all marriage is a contract entered into freely by both parties that means that nobody can marry your daughter unless your daughter wills it and by the same token your daughter cannot marry a single one of uncle toms grandsons unless the grandson too wills it you and i in the final analysis do not cannot and should not have a damn thing to say about it i remember the summer when i was sixteen years old and worked at a hotel in my home town of macon ask any black bellhop you ran scared to death most of the time say they rang for room service in suite you knew that room service meant any service the traffic would bear so when you reached the door you hesitated sometimes made the sign of the cross it was not unlike moving out onto the hollywood freeway swallowed hard and knocked knowing that once that door opened anything could happen the door finally swings back and there stands the white woman eternally aimed at your poor black head like a loaded rifle she can be in varied degrees of dishabille even like lady godiva sometimes without her horse standing there as if you do not exist as a man desexing you with her eyes though you suspect at the same time that she may covet you so you stand there sixteen years old feeling your age and knowing your place tonguetied and perspiring hating this white woman and yet somehow feeling a strange kind of pity for her then the gruff voice from the other room tell the nigger to bring the stuff in here lucy belle but before you could get yourself together he comes stumbling naked toward the door hey boy what you looking at a white woman like that for you hate yourself for saying what you have to say im not looking at anybody sir no sir you calling me a liar boy no sir i just mean you were mistaken you turn to go the hell with the tip where you going boy bring that stuff on into the bedroom youre in the bedroom now nigger ever since you been in this suite you aint been able to keep your eyes off a miss lucy belle no sir you are mistaken sir whats the matter you think she ugly no sir i bet you got a great big tool all right what you reckon lucy belle leave the boy alone george henry there were two or three incidents like that per week with variations but somehow you got through the summer with your manhood and your sanity intact when i remember that summer and think of all the black men who have been lynched legally and otherwisethe scottsboro boys the martinsville seven willie mcgee and emmett tilli am certain that some white women must shudder at the way they have let themselves be used against the black man they have been the justification for every evil ever perpetrated in the name of southern womanhood white women must know they have been used and abused historically they still have very few rights that a white man must respect white women have prerogatives of inferiority and they have learned to live with them in this the white mans world some even look upon them as privileges the feminine mystique is as tricky as the black mystique and after all is said and done the white woman settles too for the masters leavings she eats much higher on the hog than black folk but the choicest morsels are still left for old massa there was a time when white and black women declared a common cause many of those in the suffragette and womens rights movement were also rabid abolitionists women like ernestine rose and many others frederick douglass the great abolitionist and exslave also made common cause with the struggle for womens rights he saw no contradiction is it any wonder that old massa lives with a growing horror that one day his victims both black and white might join forces a guilty conscience produces an inordinate amount of worrying the afromexicans to say that mexico is a land of wonders artistic archeological and scenicis an obvious truism there live few with soul so dead who have not thrilled to an orozco mural the antiquity of chichen itza or the surreal beauty of popocatepetl by moonlight with its art history and cultural heritage mexico is a land that fairly begs for a traditional lost civilization a la james hilton and the writer has encountered more than one american who has gone home regretting that the mexican catalogue of wonders was more one of objects than of persons ruins paintings and volcanoes are fine butlets face it there is nothing that grips the popular imagination like the promise of a community of lost humans surviving in a remote shangrila well i have news there does exist in mexico a lostor to put it more accurately completely overlooked civilization a culture so atypical so alien and so different from anything americans associate with mexico that it seems like an importation from another continent and another world its members are not as might be supposed descendants of aztecs or mayans undiscovered by the conquistadores and living as they did in montezumas day they are rather people of pure negro stock who presently inhabit a region of mexico that resembles the land of their origin in topography climate and as we shall see many other respects where does all this fit into the traditional ethnic concept of mexico as an indospanish country as opposed to say cuba or the dominican republic where the ethnic strain is afrospanish the answer is simply that the traditional view is absolutely correct and mexico is a spanishindian country while one encounters persons with negro blood in such gulf ports as tampico and veracruz this is true of gulf and caribbean port communities everywhere what confronts us here is in effect a black republic in the heart of mexicoa microcosm of africa set down in the middle of a spanishaztecmayanzapotec culture so purely african is this enclave that one is as unlikely to encounter whites indians or mestizos within its boundaries as in such places as accra or lagos how does this phenomenon affect the mexican image civilized americans of course reject the discredited stereotype of all mexicans as peons slumbering in the sun such types do exist but so does the mexican who flashes credit cards graduated from an american university and jets to new york to clinch big deals but the truly unknown mexican unknown the writer discovered to many mexicans themselvesis a man whose ethnic roots are african rather than spanish andor indian and who lives in what is essentially an african community where is afromexico geographically it is a rectangularshaped area miles long and miles wide straddling the border between the two southern pacific coast states of guerrero and oaxaca it is bound on the south by the ocean and runs as far north as the halfruined city of ometepec once a goldmining center but now fallen into decay the african enclaves western extremity is the guerrero village of heuhuetan in the east it stops at the mixed afroindian town of pinotepa in oaxaca although smaller than long island afromexico offers an incredible diversity of topography and climate along the coast is a steamy tropical jungle region of mangrove swamps and coconut palms but less than five miles inland you find yourself on a plateau among the approaches to the towering sierra madre del sur this is cattle country sparselytreed and enjoying a temperate climate characteristic of the african veldt africa in miniature go to the seaside village of tecoanapa and youre on the tropical guinea coast then travel less than miles to the hill town of cochpan and you find yourself in the invigorating uplands of kenya as interesting as the areas geography is its history how is it that a community of negro africans comes to be found in mexico the enclaves inhabitants are descendants of negroes who escaped from a fleet of contraband slave ships bound for acapulco during colonial times under laws of the spanish crown veracruz was the only port authorized to receive slave shipments but a number of illegal attempts were made to smuggle negroes into acapulco acapulco now an international resort but then new spains chief pacific port serviced the gold mining center of ometepec and san luis acatlan and it was believed that negroes were hardier than indians and better suited for backbreaking labor in the mines the fugitive slaves to their great good fortune found themselves in a terrain almost identical to their homeland taking to the hills and swamps they waged intermittent guerrilla warfare against soldiers of the spanish viceroy sent out to capture them this state of affairs continued until mexico achieved its independence in and all slaves were freed the africans remained unmolested until the latter part of the th century when they were herded into settlements by a germanamerican adventurer from pittsburgh named johann schmidt schmidt who called himself don juan smith in mexico ruled over the area as a local tyrant until he was overthrown by the revolution of with the downfall of schmidtsmith the negroes set up a virtually selfgoverning community and this is the situation that prevails to this day although the western border of afromexico is less than miles from acapulco the enclaves existence is virtually unknown to the tourist throngs that invade the resort at the present time a modus vivendi exists between the mexican government and local authority in the region with the tacit understanding that federal intervention is kept at a minimum to make one point perfectly clear the african enclave can in no way be described as a ghetto or segregated area mexico is free of racial discrimination and persons who choose to leave the area are absorbed into mexican life at every level including intermarriage those who remain do so voluntarily and out of preference for their own way of life due to factors of geographical and cultural isolation estimates vary as to afromexicos present population the most widelyaccepted figure is excluding persons of mixed negroindian or negrospanish blood who are found all along the costa chica a coastal strip running miles between acapulco and puerto angel oaxaca i have mentioned the amazing diversity of topography and climate that exists within this minuscule area no less striking is the diversity one encounters among its inhabitants affirming the principle that personality is developed by environment rather than by such a nebulous concept as race afromexicans can be broken down into three distinct subculturesurban coastal and mountain the urban group consists of people born and raised in the area who have since chosen to join the mainstream of mexican life such integration has meant pulling up stakes and moving to the big citythe metropolis in this case being acapulco negroes mulattoes and lobos persons of mixed negroindian ancestry form a considerable percentage of the resorts indigenous population and the african influence creates an ambience completely atypical of mexico one that suggests rio or havana far more than mexico city or guadalajara the majority of these displaced negroes live in hillside communities on the outskirts of town and some of these areaslike la laja and calle ochorecall the favelas of black orpheus the african influence is also reflected in acapulcos music and typically mexican ranchero songs while still popular are given a strong run for their money by such afrocarib rhythms as the merengue or pachanga presence of a strong negroid strain among acapulquenos invariably creates confusion among tourists where do they come from this is a question i have had thrown at me repeatedly and my explanations have usually been greeted with utmost skepticism the idea of a negro mexican defies the american and european stereotype and i have heard afroacapulquenos explained as cuban refugees afroamericans west indians visiting africans and in fact as just about anything but what they actually were of the afromexicans who have remained in their homeland the coast people inhabit a number of fishing villages like tecoanapa in guerrero and corralero in oaxaca terrain here resembles not only the west african littoral but such transpacific locations as fiji new guinea and the solomon islands where the inhabitants though nonafrican are of negroid stock the coastal negroes are skilled swimmers and divers and of the ones who eventually make the move to acapulco many wind up as professional skindivers and water ski instructors yet a few miles inland you wont find one man in who can swim a stroke but it is the hill folk of afromexico who will most actively stir the imagination of lost civilization enthusiasts for the land they inhabit furnishes daily a drama recalling the american wild west complete with ranches brandings roundups and even occasional range wars but if the area is isolated it is far from impoverished as it contains some of the best grazing country and finest herds in the republic such prosperity is reflected in the overall economy and the small town of cuajinicuilapa with less than population has three movie houses an airport and is fully electrified for a community that size this is almost unprecedented in mexico another striking similarity between the region and our old frontier relates to views on crime in these uplands there are only two unforgivable offensesrustling and stealing horses lawbreaking of a nonbovine or equine nature is dealt with whenever possible by the victims family with police strongly discouraged from intervening but rustlers and horse thieves are handed over for quick trial before courts that mete out a merciless justice for example a huehuetan girl of my acquaintance regularly takes friday afternoons off from work to visit her cousin in the acapulco city jail he is in the sixth year of a year sentence with the sure prospect of having to serve out his full term his offense was too serious to warrant consideration of pardon or even parole i inquired as to the nature of his crime and was told that he had been convicted of selling stolen butchers meat regardless of environmental differences both the amphibious coastal people and the herdsmen in the hills have in common a number of uniquely african folkways on the coast as in the mountains village huts are circularshaped constructed of wattle and topped by thatched roofs both coastal and mountain women carry loads and baskets on their headsthis accounts for the magnificent posture of afromexican girlsand babies are carried africanstyle astraddle the mothers hip indian women on the other hand carry babies in a rebozo or shawl the enchanting world of afromexico provides interest for americans of a wide variety of tastes and backgroundsfor the travel writer it is an untapped gold mine out of curiosity i scanned every guide book on mexico i could get my hands on and encountered only onethe revised edition of terrys guide to mexicothat even mentions the region the negro enclave is also an anthropologists dream and budding ashley montagues and margaret meads as they cover the area will find source material to fill a score of scholarly monographs if any remain unconvinced i make the following suggestion on their next trip to acapulco let them invest the round trip per passenger price of a small charter planeand visit either cuajinicuilapa guerrero or santo domingo oaxaca both communities serviced by airfields then let them say that mexico has no lost civilization the negro and the police ew york city police lt thomas r gilligan shot james it powell to death and harlem dissolved into an angry riot the uproar that started there set off a chain reaction that spread to several other cities immediately after the rioting sociologists psychiatrists and city officials set themselves to the task of finding out just how it all got started in the first place one of the reasonsand often the trigger that sets off violence in the streets is the hate and fear that exists between negroes and the police but hostility between the negro and the police is not manifested once a year in spectacularly isolated instances like the harlem riot the feeling is there week after week year after year and it is evident in hundreds of small incidents that do not receive newspaper coverage the u s commission on civil_rights has stated that police brutality is one of the major injustices in america today case histories documented in the commissions report reveal that the civil liberties of negroes in the custody of the police have been flagrantly violated in chief detective pape and chicago policemen broke into james monroes apartment monroe and his wife were wakened and forced to stand in the center of the bedroom while their six children were lined up in the living room pape reportedly hit monroe several times calling him nigger and black boy another policeman was accused of assaulting mrs monroe several of the children said they were kicked and beaten monroe was taken to jail and held on an open charge for hours he was denied the right to call a lawyer he was denied the right to appear before a magistrate he was finally released without any charges being filed against him in in the case of monroe vs pape the u s supreme court rendered a decision which permitted monroe to sue the chicago police department for violating the federal civil_rights act an naacp report on police practices in a large california city contained this case history a police officer went to investigate a complaint according to the naacp he was belligerent and choked one of the negroes to the ground a fight followed during which the officer was hit on the head with a womans shoe twentyfive arrests followed this incident it was presumed by the officers that one of the men involved in the fight knew who had struck the officer with the shoe he was taken to a secluded spot and beaten later booked in city jail and contrary to usual practice no photographs were taken of him lack of restraint by police is shown not only in individual incidents but in confrontations with civil_rights demonstrators as well in princess anne maryland peaceful picketing of segregated restaurants turned into a riot the state police used dogs clubs and fire hoses to break up the crowd of negro students one demonstrator threw acid on the leg of a state trooper burning him slightly several of the students were bitten by the dogs and kicked by police when on the ground fortysix students had injuries ranging from bloody noses to concussions fourteen were bitten by dogs five so badly they needed stitching in new york recently a group of parents demonstrated to dramatize the need for a traffic light near a harlem school their protest resulted in several arrests and charges of police brutality by demonstrators it was alleged that police kicked shoved and struck women and children as they broke up the gathering mrs alice kornegay said that police kicked her in front of the school mrs vonnie jordan president of the schools pta charged that police kicked us and hit us while making their arrests a yearold boy said that the police struck him in the side while he was walking along the street near the demonstration several recent incidents in los angeles illustrate that feeling between the police and the negro is dangerously explosive a policeman was knocked unconscious and windows of two patrol cars smashed by a mob following a high school track meet other policemen were showered with sticks and stones by spectators who objected to the arrest of a youth who had been ejected from the stadium more than officers were summoned before the crowd estimated at was dispersed the next day police officers ambulance attendants and victims of a busauto collision were assaulted by a rock throwing crowd that gathered at the scene of the accident an officer said that rocks cement and bottles were thrown at them as they attempted to aid the injured both these incidents occurred in south los angeles the negro district of that city soon after these outbreaks of violence two negro members of the los angeles city council recommended increased training in community relations for policemen billy g mills one of the councilmen refused to label police tactics as discriminatory but pointed out that he is stopped on numerous occasions by policenot because i am violating the law but because they see me at night driving a car provided by the city william h parker chief of the los angeles police dept blamed the disturbances on social unrest and resentment against all forms of government authority he said we have long been concerned about the tendency to blame the police for the inability of some people to conform to the law but james farmer national director of core said that negro social unrest stems to a large degree from police brutality police do not respect the negroes rights as a citizen so how can negroes respect the police he continued the feeling in the negro community especially in the north is stronger against police brutality than anything else a resident in a negro community after witnessing a fight between white police officers and a young traffic offender who happened also to be a negro tried to analyze the cause of the disorder she said its just they dont have the right approach they dont respect you what are you going to do what are we going to do malcolm_x thought he had the solution he said it is criminal to teach a man not to defend himself when he is the constant victim of brutal attacks it is legal and lawful to own a rifle and louis lomax at a conference on civil equality at pomona college said that the nonviolent negro revolt has just about run its course he said nonviolence is downright unamerican and one of the reasons you dont respect me and you call me boy is that i dont defend myself while lomax did not spell out exactly what forms he thought the new revolution of selfdefense might take it is certain that confrontations between police and civil_rights groups would not be exempt from the extreme militant approach but when malcolm_x advocated the unlawful use of guns he was approving the acts of the lee harvey oswalds of this world when louis lomax derides the nonviolent movement he spurns the obvious gains made by dr martin_luther_king recipient of the nobel peace prize surely it is possible to solve the most difficult problems within the framework of existing law history has proven that the extreme limits of selfjustification and selfdefense can only lead to anarchy many people involved in the study of the relations between the police and the negro feel that the education of the police officer in minority group problems has been seriously neglected they contend that the police have been unwilling to recognize the fact that socioeconomic factors have a direct bearing on individual behavior courses offered the recruit are neither long enough nor intensive enough worse still most police departments stubbornly insist on having police officers instead of trained social scientists teach such courses dr charlotte epstein a social scientist and author of the book intergroup relations for police officers supports this criticism according to dr epstein the men should be given every possible opportunity to come to grips with their own prejudices and learn how to control them in the performance of their duty they should be helped to eliminate from their framesofreference all the stereotypes all the misconceptions about racial religious and nationality minorities they also need thorough grounding in our concept of lawnot only in specific ordinances but in the meaning of the law the spirit of the law the extension of the law to the everyday relationships of men dr epstein also says in addition to study of group prejudices and law they need some broadening in other human relations concepts for example their responses to the problems of homosexuality are so personal and emotional that they undoubtedly interfere in their impartial dealings with homosexuals their attitudes toward college students artists bearded men and toward women need exploration and understanding what must not be overlooked is a thorough investigation of the relationship between race and crime covering the many misconceptions extant concerning this relationship lack of proper grounding in the social sciences is one reason for hostility between negroes and the police but there are other reasons as well during the s the negro population had a net increase of percent while whites increased percent at the end of the fifties for the first time in history more than half of all negroes were living outside the south with the greatest increase in the far west seventy two percent of all negroes now live in urban areas as opposed to percent white in spite of these increases in population and a knowledge of the potential explosion that comes with them city governments have been reluctant to allocate more money for improved police training methods for accelerated recruitment programs or for policemens salaries huge urban complexes such as new york los angeles chicago and detroit have let slums grow unheeded have allowed and sometimes encouraged de facto segregation in schools have done too little too late about fair employment practices have seen their crime rate rise year after year and then have professed to be shocked when their police force has to cope with race riots but the vast majority of citizens must along with their city officials accept part of the blame intellectually we know that the police are necessary but emotionally we wish just to be left alone since we do not want to see or hear or know the police the problems that are particularly indigenous to law enforcement agencies no matter in what area do not touch us we are reluctant to call the police if a neighbor has broken the law we think twice about offering a policeman help if he is in trouble we utter lofty sentiments about the sacredness of law and order and at the same time we reject those who are sworn to protect that law and order although the reasons behind conflicting feelings are very different white sentiment about the negro closely parallels that felt about the police the majority of white americans advocate equal treatment for all but emotional uneasiness about the negros drive for equality often tends to negate what whites know intellectually is legally and morally right according to a newsweek magazine survey whites feel by a margin of that negroes are moving too fast twotoone are against lunchroom sitins fivetothree are against picketing and are against liedowns in front of trucks at construction sites resistance is greatest where negroes are trying to cross in large numbers into working class communities especially those of immigrant descent in the recent presidential primary in wisconsin gov george wallace of alabama received percent of the vote he received a strong vote from labor while his heaviest democratic vote was among those of polish descent an naacp float in a st patricks day parade in south boston bearing the slogan from the fight for irish freedom we must fight for american equality was bombarded with rocks beer bottles and cherry bombs in seattle washington a fair housing ordinance was turned down by a vote despite heavy support from church and civic leaders and on november rd californians passed proposition which if not declared unconstitutional by the courts will nullify virtually all of californias fair housing laws perhaps the negro and the police are singled out for abuse by a disgruntled white populace because they are both so obvious the policeman with his uniform the negro because of the color of his skin both are effectively isolated both are harassed both are at one time or another spat upon and when two such alien groups are backed into a comer it is inevitable that they should turn and snarl at each other a substantial portion of negro charges that the police are hostile to minority group aspirations is dismissed by many as hysterical mudslinging by an agitated people but john milner professor of social work at the university of southern california and until recently a parttime teacher of police in human relations problems had this to say i can say that the policemen and women seem to be generally prejudiced against the negro this attitude stems from two major reasons one the police personnel tend to come from lower class or lower middle class families two the police fear the negro and with good reason the need to deal with the uneducated delinquent type who regard all constituted authority with hostility the crime and delinquency rate among the negro population is extremely high and much of the policemans work is taken up with them and to him they seem the major social problem he sees no way to handle them except by control he therefore fears their being given more freedom capitals supplied mr milner goes on to say that i have found this prejudiced attitude quite common to police from all parts of the u s those working in the major cities seem to fear them negroes even more than do police in the smaller southern communities it has always been a point of discussion in my classes whether or not the negro is a subhuman being as some policemen in every class have insisted the negro does not respond in the same way as the white to their use of authority and they see them as a different type of delinquent the police tend to view demonstrations as rowdyism as exhibitionism in its crudest form they think of the revolution as essentially a rebellion against the status quo this strikes a sensitive nerve for the police dearly love the status quo it is their sworn duty after all to protect it the police do not seek sensationalism they do not court controversy they do in fact abhor it one of the policemens fondest and most legitimate desires is to be viewed as a professional man equipped through intelligence training and efficiency to do a difficult job to achieve this goal the police have in the past several years been paying more and more attention to public relations the art of creating a good image is an important part of every recruits training the negro with his noisy attentiongetting ways is threatening to spoil all these efforts he is reviving old cries of police brutality and dumb cop he is creating front page headlines and pictures of police dragging demonstrators off to jail he is then more than a nuisance more than a crime statistic he is in policemens eyes a dangerous threat to a much desired elevation in status occasionally when criticism of police practices in negro ghettos in large cities becomes too vocal the police hold a public meeting to discuss grievances one such meeting was held recently in southern california and although it was well publicized in advance fewer than forty people attended at the meeting no complaints were received the police immediately seized on the lack of complaints as proof that no problems exist but this simple explanation ignores the fact that for over years any desire on the part of the negro to speak out against injustice has been swiftly repressed so if negroes do not come forth to speak out in lawful assembly their reluctance to meet the white man on his own territory should be understandable it is unfortunate that this reasoning which is based on historical fact completely escapes the police it is little wonder then that a large majority of negroes have little faith in citizens committees or biracial councils or in the humanitarianism of the law instead they take to the streets to fight the shadowy ghosts of inequality and they use the same weapons their oppressors have always used against them fear intimidation and violence when negroes do take to the streets policemen are frightened they see themselves as the only thing standing between angry negroes and a complacent white society as such they tend to exaggerate the potential violence of individuals and soon have trouble distinguishing between a peaceful civil_rights demonstration and an angry mob the policeman is the obvious target for hate and a need for violence he is the man who must face and deal with the lunatic fringe the dissident elements who become angry individuals the rioters who strike out blindly at any symbol of authority but the law must not become a club to beat down those who seek to arouse us it must not protect those who seemingly deserve it and oppress those who are the havenots in our society there can be no flexible scale to determine who is to be granted civil liberties and who is to be denied them the great wisdom in the bill of rights decrees that civil liberties are each individuals inherent right no matter what his status or his crime what must we do to ease the fear and prejudice that poisons actions and communication between the negro and the police a predominantly white society which purportedly believes in the dignity of the individual and the sacredness of the law has tried to banish both the necessity of the police and the shame of the negro from its conscious thoughts in a very real sense this society has relegated the negro and the policeman as well to a position of secondclass citizenship worse yet both groups have been placed in a position which for one or the other may soon become untenable we must as citizens as community leaders as members of a minority race or members of a major power structure as individuals and in groups work in courtrooms in jail cells on street comers and in alleys to see to it that a negros rights his dignity and at times his person are protected we must use our influence and our tax dollars to demand that policemen are exposed to more sophisticated and more extensive instruction in community relations and we must somehow convince the policeman that his status and his security are not being threatened by the negros drive to achieve the same goals whether he likes it or not our faceless john doe is involved when a nightstick cracks into someones skull he is involved in the civil_rights movement he is involved in the policemans objectives and his prejudices it is imperative that every citizen realize that this is happening to him it is clear that only this awareness will stir him into taking an active role in helping himself solve this great american dilemma i have not yet read or heard anyone speak of the historical significance of malcolm_x more tragic than his all men die sooner o later was that it was precipitated in the early days of a basic change in his philosophy perhaps it would be more precise to say jelling of his philosophy for his break with the old man elijah muhammad was the change and all that followed until his murder was really a quest for what this sensitive and dramatic angry man knew could be found somewhere in spite of america for me his search was consciously or unconsciously the reclamation of the black mans masculinity sociologically what focus the negro family has had parentally has been for the most part matriarchalthat is centered in the motherfigure the racist critics who disparage the instability of negro family life fail to note that there was no concept of family life in the negro community in the south until just a hundred years ago then following emancipation the leftover evils of slavery some of which are much in evidence today contributed largely to the suppression of the fatherfigure in the already weakened and sometimes broken family circle reconstruction followed by separate but equal and the coupling with antebellum traditions prevented the negro male from becoming a man the only course left was survival by accommodation being an uncle tom the male head of the negro family could defend neither his woman nor his children he was impotent politically and economically he ab solved violence and death without cause or purpose having had to stand by and see his children starved and his women raped the negro man either resigned his manhood or physically fled his responsibility as the only alternatives to sure death the end result of this circumstance was for the negro child to be almost totally dependent upon the female head of the family for strength direction hope whatever children for the last three or four generations have grown to manhood and womanhood under this matriarchal influence necessitated by loss of the negro males masculinity this is why brother malcolm has historical importance as he was symptomatic of the terrible ills that beset our nation domestically he was also symptomatic of the solution to those ills black and white people who regretted and resented the presence of a malcolm_x would have done better to have regretted and resented the society that produced him it must be noted that as malcolm made an impact on society in reciprocal fashion he felt its impact on him how was it that a malcolm_x never appeared on the scene until the nonviolent movement led by martin_luther_king jr had reached thunderous proportions all of the problems have been just about the same for the last one hundred years one who is a thoughtful student of sharp social change can recognize the telltale dynamics of revolution given a martin_luther_king jr there had to be a malcolm_x in earlier days dr_king was considered by most in the national community circa a dangerous wildeyed perverter of religion with demagogic power and obvious communist sympathies whites were not alone in swallowing hard at his extremist tactics enter malcolm_x and dr_king in contrast to the fiery outpourings of malcolm_x a la muhammad necessarily became more palatable to the american scene king the pioneer of a new militancy provokes a response that purports to outking king thus malcolm represented a newly found assertiveness that had lain dormant too long in the minds of men of color casual observers m of the present american scene in race relations mistakenly assess malcolm as more militant and dr_king as less militant when in reality each practiced distinctly different methodologies dr_king by the nature and practice of nonviolence could not be more militant malcolms practice was far less militant than his theory militancy is more accurately measured by how determinedly one pursues and achieves his goals dr_king chose nonviolence as his methodology and has steadily escalated and broadened his attack against the evils of bigotry and prejudice so much so that his work now tangentially is of significance to international affairs malcolms methodology was verbalized as an eyeforaneye in earlier days and softened to selfdefense in later days the goals of both though not always described as such were basically securing a fair shake for the black man in america dr_kings techniques have proved to be not only religious and morally rooted but also practically and realistically productive however charitably one may view the work of malcolm_x the same caliber of results are not evident not everyone can buy the nonviolent stratagems of dr_king and company though i am proud to be counted in his number few precious few can academically and functionally accept nonviolence as a way of life all those who are left are not necessarily spineless or violent there are certainly those like malcolm whose manhood was challenged strengthened by the repeated heroism of men women and children of the deep south in the face of awesome hardships physical and emotional the nonviolent movement in the south broke the shackles from many chained minds in the north through its raw courage alone a malcolm_x a jesse gray a milton galamison had to do something though they would not or could not abide by the discipline of the kingled forces who turn the other cheek to some degree this may explain some character of disconnectedness in the thrust of the negro community in our large urban centers of the north the newfound assertiveness of the negro in the north went off in as many different directions as the personalities through whom it was filtered at some points as in the case of last summers looting and socalled riots its misdirection and lack of discipline degenerated into senseless violence in almost every instance it expressed itself most vehemently at that point in society where the negro male has been emasculated most confrontation with law enforcement officials malcolm brought whitey down front and men who had cowered inwardly and outwardly in the presence of the nameless white face in whose world he moved admired his spunk and grit vicariously through him some negro men got up off their knees for the first time in their lives and touched their manhood as if it were a new christmas toy what am i saying we should make the late mr little st malcolm not at all malcolm was guilty at times of useless illogical and intemperate remarks that helped neither him nor his cause i personally could never buy black nationalism nor could i recommend it even if conditions for black men were infinitely worse than they are but all the world must agree that malcolm had the book on white america and he read it loud and clear for all to hear the press generally more from naivete than from malice wrote malcolm off rather quickly at death almost summarily as living and dying by the sword this was neither a fair or accurate assessment of the late malcolm_x careful study of malcolms preachments particularly after his break with elijah muhammad reveal primarily focus on being problack as versus being antiwhite as he was erroneously described in epitaph a secondary focus was his insistence on the right of an individual to protect the sanctity of his home life and property with arms as over against his newspaperproduced reputation of encouraging black to take up arms against white these are fine shades of differences but absolutely crucial to understanding the historical importance of brother malcolm the current lowbudget movie nothing but a man is the story of another malcolm fictitious yet very real who can be found all over this land dove anderson the main character wasnt looking for trouble or running away from it either his unverbalized goal in this magnificent picture was to be nothing but a man thats what malcolm_x was all about he was the symbol of negro males who though groping have not yet found the answer to how they can be nothing but a man which is really more than enough the emptiness of negro middle class church life i know that it is a hazi ardous mission to un dertake an examina rv tion of the weaknesses qf mjdde dass negro church life accordingly while exercising care and all due moderation in my deliberations i shall also frequently rely on the observations of eminent sociologists and theologians to back up most of my contentions they too have reluctantly come to recognize a growing emptiness in black bourgeoisie church life besides in many ways this analysis is a commentary on white middle class church life after which the negro middle class generally is patterned in fact the most ostensible difference between white and negro middle class church life though there are others as we shall seeis that negro church services usually last twice as long for reasons that will become clear as we go along one reason why negro services last so long is the desire for everybody to have a word and the necessity for welcoming all visitorsbut more about that later a cue to the middle class negro mentality may be found in a comparison of church songs used by lower class negroes and the middle class regardless of what may be said of the lower class at least their songs have meaning in that they symbolize malcontent and a desire to escape their deprivation they at least are bent on going somewhere therefore their songs frequently contain some reference to a vehiclea chariot a train bound for the promised land which will swing down some day by and by and take them out of their misery failing that they plan to walk through that valley or ill fly away on the other hand recent visits to middle class negro churches revealed anthems and such titles as rejoice and be glad and it is well with my soul these symbolize their acquiescence and complacent contentment but before examining in detail the emptiness of middle class negro church life let us look at the background factors to their behavior unlike white middle class individuals many of whom are the children of middle class parents many middle class negro individuals grew up as lower class persons as they move up the status ladder many grow dissatifled with membership in the lower class churches they have known in early life they accordingly switch into churches not identified with the negro others choose a church because of its prestige the faculty of a college in the south where i once taught has been known to join whatever church the president belongs to when they had an episcopalian president most were episcopalians later when they obtained a baptist president most joined the baptist church he attended e franklin frazier found professionals such as lawyers and doctors belonging to two churches one for prestige while retaining membership in a lower class church in order to attract a clientele some other persons retain membership in two denominations because they are reluctant to let their parents back home know they have switched denominations large churches also serve a status value the abyssinian baptist church in harlem is said to be the largest in the united states in many others in the north where migrant negroes have experienced new status gains persons desiring a seat must go long before services begin this is not so much a reflection of mushrooming piety as it is a passion for big churches accordingly many churches overreport their membership and yet these mass churches are characterized by anonymity and a loss of individuality on the part of members in addition middle class negro churches seek to sever their identity with negro lower class churches gibson winters the suburban captivity of the church has pointed out that negro middle class churches often form a buffer against the lower class community they reject the lower class yet they must live with constant reminders of their common heritage and their own recent escape from the southern lower class the aggravation stemming from this fact led one middle class minister to comment that storefront churches merely express pentup emotions and moreover that people of this type lower class church members are in the first stages of insanity vattel daniel writing in the american sociological review reported that many middle class negro christians regard deep religious devotion as synonymous with lower class worship getting happy for example in a black bourgeoisie church is strictly taboo and according to st clair drake in black metropolis a person who admits to being sanctified is immediately labeled lower class thus the middle class has generally become alienated from the lower class churches and their problems what should be the biggest source of mission is ignored meanwhile some take missions to help civilize or christianize africa and even contribute to such funds as white educational enterprises on the other hand during my days as a member of a middle class negro church i sat and watched the deacons escort a middle aged woman who being lower class was responding with oral enthusiasm to the ministers message straight out of the church at the ministers request frazier in the negro church told how middle class negroes have tried to remove identification as negroes from their churches the colored methodist episcopal cme became the christian methodist episcopal there has also been some effort to get the ame african methodist episcopal changed to the american methodist episcopal but the masses rejected the move another sociologist reported as early as that many middle class negroes were severing their affiliation with churches traditionally associated with negroes baptist methodist and joining others with nonnegro identities such as the catholics lutherans and episcopalian thus churches with a majority of lower class members among whites such as the catholics and the lutherans become upper class negro churches in moving up the status ladder some seem to get the impression as they follow whites to the suburbs and where possible into their staid congregations that they also are moving out of the negro race they appear to believe that heaven is surely integrated and therefore the only way to heaven is through the doors of an integrated church they covet white church membership as an earthly symbol of the paradise they perceive accordingly they stage prayins not to mention unpublicized slinkins to gain admission to congregations that have failed to demonstrate true christian ways such congregations have lagged behind the courts and the schools in accepting negroes and have as a group only subsequently begun spouting some sympathy for their negro brethren and their predicament nor have they raised their voices in a sustained fashion on any other major evil of todays world such as war and imperialism we do not expect that middle class negroes who hunger for the white brand of religion will have anything much to say about these issues either but not only is the middle class negro church a caricature of the white church it surpasses the white church in some areas of organized distraction for example the negro middle class church was found by frazier the negro church to be the most materialistic religious group in the united states this is indicated by the competition for finery visible in elaborate buildings and furnishings and in the members struggle to outdress one another at church affairs some persons feel out of place if they are not well togged the bulk of the collection generally goes to the building fund while only about per cent according to benjamin mays and nicholson in the negros church is given to missions education and the like in spite of the emphasis on the erection of grand physical structures many members are found to hedge on giving their share to the collection plate less than half of the reported membership in the negro church were found by mays and nicholson to pay their dues regularly the larger the church the fewer the contributions in relation to the members in that more can hide behind anonymity in the group this gives rise to numerous and complex appeals for contributions in the effort to wring money from stingy members some churches instruct communicants to march by the collection table up front on the assumption that they will be too ashamed to walk by without giving anything this exercise usually follows and complements previous passings of the collection plate some follow the general offering with sacrificial offerings in addition envelopes are often distributed to members and contributions given official credit this is in contrast to the lower class practice of taking collection by merely whipping up the spirit of the members on the spot the emptiness of the middle class negro church also emerges in the formality of their exercises which though similar to that of the white middle class is more intense according to gibson winters in the suburban captivity of the church not only do they require subdued expression of religious emotions with orderliness and uniformity they also frown on verbal outbursts and are afraid to clap their hands even if the spirit should move them to do so i recently noted with interest the admonition in a middle class negro church program enter the sanctuary in silence also whereas songs once were started by anyone so moved now ritualistic monotony is broken only by an occasional standing to accompany the organ in rendering a hymn thus they are adopting the ritualismasanendinitself approach characteristic of white congregations described in morris l wests novel the devils advocate while we do not need to dwell on the antics of negro middle class ministers as i have discussed that in another study see have negro ministers failed their roles negro digest july the emptiness of the sermons of many ministers is apparent the subject of a middle class sermon recently heard was why everybody should go to church while some especially in the south do capitalize on the drama of the negros struggle for equality many label such sermons derogatorily as political speeches many are bent on saving souls instead of the race others would prefer to save members for their churches than to save souls they accordingly spend much time on biblical legend rather than on the worlds current problems this grows in part from a desire to show off knowledge of biblical history learned in white divinity schools the longwinded among them likewise are given to spouting grand theology and yet while they have produced some leaders in the field of race relations they have not according to joseph washington himself a leading negro minister produced any firstrate theologians this is partly due to their opposition to intellectual efforts within the area of religion whereas ministers used to whoop up their audiences to righteousness they now whisper into microphones instead of chastizing members for their wrongdoings in the middle class they now read an assurance of pardon preceding the reading of their prepared sermons this leads to conflicts with their members ruby johnston the development of negro religion found ministers far less tolerant toward emotionalism than church laymen they have accordingly lost some of the rapport between speaker and members who used to indicate approval and spur the minister on in the middle class the minister now appears as a formal lecturer anyone who forgets and says amen will be looked upon with scorn this formality is regarded as progress and culture since middle class church services necessarily are more cold and impersonal compared to the lower class they lose and miss a basic warmth and intimacy many are not even known by their pastors whom they see only on sunday thus the necessity for fellowhip and acceptance in a variety of committees and associations others must complement their associational life with pseudoreligious fraternities clubs and lodges they form hospitality committees to fill an apparent absence of hospitality in addition there is a plethora of interests peripheral to church worship itself there is a proliferation of clubs associations missions fellowships auxiliaries orientation dinners and other recreational activities and organizations to compensate for social maladjustment to city life this is not to mention the various raffles and bizarres to compensate for low contributions already discussed reflecting in part the growing secularization of american society many according to joseph washington confuse religiosity with faith indeed some adopt a cynical attitude toward faith ruby johnston found in a study of persons that of those expressing a belief in god only were warm in their expression and only enthusiastic of those expressing a belief in prayer only were warm and enthusiastic this is not even to mention that some of those who were enthusiastic were no doubt giving lip service to an acceptable folkway in any case many feel that it is necessary only to profess membership without following the dictates of their faith or even attending services religious affiliation is enough for them vattel daniel found churchgoing not important especially for upper class negroes in other churches there is a high turnover of membership with members bouncing from church to church in search of spiritual satisfaction those who attend church services have failed to make any significant contributions to theology in part because they have sat back and gloated over the fact that christ died for us even the famous white lawyer clarence darrow once told a negro congregation to get off their knees and do something rather than rear back and wait to be redeemed in mimicking white religious bodies negro middle class congregations are fast becoming as empty as their coveted model but they will have to go far beyond white religious models if they are going to be successful in promoting high religious ideals jim crow justification sixties style i am just as opposed to booker t washington as a voter with all his anglosaxon reinforcements as i am to the cocoanut headed chocolate colored typical little coon andy dotson who blacks my shoes every morning thus andy dotson went down in american history along with u s senator james k vardaman of mississippi who made that statement in a speech in during his governorship he had expressed an equally strong opposition to educating the negros head and he stated bluntly that negroes would always be only a servant class in mississippiand in all the states ultimately as a member of the mississippi house of representatives governor u s senator vardaman was significantly instrumental in designing establishing and defending a pattern of rigid humiliating and exploitative racial segregation which did ultimately encompass the entire deep southbut hardly all of the union and now this anomalous caste system in american democracy is under incessant attack from many quarters but like any established human institution under attack it has its staunch defenders among those warmly defending segregation are notably most of the white southern clergymen in upholding the racial status quo they are however only acting in a traditional role during the abolition movement the southern clergy stoutly defended chattel slavery as necessary to the continuation of our civilization today dr clayton sullivan a baptist minister of tylertown mississippi thinks that at the present time in the rural south segregation is a social necessity a device to stave off cultural disintegration speaking out saturday evening post april but before the end of his article his present time has merged with the distant future for he sees a complex negro problem that is going to be around for generations to come a further glimpse into southern history which dr sullivan almost completely ignores will better indicate why segregation was devised it should be understood that the establishment of segregation was definitely not the restoration of a social order that had existed before the civil war it was instead a new order of a kind that would have been impractical with the close association during slavery further this new order was not instituted immediately after reconstruction see the strange career of jim crow by c vann woodward in fact there was a considerable period of uneasy respite for the negro people during which negroes shared in the use of public facilities held local state and national offices and served on juries and on the bench for instance in two years after the removal of federal occupation troops from the south negroes in jackson were using hamilton park for picnics and angelos hall for dancesthe same park that white church ladies used for fetes and the same hall that whites used for dances and for democratic conventions for several years most mississippi saloons served customers of both races at the same bar providing separate tables for each race many restaurants served all comers in the same room rigidity in interracial relations came to mississippi later and relaxed relations between the races was more manifest and lasted longer in other states in eight years after home rule had been restored a negro journalist traveled from boston to south carolina with a chip on my shoulder and found the south ahead of the north in relaxed and friendly relations between the races that same year a northern visitor in new orleans was greatly surprised if not shocked by the free and easy race relations there also the period of office holding by negroes was not confined to reconstruction the last negro congressman from the changing south was george h white of north carolina who completed his term in and negroes in large numbers continued to vote in the south on through the nineties negroes were eventually disfranchised by indirection through constitutional trickery that began in mississippi in and ended as late as in georgia ironically one duly elected delegate to the mississippi constitutional convention of was a negro i t montgomery the central purpose of this convention openly avowed but not officially acknowledged was to disfranchise the negro montgomery estimated the new constitution would eliminate negro voters but only whites see from slavery to freedom by john hope franklin in thirteen years after the restoration of home rule mississippi had registered negro voters in she had the respite for the negro people was indeed uneasy negro lynching was proceeding apace during the period of negro voting this summary method of rendering justice reached its high point in when people were lynched roughly three per week and sometimes and in some places negro voters were marched in from a plantation and voted and some of them were often kept away from the polls by trickery or intimidation and some of their votes were often stolen yet their votes in considerable numbers did often count rival politicians vied with one another for the negro vote respectfully addressing a voter as mister so incidentally voting rights not only afforded negroes occasions for a sense of ordinary human dignity but they also exerted a cultural influence upon politicians but if you want to degrade an enfranchised people the first logical step is to disfranchise them after the negro was disfranchised in any state his social abasement could proceed without consideration of political expediency besides negro disfranchisement would stop rival white factions from stealing the negro vote that became a popular argument though rigid segregation in the south was welcomed by many for economic psychological and social reasons it was sanctioned by the old line aristocratic conservative democrats seasoned and skillful politicians only when a political crisis seriously threatened their overthrow hoping to attract northern and eastern industry and capital to the redeemed south they had begun to support the interests of the railroads the big banks and other corporations but the poor whites as well as the negroes needed low freight rates and easy money in order to prosper even moderately for many small farmers high freight rates and hard money led directly to mortgage foreclosures since no middle class as such had yet arisen in the south nearly all of the white population belonged to the small farmer class so in the eighties third parties began to arise to challenge the conservative whiglike democrats as greenbackers independents or readjusters these political rebels made no headway but when the populists members of the peoples party appeared on the southern scene in large numbers in the nineties they posed a real threat to the serene supremacy of the conservative democrats the white populists not only welcomed negroes as members they also gave them positions in the policy making councils of the party the farming whites and the negroes had a pressing common interest that for a time drew them together politically they shared a grinding poverty as one white delegate to a state populist convention expressed it they were both in the same ditch the populists won many local elections across the south populist sheriffs a different breed from the segregationist sheriffs of today were quite common and in their counties negroes generally were treated as fullfledged citizens at least by the sheriffs the populists with the aid of the republicans were actually able to gain political control of one state north carolina to the conservative democrats the prospects of a permanent political union between large numbers of whites and negroes became truly a clear and present danger and when these rebels began to talk about land reform they became an intolerable menace but the democrats had in reserve one surefire weapon which they were now ready to unlimber color prejudice a broad campaign of vilification against the negro people was carried on simultaneously with the disfranchising drive ttiis campaign enlisted the services of the press public forums the pulpit and the authors of books one book which appeared in was entitled the negro a beast or in the image of god lynching was the strongarm part of this campaign to put the negro in his place and keep him there by a blatant and massive appeal to the dormant race prejudice that slumbered unacknowledged if not unrecognized in the frustrated breasts of many populists the democrats were able to wreck the peoples party in state after state the name of the party disappeared from the ballot in tom watson of georgia was the last populist presidential candidate but the peoples party was dead for a quarter of a century watson had fought gallantly sometimes dangerously for negro rights and for populism but in he too climbed on the bandwagon of negrophobia and thus became the antinegro political boss of georgia after the death of the populist party the poor whites in their untutored poverty could at least have the pleasure of looking down upon the niggersthe booker t washingtons along with the andy dotsons but the negroes stripped of political allies were inextricably enmeshed in the relentlessly closing net of cold segregation in its rigid legalized form segregation is chiefly a twentieth century product up to jim crow laws applied only to railroad travel except that georgia alone had some jim crow street cars montgomery did not have separate street car facilities until and before only three states had separate waiting rooms in fact practically all segregation laws were enacted early in this century whites only and colored were twentieth century signs we managed to get along without for decades after emancipation louisiana didnt get around to separating its circus patrons by law until and it was before south carolina law even began to require separate facilities for factory workers in design and operation the new order of segregation was the best available substitute for slavery its central purpose was to degrade the negro people socially exploit them economically and stultify them mentally if it also had the effect of abasing some of them morally that should not be at all surprising for it certainly increased the moral insensitivity of many white people lacking historical knowledge most segregationists view the negro problem simply segregationists are the good guys and integrationists are the bad guys unquestionably there is a tremendous social problem in the deep south but the attitude of the local white power structure is the central obstacle to a rational handling of the problem many in positions of influence and power are still fighting the civil war as the wide official display of the old confederate flag clearly indicates many white people of that region have never fully accepted the emancipation proclamation much less the fifteenth amendment like the late senator vardaman fhey want the negro to be always a servant in order to maintain this de facto servitude the whites have wisely from their view point refused to recognize the negros full citizenship and to allow him to vote likewise they have been prudent in refusing to educate his head an informed and enfranchised servant class would of course vote itself out of servitude in dixie a vestigial sense of personal ownership of negroes which lingers on from the days of chattel slavery often comes out in casual conversation in rural areas a negro whom someone does not recognize is always identified as one of mr broadacres niggers dr sullivan finds an appalling chasm that separates most of the rural negroes from the mainstream of american life but surely he knows that segregation was deliberately devised and designed for the very purpose of separating negroes from the mainstream of american life segregate v t to separate or cut off from others or from the general masswebster the width and depth of that chasm only testify to the tragic success of segregation in a manner characteristic of segregationists dr sullivan reverses the cause and effect relationship he takes the appalling effects of segregation as a justifiable cause to continue it indefinitely that is a pleasing and satisfying way to see the situation for it eases the conscience and neatly shifts the responsibility from the perpetrators to the victims of that dehumanizing social wrong in their everyday language segregationists automatically always exclude negroes from their stream of american life for instance dr sullivan counts them in the population statistics of tylertown but when he speaks of having profound respect for the people of the town he is certainly not talking about the negroes who constitute nearly half of the people in like manner he excludes them when he refers to fellow townsmen mississippians clergymen and southerners such terms of reference are reserved for whites only negroes are only negroes a segregationist would never no never refer to a negro as a southerner white children in dr sullivans opinion should not have to go to school with negroes from impoverished homes which have been abandoned by the negro men do no white children come from such homes and is impoverishment a generally acknowledged social stigma in mississippi which has the lowest per capita income of any state in the union in dr sullivan tries to justify racial segregation on such other grounds as personal uncleanliness superstition and low moral standards but those are human characteristics under certain circumstances in twentythree years of school teaching in rural arkansasa next door neighbor to mississippii often found the same things among whites are all whites of the south now above all these things what about the ones who were once commonly known as poor white trash and whose counterparts are now commonly referred to as red necks or crackers moral standards what about the moral standards of those whites who burn negro churches by the dozens coldly bomb negro children to death and wantonly murder civil_rights workers also what about white citizens and officials who condone such acts and finally what about the morality of segregation itself which is the mother of countless immoralities immorality does not belong exclusively to any particular race neither does morality besides if impoverishment personal uncleanliness and superstition were taken as the standards by which to enforce public school segregation you would have economic class segregation instead of racial segregation and class segregation was precisely what many southern aristocrats expressed a preference for when jim crow railway cars were first introduced but people are not races nor classes either they are individuals and deserve to be treated as such the da y the world came to an end if you havent had the u world coming to an end on you when youre twelve years when it happened to me it scared the living daylights and some of the joy of sinning out of me and in a lot of other ways life altogether lieve ralph mymessed up but if i am to bewaldo emersons i i got dont compensation i guess some good out of it too the calamity befell me back in old and a sinner you we were living on a plantaknow how lucky you are tion in louisiana at the time close to the earth and god and all wrapped up in religion the church was the axis around which plantation life revolved the mother to whom the folks took their problems the teacher who taught them how the lord wanted them to live the chastiser who threatened the sinful with hell in spite of the fact that my parents were churchgoing christians i was still holding on to being a sinner not that i had anything against religion it was just a matter of integrity there was an old plantation custom that in order to be baptized into the church a sinner had to get religion a mystical experience in which the soul of the sinner was converted into christian a christian had to live upright and i knew i just couldnt come up to that on account of there were too many delicious sins around to get into but a world coming to an end can be pretty hard on a sinner the trouble began when my cousin rena came upon me playing in the watermelon patch running like the devil was behind her i was making a whole quarter of mud cabins by packing dirt over my foot in the shape of a cabin putting a chimney on top then pulling my foot out the space left by my foot formed the room of the cabin id broken some twigs off chinaberry and sycamore trees which i planted in the ground around the cabins to make trees some blooming wild flowers that negro digest august i had picked made up a flower yard in front of each cabin it was as pretty a sight as you ever want to see before she came stepping all over everything i let her know i didnt like it real loud but she didnt pay what i said any attention she just blurted out the end of the world is coming saturday you better go get you some religion in a hurry that was on a friday afternoon getting late a picture of hell flashed across my mind but i pushed it back into the subconscious the worlds not coming to an end the confidence i tried to put in my voice failed it quaked a little who told you the world is coming to an end i heard mama and miss daya talking about it just now theres going to be an eclipse sunday you know what an eclipse is dont you i didnt know but i nodded anyhow thats when the sun has a fight with the moon if the sun whips the world goes on if the moon whips then the world comes to an end well they say that sunday the moon is going to whip the sun i wasnt going to be scared into giving up my sinning that easily how do they know the moon is going to whip i asked they read it in the almanac and its in the bible too in revelation it says in revelation that the world is supposed to end this year miss daya is a missionary sister and she knows all about things like that nobody knows anything about revelation my daddy says so i rebutted aint never been nobody born smart enough to figure out revelation since that mister john wrote it hes just going to have to come back and explain it himself she acted like she didnt hear that and reverand davis said in church last sunday that time is winding up she said hes been saying that for years now and time hasnt wound up yet thats what i know hes been saying it for years and all the while hes been saying it times been winding right along and now its just about all wound up that made sense to me and i began to consider that maybe she could be right then that miss daya happened by lord bless you down there on your knees baby pray to the lord cause its praying time i hadnt gotten up from where id been making mud cabins but i jumped up quick to let her know i wasnt praying both of you girls got religion she asked and without waiting for an answer thats good youre both big girls big enough to go to hell you all be glad you all got religion cause the lord is coming soon he said he was coming and hes coming soon and she went on towards our cabin before i could ask her about the world ending sunday rena just stood there and looked at me awhile shaking her head in an i told you so and advised me again to get some religion in a hurry then she ran off to warn someone else although i was a sinner i was a regularchurchgoing sinner and at our church we had a hellfire preaching pastor he could paint pictures of hell and the devil in his sermons horrible enough to give a sinner a whole week of nightmares nobody with a dimes worth of sense wanted to go to a hot burning hell where a red horned devil tormented folks with a pitchfork but id been taking a chance on enjoying life another years or so before getting some religion getting just enough to keep me out of hell i hadnt figured on time running out on me so soon and i still wasnt taking anybodys word about the world coming to an end before asking my daddy about it first but it was plowing time and daddy was way back in the corn field where id already run across a rattlesnake so i figured even the world coming to an end could wait until suppertime i went around the rest of that day with my mind loaded down now i didnt exactly believe that the world was coming to an end out i didnt exactly believe it wasnt either about two years before id went and read the worst part of revelation and it had taken my daddy two weeks to convince me that i didnt understand what i had read which still didnt keep me from having bad dreams about the moon dripping away in blood and a lot of other distressing visions aroused from misunderstood words those dreams were only a vague and frightening memory the friday im talking about and revelation an accepted mystery yet things like that have a way of sneaking back on you when you need it the least i got to supposing the world did come to an end with earthquakes and hail and fire raining down from the sky and stars falling exactly like it read in revelation and supposing the devil got after me and took me to hell like folks on the plantation said he would and supposing hell really and truly was as horrible as the preacher said it was the way the preacher told it in hell a person got burned and burned and burned and never got all burned up and died he just kept on burning burning burning with supposing like that going through it my mind was really loaded down i figured there was no use talking to mama about what was bothering me because that miss daya had stayed at our cabin for over an hour and i was sure she had convinced mama that the moon was going to whip the sun it seemed to me like it took daddy longer than ever to come negro digest august home it was the friday of council meeting at the church and daddy a deacon had to be there i knew he wouldnt have much time to talk to me before hed have to leave out for the church so i started walking up the turnrow through the fields to meet him when i finally saw him riding towards home on his slide i ran to meet him daddy always hitched a plank under his plow to keep the plow blades from cutting up the turnrow when he came home from plowing the fields the plank which we called a slide was long enough behind the plow for him to stand on and ride home pulled by his plow horse whenever i ran to meet him hed let me ride home with him on the slide daddy i said as soon as hed put me on the slide in front of him and geed the horse to go on is the world going to come to an end sunday i dont know honey he replied why do you want to know i told him about renas prophecy that really tickled him he laughed and laughed like that was the funniest thing hed ever heard i laughed a little too though i didnt get the joke in it theres always somebody coming around prophesying that the worlds coming to an end he said after hed laughed himself out folks been doing that ever since i was a boy they were doing it when my daddy was a boy when my granddaddy was a boy aw theyve been doing that for hundreds and hundreds of years and the world is still here dont you ever pay any attention to anybody that comes around telling you the world is going to end baby but aint the world ever going to end i wanted to know yeah but dont anybody know when only the lord knows that why the world might not end for another thousand years then again it might end tonight we just dont know tonight you mean the world might end tonight sure im not saying it will but it could a person never can tell about a thing like that but if you let that bother you why youll be scared to death every day of your life looking for the world to end youre not going to be that silly are you aw shucks no i lied i was that silly right then and there i got to looking for the world to end right there on the spot like anybody expecting a calamity i decided to sit up all night that night but mama made me go to bed my room was full of the plantation night the darkest of darkness before daddy returned from church mama put out the coal oil lamp and went to bed the lazy old moon was on its vacation again there was no light anywhere not a speck although my eyes couldnt see anything in that awful dark my mind had always been very good at seeing things in the dark that werent there i got to seeing how it was going to be when the world ended the whole drama of it paraded right before my mind then my imagination marched me up before the judgment seat to give account for my past sins and i tried to figure out how much burning id get for each offense counting up all the ripe plums and peaches id saved from going to waste on the neighbors trees neglecting to get the owners permission the fights id had with that sassy little catherine who lived across the river the domino games id played for penny stakes with my sinnercousin sam the times id handled the truth careless enough to save myself from a whipping and other not so holy acts i figured id be in for some real hot burning while i lay there in that pitch black darkness worrying myself sick about burning in hell a distant rumbling disturbed the stillness of the night so faint that at first i wasnt sure id heard it i sat up in the bed straining my ears listening sure enough there was a rumbling far away the rumbling wasnt thunder i was sure of that because thunder rumbled then died away but this rumbling grew louder and louder and louder a slow moving terrible loud rumbling that was to my scared mind the earth quaking the sky caving in the world ending i got out of there i got out of there fast i didnt even think about being dressed only in my nightgown or the awful dark outside being full of ghosts and bogeymen and other horrors i just ran the world is ending the world is ending run run for your life i shouted a warning to mama and i just kept on hollering as i ran down the road past the other plantation cabins the world is ending the world is ending run run for your life doors opened and folks came out on the cabin porches some holding coal oil lamps in their hands theyd look at me in my white nightgown running down the road as fast as a scared rabbit then look up at the sky rumbling like it was caving in and a few of them hollered something at me as i passed by but i couldnt make out what any of them said i might have run myself plumb to the ocean or death if daddy and some other deacons hadnt been coming up the road on their way from church daddy caught me he had a hard time holding me though the fear of the devil and hell was stronger in me than reason i was dead set on escaping them daddy had heard my hollering about the world ending as i ran down the road towards them so he kept telling me thats just an old airplane honey the worlds not ending thats just an old airplane making all that racket when his words got through the fear that fogged my mind i calmed down a bit airplane id only heard about airplanes never had i seen one or heard one passing by daddy laughed you were just about outrunning that old airplane and keeping up almost as much racket he pointed towards the sky look up there you see its gone now see that light moving towards town thats it those old airplanes sure have scared a lot of folks with all that racket they make i looked up sure enough there was a light that looked like a star moving across the sky the rumbling was way off in the distance going away slowly like it had come and the sky was whole not a piece of it had caved in i broke down and cried because i was so relieved that the world wasnt coming to an end because id been so scared for so long because id made such a fool of myself and just because daddy pulled off his suit coat and wrapped it around me to hide the shame of my nightgown from the deacons after id had a real good cry we walked home as we walked up the ribbon of road bordering the plantation on our way home i felt a new kind of happiness inside of me the yellow squares of light shining from the black shapes of the plantation cabins outlined against the night made a picture that looked beautiful to me for the first time even the chirping of the crickets sounded beautiful like a new song id never heard before even the darkness was beautiful everything was beautiful and i was alive i felt the life within me warming me from the inside a happy feeling id never had before and the world was there all around me i was aware of it aware of all of it full of beauty full of happy things to do right then and there i was overwhelmed with a desire to live really live in the world and enjoy as much of it as i could before it came to an end and ive been doing so ever since a major event in cultural annals will take place in april when the first world festival of negro art opens in the west african nation of senegal always a rich

a dus after the demonstrations the arrests the trials and the negotiations the city administration reluctantly agreed to desegregate the buses but the ku klux klan threatened to picketand the citizens group to boycottthe buses and jones editor told him to ride one and get the story jones entered a bus and took a seat at the back so as to have a good view of all the passengers the bus was passing through a negro area which encircled the downtown district almost half the passengers were negroes there was no tension but an air of expectancy in the bus jones realized that it was up to the negroes to integrate the bus the whites were not going to sit in the back which bore the stigma of being the worst place strange he thought in a train or an airplane the jim crow place was the front while in a bus it was the back the negroes were proceeding to integrate the bus a couple got on and sat down directly behind the driver and there were others scattered through the front and the middle they avoided sitting next to whites they sat next to each other or took vacant seats as the bus passed through skid row a little nondescript negro man got on he was the sort youd see and never remember he wore nondescript clothes and had nondescript features which youd forget as soon as you saw them he peered around for a seat saw one next to an elderly white man and sat down in it the man had been hogging his seat sitting almost in the middle perhaps to discourage any negro from sitting next to him and the new passenger had to sit half in the aisle to get more room he slid closer to the old man he did not move over but turned around and stared angrily at the negro the negro kept on pushing and leaned close against him he glared at the little man with the most virulent hate in his thin face and pale blue eyes that jones had ever seen even jones was seared with the malignancy of it hell he thought that look is enough to melt a brass monkey will that little fellow have enough guts to keep on apparently he did for he kept on pushing vigorously and pressing close to the occupant all at once the old man yielded and jerked sideways and pressed stiffly against the window his face jammed against the glass as if he were trying to move as far as possible from the hated presence of the negro well that little fellow had the nerve not to give up jones thought even though the old man is hating his guts for sitting next to him hurrah for you little man but the little man seemed not to enjoy his victory he squirmed uncomfortably on the seat he peered around furtively and after a couple of stops he scampered to the door and skipped off the bus a duncolored little mouse so timid and insignificant looking that you only half glanced at him and forgot him as soon as you saw him the old man remained in the same position jammed against the side of the bus with his face pressed against the pane he must have asked the driver to call his stop for two or three blocks farther on the driver called a street loudly and looked in his mirror at the man when he did not get up the driver walked back to him and said heres your stop he did not answer and the driver touched his shoulder bending over him he touched him again then jerked back his hand and stared at it it was red with blood jesus christ he said the man is dead the other pathfinder fall the movie and tv thrillers depicting a man galloping on a fast horse lariat in hand none has ever shown a negro in that role yet in the real life of the old west a negro youth rode on one of the most famous and fastest rides on record lariat swinging his name was jacob dodson and he rode with fremont the pathfinder on the latters remarkable ride from los angeles to monterey during californias critical days of a ride on which fremont and his two companions covered miles of rugged country in actual riding hours dodson was chosen for that ride because of his skill with the lariat though only years of age he had been with fremont for four years on two great exploring expeditions to the far west in a band which included such well known frontiersmen as kit carson and thomas broken hand fitzpatrick dodson had taken part in the perilous crossing of the sierras in the winter of and in many another adventure with that band of many nations americans delaware indians french voyageurs canadians and germans which lieutenant john charles fremont assembled to chart the west for the united states government in fremonts party of men had turned from exploring to seizing california from mexico in the mexicanamerican war then going on fremont held southern california with a title of provisional governor and headquarters at los angeles while general stephen kearny held the north at monterey with only a handful of americans under his command and uneasy as rumors of impending revolt flew about fremont felt an acute need to confer with kearny but was loath to leave his post for long with characteristic imagination fremont hit on a novel method for a daring fast ride north choosing as his companions his devoted friend don jesus pico a superb horseman and the equally devoted colored man jacob dodson each of the party had three horses nine in all the riders changing mounts riding on one and then another the six loose horses ran ahead without bridle or halter when wanted for a change say at a distance of twenty miles they were caught by a lasso thrown either by don jesus or jacob who in his long expeditions with colonel fremont had become as expert as a mexican with the lasso as sure as the mountaineer with the rifle equal to either on horse or foot and always a lad of courage and fidelity according to an account in the national intelligencer of washington d c on november it was at daybreak on the morning of the nd of march the intelligencer report continues that the party set out from los angeles the way was over mountainous country with no other road than a trace and many defiles to pass particularly the punto gordo made by the jutting of a precipitous mountain into the sea and which can only be passed when the tide is out and the sea is calm the towns of santa barbara and san luis obispo were the principal inhabited places on the route the most usual gait was a swinging gallop the first day they ran miles passing the san fernando mountain and other mountains the only fatigue complained of was in jacobs right arm made tired by throwing the lasso and using it as a whip to keep the loose horses to the track the next day they made another one hundred and twentyfive miles passing the formidable mountain of santa barbara and counting the skeletons of fifty horses which perished upon it the previous christmas when fremont and the california battalion had passed that way heading south in a raging tempest at night san luis obispo was reached the home of don jesus where an affecting reception awaited fremont he was detained until ten oclock the following morning taking a breakfast of honor and receiving the visits of the inhabitants here the nine horses from los angeles were replaced by fresh mounts proceeding at the usual gait that day don jesus became fatigued after seventy miles and proposed a halt in the valley of the salinas for safety from marauding indians they chose a secluded spot off the trace but their repose that night was disturbed by a stampede among the horses not due to indians but to white bears the bears were considered dangerous fremont reached for his pistols but don jesus restrained him scaring away the bears with some loud hallowing in spanish the bears went off but sleep went off also says the account in the intelligencer and the recovery of the horses frightened by the bears building a rousing fire making a breakfast from the hospitable supplies of san luis obispo occupied the party till daybreak when the journey was resumed eighty miles and the afternoon brought the party to monterey the return ride to los angeles was covered in the same way says author f s dallenbaugh in his fremont and and fremont and his two companions rode into los angeles after leaving there a total journey of miles over rough country in actual riding hours by the use of horses one of the most remarkable rides on record for speed and distance the famous ride from ghent to aix immortalized by the poet browning was barely more than the least of these eight days of fremont another biographer of fremont cardinal goodwin says if any one of the three deserved more credit than the others it was the negro dodson whose skill with the lasso kept the men provided with fresh horses jacob dodson was a freeborn negro whose family worked in lifelong service for the family of fremonts wife the bentons at the age of he was nearly sixfeet tall and strong and active as he had watched fremont prepare in washington for his first expedition in he had begged to go along fremont took dodson as his personal servant but the youth so quickly learned the ways of the frontier that he outgrew his classification from the first he proved his mettle fremont leaving washington for the west was traveling through the pennsylvania mountains in a stagecoach with dodson charles preuss a mapmaker for the expedition and fremonts family the driver trying to pass a long freight wagon overturned us into a gully fremont related and the coach lighted on its roof jacob who was on the box was at the horses heads before the coach reached the gully and the wagoners men prevented further harm from the frightened animals dodsons name occurs a number of times in accounts of fremonts explorations fremont encamped on the shore of the great salt lake in september with a small select group of eight and reduced to a diet of roots while awaiting supplies related that for supper we had yampa the most agreeably flavored of the roots seasoned by a small fat duck which had come in the way of jacobs rifle next day the party explored the island in the lake now known as fremont island during the fremont partys desperate crossing of the snowcovered sierras in the dead of winter fremont chose dodson as his companion to reconnoiter ahead of the main party down the west slope of the range fremont relates in his report of a journey and that night he tells we encamped on the headwaters of a little creek where at last the water found its way to the pacific the night was clear and very long we heard the cries of some wild animals attracted by our fire and these strange sounds had something pleasant to negro digest august our senses in this region of silence and desolation next morning fremont and dodson followed the icy surface of the creek till it grew wider so that fremont was satisfied we had struck the stream on which mr sutter lived he was correct they had found the silver fork of the american river three weeks later on march an advance party of eight including fremont carson and dodson arrived at sutters fort in what is now the city of sacramento genial captain john sutter must have looked with wonder upon the emaciated ragged men he met that day says morgan estergreen in his kit carson a portrait in courage they had just accomplished something which he would have sworn could not be done crossing the sierra nevada range in the depths of winter but that they had done so without loss of human life must have astonished him even more the poet john greenleaf whittier celebrated fremonts achievement in his poem the pass of the sierras so capable were the men of fremonts party said his wife jessie benton fremont later that every man was a captain a diorama of fremonts group arriving at the fort is on display at the sutters fort historical monument in sacramento dodson appears as the fourth figure from the front of the party j n recent years a great deal of publicity has been given to educational occupational and economic gains of negroes in the united states viewed in absolute terms these gains since the beginning of world war ii have been impressive for example the median years of school completed by nonwhites years old and older more than per cent of whom were negroes rose from in to in in only per cent of nonwhite adults had completed high school whereas per cent had done so in the quality of negro education also improved substantially during this period in only per cent of employed negro workers were in whitecollar or skilled manual occupations by almost per cent were employed in such work the median wage and salary income of gainfully employed nonwhite males increased threefold in constant dollars from in to in all evidence indicates that educational occupational and economic progress is continuing substantial though these gains may be they have not been sufficient to forestall negro restiveness expressions of negro discontent if not discontent itself increased steadily although slowly from the end of world war ii to the early s and in there was an almost explosive increase in negro protest activity the discontent that prompted this protest grew in large measure out of such conditions as segregation of public facilities housing discrimination and inequitable treatment of negroes by police but it was also due to dissatisfaction with the rate of progress in the basic spheres of education occupation and income and to a high rate of negro unemployment during a period of unparalleled prosperity a major reason for negro dissatisfaction with recent gains is that white gains have also been large and therefore there is still a sizable gap between negroes and whites although most negroes lack precise knowledge of this gap they perceive that it remains large and several recent trends have sharpened the negros perception of his relative disadvantage and made him more prone to measure his condition against that of whites for instance skilled and whitecollar occupations and good education have given many negroes a better vantage point from which to judge their relative condition and negroes who have moved from allnegro to interracial social circles have often experienced a decline in relative status and a heightened sense of deprivation more casual and stylized contacts such as in the classroom and on the job have had a similar effect on the experiencing of relative deprivation increased travel and greater exposure to the mass media of communications have also given negroes more knowledge of the life styles and consumption patterns of middleclass white americans and have widened the disparity between negro aspirations and attainments therefore if negro aspirations are to be satisfied and negro discontent stilled there must be a marked closing of the gap between negroes and whites not merely large absolute negro gains the prospects for such a closing in the near future are not good unless the convergence of negroes and whites in education occupations and income is greatly accelerated an appreciable gap will remain throughout the lifetime of most negroes now living this can be seen by projecting recent rates of convergence at the to rates of change in the relative standing of negroes they would attain equality with whites in education long before they would attain equality in occupation and income but even the education gap as indicated by the ratio of nonwhite to white median years of school completed would not close until the year and the income gap as measured by the ratio of nonwhite to white median family income would not close until negro males would become proportionally represented in most intermediatelevel occupations within a few decades but would not attain equality in some upperlevel occupations for centuries negroes are considered to be proportionally represented in an occupation if the percentage of negroes is the same in the occupation and in the total labor force in a few occupationsincluding physicians and surgeons and managers officials and proprietorsnegro representation did not increase at all during the s and therefore equality cannot be projected at any rate the projected dates for proportional representation in a few selected occupations are as follows these projections are not predictions they merely say that if the rate of progress in the recent past were continued it will take a very long time for negroes to catch up with whites negro income and occupational gains are likely to accelerate so that income equality and roughly proportional representation in the upperlevel occupations will be attained in less than the time indicated on the other hand negroes almost certainly will not gain educational equality with whites by the above projected date of a conclusion we reach from an analysis of data on educational attainment by age since most people do not receive formal education after about age but will live and influence the educational statistics for many more years educational equality in the total population probably will not be attained until four or five decades after it is attained among young adults and the educational gap between negroes and whites in this age range from through remained substantial in at the recent rate of change the gap will not disappear for this age group for three or four decades nearly a century probably will pass before there is equality in the total population in addition to the gap in the quantity of negro and white education there is a vast difference in the quality of education the average year of negro schooling is far less than the equivalent of the average white year in terms of the skills and knowledge that result from it in many localities negro pupils average only as well on scholastic achievement tests as whites two or three grade levels below them although there is no good overall measure of the difference in quality we can be fairly certain that it like the gap in years of school completed is slowly closing there has been appreciable desegregation of schools and colleges in the border states during the past decade and the southern states have at least improved the physical facilities of their negro schools in an attempt to lessen pressure for desegregation however it is not likely that the gap in quality of education is closing as rapidly as the gap in quantity de facto segregation based upon residential segregation has increased recently in some northern and western cities and the predominantly negro schools pervaded with a lowerclass culture and usually poorly staffed and equipped almost invariably offer inferior opportunities to learn and stimulate less incentive to do so although there is now little overt discrimination against negroes by northern and western colleges and universities negro college students handicapped by poor backgrounds and limited financial resources are highly concentrated in institutions with low academic standards even so a large percentage of them do not fare well in competition with their white classmates and almost per cent of the nonwhite males who complete one year of college never complete four the comparable percentage for white males is less than it seems therefore that some difference in the average quality of negro and white education is likely to remain for some time after the gap in years of school completed is closed true educational equality is probably more than a century away even if recent favorable trends continue and are accelerated by the belated efforts of governments and foundations to correct longrecognized deficiencies there is still considerable discrimination against negroes in employment and in rates of pay but such discrimination has been declining rapidly since no overall measure of discrimination is available one cannot determine the exact rate of decline but if the present rate continues discrimination may virtually disappear within a short time except in isolated black belt areas of the south if this is so the occupational and income gaps will close as soon as educational equality is attained employment opportunities are already opening more rapidly than negroes can become qualified to take advantage of themespecially in some professional and technical occupations in which a scarcity of qualified personnel of any race makes it impractical for employers to discriminate or in which conspicuous employment of negroes is considered good public relations by the corporation government agency or university since there is more discrimination in most other kinds of occupations especially in the skilled trades discrimination remains an important obstacle to negro advancement the craft unions of the skilled building trades for example use well established techniques of nepotism and maintain an artificial shortage of workers thus effectively obstructing the hiring of negroes among the potential workers however low average negro occupational qualificationsthe result of centuries of past subordinationare now a greater hindrance than current discrimination in most occupations the persistent income gap the slow but steady closing of the educational gap and the more rapid decline in discrimination have not led to a convergence of negro and white incomes the reason is a growing gap between the incomes of well educated and poorly educated workers regardless of race for instance in males with only one to four years of formal schooling had a median income per cent of that of males with four or more years of college whereas by this percentage had declined to underlying this change was a widening of the income gap between unskilled workers and professional technical and managerial workersa change growing from automation and other technological developments which increased demand for the highly trained and decreased demand for the unskilled and untrained a much larger percentage of negroes than of whites are still poorly educated and unskilled and the decline in the relative status of these negroes almost completely offset the economic advancement of the minority of negroes who became well educated the widening of the chasm between the opportunities and economic conditions of poorly educated and well educated workers is continuing and perhaps accelerating as a consequence negroes must gain steadily on whites in education and occupational status merely to stay the same distance behind in income there is likely to be enough automation during the next decade or so to make it hard for negroes to keep up and the income gap could widen appreciably the impact of automation any widening of the income gap will necessarily impede negro efforts to catch up in education and could postpone the attainment of educational equality well beyond the projection we give above and any slowing of the convergence of negro and white educational status will in turn tend to widen the income gap consequently the imminent prospects of widespread automation give great urgency to efforts to improve negro education and occupational qualifications if negro education is not improved rapidly enough negroes as a whole are faced for many decades of underprivilege and inferior status after the discrimination that has kept them down for so long is practically eliminated as automation replaces discrimination as the major force keeping negroes near the bottom of the social heap negro efforts to attain equality must change the battle against discrimination may soon be won but if negroes try to impede automation their efforts will be futile even labor leaders who feel their unions have much to lose are fighting delaying actions and playing for time and concessions they do not think it possible to obstruct automation for very long the most rational future strategy to raise negro status would be a program of uplift and selfimprovement necessarily with the massive support of government foundations and all kinds of educational institutions from the standpoint of negroes a shift away from emphasis upon protest to such a program may not come easily negroes are marshalled to fight discrimination they increasingly focus their hostility upon whites and they can release their pent up hostility in protest activities they will find it hard to turn their attention upon themselves and settle down to the long arduous and unexciting tasks of uplift whites whose consciences are being eased by the elimination of the more flagrant forms of discrimination may not readily give the sustained support and cooperation needed for an adequate program of negro uplift not many whites are likely to feel responsible either for the technological changes that are lowering the economic status of the poorly educated or for the past discrimination that has left negroes concentrated in this downwardly mobile segment of society in short neither recent trends in negro status nor the potentialities of the methods now being used for negro advance lead us to expect a rapid closing of the gap between negroes and whites only a massive program of education job retraining and occupational upgradingon a scale far greater than any program now proposed by negro leaders the federal government or any organization concerned with negro improvement can save the majority of negroes from many more decades of inferior status such programs of the presidents war on poverty as the job corps and operation head start are a step in the right direction and not a small one but much greater efforts are needed upon picking up dr mordechai kreinins israel and africa a study in technical cooperation columbia i was impressed with the price of the book i immediately became interested in what the publishers thought was contained within the pages appendix included that would demand such a price here is what i found the book is about rather specialized and technical problems without all of the weightiness of technical and specialized language it is not intended for general reading but the general public can read and understand it it is written by a scholar who displays his scholarship through the manner in which he simplifies rather than complicates the subject matter the substance of the book revolves around the ways and means in which israel can aid africa in the latters struggle for economic and social growth but more than that it gives reasons why israeli aid and assistance has certain advantages over aid from other countries as well as the negative aspects that may also exist for example he points out that aid from israel does not mean that the recipient country is getting involved in the power struggle between east and west there is an element of kinship due to the fact that both africans and jews have had tragic pasts there are several more aspects that make it most desirable for africans to get israeli aid but the one that holds the greatest import as i see it is the fact that africans who come to israel for study tours and conferences see the political and social leaders often roll up their sleeves and get very much involved in manual labor the aversion that the african leader often displays for manual labor has two very real foundations first the old tribal and traditional customs have the women doing most of the manual labor the man reserves his energy for the essential task of hunting second under the colonial powers it was the undermen not the leaders who performed tasks of manual labor it is natural then that the african leaders should want to continue in this tradition and fashion but what africa needs is everv available ounce of talent it has to apply itself to the problems facing i it and when the most talented men are reluctant to pitch in for fear of doing something beneath them then it is advantageous for them to be exposed to any system that will help to alter this unfortunate trait in the african makeup perhaps none of the above is really very original startling or sensational but it is useful and compiled in a logical easy reading style it makes interesting reading for those who have an especially strong interest in african development africa must emulate israel in certain crucial areas of improvement many of these are very candidly but gently pointed out the book bears the mark of a scholar and that is rare in these days of mass production of books the confederate general of the title is not a character in this book by richard brautigan a confederate general from big sur grove press but is supposed to be the great grandfather of one lee mellon who meets the narrator jesse on a spree after he has hit a rich queer on the head with a rock and has taken his car his watch and his money later jesse visits lee in his primitive cabin on big sur and the rest of the book is taken up with their attempts to find food money tobacco and lays the reader of this book is reminded of an oldtime vaudeville comedian who feels the audience is getting bored and who says damn whereupon everyone laughs only this time the performer says damn damn damn damn damn damn damn damn so often that there is no response mr brautigan uses so many fourletter words that they become as meaningless as the circumambient profanity of the army he seems to write whatever comes first to the top of his head and what comes out is sometimes meaningless sometimes inane and sometimes a nice simile or metaphor the characters are zany like those in comic strips the book is froth and like the fiction of ladies magazines is to be read in a summer hammock or in bed when you cant go to sleep and then be forgotten in the black anglosaxons marzani munsell sociologist nathan hare carries on a contention begun several years ago by the late e franklin frazier black bourgeoisie essentially it boils down to a conviction that assimilation into american life has cost the middle class negro his racial identity rendering him a cheap sterile and selfdespising imitation with an approach reminiscent of the late dr fraziers personal anecdotes hearsay erratic news items dr hare examines his subject from several points of viewthe mimics the imagemakers the cultured the supercitizens etc if this is supposed to provide dimension it simply doesnt come off for the book is singularly shallow undocumented and often embarrassingly distorted it has taken what may be an interesting subject of investigation and given it the depth and scholarship of a gossip column in a chapter titled the exiles for example the author states because they failed to gain equality as members of a race they seek to abolish that race integration becomes synonymous with disintegration of the negro they operate on the pathetic assumption that the sooner they forget that they are negroes the sooner the whites will also this raises all kinds of interesting questions among them whether or not there is such a thing as a preexistent american negro culture and whether terms like negritude and blackness which presumably link all negroes together in some sort of mysterious bond even wedding them to distant africa have any validity instead of answering the questions however dr hare devotes the entire chapter to a series of gossipy tidbits describing how horrible it was that a certain dancer quit langston hughes stage revue in objection to its title black nativity and condemning althea gibson for insisting in a magazine article that she not be referred to as a negro tennis player many of his observations are indisputable as when he bemoans the middle classs conspicuous consumption antiintellectualism etc others are patently absurd when a group of howard university coeds confess they were thrilled at shaking hands with robert kennedy dr hare at tributes their enthusiasm to his kennedys whiteness he becomes so enamored of his theme that he extends it to include middle class negro speech eating habits and even the kinds of names parents choose for their offspring but as sociologist oliver c cox points out in a rather stabilizing introduction as a population either negro or white moves from lower to middle class status it surrenders one subculture and takes on another thus it should not be conceived of as being cultureless and rootless in the process the culture of negro americans is not an immemorial heritage of the race but rather a version of western culture and that romanticized folk tradition so mourned by the frazierhare school of commentators was and still is a largely illiterate extremely inefficient instrument of modern life it is not an ideal toward which negro americans can be expected to reverthamilton bims cycle of indebtedness exploitation and desperation is repeated each year within yelling distance of major centers of culture and the twentieth century like miami philadelphia new york and other eastern seaboard cities the other outstanding feature of the book is that it is exactly what the foreword and introduction state it to be it is the migrants own storya story that needs telling this report is rather an amplification of the migrants own faint cries they are cries of bitterness resentment unhappiness the futility of existence cut off from the rest of humanity wright has done just that he has amplified and articulated the cries of the migrant worker so that their voices have been heard in the highest places in the land thankfully there is now just the faintest hope that more legislation will join the little that is already on the books to help the migrant worker extract himself from the quicksand of exploitation but equally as important is the fact that as senator harrison a williams states in the introduction it is heartening to know that courageous reporters like mr wright still serve as active gadflies to americas conscience his moving plea should be read by every american with a recommendation from such a high place that drips with obvious truth is there need to say morebrooks johnson there will never be another mississippi summer project the conditions of a state crippled by a ravaging history together with the idealism of the young people who chanced death to open its closed doors is captured in letters from mississippi mcgrawhill edited by elizabeth sutherland damn it i dont want to go i just want to know the best way to do it written from the oxford ohio training camp in june is typical of the almost frightening honesty contained in the letters and excerpts written by the summer volunteers although the amazing introspection of the students is the heart of the book the book is also a complete catalogue of the summer project from oxford to the magnolia state to the atlantic city convention and back to their northern homes the reader journeys with the students mississippi life through the eyes of those who became mississippians for a summer is shared with the reader and the reader also shares the letter writers abounding love for humanity and equally abounding hatred of evil in reading letters from mississippi one perceives the difference between the sympathy of the liberals and the empathy of those who chose to explore the depths of life while experiencing the taste of death the letters provide heretofore unpublished insights about bob moses he forced you by what he said and by his manner of saying it to want to partake of him to come to him he was not in any way outgoing yet when he spoke you felt close to him the young man who was largely responsible for the creativity of the summers endeavor one is reminded that these students led a nation last summer forcing it to see its crimes their spirit challenges the more cynical among us their concern is captivating and however despairing one might be letters from mississippi makes one recognize that the nation has produced at least one group of young people who are somehow larger and greater than the nation much has been written about the students sacrifice last summer in getting to know them one is aware of an even larger sacrifice that this nation will have to make if their idealism is not to be in vain sixyearold phyllis wearing bright ribbons on her s braided pigtails and with the weariness of defeat over her entire countenance walked heavily up the front steps ignoring the ecstatic approving collie who bounced around yelping gleefully over her return home omitting a greeting she blandly announced the teacher doesnt love me she never lets me win a star a star it seemed was the symbol of success twelve years before abel had returned home literally carrying his broken heart in his hands they say they wont play with me because im colored in between those two beginnings don who was enrolled in a nursery school in pasadena that strove for acceptance of all races had no words he simply developed frequent abdominal pains before time to go to school i had no answer for abel but loud expressions of anger and recriminations for those who rejected him my answer to dons problem was to lie awake at nightand worry in both cases my reactions were of no value to my children nor were they of value to me because i felt so frustrated and helpless i was not prepared to meet the needs of my children in these unhappy situations when phyllis first announced the teacher doesnt love me i had no preconceived logical reply the answer just came and then grew until it was something of an answer it grew big enough even to give some support to the older children i answered the teacher doesnt have to love you shes paid to teach thats her job i am aware that children need love and approval in order to perform to their greatest capabilities but i am also aware that they are not always going to receive this love and approval hence they need to be prepared to function without it i have not seen fit to tell my children oh yes your teacher loves you youre just imagining that she doesnt i have told them that some people are prejudiced that these people cant help this maybe because theyve been taught that way some adults are indifferent to the needs of other people many other unhappy adults and children express their unhappiness by hating people but some people are warm affectionate and happily enough full of love for you and for other people it is my belief that children of negro and other minority groups should be prepared at an early age to cope with prejudice the current practice as i now see and remember what we did as parents is to send them out into the world defenseless just as we bundle them up to protect them from the cold we should also take some thought about protecting them from the ravages of hate a cold disappears with a few days care but if hate is not explored by each one it may take a person twenty thirty or forty years to know in his heart theres nothing wrong with me while some others may live their entire lives without ever having had this shocking revelation it may be that this kind of understanding would be of more immediate value to the sensitive vulnerable child however it is possible and highly probable that prejudice can have adverse effects on the most outgoing welladjusted child if the exposure is consistent and direct enough these children need an earlier exposure to the fact that hate is a human weakness that all people are capable of hating other people that the objects of hate need not be hateful that the hated need not be haters and that before and after youve been called a name youre still the same person with this understanding our children would grow to feel less depreciated would be less adversely affected by nonacceptance and would gain some freedom to pursue the business of attaining their full potential prejudice and hate are not going out of style we need to show our children what prejudice is and help them to perform in spite of it i offer these suggestions as aids not cures the cure will come gradually with the gradual disappearance of hate show the child ways in which outside adults are like the child himself explore these facts together tell them that teachers are human many teachers probably like ice cream cookies and candy better than spinach carrots and squash they probably would enjoy more fun and less work say to your child teachers cry sometimes by leading the child to think of a teacher as being a fellow human rather than some kind of supernatural being as children often think you help him to take a more tolerant attitude toward the teachers shortcomings children are most forgiving creatures show the child ways in which outside adults are like mother father aunts grandparents and so forth sometimes you might remind him we dont listen to what youre saying to us or we are not patient with you were thinking of adult things we have our special friends that we like very much and other people that we dont like and sometimes we hate people well other grownups are like that too explore with your child the many races of people in the world with their various colors features sizes customs beliefs likes and dislikes have him understand that no matter how painful race hate may be to him he is not the only object of hate name other groups of people living in the u s and the world who are living under circumstances similar to ours point out some of these people bodily if they are in your neighborhood it may be that your child has such classmates show him pictures of the different peoples in the world lead his thinking in terms of the great varieties within other species of life help him to reach the conclusion that he is not unique in being different tell the child of countries where he would be in the majority point out these places on a map of the world of course he cant comprehend a map but he has faith in your knowledge help the child to think about the different kinds of jobs that people do he can name the mailman the milkman policeman storekeeper and many others explain to the child that people are doing these jobs for pay in order to provide necessities for themselves and their families and that many of them might not like the jobs they have just as you dislike washing dishes or doing your chores some teachers may not like their jobs either whether or not we show wisdom in what we say to our children about race and prejudice we should talk about it too often in our inability to find reason in unreasonable circumstances in our desire to prevent pain for ourselves and our children we deny by silence the existence of prejudice and thus unwittingly become allies in the frustration of our own children well what about not winning the star i agree with the child that lack of love may be a factor in his not winning a star then give him some other ways of looking at it maybe there are children who need the encouragement more than you do or maybe the teacher thinks that you can do better at the same time i would be sure that the child is getting his work done not falling behind when the hope for approval and the enthusiasm for learning are lost help him with his work if you can and if you cant tell him i never heard of that and then find someone who can give him the needed assistancea classmate a neighbor a paid tutor visit the school get to know the teachers brave the cold atmosphere of the school somehow after all your child is doing it every day give overwhelming approval at home for every conceivable accomplishment from shedding of a baby tooth to the highest achievement have a place to display certificates awards commendations pictures a child should be told before he leaves home and mother that he might be called nigger and black he should be rehearsed in what to answer if you are called nigger you can ignore it or say my name is mary or im tommy if you are called black you can answer its all right to be black or so what then you might also tell him you know you might also be called names like crybaby fraidycat skinny or fatso dont fail to remind your child that he too might be guilty of name calling sometimes even the same names that others call him a child who has not been subjected to name calling during his preschool years will be particularly open to this form of attack even though he doesnt understand it i reasoned with phyllis like this if you are called a broom or a dustpan do you become a broom or a dustpan or do you remain phyllis the child will accept this reasoning while this does not negate the unpleasantness of being called a name it does bring it into a different perspective there are those who might contend that this doesnt happen here in seattle that there is no need to prepare a child to face prejudice here such people do not know the child may not be called a nigger or black but he may be excluded from play birthday parties and other social functions and theres going to be the adult who looks through him or just cant ever be sure whether its mary or kathy they all look alike you know on this matter i sympathize with the adult who deals with many children for short periods of time but it is a different matter in a preschool or lower elementary grade where it is so important to a child that you know his name the teacher of our oldest son in a second grade class with two negro boys and twentythree white children was from september to january unable to distinguish between the two negro boys until i went to the school to tell her which one was which teacher prejudice can be so subtle that a child has no words to relate it to you there is beauty in our race that we fail to recognize oftimes we are so preoccupied with the beauty of other races we overlook or minimize the beauty of our own naturally our children admire the beauty of their white friends and classmates very often that admiration is mutual our children need this pointed out to them take your child to the mirror and show him his own beauty as you shop attend pta meetings church comment on the beautiful negroes that you see your child will see them too dont allow him to grow up feeling that only whites are beautiful encourage and lead the child to identify with his own race this can be done without interfering with a childs preference for friends children as well as adults need friends of all races but most of us need the security that group identity offers use your own methods the adults in our family have a strong preference for negro friends and associates our children too seem to have this inclination we subscribe to negro publications buy recordings of african and negro artists negro dolls and stories attention is always called to pictures and news stories of noteworthy or famous negroes we patronize negro businesses or those that employ negroes even when it is less convenient to do so invest in success rather than its symbols as low income workers we should spend more money for our childrens health and education less for cars lavish furniture and clothes true you cant go into a shop and buy good health or a degree but developing and carrying out an educational program not merely a public school education which provides for additional skills training and experiences costs money takes time and thought a child needs more than a facade of status he needs emotional security a truly adequate person may have less need for acceptance believe in something and give your child something to believe in whatever your faith or lack of faith a child needs guidance he should not be abandoned to wander around in a maze of conflicting ideas give him something to begin with he probably will do some thinking of his own later in life we are christians we take our religion seriously we teach it in our home and strive to live by its principles i personally believe that the time will come when each individual has a need greater than he or his parents can fill he will need god much of this will be of small comfort to the very young child but he will be strengthened by knowing that you understand and care and that there is love and approval for him at the end of the day as you sharpen his awareness of the complexities of the human being and his own beauty and worth and help him to develop you lessen the probability of his accepting the implication that he is of less value than other people he will be of course keenly aware of injustice uncomfortable in nonaccepting situations but he will also be aware that the evil is in the system not in his race but after you have done all that is humanly possible to help your child through these devastating unhappy experiences there will still be the nights when you walk the floor and cry and curse and pray by all means do not let such things discourage or silence you the race problem is our problem in amer ca the excellent special august edition of ebony spoke comprehensively and eloquently of the white problem in america in its thesis that it is the white man who must change his attitudes and actions kb rather than the black man if racial problems are to be solved that the white man must change his attitudes and actions toward negroes far more drastically than he has even in the past few years is undoubtedly true but it is an oversimplification to imply that it is the white man only who must change it is neither the white problem in america nor the negro problem but rather our problem in the special august ebony issue mr john h johnson editor and publisher said we as negroes look at the white man today with the hope that our effort will tempt him to look at himself more thoroughly with a better understanding of himself we trust that he may understand us betterand this nations most vital problem can then be solved with the help of negro prodding in various ways the above process is taking place in american white people president lyndon b johnsons confessions to his own past limited sympathy for negro people and their problems is typical of newly acquired insight by many white people i know that i am constantly revising my attitudes concerning negro people as i read more of their writings and get to know myself better in the process hoyt fuller editor of negro digest and i had a frank and spirited correspondence this past summer concerning some aspects of our problem like the woman convinced against her will i am of the same opinion still regarding the particular issues we were discussing and i have no reason to believe that mr fuller succumbed to my arguments nevertheless mr fuller caused me to do some serious soul searching since white and black people approach our problem with different biases i usually preach one way to white people and another way to negroes trying to get each of the two groups to understand and to help the other therefore what i am writing here for a preponderantly negro audience does not reflect accurately the efforts i make to awaken white people to their responsibility in seeing that negro people have full freedom rights and privileges what this article purports to do is to speak frankly as a white man concerning how i react to certain negro attitudes and actionsin other words to reverse the process of which mr johnson spoke i have reluctantly come to realize that any claim of friendship on the part of any white man for negroes will be greeted with a good deal of open or covert scepticism by many individuals in the latter group also my motives and insight will be suspect by many negroes merely because i am white but those who are willing to listen may gain some new insight concerning themselves as well as the white man from the pen of one who really believes he is a genuine friend of the negro whether i am a genuine friend even a patronizing or naively ignorant friend can and will be questioned and perhaps rightly so but surely there is something for negro people to learn in listening to one who believes that the future of our country and of all individuals in it depends upon a deemphasizing of color and race many people with good motives are seemingly willing to set up one group of standards for negro conduct voting job qualifications etc and a more stringent one for white people in an effort to change a situation that has always been just the opposite i too am among those advocating this present course but i do so with fear and trembling for the longrange good of american black and white people alike justice and understanding demand this temporary venture into what is basically unjust and discriminating but if freedom can be easily and permanently gerrymandered even in a necessary cause and if in the process black and white people become increasingly isolated behind chauvinistic racial barriers the future freedom and happiness of american individuals in any race is doomed therefore my estranged negro brother regardless of whether you accept or reject my friendship or however you judge me and what i feel and say i shall not add still one more indignity to what you have had to endure by condoning attitudes and conduct in you that i would condemn in white men if any individual among you indulges in racial hatred or breaks the laws of decency necessary for civilized law and order i shall oppose his harmful attitudes and actions even while understanding the social forces which made it easy for him to be that way all my adult life i have opposed injustice by white men to black ones in spite of threats social ostracism and damage to my professional status i did so because it was right i did not do so to create a reversal of injustice and to support a climate of hatred and distortion it is growing more apparent to me that while the long range future with its options to continue racial differences and return either good or evil for evil belongs to the colored races of the world the immediate future of the negro in america is somewhat clouded by growing resentment on the part of many white people who have at least in recent years been advocates of negro causes since history indicates that as any oppressed people unless checked gains privileges it becomes less satisfied and demands more and more even to the point of oppressing its former tormenters i think we can reasonably expect more and more violence and racial hatred in our country but somewhere along the way enough people of both sides must love their brothers with different skin colors no matter what provocations occur until loves slow but permanent healing force extinguishes the devastating fires of hatred only thus can a meaningful and longcontinuing american civilization grow out of the compounded injustice and intolerance of the past we white people need your help james baldwin writing to his nephew in my dungeon shook accurately points out this need the really terrible thing old buddy is that you must accept them and i mean that very seriously you must accept them and accept with love for these innocent people have no other hope one constructive way to lessen tensions is for black and white people to curtail the tendency to overstatement which alienates rather than converts no matter how much temporary comfort such overstatement gives to its partisans for example the play in white america as i experienced it was in spite of its basis in fact and its powerful impact a preachment of hate and distortion which lessened its effectiveness the past is bad enough distortion of it primarily through significant omission is however a dubious way to bring a better future preaching of hate and violence is not likely to bring one friends and stable supporters it does cause one to wonder about motives i for one am not going to support unworthy means to achieve worthwhile ends no matter who sponsors such means attacking our countrys image in a biased way can seriously damage the future america with so much hope for the negro all negroes may yet come to regret the image of our country created by some overzealous advocates of negro causes granted that the image of america created by white men is probably far more damaging than anything any american negroes can do is hardly a good reason for negroes to cut off their noses to spite their faces the destiny of american negroes and whites is basically the same and this fact should not be minimized by either race finally i should like to say to my negro brothers that while i am fully aware that ones environment does limit his development it is high time that poor environment no longer be used as an indiscriminate shield to excuse unworthy conduct klansmen and those who shield them are the products of their environments too but they are nevertheless morally responsible for their attitudes and actions as they will someday soon be held legally responsible why should klansmen be condemned and negro violence and lawlessness excused the negro is winning his fight why should he place himself in a morally indefensible position that will only hurt his cause of course a primary burden also falls here on the entrenched white race to share its power and privileges in continuing the effort to create the best possible environment for people of all races and classes incidentally this burden is also a responsibility of negro upper and middle classes far more than is generally recognized privileged class indifference to the psychological and material needs of others is not limited to white people the only difference between us is color and time will take care of that difference in conclusion my negro brother i pledge to you that i am going on fighting for your rights in spite of actions and attitudes by some of you which make that task more difficult i however shall criticize you when you are wrong and expect your criticism in return for my shortcomings in a free exchange that is fitting for free and equal men about a year ago i learned a good deal about uncle tomism in the united states i was returning from a weekend in saginaw a town in central michigan the greyhound bus on which i was riding was filled with many types of people for a while i enjoyed watching the people and wondering where they were going and why they were going and where they had come from then almost suddenly i became aware of the apparent lowerclass situations from which most of the passengers seemed to come both socially and economically the bus was racially desegregated although there were no colored to the back signs most of the negro passengers moved to the back anyway they were typical lowerclassed negro travelers they carried what seemed like dozens of suitcases and shoe boxes filled with food the women were fat some had four or five children hanging on to their shabby coats the children screamed and ran up and down the aisle the mothers in voices twice as loud yelled to the kids shut up yo mouf the caucasian section of the bus was equally revolting the women were equally as fat equally as loud and had an equal number of children following them instead of the southern negro dialect they spoke with a hillbilly brogue instead of shoe boxes they had brown paper bags filled with food for some reason however they maintained an air indicating that they were the bus elite passengers being negro myself i was embarrassed by the conduct of the negroes and disgusted at the actions of the whites boarding the bus i almost automatically took a seat at the front there was no other passenger to share the double seat and i was well content my contentment was shortlived however a negro man in his thirties stepped onto the bus he attracted my attention because he had no suitcase or shoe boxes he searched the back of the bus for an empty seat and failed to find one although there were several empty seats nearer him he walked back to the front of the bus to sit with me his action left me somewhat peeved and i gazed out of the window to avoid any efforts he might make toward conversation the bus proceeded the children were wild and loud the mothers were louder and wilder the fathers just sat there and ate sandwiches from the shoe boxes or the brown bags after a few minutes the man sitting next to me handed me a copy of jet magazine he didnt say a word i didnt look at him as i told him i had already seen the magazine my efforts to maintain silence didnt work however he told me his name and said that he was going to detroit most of the passengers were he said he had lived in michigan all his life and had never been out of the state he talked on and on about his family and tried to get me to reciprocate i answered his questions vaguely and briefly and eventually he caught the hint that i was not in a conversational mood from his short oral autobiography i learned two things he was not very bright and he was obviously uneducated by this time all the seats were occupied the bus stopped in a small town and three men boarded one of them was a negro he walked to the back of the bus without hesitation and stood among the bulk of the negro passengers the other two stood near me at the front the new passengers fit in well with the negro and white stereotypes already on the bus one of the white men standing was obviously uneasy at having to stand he shifted his weight a countless number of times his eyes gazed up and down the aisle as if a seat would appear magically i sympathized with him but as the minutes passed his attitude altered and soon i was waiting for something drastic to take place it happened he said to the man standing with him some of these niggers ought to git up and giv us a seat my mood immediately switched from sympathy to hatred mr johnson didnt react that way however with instant humility he attempted to rise and give mr hillbilly a seat almost instinctively i thrust my arm in front of him to keep him from getting up mr johnson thought for a minute and realized that he was not obligated to give up his seat mr hillbillys pale face turned red and his eyes stared in anger i experienced a strange peaceful feeling the other passengers only stared the bus continued the children continued to scream and play in the aisle the women screamed louder than the children and mr hillbilly continued to stand my timid fellow passenger is one of the few oldfashioned uncle toms who still hang on to their secondclass citizenship with strange humility although he had never been out of the state of michigan he is one of the people former mississippi governor ross barnett was talking about when he said per cent of our nigras are not interested in racial integration negroes never express a desire to see their children mingle with white children in public schools it is factual that some negroes have voiced these opinions but it is dubious that they really believe it centuries of meek dependency have taught many of these negroes to say to white people what they think white people want to hear these people have been labelled by the negro community as uncle toms they are the people who are guilty of slavishness in their demeanor especially toward white authority for uncle toms the supreme court decision caused no rejoicing those of little education were slow to grasp its significance and many who did were afraid that efforts to secure equal rights would cause them to lose their jobs and therefore their only means of making a living harry golden editor of the carolina israelite and author of several books on minority group discrimination says that uncle toms are silent and meek because they fear accusations of treason to denounce the cause of legally enforced segregation is a form of treason to southerners said golden the truly noble people of the deep south are silent because the worst crime in their culture is treason golden cited in his book mr kennedy and the negroes a situation in mississippi in which a ne gro had been charged with rape he was kidnapped from jail and lynched even though many people knew who the lynchers were they were never brought to trial why golden explains that the mississippians would not betray their oath to white supremacy they would not speak treason uncle toms are the negroes who are not necessarily afraid to betray this oath but are themselves dedicated to it through years of servitude and brainwashing golden goes on to say that as late as the s a few of these uncle toms placed ads in the paper saying noticei am not a member of the naacp occurrences like this are rare today my friend on the greyhound bus is rare too the social revolution has caught most old uncle toms and has converted them through a growing pride in the fact that their race is handling its own revolution and winning big by the majority of negroes in the united states were conscious of the injustices and degradation of segregation and all its tragic and uncomfortable results each sitin each demonstration each new civil_rights legislation has strengthened the willpower of servile negroes this new strength has made moderates of some of the former toms and militants or leftists of others today uncle tom has a new identity the name applies to anyone who thinks there is the least measure of goodwill toward the negro cause within the white community an uncle tom is any negro who seeks to convince his people that progress and justice can be achieved in lawful and orderly protest according to militant negroes negro civil_rights leaders are among the many advocates of nonviolence who have been labelled uncle toms when dr martin_luther_king jr received the nobel prize last year there was widespread fear that he would lose his position as the modernday moses of his race and be branded an uncle tom however king has managed to keep his primacy in the eyes of the negro public his several jail sentences along with his continuation to march and demonstrate with his people have secured his position as a leader of the struggle in a sentence he follows his own orders he risks his life there is nothing uncle tomish about him dr_king summarized his feelings and the feelings of the negro public when he said to american whites we will match your capacity to inflict suffering with our capacity to endure suffering we will meet your physical force with soul force we will not hate you but we cannot in good conscience obey your unjust laws we will soon wear you down by our capacity to suffer and in winning our freedom we will so appeal to your heart and conscience that we will win you in the process james farmer national director of the congress on racial equality core once said if an individual is waging a militant struggle if negroes are convinced he is concerned about their interests rather than his own he wont be called an uncle tom farmer however was not as lucky as king he could hardly get these words out of his mouth before he was stamped an uncle tom by the militant negro community there has been much speculation that malcolm_x was shot down because he had become an uncle tom as a black muslim and later as the leader of the black nationalists malcolm_x was the epitome of militancy however when he began to confer with other civil_rights leaders and when the word nonviolence entered his vocabulary some felt that he had crossed the line toward uncle tomism negro leaders are involved in a painful dilemma they must convince negroes that they are interested in the cause while maintaining rapport with the nonnegro community this latter function is an essential responsibility of negro leadership militants say that this rapport is immaterial that basic rights exist and should be taken by force if necessary they say that they can fight the negro revolution without white hypocrites and footshuffling black white people this militancy has sprung from the emotions and feelings that prevail in ghettoes where hope is trapped out and despair trapped in these people have heard too many promises of jobs housing and education and not enough results one example of growing militancy is a budding organization in the midwest called uhuru swahili for freedom uhuru is primarily a student organization but it attracts scant but multiplying numbers from the professions its members have taken militancy to extremes according to nonviolent standards in detroits recent effort to host the olympic games a crosscountry marathon race from los angeles to detroit was staged by local track stars as the last runner approached the finish line a crowd gathered to greet him and sang the star spangled banner uhuru representatives burst out into catcalls and boos they screamed to the negro trackman run on uncle tom the group theorized that the olympics would only benefit the white community and the white businessmen and that any negro advocate was defeating the negro cause in favor of white supremacy uhuru like other militant organizations springing up all over the country wants results about the only thing that will quell their fire is freedom or as they say it uhuru quito or freedom now if vicepresident hubert humphrey is exemplary of the growing sympathy of american whites there is no need for extreme militancy or extreme servility within negro ranks the vicepresident recently summarized what he and civil_rights leaders believe to be the prevailing opinion on civil_rights let me say simply that i am aware that different civil_rights advocates have widely varying opinions on the degree of gradualism acceptable in their fight for equal rights and oppotunity and on the means to achieve these goals my own position is that nothing less than total assimilation of the negro into our political and economic life is acceptable this country cannot countenance two classes of citizenship there are a great many decisions which go into the purchase j f i g of a new car and of great importance is how you are going to r i ii pay for the car sure shop for the best deal and satisfy your tbaiirfs self that you have the classiest car on four wheels but dont overlook financing and insurance costs it is not uncommon for car buyers to save or by shopping for financing and insurance before they buy some people have saved as much as first consider financing seven out of ten persons finance their car purchases it costs money to borrow just how much it costs depends on where the borrowing is done where are some of the places that will lend money or help make a loan there are auto dealers who have arrangements with finance companies finance companies themselves credit unions and banks even your insurance agent who often works with different banks to help get the lowest financing costs so he can keep you as an insurance customer is a prime contact when you are looking for money to buy a car insurance companies like state farm mutual even have car finance plans under which their agents direct customers to banks that will lend money to customers who are acceptable credit risks how much do rates vary between different lending institutions and in different parts of the country a university of chicago survey of nine cities disclosed for example that in new york city dealers finance charges ranged from to while banks offered money with gross finance charges the equivalent of about vi per year of the original balance this means a new yorker financing on the purchase of a new car would pay from to to finance his purchase through an auto dealer it would cost him to get a bank loan to make the same purchase a difference of between and on finance charges only and thats on new cars as hillel black says in his book buy now pay later rates for secondhand cars are invariably higher for old used cars rates may range from to per cent true annual interest why the big variation basically its because of the difference between an interest rate and a finance charge many people think these two things are the same but they are not an interest rate is the rate charged for borrowing money the rate varies depending on where the money is borrowed bank loan company credit unionwho borrows it his credit rating collateral general financing statushow much is being borrowed and for how long in any event the interest rate is regulated by law a finance charge is something else again it is an amount of money added to the price of an item when that item is paid for over a period of time in effect it is simply a second price for an itemthe price the buyer agrees to pay when he buys on time thus a car may have two prices a cash price and a time price the gap is called a time price differential an important point to remember is this finance charges sometimes are not regulated by law this means the person charging the time price is free to charge whatever the traffic will bear fortunately the buyer is also free to shop around for the best deal no matter where the buyer gets his money he should bear in mind that the more he borrows and the longer he takes to pay it all back the more it costs him so to cut the cost of borrowing or financing to a minimum he should make as large a down payment as possible on his car and pay the loan back as rapidly as possible knowing this it should be obvious that a low down payment with months to pay isnt always the best deal it may look tempting after considering the capital required to equip an entire business operation but it will definitely cost more these days increased competition is causing many auto dealers to cut the price of their cars and thus their profits to a minimum but they must make a profit somewhere to stay in business one likely spot is on finance charges when this occurs its the result of a mutually beneficial arrangement between an auto dealer and a finance company the auto dealer turns over his customers financing business to the finance company and he in turn gets a fat slice of the profit the following scale of rates available through a major national finance company operating in the midwest is an example of one such setup these figures were elicited at congressional hearings and show the amount the customers pay and how much of that payment is returned to the auto dealer a prospective car buyer residing in hillview illinois obtained figures from the auto dealer showing for the unpaid balance of the car plus financing charges and deductible collision insurance he went to his insurance agent who made arrangements at a local bank he paid more as a down payment and was able to save the overall sum of so much for finance charges insurance rates are regulated by state laws but yet they vary from company to company so once again it pays to check with both auto dealers and insurance agents the preceding example illustrates one particularly important area of insurance credit insurance the type of insurance itself is important because it assures the borrower that if anything should happen to him his family would not be responsible for the unpaid balance and that the car will belong free and clear to the heirs however the amount charged for credit life insurance varies a great deal sometimes it is included with the cost of the bank finance charge as was the case in the example given the important thing is that you must be aware of the cost it should be also noted that in some instances the rebate situation that exists between auto dealer and finance company on finance charges also exists between auto dealer and insurance company for instance the chairman of a large finance company admitted before a congressional subcommittee that his company gets a commission from its insurance company on all the insurance its dealers sell what does all this mean to the prospective purchaser it means that his initial shopping trip should be just thata shopping trip and not a buying expedition he should leave his check book home and take along a paper and pencil instead then as he visits assorted auto dealers banks finance companies and insurance agents hell be able to write down the figures each quotes this lessens chances of being left with nothing but a jumbled memory of facts figures and percentages when the shopping trip is over first stop should be an auto dealer where the buyer should decide what kind of car he wants make model extras a list should be made of what accessories or extra each dealer offers so as to get a real price comparison next several dealers should be visited to find out the going price on the particular make and model the car buyer is interested in if there is a car to be traded in the buyer should first find out the cash price of the car then the price with trade in this will show exactly what is being gotten for the used car and sometimes it will pay to place an advertisement to try to obtain more than the amount being allowed for the trade in the next thing is to think about insurance and financing when shopping for financing the buyer should get both percentage figures and dollars and cents figures with respect to insurance the buyer should find out just how much coverage is being obtained for how many dollars if he is buying from an auto dealer with what company will he be insured is it reliable does he know others who are insured with that company if so are they satisfied if after checking and being satisfied about these items the buyer de cides to buy the auto with an insurance and finance package from the auto dealer he should get the dealer to make out an itemized list of just what is being bought and the price of each item auto extras taxes insurance and finance charges then he should make sure that this total is the same as was quoted at the time the dealer made the sales pitch where the dealer quotes a monthly payment figure for the entire package the buyer should find out how many of these payments he is obligating himself for by the signing of the contract and he should then multiply the monthly payments by the number of months and again check to see if that figure is the same as was previously quoted it may sound simple but better business bureau records are full of the sad woes of people who did not do this one official of the chicago better business bureau estimates that if car buyers would merely multiply the total number of months to be paid by the amount of the monthly payment about of the complaints the bureau receives would be eliminated the story is told extreme but true of a man who looked at a car advertised for and asked how much the monthly payments would be he was told per month and feeling that he could afford such a moderate payment signed a contract without first reading all of the clauses what he did in fact sign was to pay per month for a total of months all in all a total of for the car all of the foregoing can lead to only one conclusion when you are shopping for a car shop examine the facts compute the interest and insurance charges watch what you sign make sure all of the pertinent parts of the contract are filled in before you affix your signature failure to do these things can cause financial loss and disappointment instead of the intended satisfaction of a sound investment among the children of the very poor survival must take precedence over every other consideration but current motivational theory tends to downgrade immediate and physical motives it turns its eagle vision instead like a rising young executive on goalstriving statusseeking and planning by such elite and middleclass standards the poor must be said to have little or no motivation under a grant from the national institute of mental health we have been studying a large st louis housing development inhabited almost exclusively by very poor negroes we middleclass observers have noted the pronounced tendency of the tenants toward randomlike and unrealistic behavior their attitudes toward space time objects and persons lack our patterns of organization lack our predictabilityeven sometimes seem to lack sense to us how do they seem to the project dwellers themselves after more than a year of field work with about fifty families we have the strong impression that they are well aware of the differences for instance they make a strong distinction between cp colored peoples time and wp white peoples time according to cp time a scheduled event may occur at any moment over a wide spread of hoursor perhaps not at all they believe however that in the highly organized world of the whites it occurs when scheduled the housing project is so isolated from the social and economic life of the city and the white community that the occupational classes of the census bureau scarcely apply to it the tenants work as domestics or in the nooks and cracks of our economy employment is uncertain pay is poor resources are scarce yet unemployed men talk of jobs they do not have and the women in this city of women speak of husbands dead fled or who never existed illusion is thus a way of life young and old spend money they do not have for expensive clothes and cars people with no power and status brag of influence and position and concentrate on getting the better of each other the illusion of middeclass success settles invisibly over them thus a white school teacher working with negro children remarks that they are not interested in solid accomplishment but only in showing off obviously such shortcutting must interfere with learning and with facing school and life realistically casting out the poor and the negro from white society has resulted in a social life so saturated by illusion that the fancy soon becomes the only possible achievement disorganization and a life of fit into the social dynamic of the school room to create educational underachievement the children of disorganization cannot create classroom organization and the teacher can only work with those who have somehow managed to acquire enough of the necessary motivation often we have seen a harassed teacher working with a very few children in a class and trying to ignore the disorder and uproar the others are creating here are some notes made in one such sixth grade classroom with both negro and white children the teacher was leaning over pauls desk helping him with arithmetic irv and mike were watching alice was talking to jane and joan to edith nearby alan ed and tom were pushing and shoving tom got out of his seat made a wad of notebook paper and tossed it into the air several times tom and ed suddenly slammed their desks shut got up and walked out noisily lila and alice followed alan grinned at the observer waved his hand and said hi the teacher took no notice this process of partial withdrawalwhereby the teacher simply withdrew to those few students she could handlemay occur anywhere an individual tries to cope with a disturbed environment i have also seen it in mental hospitals it reflects not so much the relationship between authority and client but the total social situation in school pupils have the choice of building status either with their teacher or their friends to many reputation among friends may be much more important the pressure of peergroups is very strong and selfdestructive status choice can occur in any such conflict between the demands of authority figures and the demands of the group what usually tips the balance toward teacher and selfpreservation is a measure of hope in the future disorganization can tip the balance the other way this is especially true if the disorganization has unique attractions for the children in integrated classrooms the approval of white students may become so attractive to negro children that they gladly risk official displeasure punishment or failure in coeducational classes attracting the attention and getting the approval of the opposite sex can become much more important than teachers dirty looks all such split situations introduce disturbing and competing elements students can make status choices that ruin their whole future lives very very poor children both by feeling and understanding lack the structure on which conventional education can build their background does not have the elements of order necessary to achieve their homes are crowded full of disturbance physically and personally disorganized they do not operate on schedules that pay much attention to school concepts of time they lack both belief in achievement and fear of no achievement when thirty to fifty such children are a class supposed to be run by one teacher disorganization must result from it the teacher in sheer selfdefense may select only those elements suited to her taskshe will teach those considered teachable and let the others go but even the children most willing and able to learn are under tremendous pressure from their classmates to give up and join them by pleasing the teacher they can buy success in a vague and distant future only at the probable expense of making their present life lonely unhappy and even dangerous the poor motivation of the lowachiever is not therefore a demon somehow arising from and locked up inside himself but one effect of a whole sea of pressure and pain which has surrounded him since birth and in which he himself seldom knows why he gasps the missing ingredient but why all this disorder illusion and destruction does it come about because as some moralists believe the poor lack an essential fiber so that they tack and waver in the wind against which we advance this view is actually not far wrong the poor do lack a fundamental vitamin that we others absorb with the smell of food with the promise of gifts at christmas with plans for graduation they lack the essential strength of hope hope is not a simple nutrient it goes straight to the heart of organization and makes it work among lower animals organization occurs largely through inborn genetic factors with man things are not so direct and the word culture has chosen to designate the complex learnings that determine his behavior but culture varies between societies and even between groups within societies for the middle and upper classes in our society achievement and security are major determinants they organize behavioror our behavior is organized around them they act as carrots the fear of their opposites failure and insecurityacts as a goad when people do not see success and failure as we do their behavior will appear to us random and purposeless and we disapprove of it but those who cannot hope for achievement or security can have no concept of the organization of behavior through time toward goals the culture of the middleclass itself has been superficially charted how for instance does the middleclass handle hope time and the self achievement depends on hopeand hope rests on time some time in the future we hope to achieve something even to say billy has stopped wetting the bed means that desired change has occurred through time billy used to wet the bed but does so no longer but the parent with no hope can have only partial understanding of his childs having stopped bedwetting he can have no fruitful concept of the conscious movement through time toward desired goals relative to large social goals his actions are undirected flight from death though the poor have little hope for life they do not wish to die according to comparative suicide rates they have less taste for final voluntary quietus than any other class therefore they concentrate on those factors that keep them alivenowthat make direct obvious and strong contributions to present life the culture of the very poor is a flight from death in this setting the very disregard of common methods of looking at things and objectssuch as how to arrange a housecan become institutionalized a way of life such disregard in objects we call disorder in behavior we call it randomness martin heidegger in being and time relates the perception of self to existence through time when people think of themselves they seem to say he argues that is the way i was this is how i am now and in the future i hope to be something else these perceptions of self have past present and future and it is from them he believes that we conceive time they presuppose change during time movement from what used to be to ward what will be self must therefore exist at least partly as a function of time it must include organization through time but what happens to a person who has no expectations or hopes for himself or his children his behavior having neither background nor direction is disorganized what is left of him in the irreducible ash the survival selfthe flight from death the survival self has no real sublimation or higher displacement nothing but physical lifein a very limited but very intense form the survival self must concentrate on those experiences which give it continual and vivid reassurance that it is aliveheightened perhaps and smoothed by drugs or alcohol it must literally keep feeling its life sociologists of middleclass background contemptuously refer to this state as hedonismliving for pleasure it is notit is flight from death the famous second law of thermodynamics states in paraphrase that disorder within an isolated system can only increase life is not pure physics but there is a useful parallel consider a middleclass neighborhood or suburb it is not an isolated system its members go out into the community and the community comes in at the door and the mind the resources of the community are known to and used by it and it is subject to steady cultural and economic stimulation which it in turn affects the interaction brings adjustment and reg ulation the disorder or randomness entropy in the language of physicsis low the slum or lowerclass housing project does not have access to these sources of support and stimulation a paradoxor vicious circleexists because of their disorganization and lack of hope the very poor cannot or do not get to the major sources of economic and cultural stimulation and their disorganization and hopelessness came in the first place from lack of access to these resources cut off from hope stimulation and change the poor neighborhood is an isloated human thermodynamic system and its disorganization can only increase many middleclass selves are also in flight from death but they are trained to look at life through the lens of achievement sustained by hope and expectation and they can fly along this pathperhaps even to greater achievement this sustenance is not available to the great majority from the slum and housing project our conclusion then must be that hope is a boundary it separates the free from the slave the determined from the driftingand the very poorest from almost all those above it a corollary conclusioneven more surprisingfollows time space and objects exist for us only when we have hope short of reforming his world how can we stimulate the slum child to greater school achievement certainly it will not be enough to merely improve teaching methods and curricula we must improve the school as a social system some proposals are in order building up perceptions children whose central milieu involves so much disorganization and disorder cannot master mathematics or any other discipline involving order and direction i would urge that these children be given preschool training in which the basic perceptions that other children acquire without apparent effort be deliberately taught for instance a child must learn fundamental shapes and categoriesinsideness and outsideness roundness straightness flexibility rigidity transparency opacity motion in a straight line motion in a circle rocking motion and many other basic perceptions a child should have this perceptual competence before he starts school calming down poor children often come to school unfed after wretched nights torn by screaming fighting bedwetting often they cannot sleep because of cold and rats they come to class hungry sleepy and emotionally upset to start routine schoolwork effectively at once is impossible i propose that teachers be specially trainedas they are in the youth development project of the greater kansas citymental health foundationto deal with such children and that they breakfast with them in school the school should of course furnish the food perhaps out of government surplus school breakfast would accomplish two things it would feed hungry children otherwise unable to concentrate adequately on their work and it would bring teacher and pupil together in an informal and friendly atmosphere associated with satisfaction before the strain of classroom constriction and peergroup pressures dictate that teacher become an enemy it is essential therefore that the teacher be present a program like this suggested by me in kansas city brought about immediate and sharp improvement in attendance behavior and in schoolwork the more the teachers know about the emotional management of these children the better expansion of participation the frequently proclaimed immediate goal of instructionmore personalized attentionis especially important with lowachievers this can be done by reducing class size or by increasing the number of teachers the extra teachers if not as highly qualified as the regulars should nevertheless be trained and familiar with the lessons they can be substitutes teachers in training or even members of the domestic counterpart of the peace corps whenever that is established they should be able to help with routine tasks with keeping orderand with seeing to it that each child very poor children need hope in has more time attention care and order to achieve so do those who opportunity to learn work with them contemporary african art has been the subject criticism and among its critics is the man often called nigerias best known and most outstanding artist ben enwonwu paintersculptor the art of africa has never been the same since the arrival of europeans says the yearold ibo who achieved fame in his first love sculpture sculpture which i did not study under anyone else but my father and which comes naturally to me is my favorite medium says the artist although his father died when he was only an infant of four enof much wonwu recalls carving with him his father an engineer who in retirement turned sculptor was also his first model bom july at onitsha eastern nigeria benedict chuka enwonwu who prefers to be called ben carved his own toys as a youngster and recalls his mothers discomfort over his littering the grounds with chips after cutting bamboo and egbo as he fashioned the reverend fathers and fashionable ladies these along with the toy motor cars houses schools churches and government offices he sculpted constituted the little world he created a world he chose to call man labeling his activity useless his grandmother attempted to dissuade him but young ben was persistent she soon left him alone when she observed that i was obsessed with this preoccupation says mr enwonwu speaking of those early days of creativity tivity of he adds man was the daily acan absorbing daily activity i did not in fact know what an artist was or what makes up an artist hence my development in the various directions of recreative activities in which what was primary was to mould a world of my own in which my creative exercises centered while attending the holy trinity roman catholic school in onitsha young bens artistic interests continued he began modeling tea cups and saucers of clay and tracing mango leaves he carved in elmwood and indian mango and it was during this period that he began exploring the possibilities of alabaster and bronze scholarly as well as creative he was transferred at the age of to the government college at ibadan nigeria still colonialized at that time his talent was encouraged and he proceeded to the government college at umiahia where he graduated in the college immediately hired him as art master and at mr enwonwu was on the brink of a fame that is now internationally acclaimed subsequently promoted to the position of art instructor he traveled from school to school in eastern nigeria starting art classes all the while developing and nourishing his art his first oneman exhibition was held in benin early in but the initial boon in a career that would soon soar was a oneman exhibition in lagos in december of the same year this showing resulted in his being sent to oxford university in england under the cosponsorship of an english businessman and the nigerian government he studied at the slade school of art and in received the diploma in fine art from london university mr enwonwu did postgraduate work in social anthropology and ethnography and in was made a fellow of the royal anthropological institute the berkeley galleries was the scene of his first oneman london show and was followed by a presentation at heals mansard galleries the year concluded with an appointment as art advisor to the nigerian government which made the year indeed a big one for mr enwonwu as art advisor he was instrumental in setting up art schools throughout nigeria his duties included inspecting the teaching of art and lecturing he frequently junketed to europe to keep abreast of developments in art but he also devoted ample time to his still ripening talent although his works began gaining recognition in the united states in the late forties it was in the fall of that he first visited this country under the auspices of the harmon foundation on october he opened with a oneman show at howard university and won the warm approval of washington art lovers following his success at howard mr enwonwu journeyed to boston with his works and appeared at the schweitzer foundation festival an exhibition at roosevelt house in new york sponsored by hunter college was the next stop for the visiting artist at roosevelt house mr enwonwu displayed his exhibit of oil gouache and water color paintings and wooden sculptureshe is considered to be one of the few living expert wood carversand especially fascinated patrons with his painting of olisa the god of gods olisa described by mr enwonwu as powerful and calm in his wisdom was painted from recollection of stories his grandmother had told him his american tour in high gear mr enwonwu set off for exhibitions at vassar college syracuse university and bennington college his tour included two lectures at new york university and lectures and art discussions at adelphi college on long island and at other schools returning to nigeria he continued work in the civil service and oneman exhibitions which took him to the capitols of europe the fifties brought many awards and commissions attesting to his increased recognition in mr enwonwu became a member of presence africaine at paris and attended the conference on world negro culture two years later the same year he carved the statue of the risen christ for the university of ibadan chapel one of his principal works he was awarded the insignia of mbe member of the british empire for his contribution to nigerian art and culture the famous bronze piece called anyanwu which was hailed by the late sir jacob epstein as symbolizing the rise of african countries towards nationhood was produced by mr enwonwu in the year of nigerian independence today it adorns the entrance to the nigerian museum one of the highlights of the enwonwu career came in when he was given a studio in buckingham palace to carry out the commission from the nigerian government for a bronze portrait of her majesty queen elizabeth ii the highly acclaimed work now can be viewed in front of the nigerian senate chambers the bennett prize of the royal society awarded to one person every three years for the encouragement of arts manufacturing and commerce for the commonwealth countries was presented to ben enwonwu in the sculptor to whom art has been a lifelong dedication recalls as a dark period beclouded with the cultural problems of nigeria he insists that culture and the artist were denied the proper priority during the quest for political freedom and direction the artist was forgotten as nigerianisation of the civil service began says mr enwonwu art became a thing to be used as a convenience rather than a necessity for the projection of the nigerian image in spite of the dark period the artist continued to work in president nnamdi azikiwe sat for him in london and he created a statue in bronze two years later in torino italy mr enwonwu sculpted a second statue of the nigerian president one of the more popular of his numerous murals is located in the nigerian ports authority building the mural was painted in holland in cultural missions to india germany and ghana occupied much of and has been a busy year for mr enwonwu the inspection of nigerian foreign missions took him to london bonn and rome and in the spring brought him to this country once again new york and washington were included on this cultural mission for the ministry of external affairs projection of the nigerian image a phrase that owes special homage to mr enwonwu was at the heart of the mission the artist seeks to promote the nigerian image through the decoration of our embassies with nigerian works of art he says that the mission was a success but adds that due to the influence of tribalism on the arts in nigeria ministerial authorities concerned with the promotion of art and culture would rather assign the responsibility for projecting nigerian art abroad to young and inexperienced administrative officers mr enwonwu expects that these young officers will represent his country at the world festival of negro arts to be held in dakar senegal next spring even though the festival was first discussed in nigeria in my studio between president leopold senghor and myself while the senegalese president was on an official visit to nigeria nevertheless the sensitive artist looks to the future he plans to establish a private art gallery in lagos for the purpose of promoting evaluating and developing the right kind of aesthetic attitude and philosophy of african art the art gallery might necessitate his resigning from the civil service but mr enwonwu will be able to recall glowing years in the service of his country as art advisor the gallery will be named omekaodigwe enwonwu in memory of his father it will says enwonwu tackle all the problems of cultural art and so the imagination that flowered in youth flowers in fame that which was called useless activity became genius magnified by depth spirit and endless energy a man an artist recalls his lifetime and remembers his early inspiration and alas pursues his early love malcolm_x was a great man few recognized his greatness when he lived some have come to recognize it now many will be compelled to recognize it in the future but with the publishing of the autobiography of malcolm_x grove press no matter how one has thought of him there is no longer an excuse for the ignorant belief that malcolm_x was the devil incarnate who deserved his violent death and whose absence makes the world a better place after malcolm_xs murder carl rowan an american of african descent who was at that time director of the united states information agency expressed dismay at the foreign presss clamorous attention to the murder of an unschooled black man in harlem as the creature of the politicians who had presented him his job rowan assured the world that malcolm_x represented no more than a tiny minority of the negro population of america and then scornfully holding up the clippings from newspapers throughout the world he continued all this about an exconvict exdope peddler who became a racial fanatic i can only conclude that the need to inform world opinion is even greater than we in usia thought it to be think of that incident one american black manhonored by his nations journalists and promoted to public office by the president of the united statesdenigrating a fellow black american who was excoriated by his nations press men and considered unworthy of the serious attention of the political and economic leaders of the united states that incident was a dramatization of the bitter black paradox the american dilemma which black man will finally become honored in this country the black man with some intelligence but little vision allied with those whites who would falsify the truth about this country in order to maintain the artifice of a good image or the black man who refuses to perch precariously on the horns of the race racist dilemma who faces the horns grapples with evil even if it means his death carl rowan or malcolm_x which one do you think will go down as a hero of his times before you decide do what mr rowan did not dofind out the truth about that exconvict exdope peddler no man has more acutely described and analyzed the existential political social moral and spiritual plight of a victimized people than has malcolm_x in this book no man has painted a truer picture of the afroamericans life style from midwestern farmlands to the suburbs and ghettos of big cities no man has thrown the segregationists bigots and hypocrites lies back into their teeth with greater intelligence wit defiance bravery and inflexible honor than did malcolm_x in his life and in this book no man has so irrefutably demonstrated that the race racist problem of this country should not be restricted to the reasonable speed of leadfooted american justice but rather exposed to the moral conscience of the rest of the world through open discussions in the united nations his life was full of changesfrom farmboy to high school dropout and on to zoot suits burglary dope taking dope peddling racketeering adultery and prison and in prison the crucible in which american society ritually burns out the residual dignity of its outcasts malcolm_x became converted to a new way of life through elijah muhammad of the thenobscure nation of islam and from that day on he was inflamed with the desire for knowledge and power to help his fellow black americans no man has risen from his societys dunghills to shine with more purity of purpose to scorch the blinking eyes of those who would not see a nation continually perpetuating a racist crime and to illuminate the paths of retribution more brilliantly than did malcolm_x no man can tell of a profounder transformation and growth of intellectual social and moral consciousness than does malcolm_x who addressing students and faculty of harvard university gazed out a window at a house which served as his hideout when he was big red a burglar no man has been more foully maligned in his own country even by his own people but more warmly admired and respected and honored by enlightened statesmen and citizens of africa the middle east and many other countries than malcolm_x he was an angry man but a kind one and he foretells his own death in this book with neither selfpity nor conceit nor malice no mans life is like anothers but the lives of some men men uniquely endowed with intelligence courage honesty and moral vision and fittingly present during a critical moment in history acquire a transcendent significance to all who survive them malcolm_x was such a man that is what makes the autobiography of malcolm_x a book which must be read especially by the colored people of the world for unlike many other afroamerican spokesmen especially literary ones malcolm_x does not write with a white audience in mind near the end of his life when he went to mecca and became elhajj malik elshabazz he no longer embraced racial hatred or separatism yet he realized that the whites of the western nations might not readily give up their delusions of superiority and habits of oppression and he saw that only through the unity of colored peoples can there begin the transforming of an evil world to a better one not until black americans realize that it is the murder of malcolm_x and not of john f kennedy which will prove to be the most untimely and tragic death of this century not until that time will black americans nity as malcolm_x didjohn woodbegin to rise up in strength and dig ford three years ago just lll before my anthology hhl beyond the blues was hh published i gave a lecs turerecital of and about poetry by afroamericans on bbc british broadcasting corp radio in london england among the fan mail following that broadcast was a particularly interesting letter because in the name at the bottom of the page i recognized the author of a novel about neonazis in presentday southern germany about that book the author himself wrote in a later letter lightweight stuff but not unthinking and i use these facts as an introduction to the man who said in that first letter to me as a writer and a liberal amer ican southerner i was most interested in your fascinating talk on american negro poets last friday are there any anthologies where these poets works may be found i was particularly taken with the verses of county cullens spelling which you read now in the almost years during which i have delved into the poetry of afroamericans and the many years of astonishment at the americans ignorance of the riches rejected and wasted countee cullen was one name that used to come to the fore even in the minds of very badly informed citizens of the usa here was the moment for me to say yet do i marvel i marvelled also at the writers use of capital letters which i have left as originally written so i wrote my liberal american southern colleague a note thanking him and giving him a list of then available anthologies especially recommending langston hughes and arna bon temps the poetry of the negro which was published in doubleday and was for many years the source of information on our subject together with countee cullens own excellent anthology caroling dusk published by harper in i also mentioned alain lockes the new negro published in by boni in new york the negro caravan selected by sterling a brown arthur p davis and ulysses lee which appeared in dryden press that i thought would do for a beginners reading i enclosed a copy of eric walrond s and my selection of negroamerican poems black and unknown bards the package was rewarded with another letter from the recipient black and unknown bards arrived this morning and i have been dipping into it i find the poems for the most part almost unbearably good the underlining is mine rep and i mean that literally one gets the impression that the only really good modern poets who have something worthwhile to say and say it decently and with force are negroes an impression which i find distressingly poignant i am quoting my liberal american southerner at such length another startling paragraph from his letter is still to followbecause he voices honestly the same things about which critics have been beating about the bush for decades in fact his remarks reveal the true reasons why other writersliberal or unliberal northern eastern western or southern americans have kept the afroamerican poet outside the mainstream of american literature not because nonwhite americans cannot write but because they can and that is the distressing thing this ability this genius these qualities which make negroes men among men artists among artists in a world which does not want to recognize these truths it is as simple or as complicated as that the appreciation of art is an entirely subjective matter tastes in art are subject to fashion subject to socioeconomic circumstances to trends of the time and in the final analysis it is the consumer who decides whether he likes the article or doesnt art to me is something that awakens within me a specific sort of awareness if a picture a poem a piece of music any artistic product does this i call it art that is to say i myself decide whether or not something is art no objective criterion exists that applies to the ordinary man as well as to the professional critic the awareness which i mentioned before we may best compare with love if i meet someone who arouses in me that definite yet inexplicable awareness i say that i love that person when i am seized with this emotion the word beauty comes to my mind but in their essence love and art have nothing to do with beauty a poet need not write about beautiful pretty or glamorous things to create in his reader that specific awareness either his work appeals to me or not that is the dilemma of the art critic he must judge what he adores or abhors and he must share his emotions with others american critics almost without any exceptions have until very very recently been nonnegroes the vast majority of them have not yet learned to see afroamerican writers as just writers the critics consider subject matter first when it concerns that specific group of creative artists in the same way as concert critics used to speak of the negro contralto or the negro tenor before they gave fair criticism to the artists vocal and especially professional achievements oddly enough in the field of the performing arts the prejudiced mind worked the other way round negroes were supposed to be good singers by right of birth consideration in respect of their training and professionalism did not enter into the critics reviews and there we are on the same level as still prevails in respect to literary criticism it is remarkable that my letter writer does see the tremendous qualities of negro poets that he does feel the power and impact of their work that it arouses in him that specific awareness but he cannot love and that i am deeply sorry to state is perhaps the clue to the entire problem of the negro poet and his judges ray durem said it so painfully true i know im not sufficiently obscure to please the criticsnor devious enough imagery escapes me i cannot find those mild and gracious words to clothe the carnage blood is blood and murders murder whats a lavender word for lynch that makes me sit up all right that does give me that specific awareness and it shocks me as it must have shaken many a critic however without the ability to love that critic will not call ray durems poem art i i i right through the long history of negro writing in the united states critics in certain periods recognized a limited a very limited number of poets all of these responded to the preconceived idea of the negro all of them represented some aspect of the negro stereotype and i am audacious enough to maintain this situation is still with us to a large extent only specialists and there are preciously few of them would know that black americans have contributed to the countrys formal poetry i use the term in contrast to folk poetry as early as miss lucy terrys account of an attack by indians in and that jupiter hammons evening thought in was the first published poem by a negro the first afroamerican of whom american literature takes note is phillis wheatley an able poet but certainly not a militant or raceconscious lady miss wheatley kidnapped from africa at the age of eight sold into the ownership of the liberal and religious john wheatley became a genteel late eighteen century young lady and as a poet modelled herself on pope and milton unmistakably she had talent and craftsmanship although she allowed her teachers and society to remake her completely she sacrificed her personality to the wish to be one of them no wonder that white america wasand isready to accept that good intelligent grateful african girl she died free impoverished of tb at the age of none but the minute band of experts knows lyrical and freedomloving moses horton or daniel payne or charles reason or ann plato or alberry whitman or sincere tender militant frances ellen harper or any other negro abolitionist poet the one america does know is paul laurence dunbar but what part of his work have the white critics accepted the dialect poetry of course dunbar was a master of it of course his lyrics sing out his people live his cornbread smells most appetizingly but dunbar was not a southerner his mother was and she taught him the regional language nor was he a man of the country dunbar wanted to live by his pen his own people were still largely illiterate and those who could read and write didnt have the money to buy books so his audiencein fact his customerswere white america and to please them to make them sit up and listen he deliberately chose the kind of poetry that made him famous in their world for their sake he wore the mask that grins and lies as he himself wrote in dunbar we have another good negro who presented himself as a stereotype although he left the world a magnificent heritage of four novels a great number of short stories and hundreds of nondialect poems when he died at the age of the next in that short and very slim column of dark americans who made it in general anthologies occasionally appear in school textbooks and whose names more than just people with wayout interests know is james weldon johnson poet essayist collector of spirituals author of a book that shook his epoch the autobiography of an excolored man editor of the book of american negro poetry with its daring introduction on the negros creative genius and what of his work do we find among specimens of negro poetry a word i hate anyhow theres poetry by negroes but theres no negro poetry neither white nor red nor yellow the creation and god stepped out into space and saidim lonely ill make me a man now isnt that cute arent those coloured folk simpleminded arent they religious too i just love to hear them sing theyve all of them such beautiful voices ad lib do they taste the poetry of those sermons no they dont do they sense the tenderness no question about it they see the odd primitive adorably childish preacher rolling his eyes toward heaven for their entertainment thats why the creation has made it do those who acclaim it know the great james weldon johnsons other work you bet they dont i even know negroes who dont realize that lift every voice is his poem and the songs magnificent tune his brothers then comes the harlem renaissance scores of names tons of talent one of those who then was a youngster has really made it langston hughes now called the dean of negro writers a man whose work has been translated into practically every living language have a look in anthologies of american poetry comb through books of poetry for american secondary schools and what do you find mother to son dont misunderstand me i like the poem its a remarkable piece it communicates with people of many nations and races but that mother is as white america expects a good negro a hard working slaving woman who just wants her boy to be good too and carry on she doesnt protest seewe all know thats how negroes live they actually enjoy their lives that way colored folk dont really want to live otherwise thats how they are the scope of this article does not permit me to carry my point too far i could easily apply it to prose writings too from richard wright to james baldwin the critics of negro writing extract from it that which they have all the time expected they judge by way of subject matter not by general literary standards if there are any or by their specific awareness because there is no level of individual communication other than the mentioned negative one because there is no love my listener and letter writer knows that and it frightens him listen to him again will your new anthology beyond the blues include the poems in this one black and unknown bards i rather think it would be better to leave out any spirituals as this is the sort of thing one expects from negroes and although charming is not startling anymore whereas the poems have a great impact part of which is the fact that they are not at all the sort of thing one associates with negroes my correspondent may get some more shocks when he discovers that many of those charming spirituals were in fact coveredup songs of protest i told him so in my reply and a few things more for instance that negroes are not curios but human beings with creative abilities perhaps not better certainly not worse than others but at least on a level with the rest of the human race blindness to that simple statement is the very root of that disgusting attitude of the critic toward negro writing some people on this earth are as mari evans says in her poem fling me your challenge incontrovertibly and most magnificently black some of these also are poets writers of all the world will express best that which is truly theirs that which they experience so deeply so painfully whether it be love or hatred that it wants to press itself out of their system almost like in childbirth the german poet goethe meant something which also affects negro writing as it affects all writing of all times when he said you cant get rid of what is truly yours even if you were to throw it away he also wrote poetic content is the content of ones own life and his compatriot philosopher schopenhauer put it like this style is the physiognomy of the mind and a safer index to character than the face or the colour of ones skin rep authors or editors are only human and human beings like praise recently my anthology beyond the blues was praised by a famous critic for being the best anthology of negro verse ever published however i reject praise that was given for the wrong reasons in the same way that critics of past generations liked the work of negro stereotypes or as they interpreted the works in terms of their own minds which were unable to see negroes other than as stereotypes the presentday critic will acclaim black authors who make the reader forget they are black again it is the subject matter that counts first not the writers artistic ability the new trend is as bad as the old prather davis p forced himself not to f limp as he followed his mother out of the elevator across the lobby of the crowded police station his right knee was throbbing like a toothache from his many falls during the demonstration and he could feel warm blood snaking down his leg he was ten years old and he was hot tired and hungry he swallowed hard and hurried after his mother who cut a path through the milling demonstrators and sternfaced policemen to his left he saw a group of singing clapping demonstrators being herded through a revolving door into the police station the singing washed over him and he paused that thing in him which had settled down while he had been upstairs in juvenile detention now began to rise again it started in his stomach whirling about and rose to his throat choking him slowly he started toward the demonstrators but after a few steps his mother grabbed his hand and led him firmly out of the building going down the street prather frowned he wished his mother wouldnt hold his hand and lead him like he was a child but the hard tapping of her heels and the straight set of her shoulders made him hold his peace he glanced up at her face and seeing the tight line of her mouth he knew that just one more straw and either hot tears or hot words would pour from her so ignoring the pain in his knee he quickened his pace he heard the shrill blast of a policemans whistle and up ahead he saw a policeman in white gloves directing traffic a sleek sports car zoomed by and his eyes followed it lovingly a black police van turned the corner and from inside it he heard demonstrators singing and clapping again that thing started churning in his stomach and rose to his throat he tightened his hand around his mothers fingers and thought about this thing in his throat that choked him he choked from it whenever he heard his brother a philip who had been named after that big pullman porter man and who had come home this summer from fisk with a beard talk about civil_rights and freedom and the l a dodgers he choked from it when he played checkers with his father in the evenings after supper and when his father would tell him about the different cities to which his railroad waiters job had taken him before that accident two years ago had crippled him for life prather remembered when his father used to bring him presents he would rush to his father for it but his father would hold it high in the air he would have to climb upon a chair then onto his fathers shoulders before he could reach the present his mother would stand by nervously telling his father to quit the foolishness but his father would laugh and say let him learn to reach and today during the demonstration that thing had choked him with a philip holding his hand he was marching and feeling good when the confusion began the police had come with horses and water hoses and swinging billysticks somebody shoved him and he fell skinning his knee he scrambled to his feet looking for his brother but a philip had disappeared he heard people screaming and praying and horses hooves ringing and fire hoses swishing somebody was shouting over a loudspeaker and cameras were flashing and popping suddenly he was slammed to the pavement lights blinked behind his eyes and air gushed from his lungs as he lay with the world spinning about him someone lifted him and carried him to a police van now this thing was still in his throat as they reached the parking lot his mother let go of his hand and fumbled in her purse for the car keys finding them she turned inspecting him silently her eyes large and luminous then slowly she held out her arms the thing in his throat expanded and burst he ran crying into her soft arms letting the sweet rose smell of her wash over him the boy walked down the hill past the mess hall and into the valley he wore indian moccasins shorts rolled neatly half way up his thighs a white tshirt and a sailor hat pulled down all around through the trees ahead he could see the calm water of the lake a woodpecker knocked overhead and he stopped to locate it in the tall pines it was redheaded a big male moving clockwise around a tall pine about two thirds of the way up the cicadas were sounding their greek chorus and he could hear the crows cursing the fish hawk over the lake he moved towards the beach past the thick ivy on the valley floor to his right he stopped at the rail fence hed helped build a few summers ago and looked at the lake it was a mirror no breeze to ripple its surface the wooden pier moved out into the water its lshape reflected in its surface then the flash of a fish leaping for a bug far out in the lake and the smooth surface was broken he walked to the board with the name tags hanging on it and moved his tag from the section marked in from among the tags of the members of his troop to the section marked out hanging it on one of the hooks at the green painted symbol of canoe number three the boy walked to the racked canoes stepped out of his moccasins stooped and came up under number three a long old towne painted green he stood between the gunwales and shifted until he was at the balance point then straightened letting his legs lift it the canoe balanced on his hands he walked to the waters edge and into the lake until the water was at his calves then aware of the eyes of the younger scouts who stood at the fence he pivoted half a turn to his left and allowed the canoe to turn over of its own weight lowering it to his extended left thigh he fed the bow into the water hand over hand lowered the stern gently to the sand and walked to the rack of paddles selecting one that came just to his chin he picked up a kneeling pad that he had filled with kapok and sewn the winter before and returned to the canoe pushing it into the lake as he stepped into it and knelt at the stern thwart the boy let the canoe glide the paddle across the gunwales as he moved past the sailboat it was a sixteen foot marconirigged sloop broad of beam and with a center board well suited for the long narrow lake he had furled the sails well that afternoon he would sail again tomorrow later that evening there would be the annual songfest in the mess hall after dinner scouts from the four camps at the lake miles to the south had hiked north to hear them theirs was a singing camp and they were famous for it they sang everywhere on the trails in the dense woods when hiking around the camp fires in the mess halls in their boats and their tents at night his own troop was one of the best they might win the prize again that night for the second consecutive year the boy loved to sing and he looked forward to the evening he hummed one of his favorite songs as he jstroked lazily across the lake then he shifted his right leg from a kneeling position braced it against the side of the canoe in the racing stance digging in hard with the paddle picking up the beat the canoe leapt forward and he stroked hard until the water surged past and he began to sweat he rested the paddle across the canoe and looked astern at his wake and the whirlpools left by his paddle marring the surface of the lake he was proud of his skill on the waterfront as a swimmer with the canoe and rowboat as a life guard and in the sailboat the camp had opened a new world to him one not bounded by the dirty streets and alleys of chicago he stroked slowly toward the shallows at the other side of the lake the turtle hunting grounds watching the fish hawk circling sedately high above ignoring the crows as they divebombed him the crows offered no threat as long as he was healthy and the hawk knew it tomorrow the boy would bring two of the younger scouts across in the canoe to catch the turtles that swam and sunned in the shallows but today he wanted to be alone in the gathering dusk on the quiet lake the lake dropped off suddenly at that point and the turtles depended on the depths close at hand for protection but by keeping the canoe between the turtles and the deep water forcing them to swim parallel to the shore a wading scout could approach them from the rear reach into the water and capture them for the menagerie already full of snakes turtles and toads and frogs the boy would watch from the canoe as the younger scouts waded after the turtles and tell them when they were chasing a snapper they didnt know yet how to recognize the snappers or how to grab them without being bitten the snapping turtles were mean and often refused food in captivity so he let them swim into the depths of the lake he reached the shallows and watched six turtles scurry to the deep water he followed the shore to the end of the lake and then turned back towards camp it was time to return to his tent get his uniform from beneath the mattress where his body had pressed it the night before and shine his moccasins in time for the singing he let the younger scouts rack the canoe and then walked up the hill toward his campsite everywhere he could hear the scouts singing eager for the evenings music they were a singing camp later after the singing had finished still full of the songs and rhythm he walked from the mess hall with the crowd into the darkness of the michigan woods but he didnt return to his campsite he was still excited from the singing and he hoped their guests from the lake to the south had enjoyed it the scouts at the four camps there were from chicago too he had been to the camps there the year before for the ceremony initiating him into a higher order of the scouting fraternity he had noticed the difference in the facilities the cabins had raised concrete floors wooden sides and screening electric lights and hot and cold running water in the wash shed at each campsite at his own camp they slept in tents with wooden floors with no screening with kerosene lamps and washed in the morning in the icy water from the pump at the rustic wash racks they had built themselves they made their own mattresses from muslin to be filled with dried leaves or pine boughs or slept on the bare canvas stretched between the short springs of their bunks but their scoutmasters told them that theirs was a real camp and that they were better scouts for having to rough it and the boy believed it was true the singing had been good the best in his five summers at camp it had gotten better with each song and there had been the contest for the prize between his troop and their traditional neighborhood rivals they had not won but the voting had been close and then the two of them had sung three songs together the last a driving swinging spiritual and they had rocked the entire hall he still felt the song and although he knew that there would be more singing at campsite around a camp fire he walked on he wanted to talk to the visitors it was a black moonless night and he could not see very well coming from the mess hall which had been brightly lit with coleman lanterns but he could see the path marked with whitewashed boulders a group of scouts walked ahead and he joined them hi the boy said to one of the scouts how did you like the singing wonderful wonderful he replied it was just great its my first year in camp and everyone said how good it would be but it was even better my scoutmaster is right those niggers sure can sing there was light ahead at the entrance to the camp and the boy didnt want the scout from the camp to the south to see his face he stepped to the side of the path and allowed the group to move ahead and strangely he wasnt angry only very sad somehow he walked back to the hill and the path leading to his campsite he could hear them singing his troop and their rivals singing together the boy halted on the dark path halfway up the hill listening in the midst of the tall pines and big oaks the singing came to him filtered by the trees he stood there alone and listened then walked up the path and into the clearing of the campsite the two troops ringed the fire some sitting on the logs around it others on the sand he looked for the flag of his patrol the fox patrol and saw it stuck in the sand in front of the right members of the patrol the boy moved into the light of the fire and toward the flag he saw his friend in the midst of and waved there was a breeze stirring they would have good sailing tomorrow he sat on the sand crosslegged next to the flag and listened awhile then he began to smile as the song filled him yes he thought as he sang he was right yes we can sing history masks the faces and emotions of black men and women who lived in this racial wonderland the record burns with their presence but the record is strangely silent on their reactions and the reactions of their white colleagues the record becomes far less silent at the hands of a diligent historian in confrontation black and white johnson publishing co inc from which the above is quoted lerone bennett jr writing in his lucid style fills more voids in this nations black and white experience than have previously been filled in any one book about a nation where the popular use of history has served to defend an ugly past maintain an evil system and to avert radical change the author writes there is no need really for us to continue to play the dreadful games of the professional race relationist the game of education we must educate negroes the game of appropriation we must improve the cultural standards of negroes the game of technique it is a very complicated problem we are not now nor have we ever been playing those games the game we are playing is racism mr bennett uses history to relate precisely what brought about the game and in bringing us from jamestown to selma he explains the creation of the game and the ramifications that led to the present conundrum he delves back into history and reveals the words and actions and reactions of those both black and white whose very lives and decisions are key links to an understanding of modern reality in racist america the author cites quotes from the past that relate to the present with almost frightening accuracy and relevancy one example is found in the words of georgia white supremacist henry grady we have no fear of negro revolt already we are attaching to us the best elements of that race and as we proceed our alliance will broaden the latter thought being as true a prophecy as ever uttered in this country the need of white americans to dehumanize black americans is examined closely by mr bennett who writes slavery did not spring from racism racism sprang from slavery the concept of race was a direct outgrowth of the slave trade deliberately invented by an exploiting group which needed a theology to maintain and defend privileges founded on naked force a need arose for justification of that which could not be justified by any theory in western thought confrontation black and white includes what is perhaps the most objective account of negro leadershipits successes and failuresto date including an examination of the shortcomings as well as the brilliance of men such as frederick douglass w e b du bois asa philip randolph and martin_luther_king in addition to these known leaders the author reveals the significance of lesser known men such as martin r delaney perhaps the first major american negro nationalist prior to the civil war and richard allen an early th century black man who recognized the necessity of power it is difficult to single out the books most significant contribution but students of negro revolt and protest will note the authors filling many voids of the forties in dealing with this period bennett the historian excels at his forte and casts light on a darkness that relates with great import to the movement of the fifties and sixties in doing so the author places in true perspective the role of a man who perhaps more than any other negro leader has been bypassed in terms of his significance and influence regarding the current surge of black americaasa philip randolph bennett the historian excels throughout the book and in a conclusion he calls uamerica face to face bennett the writer reveals not only amazing perception and insight but also the courage integrity and sheer audaciousness that is perhaps primary if one is to tell the truth about this country in no uncertain terms the author assesses the roles of americans who are in a race here between white hysteria and negro despair between fascism and democracy between america and america we must make revolutionary changes at every level of our lives we must first of all abandon our frames of referencesall our frames of reference are vitiated by racist assumptions mr bennett insists that negro leadership must awaken the sleeping millions and he suggests that to do so is a challenge no national organization with the exception of sncc and the black nationalist groups has addressed itself to in a serious and sustained way he tells us that the only choice we have left is between an orderly confrontation and a disorderly one writing about the fifties he refers to a new breed of artists who came forth with a new frame of reference and a new sense of respect for themselves men and women like lorraine hansberry leroi jones john killens frank london brown hoyt fuller ossie davis miles davis ruby dee oscar brown james baldwin but such a list is incomplete if one fails to include a black historian from clarksdale mississippidavid llorens those negroes over might remember when robert penn warren one of the highlypraised group of southern writers which included allen tate back in the thirties and forties was saying in print that negroes were inferior human beings and that they would be better off to accept their lot and stop all the agitating and striving well this very same mr warren published a book this year called who speaks for the negro random house and while he failed to answer his own question he let it be known that he hasnt changed his own stripes merely covered them over a bit mr warren used a tape recorder and went out interviewing negroes as high as roy wilkins and as low as an allbutilliterate black farmer in louisiana and it is plain that mr warrens favorite nigras were mr wilkins and the farmer mr wilkins for his great good sense and the farmer for his comfortable oldfashioned humility mr warren reserved his most blistering comments for the late malcolm_x and the redoubtable james baldwin which is par for the course and naturally all the yearend literary guides have selected mr warrens who speaks for the negro as one of the best books on the subject published durasserting that the murderers consider themselves and are widely regarded as patriots william bradford huie in lives for mississippi wcc writes this murder was no ordinary outrage committed by one human being against another and therefore against a state it was part of the continuing war between mississippi terrorists and the united states of america once this is understood comprehension of what happened may become easier thus the above statement best explains the authors theory regarding the murder of james chaney michael schwerner and andrew goodman in neshoba county mississippi during the summer of the author proves himself a talented journalist and the result of his intensive researchespecially regarding the planning of the execution is a book that is quite informative mr huie also admits to hating what the white supremacy terrorists are doing to negroes to the south and to the united states butdue in part perhaps to his outrage with his native souththe authors theory seems to relieve the nation of its responsibility for the fate of the three young men huie often refers to the terrorists believing that they were striking a blow against communism by murdering the three civil_rights workers and he cites the influence of southern politicians the cooperation of the mississippi police and the complicity of the community mississippi in arriving at his conclusion that the killers believed themselves patriots this reviewer would argue that responsibility for white mississippi rednecks fear of communismfear strong enough to make men kill cannot be confined within the borders of the magnolia state or for that matter even within the south in june of last year liberal illi nois senator paul douglas told a delegation that journeyed to the capitol to appeal for additional federal protection for the summer project of which i was a member of his fear of communism in connection with the summer project in his words you must remember that there are those who would choose to use you as sacrificial lambs on our return to oxford ohio only a few days after chaney schwerner and goodman were missing members of that same delegation who were scheduled to leave for southwest mississippi natchezmccomb were briefed by john doar of the justice department mr doar advised that we refrain from entering that area of mississippi because even we are afraid to go in there and i remind you he represented the united states government a government that sends men to their death and kills men in foreign lands under the guise of protecting freedom but pleaded helplessness in the face of protecting the freedom and the lives of civil_rights workers northern mayors and newspapers have consistently made accusations of communism when assailing local movements in their cities granted mr huie probably did not have access to all of the abovementioned insights but i think they relate not so abstractly as one might like to believe to the reality of what happened in neshoba county if we have created a climate whereby men pull triggers on innocent victims and think themselves patriots the entire country is guilty in the minds of many white men both north and south communism and niggers have become one and the same huac many northern politicians many northern newspapers and other national institutions as well as mississippi authorities have contributed to this dangerous paranoia if mr huie is to have us believe that these men believed themselves patriots then i would suggest that he deludes us by saying the men who planned and committed this murder thought they were acting not against the state of mississippi but for mississippi against the united states such a statement makes them mississippi patriots perhaps the murderers believed themselves exactly that but if we are to call them patriots the truth of our national life today forces us to call them american patriots the author informs us that the killers were after schwerner the jewboy with the beard and that chaney and goodman were just unfortunate victims perhaps that is correct but in discussing the nations reaction to the tragedy he fails to mention that this reaction was based on the fact that whites were murdereda fact which says something significant about this nation of which mississippi is a part in spite of much speculation and many missing linksunderstandably so in this case lives for mississippi is a book worth reading but like most books written by white men about the problem it is incomplete mr huie quotes a speech made by cores david dennis at a memorial service for james chaney in meridian mississippi and words from mr dennis speech best sum up this reviewers reaction to both the tragedy and the authors theory and im going to tell you deep down in my heart what i feel right now if you go back home and sit down and take what these white men in mississippi are doing to us if you take it and dont do something about it then god damn your souls david llorens on a spring morning in a reporter from the washington press walked up the long lane of stone steps leading to a spacious home in the d c suburbs bent on seeing frederick douglass although born a slave douglass had become the most prominent negro of the nineteenth century having behind him a notable career as an abolitionist orator a newspaper editor and a holder of such high public offices as marshal of the district of columbia and recorder of deeds for the district as the reporter neared the douglass home he heard tones from a violin coming closer he detected the tune and the tunesmiththe starspangled banner played by douglass himself after presenting his card the journalist stated his business what was mr douglasss opinion on the suppression of the negro vote in the south putting down his bow the negro leader spent the next hour discussing democracy in america the way the negro was treated said douglass in essence was a standing reproach to the principles upon which this republic was founded at the end of the interview douglass picked up his violin and again struck up the starspangled banner he liked to play it so he told the departing newsman this episode was full of meaning like other colored citizens douglass loved his country and he was stirred by the appeal of america as the land of the free how inspiring to live in a nation in which liberty and justice were the birthright of all but did such an america really exist not completely and no one knew this any better than darkskinned americans and so from the beginning they have been in the vanguard of those who wished to make their country as heroic and libertyloving as it has been pictured in patriotic song and story to help make america a beaconlight this was the great enterprise to which colored americans gave their devotion their notable efforts are reflected in a living record that has become a mighty tributary in the stream of american history their contribution dates from their first landings in the new world for they did not come emptyhanded in their ancestral homelands along the bulge of africa they had attained a stable order of civilization in their government the african political systems all operated under elaborate codes of law whether clan state village state kingdom or empire in tribal life the innumerable societies and social organizations were in the main established on the principle of equality thus when the african arrived on the shores of the new world he brought with him a sense of justice and a tradition of abiding by the law from africa too the transplanted native brought his art forms and handicraft skills tribal craftsmen were highly proficient in weaving pottery and carving in wood ivory and bone african craftsmen had been first to work in iron and gold metal forging being one of their oldest arts these natives from across the atlantic were among the earliest arrivals in the newly discovered americas indeed from onward they accompanied the spanish explorers on their voyages of discovery when balboa first stared at the pacific he carried colored workers in his train cortez used negroes in his conquest of mexico one of them found some brown grains in his rations and planted them thus becoming the pioneer grower of wheat in the western hemisphere the most renowned of the negroes who accompanied the conquistadores was estavanico who in led a party of spaniards and pima indians in search of the fabled seven cities of cibola estavanicos travels took him into presentday new mexico and arizona and thus paved the way for the spanish occupation of the southwest negroes also accompanied the french explorers in louisiana along the mississippi valley and in the great lakes area chicagos first permanent settler was jean baptiste pointe de sable a mulatto originally from haiti whose deed inspired the wellknown quip by the pottawattomie indians the first white man in chickagou was a negro when in john c fremont pathfinder of the west began a survey of the oregon trail his official party had in its number a colored volunteer eighteenyearold jacob dodson of washington d c the tradition of negroes accompanying explorers was to extend down to matthew a henson who on april stood at the north pole to witness robert e peary take the stars and stripes and plant its staff in the ice once in the new world the men from africa were given tasks to do in the beginning there were forests to be cleared highways to be constructed artillery to be hauled and boat timber to be lugged over the mountains after the english colonies were established beginning with jamestown in the negro was employed in the north as a farm hand mechanic and skilled laborer in the lastnamed class were those who practiced silversmithing goldsmithing and cabinetmaking in the south the negro was employed mainly in producing the staplestobacco indigo sugar rice and in the nineteenth century cotton slave labor however was put to other uses than agriculture and domestic service in the old south the slave had a virtual monopoly on the mechanic arts skilled slaves commanded a high price the plantation required a certain speciality in labor houses must be built agricultural implements must be manufactured and repaired clothing must be made for these and other needs of the plantation many trained slaves supplied their skillsamong them the carpenter mason wheelright plasterer weaver shoemaker seam stress tailor and upholsterer distinctive among the skilled slaves were the ironsmiths whose work may still be seen in the balconies grilles and lampbrackets of the homes in the old french quarter of new orleans while most of the colored workers were slaves there were many who were not in a year before the outbreak of the civil war there were nearly half a million free negroes in the united states this was about one ninth of the total negro population and it was nearly evenly divided between the north and the south but free or slave the labor of the colored man created king cotton and added greatly to the store of american mechanical skill contributing also to the economic development of the united states was the inventive genius of its colored people at the end of the eighteenth century norbert rillieux of new orleans invented a vacuum pan that revolutionized sugarrefining methods jo andersons competent assistance enabled cyrus mccormick his owner to bring to perfection the first practical reaper in a few years later lewis temple of massachusetts invented the singlepiece toggle harpoon thus enabling whalemen to multiply their catch from the fertile brain of granville t woods came nearly a score of new devices in telegraphy electricity and air brakes in the eighteen eighties elijah j mccoy a contemporary of woods produced a lubricating cup which was widely adopted by railroads and oceangoing ships in the same decade a year old colored mechanic at lynn massachusetts was granted a patent on a machine to last shoes this invention writes a recent biographer of jan earnst matzeliger was to revolutionize an ancient industry and help significantly to lighten the burden of human labor all over the world no less noteworthy than the colored mans economic contribution to america was that of his war services the patriotism of the negro has been well testedhe was never a summer soldier whenever america has been engaged in a war he has offered his services a runaway slave crispus attucks was the first patriot to shed his blood on the eve of the revolutionary war attucks was buried from historic faneuil hall a monument which stands at the scene of the boston massacre commends him and his four comrades in martyrdom long as in freedoms cause the wise contend dear to your country shall your fame extend in the war of perhaps the most important single action in which negroes participated was that of the colored militia who shared in the famous battle of new orleans the only land victory won by americans commanded by major general andrew jackson these more than men of color marched to battle singing their own war song go forward grenadiers he who is dead requires no ration in the civil war negroes enlisted under the union flag of whom gave the last full measure of devotion but soldiering was not their only contribution in the north and in the confederacy the brawn and sweat of black men went into many a fortification and gun emplacement one of the many colored women who worked for the day of liberation was the famed underground railroad conductor harriet tubman who served as spy scout and war nurse in world war i more than negroes bore arms four colored regiments were awarded the croix de guerre in world war ii a quarter of a century later the first casualty of the united states armed forces was a negro robert h brooks of sadieville kentucky who was killed in the philippines the day after pearl harbor in the korean war the colored soldier served in racially mixed units for the first time in significant numbers since the revolutionary war this drumming jim crow out of the armed services was a step which improved the fighting efficiency of americas armed forces a report issued from the office of the assistant secretary of defense entitled integration in the armed services and dated january made this significant statement thorough evaluation of the battletested results to date indicates a marked increase in overall combat effectiveness through integration through his direct participation in every war since the declaration of independence the negro has substantially contributed to the defense and maintenance of his country another contribution of his one of a different kindis what might be called the gift of the spirit of its many manifestations the one which has made the greatest impress on american culture is the negro song the most remarkable of the songs are the spirituals products of plantation churches conducted by colored preachers these songs sprang up spontaneously they served as a safetyvalve being the negros side of what happened to him but they were more they were remarkable for their power of feeling power of imagination and power of expression of the nearly of these spirituals perhaps two of the most familiar are deep river and swing low sweet chariot the spirituals are americas only folksong and they now belong to the world of negro origin also are many american work songs negroes who followed the sea improvised boat songs and rowing songs the rhythmic tunes of swarthy stevedores served as a laborsaving device in stowing cotton hoisting sail or casting anchor becoming part of the sailormens stock of songs as they gathered the harvest in the fields colored toilers sang to ease their tasks these plantation strains were destined to survive in railroad and hammer songs like water boy and those clustering around the fabulous john henry using such typical language as this old hammer killed john henry but this old hammer wont kill me with the coming of the twentieth century the vocal music of the negro was diverted into the field of entertainment from negro folksong came another outflowering that of ragtime this music with a ragged time to it was given a twist in theme in and the result was the immortal st louis blues composed by w c handy one night as he sat in a tavern on a levee street in st louis after ragtime was rebaptized as jazz and it quickly swept the country its influence soon spread to europe where it aroused the enthusiasm of serious musicians and composers jazz is on its way to becoming the music of the world wrote belgian musicologist robert goffin in the rhythms used in negro vocal music were much like those used in negro dance from plantation dances such as the juba came the minstrel show with its series of peculiar shuffling steps one of the colored minstrel men was james bland who before he reached twenty had composed carry me back to ole virginny now the state song of the old dominion the dance patterns of the minstrel show gave their stamp to the cakewalk and then later to the charleston the big apple and a host of others the influence which the negro has exercised on the art of dancing in this country has been almost absolute concludes james weldon johnson a student of negro culture just as americas music and dance reflect a negro influence so do this countrys behavior patterns into the channels of the american spirit the transplanted african has infused his zest for living carl g jung the great swiss psychologist has noted the negro influence on our daytoday behavior what then about american laughter writes he in rhetorical question what about the boundless noisy sociality the pleasure in movement and in stunts of all sorts the loosejointed walk the negroid dance and music it would be difficult not to see that the negro has affected american behavior another negro quality which has become a national trait is the ability to adapt oneself to a society that is never staticthe old order changeth yielding place to new the american negro writes melville j herskovits is characterized by that resilience toward new experience which in itself is a deepseated tradition of africa such a resiliency well might be the key to tomorrowone who is accustomed to scanning new horizons is not likely to be chained to the fixed assumptions of a day that is dying civilization writes lewis mumford is the neverending process of creating one world and one humanity for such a new cosmopolitanism the american negro is fitted by his physical characteristics his interculturalist background and his resilient spirit if as wyndham lewis suggests the united states has become a human laboratory for the manufacture of cosmic man if van wyck brooks can speak of the planetarymindedness of the american people and if harrison smith can maintain that this country is now producing the first world man then the negro in our midst may claim a modest share of influence this recital of the role of the negro has left out much but it may indicate that the choicest heritage of this land includes the contributions of its sable sons and daughters to the making of america they have given their best and their all the negro finally has played a unique role as a mirror for america a test of this countrys ideals a sort of spiritual barometer from the beginning his presence has raised an important question would america become an oligarchy of the skin or a land of equal justice under law colored americans by and large have never doubted what the answer will be i know of no country where the conditions for the development of liberty and humanity are more favorable than here in the united states so spoke a former slave who was destined to hold positions of high honor in the government of his country and who liked to play the starspangled banner on his violin on a hot day in august a prominent politician entered the white house and paused in the presir office it was dark joseph t mills wrote later and there in a corner i saw a man quietly reading who possessed a remarkable physiognomy the man awed judge mills i was riveted to the spot he said adding i stood and stared at him he raised his flashing eyes and caught me in the act i was compelled to speak said i are you the president no replied the stranger i am frederick douglass it was an honest mistake frederick douglass was in washington to see abraham lincoln he was not the president but under different circumstances he could have been he had all the giftspresence passion bearing brilliance all the gifts save one he was nonwhite coloran accident of birthbarred him from the highest prize but it did not prevent him from becoming one of the most remarkable men of that or any other age born in the lowest position in society douglass emancipated himself and became an orator an abolitionist an editor a politician a seer and a prophet bom brown and hungry in a society that forbade slaves to read he lifted himself by his own efforts and became one of the great names of an age that abounds in greatness for years from to he was in the forefront of the fight for human freedom during this period he laid the foundation for the negro protest movement although he died years ago frederick douglass is as current as yesterdays headline one hundred and ten years ago he was staging sitins on massachusetts railroads one hundred and six years ago he was leading a fight for integrated schools in rochester new york one hundred years ago he was denouncing hypocrisy and fraud with prebaldwin fury if there is no struggle he said there is no progress those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground they want the rain without thunder and lightning they want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters this struggle may be a moral one or it may be a physical one or it may be both moral and physical but it must be a struggle power concedes nothing without a demand it never did and never will men may not get all they pay for in this world but they must certainly pay for all they get more important than the eloquence of douglass words was the eloquence of his life frederick augustus washington bailey he assumed the name douglass later was born in february on the eastern shore of maryland he never knew his father who was rumored to be his master and he only saw his mother five or six times slavery he said once abolished both fatherhood and motherhood as a child he knew the brutality and degradation of slavery he knew hunger and pain and he saw his aunt and other negro men and women whipped till blood ran like rivulets down their backs a stroke of luck sent douglass to baltimore md where he learned at an early age that knowledge is power his mistress wanted to teach him the alphabet but his master forbade it give a nigger an inch he said and he will take an ell learning would spoil the best nigger in the world listening thinking dreaming frederick came to the conclusion that words were weapons he hid dirty pages in his pockets and when no one was looking he extracted the pages and spelled out the magic words later while still a slave douglass learned that power has its limitations this was an extraordinary discovery and it changed the whole course of his life it happened this way he refused to buckle down to his master and was sent to a professional negrobreaker who specialized in destroying the spirit of slaves who would not submit to the slave regime the negrobreakers name was edward covey and covey was good at his trade he worked douglass until he was ready to drop from exhaustion and whipped him until he bowed and smiled but wormsand slaves and negroesturn one day douglass tells he turned and made a desperate last stand the two men grappled to an indecisive draw covey stalked off and never afterwards touched douglass from this incident douglass drew a moral which he applied to many situations after he gained his freedom he is whipped oftenest who is whipped easiest four years later at the age of douglass escaped from slavery in he borrowed a sailor suit and an officiallooking paper with a big american eagle on it grabbing a train he traveled to new york flashing his eaglestamped paper as he went three years later he joined the phalanx of negro and white men who were waging an intense cold war against slavery white abolitionists like william lloyd garrison and free negroes like charles lenox remond were in the forefront of the movement but they did not have the firsthand knowledge that douglass had and their speeches lacked his concreteness and fire douglass on the platform was a sight to see he was a goodlooking man tall wellbuilt with olive skin and a halo of hair worn long and au naturel in the african style his physical presence moved people so did the rolling thunder of his voice by turns humorous dolorous and indignant he transformed his audience to slave row a master mimic he could make people laugh at a slaveowner preaching the duties of christian obedience could make them see the humiliation of a black maiden ravished by a brutal slaveowner could make them hear the sobs of a mother separated from her child through him people could cry and curse through him people could live slavery white men and black men william wells brown said had talked against slavery but none had ever spoken like frederick douglass within a few years douglass was a household name he traveled to england ireland and scotland was feted by ladies lords and earls his reception was so warm that he was tempted to remain abroad but in an eloquent farewell speech at london tavern he said i choose rather to go home to return to america i go turning my back upon the ease and comfort and respectability which i might maintain even here ignorant as i am still i will go back for the sake of my brethren i go to suffer with them to toil with them to endure insult with them to lift up my voice in their behalf to speak and write in their vindication and struggle in their ranks for that emancipation which shall yet be achieved by the power of truth and of principle for that oppressed people so turning his back on ease comfort and respectability douglass returned to america for almost six years he had labored in the garrison vineyard now he stepped out on his own in he started publishing the north star in rochester new york from that year until the abolition of slavery he was in the forefront of the abolitionist ranks in an age of danger and doubt douglass and other black abolitionists came to grips with dilemmas which lie deep in the negros heart douglass asked the old and insistent question how can i sing the lords song in a strange land the answers revolved around the traditional trilogy ballots bullets or bibles and iagos injunction go make money the followers of william lloyd garrison condemned complexional institutions negro churches lodges schools newspapers and conventions the garrisonians also abandoned political action and advocated a campaign based on passive resistance and moral force after douglass favored ballots if possible and bullets if necessary he was an opportunist on the issue of complexional institutions he demanded complete integration but if circumstances made this impossible he unhesitatingly recommended special institutions at stake here was a bitter issue of power douglass was an independent man who felt uncomfortable in a subsidiary role he demanded a share in the generalship of the movement in a statement reminiscent of toussaint louverture he said no people that has solely depended on foreign aid or rather upon the efforts of those in any way identified with the oppressor to undo the heavy burdens ever stood forth in the attitude of freedom douglass believed that he and other black abolitionists could make a positive contribution by proving that negoes were active rather than passive cogs in the antislavery machinery he said that the man who has suffered the wrong is the man to demand redressthat the man struck is the man to cry outand that he who has endured the cruel pangs of slavery is the man to advocate liberty it is evident that we must be our own representatives and advocates not exclusively but peculiarlynot distinct from but in connection with our white friends douglass famous fourth of july speech is a good example of the passion and brilliance he brought to the antislavery cause speaking at rochester new york on july he indicated every structure of power in america what he asked to the american slave is your th of july i answer a day that reveals to him more than all other days in the year the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim to him your celebration is a sham your boasted liberty an unholy license your national greatness swelling vanity your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless your denunciation of tyrants brass fronted impudence your shouts of liberty and equality hollow mockery your prayers and hymns your sermons and thanksgivings with all your religious parade and solemnity are to him more bombast fraud deception impiety and hypocrisya thin veil to cover crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages you boast of your love of liberty douglass continued your superior civilization and your pure christianity you hurl anathemas at the crowned headed tyrants of russia and austria and pride yourselves on your democratic institutions while you yourselves consent to the mere tools and bodyguards of the tyrants of virginia and carolina you invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad honor them with banquets greet them with ovations cheer them toast them salute them protect them and pour out your money to them like water but the fugitives from your own land you advertise hunt arrest shoot and kill you glory in your refinement and your universal education yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nationa system begun in avarice supported in pride and perpetuated in cruelty you shed tears over fallen hungary and make the sad story of her wrongs the theme of your poets statesmen and orators till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against the oppressor but in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the american slave you would enforce the strictest silence and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse douglass dared to make the ten thousand wrongs the subject of public discourse week after week year after year in the crucial decades before the civil war he went up and down the north warning preaching pleading he and other negro abolitionists played a major role in shaping the crisis which led to the civil war during the civil war douglass prodded the famous slow coach at washington long before lincoln perceived it douglass was saying that the war was a struggle to give america a new birth of freedom long before lincoln saw it douglass was saying that the negro was inextricably involved in the root cause of the war and that the war could not be fought or ended without coming to grips with the meaning of the negro and the meaning of america after the emancipation proclamation was issued douglass turned his fertile mind to the problems of reconstruction he demanded ballots for the freedmen and land and said with impeccable logic that as one learns to swim by swimming the negro must learn how to vote by voting four things he said were necessary the right to the cartridge box the ballot box the jury boxand the knowledge box when the north reneged on its promise and turned the freedmen over to the tender mercies of their exmasters douglass was merciless in denunciation in he denounced the negros socalled emancipation as a stupendous fraud a fraud upon him a fraud upon the world america he said had abandoned the negro ignored his rights and left him a deserted a defrauded a swindled and an outcast manin law free in fact a slave in this period douglassdespite his denunciationbecame an elder statesman he was named marshall of the district of columbia and minister to haiti but he continued to press the claims of negroes he had one foot in the grave on the day a young negro student came to him and asked mr douglass what shall i do with my life the old warrior pulled himself up to his full height and his eyes blazed with the fury of his youth as he said agitate agitate agitate on a cold gray day in february the great agitator slumped to the floor in his mansion at anacostia heights washington d c and went to that peace promised all men the legislators of several northern states passed resolutions of regret and the legislature of north carolina adjourned for the day to mark the death of the greatest negro produced in this country at his funeral in washington john hutchinson sang the abolitionist song his brother jesse had dedicated to douglass vll be free ill be free and none shall confine with fetters and chains this spirit of mine from my youth have vowed in god to rely and despite the oppressor gain freedom or die a few days later the negroes of americus ga held a meeting and voted to contribute to a national fund to erect a monument in douglass honor no people these maids and laborers and cottonpickers said no people who can produce a douglass need despair what does douglass say to us today what can we find in his life to nerve us for the trials in this hour first of alland this is very importantdouglass was a man in the deepest and truest sense of that muchabused word today when there are so few menblack or whitewe need the nobility of his example douglass knewand we need that knowledge today that to be a man is to be precisely responsible he knew too that manhood is founded on selfrespect and selfesteem frederick douglass did not doubt himself nor did he apologize for his place of birth or the color of his mothers skin he reminds us at an hour when many need reminding that the man who knows who he is and where he is going can move mountainsand mississippi frederick douglass was a man and he was a sensitive man he did not isolate himself from the masses wherever he went the negro went with him he bitterly criticized free negroes and there were manywho were indifferent to the antislavery cause free negroes and slaves he said were chained together and would rise or fall together middleclass negroes who shun and despise lowerclass negroes today would do well to remember his words his mission he said was to stand up for the downtrodden to speak for the dumb and to remember those in bond as bound with me another quality in douglass life that speaks to us today is his commitment douglass was committed he acted wherever he was he sought out the struggle and involved himself in it and he was persistent life in this age was not easy for a white agitator it was impossible for a negro douglass was roughed up by proslavery thugs his right hand was broken he was thrown down steps but he took his knocks and stood his ground it was difficult in this age to find a hall that would let a negro abolitionist use its facilities in rochester new york once douglass took his stand under a tree and began addressing five people by the time he varmed up he had an audience of five hundred frederick douglass was persistent and he was catholic he was a universal man and he refused he said to allow himself to be insensible to the wrongs and sufferings of any part of the great family of man he fought for womens suffrage free speech poor barefoot ireland and the chinese and he opposed flogging in the navy monopolies and capital punishment i base no mans rights he said upon his color and plead no mans rights because of color my objection to slavery is not that it sinks a negro to the condition of a brute but that it sinks a man to that condition douglass realized however that individuality is universality he realized that a man is most human when he is most himself and he made no apologies for raising inconvenient questions when he was rich in honors and money he accepted an invitation to speak in ohio but he warned the sponsors that he did not intend to bite his tongue negroes he said still need the help of all who can say a word in their behalf if i come to you in july i shall bring the colored man with me finallyand this is most importantdouglass was militant he not only told the truth but he also lived it he refused to accept segregation and discrimination he assumed that every door open to a human being was open to him and if turned away he made an issue of it when asked to leave a jim crow car he would refuse to move the conductor usually called assistants who would drag douglass out of the car along with several seats he always managed to hold onto acceptance and transcendence growth and commitment universality and militancy these qualities in douglass life are relevant to our present situation they also explain why mary church terrell considered frederick douglass the greatest of all americansperiod and exclamation point today on the nd anniversary of the emancipation proclamation frederick douglass is central to the negros struggle for as robert hayden has said when it is finally ours this freedom this liberty this beautiful and terrible thing needful to man as air usable as earth when it belongs at last to our children when it is truly instinct brain matter diastole systole reflex action when it is finally won when it is more than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians this man this douglass this former slave this negro beaten to his knees exiled visioning a world where none is lonely none hunted alien this man superb in love and logic this man shall be remembered oh not with statues rhetoric not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone but with the lives grown out of his life the lives fleshing his dream of the beautiful needful thing romes negro emperor only negro ever to sit on the throne of the caesars that his brief reign was completely eclipsed by the infamy of both his predecessor and successor the ruler macrinus followed was caracalla an insane mass murderer under the delusion that he was alexander the great the bizarre creature who succeeded him was caracallas illegitimate son incredible heliogabalus an effeminate teenage boy given to practicing weird religious rites and wearing womens clothes for a clearer insight into the life and career of macrinus it would be useful to comment briefly on the times in which he lived in ad the year he came to power rome was in a state of decline able vigorous emperor septimius severus had died in ad and left his two sons caracalla and geta as coemperors but the following year caracalla treacherously murdered his brother and seized power for himself it was the beginning of a grisly reign of terror twenty thousand romans were butchered for the sole reason that the tyrant suspected them of having been friendly to his brother combining extravagance with cruelty caracalla stripped the treasury and levied heavy taxes to finance his wars of conquest ironically some historians have praised him for issuing the famed edict granting roman citizenship to all freeborn citizens of the empire but caracalla was not motivated by altruism roman citizens are liable for taxation and new sources of revenue were forever needed to feed the tyrants ambitions in the last years of his reign caracalla became completely deranged obsessed with the fantasy of being a second alexander he decided in to emulate his idol by conquering the persian empire he attacked the persians in the spring and by late fall had driven deep into the persian kings domains but he failed to win a decisive victory the persian army no match for caracallas legions waged a scorched earth and guerrilla warfare campaign and by the beginning of winter the romans were exhausted from pursuing a phantom enemy deciding to resume the offensive the following spring caracalla set up winter headquarters in the syrian city of edessa it was during this period of relative idleness that caracallas madness began to show signs of getting out of control always contemptuous of roman institutions he now surrounded himself with a picked bodyguard of the most ferocious barbarians in the empirewild men from the scythian steppes and scottish highlands who dressed in animal skins and painted themselves blue a savage himself caracalla far preferred their company to that of more civilized persons it was in early april of that caracalla made the insane remark that sealed his doom turning to one of his bodyguards he casually observed that rome was rotten to the core and their peoples would have no trouble taking the city any time they wanted to the silence that followed was a silence of death the lunatic words were heard not only by the barbarians but by four of the emperors top advisers these were admiral marcius agrippa two tribunes of the pretorian guard named apollinaris and nemesianus and the pretorian prefect himselfmarcus opellius macrinus as pretorian prefect macrinus was the second most powerful man in the empire and he now decided that rome could only survive by ridding itself of a destructive psychopath who had lost the last shred of his reason the man selected to assassinate caracalla was julius martialis a soldier who bore a grudge against the emperor for reneging on a promise to make him a centurion the murder took place on april while the emperor was on his way from edessa to nearby carrhae to worship at the temple of the local fertility goddess noticing that caracalla had dismounted to relieve himself martialis came up behind him and struck him with a small dagger the tyrant died instantly and his assassin outlived him by no more than minutes being despatched by a javelin hurled by one of the furclad scythians in the emperors bodyguard the next few hours were crucial for the plotters for all his cruelty and madness caracalla was tremendously popular with the barbarians who made up the bulk of his army pampered and ridiculously overpaid with funds looted from the people of rome they had never had it so good and determined to wreak bloody revenge for the loss of their murdered hero the situation forced macrinus to report to a desperate ruse martialisthe only man who could give him awaywas dead the barbarians had no indication of the extent of the plot so macrinus and his fellow conspirators quickly feigned grief and ordered caracalla buried with the highest honors taken in by the plotters show of mourning the soldiers held a meeting to select a new emperor the issue was never in doubt as pretorian prefect macrinus was now the most influential citizen in the empire the legions quickly acclaimed him and the senate on hearing of caracallas death lost no time in following suit on april of a d four days after the tyrants death an african negro became sole ruler of a domain that reached from the atlantic to the caspian and from scotland to the nile opellius macrinus was born in ad during the reign of marcus aurelius his birthplace was the city of caesaea in the roman province of morocco since moroccothen as now was a racially mixed area what historical evidence is there of macrinuss negro origin apart from the incontrovertible evidence of busts and bas reliefs attention should be called to the fact that historians of the roman era continually refer to the emperor as a moor today a moor is simply a citizen of morocco and the designation could include persons of widely differing ethnic back grounds such as browneyed oliveskinned arabs or blueeyed redhaired berber descendants of vandal invaders but to the ancientsand to writers and historians of a period reaching from antiquity to the th centurythe word has another connotation and was nothing more than an oldfashioned term for negro so it is safe to assume that when such ancient roman historians as dio cassius aurelius victor and the authors of the scriptores historiae augustae speak of macrinus as a moor they do so in the same sense as does shakespeare when he speaks of darkskinned othello as the moor of venice as macrinus was of humble origin little is known of his early life somehow he received an education as a lawyer in his native city and was apparently active in litigation involving estates since he first came to rome to take a position as estate agent for fulvius plautianus a powerful figure who served as pretorian prefect during the reign of septimius severus plautianuss career came to an unhappy end in ad when he was convicted of graft and put to death for a while it looked like macrinus would share his patrons fate but he was saved by the intervention of fabius cilo caracallas tutor who went to the emperor and assured him of macrinuss innocence severus a stern but fairminded man who detested orruption interrogated macrinus at length and was so favorably impressed with the african that he not only spared his life but gave him the post of traffic superintendent along the flaminian way under caracalla he held several appointments as procurator territorial governor and was finally promoted to the allpowerful position of pretorian prefect and it was this post that served macrinus as a springboard to sovereignty over all of rome macrinuss first task as emperor was to clean up the mess left by caracalla and in doing so he won nothing but praise his initial act was to release a number of men under sentence of death or serving terms of life imprisonment after being found guilty of impiety toward the dead tyrant in most of these cases the alleged impiety consisted of nothing more serious than making slighting remarks about caracallas vaingloriousness or delusion that he was a second alexander along with sparing the lives of these condemned men he restored their inheritances and estates which had been confiscated by the greedy tyrant macrinus also won favor by his modesty so much in contrast to his predecessors megalomania when a grateful senate voted to strike huge silver and gold images of the new emperor he declined the measure on grounds of economy and decreed that no silver image be made of him weighing over five pounds and no gold ones of over three pounds although caracallas memory was detested in rome the soldiers continued to revere him and macrinus did not yet feel safe to attack the fallen despot openly yet in subtle ways he began to downgrade him pleading reasons of economy he threw down a number of caracallas statutesparticularly those made of precious metalsand restored the gold and silver to the treasury then he admitted first privately and then publicly that the war against the persians had been caused by caracallas ambition and lust for glory this statement caused some grumbling in the ranks but his popularity in rome rose to new heights also to macrinuss credit was the tactful manner with which he disposed of a problem created by the presence of caracallas aged mother julia domna widow of the respected severus suspected macrinuss complicity in her sons death and rashly gave vent to her feelings abusing the new emperor in the bitterest terms but macrinus disdaining to take action against a now defenseless old woman sent her a kindly message of greeting and allowed her to keep all her wealth and estates julia domnas rashness was perhaps prompted by the fact that she knew she was dying anyway a sufferer from cancer of the breast she succumbed a few months later of all macrinuss actions there is probably none that won him more praise than his attitude toward the corps of professional informers that infested rome despising the unsavory breed he coldly refused to publish any of the incriminating documents they kept sending him or forward them to the senate for action the emperors enlightened and civilized spirit was also apparent when he was administering justice to persons accused of serious crimes three senatorsmanilius julius and amenianushad been found guilty of causing the death of a provincial lieutenant governor through giving false testimony but macrinus instead of putting them to death merely banished them to islands he explained his refusal to execute the guilty men on grounds that we should be found doing ourselves the very things of which we accuse them as a civil administrator macrinus was an outstanding success unfortunately his success did not extend to the military sphere shortly after coming to power macrinus as an essential measure cut the soldiers pay back to levels that had been established by severus caracallas reckless extravagance had almost ruined romes economy and macrinuss action was not only statesmanlike and courageous but absolutely necessary but the barbarian soldiers knowing nothing of economics raged against the pay cut and in some garrisons there was open talk of revolt this unhappy situation played into the hands of a dangerous enemyartabanus king of the persians resentful of caracallas aggressions artabanus in the fall of attacked the demoralized romans near the mesopotamian village of nisibis and inflicted a decisive defeat on them with this victory the persians regained much of the territory lost to caracalla and morale in the legions sank to an alltime low low army morale caused by the pay cut and the defeat at nisibis paved the way for events that led to macrinuss downfall the rebellion against the emperor broke out on may th of ad at emesa caracallas former winter headquarters leading the uprising was an unlikely quartet composed of three women and a yearold boy the women were maesa julia domnas sister mamaea and soaemis her two daughters and youthful heliogabalus soaemiss illegitimate son by caracalla soaemis was married at the time of her sons birth to an elderly priest named varius avitus but there was no secret about the boys paternity for one thing avitus died of old age shortly after the boy was born second soaemis and caracalla were known to have been lovers and third there was an astounding physical resemblance between caracalla and heliogabalus in a clever propaganda move the women stirred the emesa garrison to revolt by parading heliogabalus up and down the city walls and then exhibiting likenesses of caracalla to accentuate the resemblance between father and son the barbarian soldiers seeing a nearreincarnation of the tyrant they adored eagerly raised the standard of revolt and declared heliogabalus emperor when macrinus heard of the rebellion he ordered julianus a trusted local commander to suppress it but his troops who had been promised lavish pay increases by the rebels mutinied and put julianus to death a similar fate overtook basilanus the governor of egypt who was known to be loyal to macrinus the revolt was spreading and macrinus who was as popular in rome as he was unpopular with the pampered barbarians who had served with caracalla appealed to the senate for support the senate promptly responded and fresh troop levies were sent to the emperors headquarters at antioch on june of ad the two armies clashed near a small village some miles from antioch in a battle that was to decide the fate of an empire unfortunately for the people of rome macrinuss hastilyrecruited conscripts were no match for the seasoned veterans who were fighting not for a cause or ideal but for the return of their privileges overwhelmingly defeated macrinus barely managed to escape the battlefield with his life yet he refused to give up hope shaving his beard and disguising himself as a common citizen the emperor made his way from antioch to the city of chalcedon on the bosphorus site of modern istanbul it was macrinuss intention to return to rome rally the senate and people and organize resistance against the rebels with the capital as his base but this was not to be the emperor was arrested in chalcedon by aurelius celsus a prorebel centurion taken inland to the province of cappadocia and slain by another centurion named marcianus taurus diadumenianus the emperors yearold grandson was also put to death at the time of his murder macrinus had ruled exactly months on hearing of the emperors fate the senate bowed to the inevitable and recognized heliogabalus as emperor in the four years that followed rome sank to its lowest ebb as the office once held by augustus trajan and marcus aurelius was occupied by a simpering teenager who worshipped outlandish gods wore womens clothes and openly consorted with male lovers had macrinus lived in the heyday of romes greatness he might wellwith his brilliant mind and enlightened spirithave gone down in history as one of the great caesars instead it was the misfortune of this littleknown african to live in a period of decay and to have his reign sandwiched in between those of two of the most loathsome tyrants in history by the third century ad the cancer that killed rome had taken root too deeply and macrinus cannot be blamed for failing singlehandedly to arrest the decline of an empire the contribution to history of romes negro emperor is that he was able during his month reign to bring a brief interregnum of tolerance and sanity to a civilization headed pell mell for suicide as the white man tells the time it was about three oclock in the afternoon and as he kept count of the rising and setting of the sun it was the th day of june many long knife pony soldiers had ridden up the narrow valley from the south and only a quick amassing of his warriors and their brave deeds had kept the soldiers out of the village the hunkpapa sioux leaders medicine had been good sitting bull had watched while the young men faced the skirmish line across the valley with pride in their valor he watched the white soldiers break their formation and retreat to the apparent safety of the trees along the river under the onslaught of the combined sioux and cheyenne defenders the great sioux was surprised when the soldiers fled this position and hotly pursued by the warriors rode wildly back towards the south the fighting was nearly a mile away now and some of the squaws and other noncombatant indians had ventured from the village in search of loot or perhaps a soldier gun left behind by the fleeing troopers keeping close to the cottonwoods on the west bank of the little big horn sitting bull rode towards the place where the fighting had been the heaviest others from the village were ahead of him he observed several women and two old men who were busily stripping the clothing from a soldier who had died there as he watched he was brought quickly to attention by a womans startled cry that rose from a spot at the timbers edge about yards ahead the alarm brought sitting bull at a brisk trot come quickly a wasicun sapa he is still alive the hunkpapa leader dismounted and strode quickly to the scene wasicun sapa was the sioux term for black white man and sitting bull discovered that the object of the squaws wrath and attention was indeed a black white man and the only negro he had ever known the man known to the sioux as azimpi was barely alive he had been struck in the back just below the right shoulder by a rifle ball and upon emerging the bullet had torn a gaping wound in his chest the front of his buckskin shirt was soaked with blood one of his boots was missing and sitting bull could see additional wounds in his leg and foot the great hunkpapa medicine man knelt beside the dying negro and as their eyes met they conversed briefly in the sioux dialect with a quick motion of his arm sitting bull dispatched one of the women to the river for water she returned with a dripping shawl the famous sioux squeezed water from the cloth into a polished buffalo horn cup that he carried at his belt and placed the cup at the lips of the dying man azimpi drank briefly smiled painfully at sitting bull and slumped over dead sitting bull explained tersely to the bystanders he was once one of us i knew him as a good man his woman is a sioux and she will mourn as will the women in our camp tonight there was no more to be said sitting bull remounted and rode back towards the village when he had departed the sioux women quickly stripped the buckskin clothing from the negros body and one of the old men carried away a wide brimmed white straw hat the depredation ended here apparently out of respect of sitting bulls friendly gesture to the dying man they refrained from mutilating his remains and vented their fury by hacking up all of the other bodies found nearby the above order one of many issued by general george armstrong custer in preparation for his campaign against the hostile in dians in was a prelude to the final adventure in the life of isaiah dorman passed over by historians and nearly obscured by the deeds of more flamboyant characters who helped to shape the west dorman stands distinguished as a member of his race who gave his life in service to his country during this hectic post civil war period little is known of his origin there are no known photographs of him it is said that he was known to many roving bands of sioux as early as tribal history indicates that a large black white man was well known and well received in their villages this is borne out by the fact that dorman was known to the indians as azimpi or teat in the guttural sioux tongue the word azimpi meaning teat or nipple sounded much like isaiah traveling with a horse and a pack mule the good natured negro roamed unmolested in the land of the sioux his freedom was his prized possession and he sustained himself by small scale trading and trapping early in dorman perhaps weary of the roving life or possibly not wanting to be caught up in the seething turmoil that was brewing between red cloud and the whites along the bozeman road ventured into the minnesota country here he took as a wife a young santee woman of inkpadutas band later that year he presented himself and sought employment at fort rice near the present day bismarck in the dakotas with his wife he dwelled in a small cabin at the fort he became known to the officers at the fort as a jovial and easy going individual and completely courageous and trustworthy dorman had supported himself by working as a woodcutter for the post trader but when the post commander and quartermaster learned of his knowledge of the territory and his ability to travel among the indians he was slated for better things on november he was hired by lieut j m marshall to serve as a mail carrier between fort rice and fort wadsworth he made the mile round trip only once that year but was to make it and others many more times during the years isaiah also supplemented his income by cutting wood for the trading firm of durfee peck and for major charles e galpin at the standing rock agency on september he was hired by capt henry inman to serve as a guide in the field for the military escort that accompanied the northern pacific railroad engineers in a survey that year he received per month for this employment a handsome sum in this era upon completion of this duty and by order and authorization of the commanding general of the department by special order dorman was hired as post interpreter at fort rice at the rate of per month he received this salary until february when an overall cutback and reduction in budget caused all civilian employees of the military to be reduced in pay from that time isaiah received but per month he still supplemented his income by cutting wood for the durfee peck branch at fort rice due to his size and rugged strength it was said that old teat could cut a cord of wood faster than his helper could stack it it is interesting to note that dorman was a parttime employee of durfee peck this firm operated by e h hicks durfee and campbell k peck with headquarters at leavenworth kansas enjoyed what was practically a monopoly on the indian and military trade in north dakota south dakota and montana during the years under contract they supplied cattle hay lumber and wood to both the military installations and indian agencies bonded to the government in the amount of each year their bond was not accepted in and they were out of business it was not a failure of the firm to fulfill its obligations to the interior department but its failure to play ball with the corrupt grant administration particularly the presidents younger brother orvil who was pocketbook deep in attempting to grab a share of all of the trading post business in the territories general custer was fully aware of the graft and the grant dealings on the frontier and made it known very publicly that goods earmarked for distribution to the reservation indians in keeping with treaty agreements were finding their way into private markets the result he alleged was that the deprived indians were starving and becoming hostile and in turn fleeing the reservations his allegations were no doubt true however the flamboyant general failed to take them through channels and instead published them through one of his many magazine articles this resulted in custer being hailed before an investigating committee headed by chairman heister clymer custer spoke his piece grants wrath fell directly on his long blonde curls this was on march just five days earlier campbell k peck had testified in regard to the same graft that had put him out of business durfee peck was defunct custer was relieved and faced suspension the trading firm never recovered and it was only through the intervention of general alfred h terry who always appeared to be in everyones good graces that custer was restored to duty and allowed to lead his command on the expedition acres of words have been written about custers march into the valley of the little big horn and of the fate that awaited him there it is known that in addition to the enemy that he faced there were those who followed him who were twice as treacherous his civilian scouts and both interpreters isaiah dorman and fred girard were of his own selection following the issuance of special order isaiah dorman was hired officially by lieut harry j nowlan who at the time was regimental quartermaster of the seventh cavalry his pay of per month started on may isaiah was about years old at that time to him the expedition was not one of war against the sioux but a chance to again see the west especially the land of the absoraka or crow this to him was a vacation from his long confining duties at the fort at about noon on june and shortly after leaving the crows nest on the divide between the rosebud and the little big horn custer divided his command shortly thereafter custer and the troopers in his battalion rode into historic oblivion for some reason both interpreters dorman and girard were assigned to the reno colunm with orders to charge the indian encampment from the south acting under orders issued previously the interpreters stayed close to their commander to be near at hand if they were needed acting under the same orders were the leading scouts both white and indian the adjutant and the trumpeter they all made up a mounted mobile command post this was fine on the charge up the narrow valley and when major marcus a reno formed his command in a skirmish line across that valley at the time they was in close proximity to the great indian camp but when reno was pressed by the hostiles or thought he was being pressed and ordered a retreat to the timber along the west side of the little horn this closely grouped entourage presented an excellent target for the multiplying hostiles their fire was concentrated here chief white scout charlie reynolds was killed a well placed hostile bullet splattered the brains of custers favorite indian scout bloody knife in major renos face two enlisted men were killed instantly adjutant lieut benny hodgson was wounded a later wound was fatal and isaiah received his mortal wound reno hit the panic button and after shouting several confused commands fled back up the valley with the remnants of his command at his heels this wild flight that was later deemed by major reno as a retreat to a more strategic position resulted in dorman and other wounded being left to the mercies of the hostiles thanks to recognition by sitting bull dorman probably fared better than the others prior to the famous cheyenne warrior wooden leg related to his friend and biographer dr thomas b marquis that he had viewed the body of isaiah dorman at it lay in death wooden leg stated that all of dormans cloth ing had been taken but that his body was otherwise unmolested he had not been scalped or cut up like the others who fell nearby this was on june or in the morning of the day following his death there is no reason to doubt wooden legs story as all of his stories of the battle have been proven fairly accurate it is true that when troopers under the command of generals terry and gibbon came to the relief of major reno one day later the scene had changed at this time it was discovered that dormans body was considerably mutiliated this depredation was probably the parting act of an uninformed squaw or of some cheyenne who was not familiar with dorman no marker has ever been erected over dormans grave he was probably buried at the spot where he fell at the time of his death there was due to dorman for his services rendered to the expedition after a lengthy search it is my opinion that this debt was never paid it would have been indeed ironic if it had been allotted to dormans sioux wife it is also ironic that the only reference to dormans color was made by major reno in his report of the battle reno perhaps out of ignorance when penning his report did omit isaiahs last name the entry is followed by the words o a great many americans white ones in particularit seems that the negro has only of late seen fit to protest his position of inferiority in america he has shed himself of submission and taken to militant protestation however the fact of the whole business is that the negro has always in one way or another protested his unequal treatment in america protest is not something that is a unique product of the present active generation of american negroes it is true however that protest by negroes has never achieved the magnitude of the present effort but it is nevertheless important that the present activity be seen as not unique it is important for at least three reasons the present activity can be better understood in terms of a historical perspective on protest confusion and in some cases resentment of the white community can be at least tempered by its elucidation and the negro himself it seems to me may be better equipped to carry on the fight with the knowledge of its existence the rather general belief that the negro passively accepted his position as slave and later as second class citizen is hardly the case lets for a few minutes take a brief look at protest throughout the history of the negro in america probably the earliest vestiges of protest can be seen in the resistance of the negroes to becoming slaves many rather than become slaves according to john hope franklin in his book from slavery to freedonri took their own lives mothers for example are reported to have killed both themselves and their children others refused to eat and starved rather than become slaves this of course was not the case with most but even after becoming slaves many fought running and harassing battles with the slavemaster bloody battles were fought between the negro slave and the white master insurrections were perceived by whites as a constant threat in the south especially where the slave population was close to or greater than the white population franklin reports many slaves ran away indeed this practice was so widespread that both federal and state legislation was enacted to aid their recovery fleeing says franklin was one of the most successful forms of resistance the slaves devised another form of resistance probably the most dramatic was found in the slave insurrections revolts and conspiracies to revolt began with slavery and persisted until slavery was abolished the last being reported in in henrico county virginia under the leadership of gabriel prosser and jack bowler more than a thousand slaves conspired to revolt they were however exposed by one of their members denmark vesey a slave who purchased his freedom in led probably the most dramatic of all slave conspiracies over a period of several years he prepared for the revolt gathering weapons and men his movement was aborted by an informant and many of his men were killed the estimates of the number of negroes involved ran as high as in south hampton virginia the insurrection of nat turner led to the death of more than white families in less than hours and a pitched battle with state and federal troops in which more than slaves were killed in the operations of the maroons a group of runaway slaves fighting a guerrillatype war with whites terrorized an entire area these groups were a constant source of harassment to the white community and served to lure many slaves to their ranks resistance also took the form of work stoppage and subversion such as destroying crops property and animals the impression of the slave conveyed by such vehicles as the stephen foster musical commentary was far from descriptive of all slaves historians of the negro have carefully documented the slaves resistance to his status of course many negroes fought in the civil war slaves ran away from the plantation to join the union forces more than negroes had enrolled in the union army by the end of the war they saw action in every theatre of operation during the civil war the operation of the underground railroad and the tremendous role of figures such as sojourner truth and harriet tubman are further testimony to the degree to which the negro resisted and protested his station in america so effective was miss tubmans efforts that a reward of pounds was offered for her head in maryland negro protest did not abate substantially with emancipation with the passage of the jim crow laws in the late s the plight of the negro especially in the south became almost intolerable race riots in both the north and the south occurred during this time the voices of men like frederick douglass were constantly raised in opposition to the treatment of the negro the great migration of negroes from the south is likewise indirect testimony to his protest the character of negro protest took on different dimensions in the th century very early it assumed two divergent directions harold w cruse has stated that negro protest since emancipation has been split with one group directed toward integration and the other antiintegration from this point of view one can construe the booker t washington movement as at least initially antiintegrationist it is important to note that the washington movement although at its inception called for separation had as its ultimate goal the inclusion of negroes into the mainstream of american life washington felt that negroes through uplifting themselves could assume a position of such great value in american society that the problem of civil_rights would correct itself hence he advised brains property and character for the negro will settle the question of civil_rights the best course to pursue in regard to a civil_rights bill in the south is to let it alone let it alone and it will settle itself washington was scathingly criticized by that wing of protest ideology which held that the immediate granting of civil_rights was the only way to realize equality this group was led by w e b du bois who claimed the negro could never improve his position gain political and social equality without fullscale civil_rights immediately for years washington and du bois were engaged in controversy one of the most dramatic in american history now the essential character of this debate centered around the manner in which the negro was to ultimately achieve if at all full participation in the mainstream of american life both of the protagonists were protesting the negros position but they disagreed as to the nature of strategies and tactics to be utilized contrary to popular belief the washington movement was in a broad sense a protest movement du bois very early in the s issued a call for negroes to ban together and present their demands for freedom behind a united front in his statement du bois said the time seems more than ripe for organized determined and aggressive action on the parts of men who believe in negro freedom du bois and other prominent negro men met the following summer and formed an organization known as the niagara movement du bois speaking for the movement articulated its aims we claim the right of free men to walk talk and be with them that wish to be with us we want the constitution of the country enforced we want our children educated between and race riots of extreme violence occurred arousing concern in the entire population three people mary w ovington william e walling and henry moskovitz organized a conference on democracy and the negro the conference took place may out of this conference to which booker t washington was not invited grew the national association for the advancement of colored people many of the members of the niagara movement joined the naacp others declined to join because they felt the organization was not bold enough in program the naacp ultimately grew it is commonly known to a position of top leadership in the negro fight for civil_rights it has however of late been seriously challenged on several fronts for its leadership position the parallel development of the national urban league greatly enhanced the negros struggle for economic advancement especially in the urban areas late in the second decade of the s there arose a movement of such great magnitude that it has never been rivaled in size by any other effort since the universal negro improvement association under the leadership of marcus a garvey became the rallying point for millions of negroes garveys plan was to establish in africa a state to which all american negroes could migrate he felt the negro would never achieve equality in white america and should cease trying and direct his efforts toward establishing an autonomous state in his fatherland garvey lauded everything black and preached a gospel of fierce race pride he captured the imagination and support of millions of negroes and everywhere his name was a household word garveys program was opposed by the naacp and a running battle ensued ultimately ending in the naacps petition to the justice department that brought about garveys conviction in a federal court imprisonment and later deportation garveys strident militancy was a legacy inherited by the black muslims who likewise advocate separation of negroes from white america unlike garvey however the muslims lay claim to territory in america the religious superstructure of the muslims is a characteristic somewhat different from the garvey movement there is little doubt that the present activity in the negro community is a result to a large extent of the success of the naacp and similar protest groups the supreme court decision of may reversing the separate but equal doctrine contributed directly to the development of a more militant character of negro protest the story of developments such as tent city the tuskegee gerrymander the little rock school integration birmingham montgomery albany and others are so recent and widely publicized as to need little comment the same is true of organizations such as the student nonviolent coordinating committee the southern christian leadership conference congress on racial equality and others nor is it necessary to elaborate on such people as martin_luther_king ralph abernathy chevine king and others their stories are a part of the experience of most americans i should however say something about a different kind of protest as exemplified by robert f williams in union county north carolina robert f williams for sometime maintained a standing army in this county by army mean a fully armed detachment of men he fought armed skirmishes with the ku klux klan and state officers the last of which forced him to seek sanctuary in havana cuba williams feels that a militant stand and the willingness to fight will hasten final positive results for the negro negro protest has not been relegated solely to an area of action on the part of organized groups one can see it in the writings of many negro novelists richard wrights books especially the long dream the outsider and black boy smack sharply of protest ralph ellisons the invisible man is a classic work of protest in my own evaluation of course these writers do not exhaust the list of protest writers on the current scene james baldwins prolific pen has raised him to prominence in this vein his recent book the fire next time should be read by everyone interested in this problem in another vein poets have long cried out in protest of the condition of the negro one finds the entire panorama of protest illustrated by the writings of negro poets paul lawrence dunbar for example wrote i know how the caged bird feels in his poem sympathy or a crust of bread a corner to sleep in a minute to laugh and an hour to weep in ie langston hughes writes beautiful is the night and beautiful are the stars and beautiful are the eyes of my people james weldon johnsons poem now known as the negro national anthem typified another kind of protest on a more vociferous level claude mckay wrote if we must die let it not be like hogs hunted and penned in some inglorious spot while all around us bark the mad and hungry dogs making a mockery of our accursed lot if we must die let us nobly die and for their thousand blows strike one deathblow in a different light the development of jazz represents an aspect of negro protest more recently the development of funky jazz is a reaction on the part of negro musicians in all the history of the negro throughout his stay in america is replete with instances of his protestations they have as has been indicated been sometimes loud sometimes subtle sometimes strained and sometimes clear at imes gentle and at other times violent at times legal and other times illegal but they have been and continue increasingly to be in existence inasmuch as protest is in existence today i feel that i should address myself to the character of the present activity let me first address myself to the organizations presently working to secure civil_rights specifically the naacp it is my acceptance that for sometime now the naacp especially the chapters in the north has been complacent the rather dramatic successes of the legal arm of the movement it seems has lulled the general membership into an erroneous sense of wellbeing in addition the naacp has tended to become a classrelated organization by this i mean that the victories achieved through its operation have for the most part made very little if any difference in the life of the great mass of negroes at the bottom of the social class ladder their efforts have been most beneficial to the middle and upper class negroes additionally the leadership of the naacp has been drawn from the ranks of the middle classes and their program of reform has articulated the needs and desires of the negro oriented to white middle class values it is it seems to me the lower class negro who bears the brunt of the differential race treatment he is the one who is the victim of police brutality of the ghetto mentality of discrimination prejudice and in many cases a victim of the prejudice of middle class negroes now the great breach between the general negro population and the naacp was no more dramatically displayed than in the rapid spread of the sitin movement these movements occurred without the sanction of the na acp although the naacp legal department later extended its support as a matter of fact the sitin demonstrators in nashville were advised against this kind of activity by the naacp early in the confederate authorities organized a brigade of free negroes called the louisiana native guard colored to supplement the small number of militiamen who were the only force available for the defense of new orleans against an impending attack by a union fleet commanded by captain david g farragut and a union army under major general benjamin f butler nominally the native guard comprised only volunteers actually most of its members were virtually drafted when the confederate troops evacuated new orleans just before the city was occupied by general butlers army of the gulf these reluctant volunteers allowed themselves to be cut off by the union forces to which they quietly and gladly surrendered during the summer of butler became aware that the confederates were hopefully planning a counterattack upon new orleans since he had only about effective troops he rightly feared what might happen particularly if the confederates could secure the help of an ironclad ram capable of clearing the mississippi river of the union navys few gunboats when butler found that he could not hope to obtain any reinforcements from the north he decided as he put it upon africa for assistto call ance with learned former this purpose in view he the names of some officers of the louisiana native guard and invited them to meet him at his headquarters these men were asked if they would be willing to serve in the army of the gulf and if they could induce other negroes to do the same all of them answered yes to both questions fourteen days later on august a regiment of a thousand men was organized within a couple of months two more regiments of infantry and two batteries of artillery had been enrolled according to joseph t wilson a member of the louisiana native guard and author of the black phalanx half a dozen regiments could have been formed in the same time if arms and equipment had been available for them the officers of the original or confederate native guard had been negroes up to and including the rank of captain the field officers of the first regiment organized by general butler were white men the colonel and lieutenant colonel of the second regiment were white the other officers were negroes both negroes and whites were chosen on the basis of ability alone as officers of the third regiment the two batteries had to be officered by white men because at this time no negroes had had any experience as artillerymen at first the existence of butlers native guard regiments was not officially recognized by the federal government but they were in fact the first negro regiments to serve in the union army during the civil war if general butlers orders probably issued with his tongue in his cheek had been strictly followed only free negroes would have been enlisted in the louisiana native guard which was unofficially known as the free colored brigade however nobody inquired too deeply about the background of a promising looking recruit and many selfemancipated slaves joined it butlers example of informally enlisting negro troops was again to cite wilsons the black phalanx followed very soon by every officer in command and by the time the presidents emancipation proclamation was issued there were not less than negroes armed and equipped along the mississippi where in the course of time they often fought against their former masters when robert frost was on his tour of russia after an exhausting visit to a russian school he came back to the reserved section of his hotel dining room catching sight of a table of arabians and a table of chinese he turned around and went back to his room and ate there thats a bad prejudice of mine isnt it he said this incident reported by franklin d reeve in robert frost in russia reveals an aspect of frostwhich is different from the public image of the genial philosophical sage of american poetry frosts letters in the recent books the letters of robert frost to louis untermeyer and selected letters of robert frost also give views of a different facet of his personality some of the letters reveal the frost familiar to the public he talks brilliantly of poetry he shows a delight in words characteristic of a poet the letters are full of puns and plays on words the letters also disclose what is not so well known to the public and round out and humanize the picture of the man there was tragedy in his family life he was often melancholy and without confidence in his poetry he was suspicious jealous of his fame and shrewd in furthering his poetic career one of his plays on words was on the name of the negro poet and critic william stanley braithwaite he wrote im not very angry with you for what you did to breathweight only i wonder if hes worth your pains perhaps he is we were taught that we must try not to look down on anyone the man whom he called breathweight was influential in the renaissance of american poetry in the early decades of the s as poetry critic of the boston transcript he helped to bring the new poetry to the attention of the public by weekly articles by fullscale book reviews and by an annual summing up of the years work in the field with his anthology of magazine verse for he was the first to publish a yearly anthology of verse in the united states the series continued until with a final volume for containing the best poems of that year and a selection of the best poems in the seventeen previous volumes this series helped the reputations of poets and increased the reading of poetry many poets and poems that later became famous were chosen and poets were proud and excited to be included braithwaite also suggested to publishers the idea of yearly anthologies of short stories and of plays two series which are still in existence today claude mckay quotes a negro historian on braithwaite the most remarkable writer of negro blood since dunbar is william stanley braithwaite who as a writer is not a negro mr braithwaite has by his literary production and criticism his poems his annual publication the anthology of magazine verse demonstrated that the negro intellect is capable of the same achievements as that of the whites when claude mckay was coming into notice he sent some poems to braithwaite who wrote to him that his poems were good but that except for two of them any reader could tell that the author was a negro he advised mckay because of the overwhelming prejudice against anything negro to write and send to the magazine only such poems as did not reveal his race mckay did not take braithwaites advice his own expression was too subjective and personal for him to write without conviction and anyone who read him could tell that he came from a tropical country and was black in her memoirs golden friends i had poet margaret widdemer tells of a party given in honor of braithwaite notable poets and literary persons were there but no negroes she says that she felt too much effusion in the praises given him a sense of strain because of his color it was in the period of braithwaites achievement and influence that frost first met him he called on the critic in boston in his correspondence he shrewdly fed braithwaite facts about himself which could be used in an article later he invited braithwaite to visit him would you come up about now dont you think we could kill a week walking and talking in braithwaite selected some of frosts poems for his anthology frost wrote i shall be honored if you will use the poems in your book honored enough if you will use two honored beyond dreams if you will use three braithwaite used birches and the road not taken frost wrote about the book i havent read braithwaites g d booki got one of the children to read it for me and tell me about it all that saved the fat obstacle from the worst fate that overtakes paper was your name and mine on the flyleaf in a letter written as if coming from someone else to himself frost said love is a kickshaw and dalliance naught but give you a field like poetry that calls to the pulling of wires and the manipulation of ropes to the climbing of every black reviewers back stairs for preferment and you frost are there with a suitcase in both hands thus in spite of braithwaites fostering of american poetry his promotion of frost and his determination to avoid anything that smacks of negro he is referred to as polluting the letter so that frost breaks off and starts over on a fresh sheet young negro writers who are pondering the question of identity can learn from braithwaites experience hie hated the tourists h and times like now out hoeing the corn that would have to see him and suellen and the kids through the winter sourness would rise up in his stomach at sight of the big outof state cars slowing down so that the smooth faces with bright and eager eyes could seecould look their fill arel english walking in the dust scrabbling in a rocky field a man with shuffling step with dull eyes knowing these things to be so knowing them to be eternally so arel english forever doomed to scrabble in a rocky field hoeing corn plodding along in the dust yet must somehow find a standard of comparison so he too in his own mind could feel superior and it was times like now with the big cars whizzing down the dirt road that he was apt to lay down his hoe seized with the sudden notion to go down to little jims cabin and sit a spell the same cabin where he had sat for as many years as he could remember back and where his pappy had set for as many years before though the cabin did not then belong to little jim but to his pappy big jim best friend ive got his own pappy used to say sitting on the wide board porch in the est rocker brought out from tk dark interior of the cabin for the occasion best friend ive got aint that right big jim and big jim sitting solid on the top step would wipe at his black face with a bandana reckon as how thats so mr english reckon as how thats so those were the good days with the dust soft underfoot and the skin of his own hands so pale against that of little jims as they tussled like puppies in the field those were the days with little jims mammy stepping out onto the porch now and again to call out mind yourself now little jim and dont get rough then would come the glasses of lemonade and the cake or the cookies or even the pieces of fried chicken with himself and his pappy eating on the porch without ever crossing the sill because even a puppysize boy knew better than that knew it without asking with a bom understanding that it was one thing to sit on a niggers porch and another to step into his house like the way you didnt wonder why big jim and little jim and his mammy sat back while you were eating and drinking waiting until you were walking the dusty road back home before they took their fill of course now a man grown walking that same hot road to that same cabin painted now with curtains at the window and a plot of grass where once was a broomswept yard but still for all of that a niggers shack now you understood what you once simply knew you understood that the lord had made things to be as they were he had made those that were to ride in the big cars and those that were to walk in the dust and he had made those that were to sit back while a white man ate and drank as he walked the stones of the road burned through the soles of his shoes and the folds of his shirt clung wetly to his back a shirt wet thus dried and wet again so that now the smell of old sweat was strong and rank arel english walking in the sun a man with burning jeet and sweaty shirt a man with rock hard years behind and rock hard years ahead a man who would never have enough of clean shirts or ride in a big sleek car walking thus he suddenly threw back his shoulders and quickened his heavy step ahead around the next bend was the familiar end of his journey that cabin painted now but for afl of that a niggers cabin just nothing but a black niggers cabin and all the paint in the world couldnt do nothing to change that by god within sight of the cabin he slowed his pace walking leisurely chewing a stalk of grass stripped from a clump alongside the road he could see little jims kids most grown now like his own playing baseball in the stubble field alongside the shack and he thought of the bright summers when he and little jim played thus and of the day when little jims mammy called out sharply little jim it aint fitting you should call a young white gentleman arel remember now and dont you forget its mr english i want to be hearing you say he did of course forget that is but not often and soon it was like it had always been little jim and mr english he wondered if that time had come for his own and little jims young ones but he likely wouldnt know unless by chance because while he had loved more than anything on earth to tag his own daddy to the cabin of big jim his own boys could not be driven to come along with him why would we want to do a crazy thing like going down to that niggers shack with you and because he couldnt rightly say never having wanted to ask such a question of his pappy he let it pass quelling the vague unease that this abandonment of the old ways brought about by telling himself that there was no figuring a young one and no need to try he walked now down the narrow lane to the cabin and up onto the smooth worn boards of the porch little jim he shouted im here from inside the cabin the quick light steps of little jims wife and the door flung wide he isnt here jims gone he pulled up the wicker porch rocker and lowered his bones into its familiar curves ill just sit and wait a spell ella mae he cant stay away forever without he has a bite to eat and its getting on now to that time of day ella mae looked at him she looked him right in the eye i dont know when jim will be back maybe not all night or all the next day or even the day after that bees droned above the climbing rose trellised between the supporting posts of the porch it was the same summer sound that hed heard for as many years as he could remember back but today puzzling on the never before boldness of that eyetoeye look the lazy summer hum in the roses took on a different sound a lonely sound like the loneliness of thinking about things that had once been but could never be again things like the way watermelon tasted when you were a kid things like the cool scrunch of grass between your toes when you would tumble out of bed and step into a sunshine world that was all your own standing there then listening to the old familiar sounds he pushed back the lonesomeness with the hard common sense he always took pride upon he pulled himself up out of the chair and spoke kindly to ella mae well ellamae i reckon youll be wearing out the bend in the road watching for little jim to be coming round it which brings to mind you didnt say where it was that little jims gone to she tossed her shining black head i didnt say but i dont at all mind doing so jim is taking part in a sitin over at trentonville this time there was no fancying no mistaking plain nigger uppitiness he wanted to smash to pound to grind the grinning face into the boards of the porch it was only the immense sadness that such a thing as this could ever come to pass that kept him standing there bound yet to the past by a chain he could not break the door slammed shut and he was alone arel english a man with burning feet and sweaty shirt in his ears the lonely drone of bees only sound now left o f summers past slowly he turned slowly he walked back down the lane back down the road stepping to one side as the big out of state cars slowed up to look with bright and eager eyes then speeded on their way once more like an animal he walked head low suffering dumbly nowhere in his mind the words to explain this thing that had come about hed heard talk of course down at the store or when hed meet up with one of the neighbors down the road and on the radio too times the battery had a new charging but such talk belonged to places far away such a thing as piney creek niggers in a sitin was so far beyond the reach of common sense that he hadnt paid it no real mind at all now and as soon as this was clear in his mind he walked with lifted head and quickened step now it was once more like in the days of his greatgrandpappy when a man must fight for the ways that was rightly his he crossed the stoop of his house and walked into the kitchen suellen was there and a couple of the girls whining words at him as he passed but he paid them no more mind than he did the flies that buzzed round his head in the thick and sticky heat he crossed to the far end of the room where by the fireplace hung his squirrel rifle oiled polished deadly it fit into his arm as neatly was as much a part of him as the muscles that covered his bones walking back through the kitchen and onto the narrow path leading to the big road he gave brief thought to the fact that never had he managed to own a whole runnable car a motor with no axles to fit a body with some vital inward worn past repair but never a car that could carry a man to where little jim was at a sitin over to trentonville but the lord gave man feet to walk upon and unfalteringly he turned his in the way that they must travel the walk to trentonville was long and though his mind was working now as clean and neat as the trigger on his gun he was standing at last on the crowded corner by the trentonville courthouse at a loss as to where to turn not knowing behind which of the brick and concrete walls little jim might be concealed then from among the strollers on the far side of the street the couples young and old walking slowly looking into the lighted windows of the closed down stores from among these men and these women he picked out the neat blue uniform of a city police a police who should know where this sitin was a police who by god instead of mincing along the walk like a dandy at a wedding should with drawn gun be seeking out the enemy preserving the order that the lord meant to be on an earth where he put the birds and the beasts and the blacks and the whites and those meant to ride and those meant to swallow the dust of those behind the wheel a policeman prancing in glittering shoes and sharp pressed pants while niggers turned the world topsideto and black wenches slammed doors in the faces of their betters a fool this police but surely with the sense to turn a man in the direction he must go he crossed the street he opened his mouth to speak the opening coming ahead of the choosing of just the right words so that he was standing there so still silent when the city police spoke to him reaching out at the same time to touch the coldly shining barrel of the gun dont you hillbillies know better than to go parading the streets with a rifle in your hands arel english white male who by god put on his pants one leg at a time the same as any other man standing now on this corner knowing that for all of these things he is still as the lord made him to be a walker in the dust a man who will now shuffle his feet look down at the concrete and whine i dont aim to cause no trouble a cunning man a man who knows it was the lords own hand that stayed him from blurting out the true purpose of his mission and caused him to say instead i dont aim to cause no trouble i just brung this old rifle in town to get the barrel blued and im right now on my way back to where i live up piney creek see that you get moving we dont want no disturbance around here from the likes of you arel english a man to speak meekly no sir a fawning grin you wont have no disturbances from me he was pleased it wasnt the first time a man had to bow down before he could stand up straight and hed handled it well that he had hed find this sitin then theyd see who was the likes of who black niggers needing to be put in their rightful place and cowards in law suits who made light of honest whites but as the hours and the miles passed by the pavement became hard beneath his feet an unfamiliar hardness trying to a man accustomed to the familiar rocks and dust of his own dirt roads and the brilliant windows with nowhere a spot of restful dark and the people the staring people in cars walking standing just standing staring tourists all and in all the world nowhere a soft chair nowhere a soft voice to say everything is fine mr english just as fine as it can be he walked until there came a time when the lighted windows were farther between less brilliant illuminated by single fly specked bulbs and these people whom he now saw standing and walking were not tourists these were kinfolk walkers in the dust though their feet might never know other than the harshness of a concrete walk and now for the first time he felt close to that for which he searched behind one of these paintscarred doors up one of these unlighted alleys was where he would find them dark figures plotting destroyers of order here was where he would find them here was where he would find little jim and for the first time that day his heart swung high his grip on the rifle tightened and he thought once more of the lilylivered cop who had touched the barrel of that same gun in scorn a cop too craven to do his duty so that a man hillborn must pick up his own weapon to see that justice be done he might too expect some trouble from such a meeching city cop as this but it wouldnt amount to much couldnt amount to much because no matter how you sliced it they was still niggers just niggers why he could remember his own pappy sitting on the back stoop smoking his pipe and talking take jess harkins he was a real outlaw six men he gunned down in his life not counting niggers of course not that he himself exactly held with that little jim used to be as good and as honest a nigger as ever drew breath and he used to like little jim he surely did and the thought of having to gun him down with no more count made of him than if he was a dog didnt seem right somehow but a man did what he must and in those days of which his pappy spoke a man knew too where he stood and he stood there by god with no damned foolishness about equal rights in a world the lord had plainly set up to be as it was on he walked and now he came to a place where there were no lighted windows at all vast buildings warehouses and factories and machine shops stood darkly silent and his footsteps alone echoed into the night somewhere he had missed somewhere behind was that for which he sought doggedly he turned and turning saw beneath the light reflected from a comer post a nigger black as the ace of spades a big buck carrying in one hand a flashlight and wearing a uniform and pinned to the pocket of his shirt by god reflecting the glow of the street light a badge not a star like a sheriff or a city police wore but a badge no mistaking that arel english male white taxpayer and great greatgrandson of a piney creek taxpayer standing now at close to midnight on a lonely city street seeing what hed always known was just tall tales and not really so at all seeing now with his own eyes a nigger with authority pinned to his shirt this then was it calmly he raised his gun and his voice was sharp as the crack of a bullet you boy come here he came moving easily speaking softly are you crazy put down that gun oh his little tin badge had gone to his head all right arel english looked close read the word security guard and he a man grown wanted to weep that such a thing as this could come to pass he liked niggers wasnt little jim the best friend he could have had as black as the pit of night and if it would do any good at all hed say now just put aside that badge boy and those uppity airs youve taken to wearing with it this was what he wanted to say and the surety that it would be no use brought hot tears to his eyes so that as his finger tightened on the trigger he could only fire blindly at an enemy nameless faceless and without form arel english standing now alone a chill in the marrow of his bones standing with useless rifle knowing now knowing at last that it would do no real good were he to fire thus ten times ten straight into the heart of little jim arel english walker in the dust standing alone in a quiet street listening for a soft black voice listening to hear the words everything is fine mr english just as fine as it can be i has long been my contention that if white america knew the true facts about the negro and his place in american history as contrasted with the diabolical myths of the stereotype negro and his happiness as a slave under kindhearted masters for whom he gladly labored and sweated from sunup to sundown in the cotton fields of the southland and sang jubilee and folk songs into the late hours of the nightsuch as white america and negroes too are taught in american text books if america learned from their school books of the negros remarkable contributions to american freedom and progress from accurately recorded history books in american schools the american conscience would be stirred and awakened by this powerful moral imperative the security of america rests upon our actual knowledge of the past events that have occurred in our land and the enlightened use of this knowledge in constructive thinking about our plans to create a better life for all americans in the future this becomes all important today in connection with the implementation of the wide benefits to be derived from the new antipoverty program recently enacted into law the rejection in teaching such myths and caricatures mentioned above is supported by the best of current historical scholarship the degrading of a whole race of people the negro by such derogatory references is attributed to the deference of textbook publishers to the special sensitiveness of the southern market what a pity that a whole race of people americas largest minority of souls must suffer this disgrace to appease the benighted vanity of the most backward section of america the total national strength of america is directly related to the maximum of unity of all classes and races in america whatever their color religion ethnic origin or nationality background it is therefore clear that to degrade one group at the expense of all others is damaging to the general welfare of all america to solve this problem is to promote the general welfare of americaand each group cultural democracy is an important inescapable corollary of political and social democracy and it involves an open door and the full acceptance of minority contributions and for the full recognition of the minority contributors one of the most important projects which the negro must support perhaps second only to the long and bitter battle for civil_rights which now appears as far as the written law is concerned as a fait accompli is to correct the mind of the average american child and adult about the place of the negro in american history and his contributions to our history as a nation and at the same time to destroy once and for all the myths and stereotypes that haunt the life of the american negro many of these myths and stereotypes were in the most part figments of the white mans imagination created by propaganda and maintained as a balm for a guiltladen white psyche dr elias blake jr of howard university has written with great clarity on this subjectsee journal of negro historyapril on the subject of the negros singing and dancing and his socalled irresponsibility dr blake says negroes did sing a lot but song was a physical life saver and a codified weapon against a deadly power structure they did dance but as a diluted expression of a former african cultural heritage which was brutally destroyed in all its major aspects there was irresponsibility but as a clever device to escape back breaking labor one of americas greatest historians and the leading authority on the history of the american negro was dr carter g woodson who after authoring singlyand in collaboration with other distinguished scholarsmore than scientific works on the negro died in washington d c on april born of former slave parents in in new canton virginia he suffered all the hardships and privations of one of several children in a tenant farmers family he left virginia at the age of and went to work in the mines of west virginia after obtaining the degree of litt b at berea college in kentucky in he taught school in west virginia in the philippines the high schools of the district of columbia and later became dean of the school of liberal arts at howard university his search for more knowledge led him to the university of chicago where he was awarded the degree of ba in and ma in he then studied at the sorbonne in paris his superb work in research on the history of the negro in america was accomplished during his two years of study at the doctoral level at harvard university where he was awarded the phd degree in following years of foreign travel and further research he became convinced that among the scholars of the world and more sadly among negro scholars and students of history the role of his own people in american history and in the history of other nations cultures was being either ignored or deliberately misrepresented he therefore delved deeper and deeper into the neglected past of the american negro he founded with others the now famous and world recognized association for the study of negro life and history asnlh in september with headquarters in washington d c it is one of the great honors and pleasures of my life that dr woodson whom i knew from my childhood and deeply respected urged me during my student days at harvard when he visited frequently as guest lecturer and summer visiting professor to establish a philadelphia chapter of this association this i did in and became its first president this chapter under the present leadership of miss edythe h ingraham a supervisor in the philadelphia school system is one of the leading branches of asnlh in america at present as a member of the national executive council of the association it is my task with a board of distinguished historians and educators to see to the furtherance of the great historical objectives of its late highly respected founder the president of the executive council is dr charles h wesley noted educator and president of central state college in wilberforce ohio the secretarytreasurer and editor of the informative an widely read popular monthly negro history bulletin is dr charles walker thomas a noted scholar and professor of history at howard university washington d c the editor of the scholarly quarterly journal of negro history founded in january is dr william m brewer an eminent scholar in the field of american history and the history of the negro in the cultures of many nations of the world the journal has never missed a publication date an impressive volume handsomely printed and bound and acknowledged to be the first and last resort of scholars throughout the world for accurate historical data on the american negro and his influence in the social political and economic history of america slavery as we all know had its beginnings in america when a dutch trader landed his vessel with twenty native africans in jamestown virginia in these humans the robust survivors of a much larger number who left the shores of africa two months earlier were sold as slaves to the virginia planters stories of their huge size their strength their friendly nature and quick acclimation to their new surroundings are now well known neither time nor space will permit a full discussion of the growth of this blot on the morals and conscience of the civilizations of europefrom which continent trading vessels were sent by the dutch the spaniards the french english and portuguese to the east and west coasts of africa in the commercial exploitation of human lives they invaded peaceful native villages and captured by force and violenceand if that failed by corrupting their own tribal chiefsdefenseless men and women these frightened people were torn from their children and loved ones and driven off in chains to slave vessels within these vessels many hardly seaworthy this human cargo was crowded into pens like animals to make the hazardous six to eight weeks voyage across the atlantic to a completely strange and unknown land it hardly need be said that records show that rarely more than half the human cargo survived this dreadful passage the earliest and perhaps the most renowned negro scholar of all time who scientifically and painstakingly studied and recorded this subject was the late great philosopher essayist historian and critic dr w e burghart dubois who died in at the age of in his monumental and scholarly book suppression of the slave trade edited by him when he was rogers memorial fellow at harvard university from which institution he earned his phd degree in dr dubois with painstaking analysis supported by records from the house of commons house of lords archives of various state governments in america as well as studies of treaties between various foreign governments relating to the slave trade says while the exact proportion of the slave trade to america can be but approximately determined records show that from to ships left africa with a cargo of negro slaves and after losing on the passage were delivered to america and that slaves were brought to america each year from to later this figure rose to per year the census of showed slaves in the united states dr dubois in this well documented book gives the accurate slave population in each of the states in colonial america including the new england states unfortunately little is known of the descendants of these unwilling migrants to our shores by the school population of america and as it follows by their parents certainly the american school books tell us virtually nothing except that the leading negroes who have risen to a place of prominence in america are booker t washington frederick douglass sojourner truth the great oratorabolitionist and marian anderson only recently have they added the name of dr ralph j bunche american history books never tell of the negro soldiers and negro sailors who fought in the civil war it goes without saying that these books geared to the sensitiveness of the south never mentioned the heroic deeds of the trusted slaves who defying death harbored the women folk and children of their masters who were at war and saved many families from death and the tortures of war nor says dr woodson in his volume negro makers of history no american school book tells its students that negro soldiers and four negro sailors won the congressional medal of honor for bravery and valor during the civil war nor do they tell us of the free negroes in the united states at the time of the signing of the emancipation proclamation on january more than half of whom were in the south and thousands of whom were successful businessmen in both the north and south nor do they tell us of the prominent role of the negro runaway slave crispus attucks in americas first birth of freedom this exslave then living in boston was the first american to defy and the first to die in the revolutionary war he repelled the british infantry on the boston commons in the famous boston massacre on march it was the shot from attucks rifle that sparked the flames of the revolutionary war which ended successfully six years later in victory for the rebellious states and their union into the great nation that is ours today there were at that time one million negroes nor does history tell of the former slaves who fought under general george washington during the revolutionary war nor does history tell of the negroes who rushed to the union army immediately after lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation and who saw active service many of these men were killed and wounded and in addition to these fighting soldiers another negroes served as military laborers and served with the naval units of the north few if any of the history books tell the american students that in the postbellum or reconstruction period twentytwo negroes served in the congress of the united states and two of this number served as united states senators from the point of view of current history this is interesting to note because these two negro senators were from mississippi they were senators hiram r revels and blanche k bruce who contrary to the writings of southern historians were well educated cultured and highly respected gentlemen who left scholarly records in this great legislative body of equal current interest is the fact that three congressmen were from alabama benjamin p turner james t rapier and jeremiah huralston all of whom served in the rd and th congress in addition every state of the solid south saw negroes in both houses of their legislatures and in many of the cabinets of the state government during this period the highest state office to which a negro was elected was that of lieutenant governor of louisiana this honor went to the honorable p b s pinchback who for a time served as acting governor of that deep south now hardcore segregationist state on the whole these men all of whose biographies and pictures appear in dr woodsons negromakers of history were easily the equals of their white associates in congress and the state house many of these officials exceeded in training culture and talent that of the vardamans and the cole bleeses of those daysand would rate head and shoulders above the talmadges of georgia and the eastlands of mississippi of today as a single illustration senator hiram r revels of mississippi a native of north carolina the first of his race to serve in the senate was born a free negro he went to illinois and graduated from the famous knox college in that state he taught high school in indiana illinois missouri and kentucky he later studied for the ministry and began his church career in baltimore maryland when the civil war broke out he organized two maryland regiments and himself volunteered in the union army as a chaplain after the war he went to mississippi to establish churches and made his home in natchez he entered politics and was elected alderman in later he entered the race for the united states senate and was elected senator from mississippi in it was paradoxical and providential that the man whose seat this respected brilliant negro took was none other than the former presi dent of the confederacy jefferson davis the first appearance of this tall handsome negro in the senate chamber for confirmation was a moment of great drama and excitement it took two full days of heated debate on the floor of the senate before the senators agreed to seat this new member finally they gave in and seated the gentleman from mississippi by a to vote erroneous myths passionate and vicious dogma and hate have unfortunately taken the place of historical fact and calm analysis hopefully we feel that the struggle of the negro to overcome the nations moral lag is now reaching the twothirds of the american population whom we like to think have not cared simply because they have not known i too like martin_luther_king have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed and that the moral scurvy that has nauseated the intellectually courageous white americans for all these long years will be a thing unknown in the not too distant future carter woodson had an awareness of the need of the negro to know himself and of the selfsufficient sophisticated white man to know his america better he was exceptional perhaps unprecedented he made negro history irresistibly attractive indeed classically respectable his dissent from the orthodox teaching of the history of the became woodson the herobecontribution of various racial and cause his dissent from orthodoxy ethnic groups in america was will become the majority opinion heresy but woodson the heretic of historians tomorrow in those long ago days lagos was an insignificant trading post and the center of power trade and commerce in this part of africa was benin city the flourishing trade of benin affected every town village and hamlet for hundreds of miles around it and was in part responsible for the crisis of kabbo the crisis began on the fifth night of the war with umia village the war was not going well and the services of every man of kabbo were required all the men were at the war camp except segun this was a criminal act of treasonable proportionsparticularly since segun had ignored two messages ordering him to report to the camp hence on this night the horrifying third warning appeared this was a detatchment of men from the camp who surrounded the evaders house torches in hand ready to burn his house to the ground only once before in the history of kabbo had the third warning been necessary that was in the war with eyo village when osagie did not show for the fight but when faced with the flaming torches he fell on his kness bathed his face in the dirt and begged for forgiveness and a chance to fight after joining the camp he fought more bravely than any other warrior and returned to kabbo with three human heads to his credit the six men at seguns house held their torches menacingly ready as their captain issued the final order segun son of bata he shouted loudly authoritatively and ceremoniously kabbo is at war join us at the camp having said this he awaited seguns response the men relaxed on the torches somewhat expecting segun to prostrate himself before the captain as osagie had done thereby relieving them of the responsibility of using the torches but instead segun stood statuesquely in front of his house fearless before his tormentors and gave the response that created the crisis this war is unjust i will not join when the captain recovered his composure he gave the predictable order burn his house down the five men with torches approached the house slowly and hesitantly at first shocked by their part in what was obviously a new script in the making and then they burned the house down the dry thatched hut made a high flaming inferno and when the blazes reached their peak the captain and his men returned to the war camp segun stood and watched his house burn the light of the fire silhouetting his tall frame and broad shoulders he gave the physical appearance of the man who gets things done yet he made no effort to save a single belonging he just watched remorseless and determined to persist in this overpowering conviction and as he watched the final flames die out he knew that this was not the end of the ordeal but rather the beginning the war lasted another week after some fierce fighting the villagers of umia were subdued and the warriors of kabbo were victorious once more as some of the war captains had expected the booty gained in the victory was richly rewarding the goods cattle and slaves were divided among the victorious warriors as was their custom and all of kabbo then turned its attention to the nasty affair of the segun case in kabbo trials of cases and disputes could be heard and decided anywhere from the lowest bush shed to the kings court the highest court excepting the kings was called the council of ogodis this court was convened only in cases of high treason and when the death penalty was expected so as to spare the king of such gruesome decisions the court was composed of five ogodis keepers of the kings conscience each dressed in an ankle length white robe with his identity hidden behind the large carved wooden mask covered with long dry grass skirts under the chin the net effect was to give the appearance of a ghost with a black wooden head and footlong beard the five of them carried beaded walking sticks that set up a nerveracking jingle as they moved about the court of ogodi was always held in an open clearing in front of the shrine of agboho a roomsize hillside cave the shrine of agboho was the repository of all wisdom and only the ogodis ever entered it was said that if any other person entered he was beheaded by the spirit of agboho and his or her body was buried in the cave with this went the secret of agboho which was the true identities of the five villagers who adorned the masks and became ogodis woe unto anyone who ever referred to an ogodi in court by his true name for this was taken as proof of their having entered the shrine which was the only source of such knowledgesuch offenders suffered the same fate of one who had physically entered on the day of seguns trial villagers gathered at the site hours before the court would convene the place was as noisy as the market with everyone arguing the merits of the casesome defending segun others damning him then at the deafening sound of the cymbals from out of the shrine signifying the ogodis were about to come out the crowd hushed and the silence was as pervading as the sound at this signal the oldest man in the village who acted as an overseer to the court rose to announce the opening of the court be civil be quiet be dumb he shouted repeating the traditional court convening speech for his sixtyfifth time let the cougher conceal his cough let mothers quieten their babies let everybody close his mouth the cord that binds humanity is broken the cord which ties friendships is cut the cord of family and relations is broken the big men now will tie up the broken cords and if anyone disturbs them in this work of reorganizing such disturber will be seriously dealt with the moment he finished the loud cymbals from the shrine clanged again and then from the mouth of the cave came the ogodis at the first sight of them every man women and child in the audience dropped to his or her knees touched the ground with the forehead and remained in that position until the last ogodi walking stick ceased to jingle signaling that the ogodis had taken their seats on the five stools placed immediately in front of the shrine to the left side of the ogodis sat two men the kiri chief of war staff who would act as prosecutor and the captain he dispatched to summon segun to the war camp to the right of the tribunal sat segun the defendent and bisi his lifelong friend and now his defender the leading ogodi opened the session as in tradition by pounding his cane against the ground pointing his finger at the kiri and shouting who are you at this cue the sitting kiri bowed low till his face rubbed the ground and answered i am the dirt at your feet fatheri am the shell of your lowliest kola nut it was the tradition that one pleading a case before the court should present himself in the humblest of terms hopefully gaining favor of the court through such flattery after all the humble remarks were finished he identified himself as the kiri of kabbo and speaker of the people in this dreadful case the leading ogodis next standard question was do you know me as if this established the impartiality of the court you are beyond knowledge father the kiri explained i can not know you with the prosecution formally introduced the leading ogodi now turned to segun and bisi stamped his cane and shouted who are you segun respectifully touched the ground with his forehead and answered i am segun son of bata this was the first time in the history of the court that a defendant did not humble himself before the ogodis chills of horror swept through the audience some of whom expected the leading ogodi to behead such a brash offender immediately without benefit of a trial after some hesitation the leading ogodi asked do you know me then in the same cool and dignified manner segun answered i do not know you the leading ogodi turned again to the kiri and his captain and asked what is the complaint against this man father the kiri began his case i am the kiri of kabbo this man next to me is my captain and that man he pointed at segun is an ablebodied man of kabbo it is the honor and glory of every man of kabbo to fight in defense of hearth and home and the country that gave him birth in the recent hostilities against the wild beasts of umia who slaughtered a son of kabbo without provocation this man endangered the success of our mission by refusing to fight of this i accuse the leading ogodi then turned to segun and bisi and asked who will defend this man father bisi began his defense i have fought in two wars with this man seguni know he is no coward and if he refused battle it was because of serious mental reservations and these reservations ought to be considered it is true that he refused to fight in the campaign against umia so let us hear his case with this introduction bisi proceeded to review the case from seguns point of view some zealous war captains of kabbo came to know about the strangers in benin called whitemen who were paying fabulous prices for common slaves these hawks of their day contrived a crisis with the village of umia over the justified killing of a kabbo village bum for the sole reason of enslaving its population and making themselves a large profit from the sales after presenting their case bisi reminded the court that kabbo had always honored men of integrity and that the implications of this case went far and beyond the fate of one man at this point and for the remainder of the trial each ogodi would take turns in questioning the complainant and the defendant until they were satisfied that they had all the facts then they would retire to the shrine to make their decision only the leading ogodi would again appear to announce the verdict the first ogodi inquirer asked the kiri was this a just war father the kiri began his reply kabbo has never gone to war without the sanction of the oracle the oracle of kabbo was consulted and gave its blessings no war blessed by the oracle can be unjust then you the same ogodi said to segun why did you say this war was unjust father segun began we have farmed the land next to the village of umia for ten years without conflict the umia farmer who slew this son of kabbo said the kabbo man ventured without authorization onto his property raped his junior wife and took some of his prized yams he said he slew the man on umia land but that the kabbo war captains who reported the incident dragged the body over the boundary to kabbo land in order to distort the truth of what happened this umia man said that he showed the trail of tracks and blood to a kabbo farmer but at the hearings on this incident the kabbo farmer was forbidden to testify though offered an opportunity to rebut the kiri would not reply to seguns statement so the next ogodi began his questioning you he shouted at segun why do you think the war captains would want to wage an unjustified war with umia father we all know that umia is weaka defenseless prey we also know about the whitemen in benin who are paying high prices for slaves since they have come to this land wars amongst tribes and villages have increased fourfold it was previously our custom to take from the defeated village only sufficient slaves to fill our own labor shortagesbut now we take the largest number of slaves possible for sale to the whitemen of benin this is why the war captains devised this war with umia we have always sold slaves to other tribes the ogodi commented so why is it so bad to sell slaves to the whitemen when we have sold slaves to other tribes in this region we have known what the fate of those slaves would be segun answered we knew for example that any slave who is brutally treated by any master may appeal to the masters king and if his allegations are proved he may be set free we also knew that the children of a slave mother are born free and will share in the inheritance of that household equally with the masters children but when we sell slaves to these whitemen of benin all we know is that they are loaded on huge ships that are swallowed by the sea we know no more you have stated before this day that dealing with this whiteman would lead to kabbos destruction the third ogodi said to segun how can this be so father this whiteman will never be satisfied until he has brought us all under his controlperhaps by buying us few by few one from another he will make us his serfs he will boss our land he will take our crops at this point there was hooting and sarcasm throughout the audience this man must be mad some said a few white men defeat the mighty kabbo another asked we are men we are strong we are powerful the ogodi told segun so how will a few whitemen do this to us father we are men and we are strong segun explained but their weapons are more powerful than ours surely you have heard what they did to the village of alero when it refused to pay their taxes the time is short before they will advance to menace kabbo ha ah this is nonsense the ogodi shouted back at segun many in the audience joined him in a vitrolic slandering of the defendants name when the leading ogodi finally restored order to the court he motioned the other ogodis to follow him back to the shrine as they began to leave their stools it became apparent to segun that i what they were about to deliberate on was not the merits of his case but the question of his sanity i am not sick segun shouted as the last ogodi disappeared i am not sicki am trying to warn you then when he looked around at the audience almost all of them were pointing to their foreheads with their right index fingers the gesture meaning that he was insane ogodi deliberations frequently lasted all night and many spectators would stay until the early morning hours to hear the life or death decision but this decision took only a few minutes they decided that segun was insane tradition forbade them to take the life of an insane man for this would bring a terrible curse to the village so they decided that instead they would sell segun into slavery so it fell on segun to suffer the horrible fate he had risked his life to condemn before day the following morning segun was bound and gagged for the forced march to benin he along with the slaves from umia had his arms closely drawn together behind his back by means of a cord tied tightly around just between his shoulder and elbows the gag consisted of a wooden bit forced into his mouth and tied around the back of his neck a chain supplied to the warriors by the whitemen in benin connected the knots in the gag to the arm cord and chain tied him to the slaves in front and behind him in this manner the long line of slaves would make the journey to benin bisi seguns unsuccessful defender and lifelong friend stayed with him right up until the bit was shoved into his mouth the last thing segun said was i am not afraid i am not bitter though i know i will never see this land again i still have the feeling of coming back bisis last words were you will come back for i met a warrior who has taken many slaves to benin and he has seen white men who left with slaves come back to benin you will come back too segun i know you will come back two hundred years later the village of kabbo was still pretty much the same as it had always been there were lots of explanations given for kabbos stagnation some said it was because none of the britishbuilt roads came to kabboothers said the village was permanently cursed but for whatever the reason everybody in modern kabbo was convinced that now kabbos stagnation would end and they would soon be catching up with lagos and accra this was because the peace corps was coming to kabbo the peace corp they were told would not only teach their children but they would also lead the village in a general uplifting community development scheme there would be new roads more sanitation better housing and more effective farming methods this was the reason why the whole village turned out for the saturday morning feast to commemorate the arrival of the very first peace corps volunteer the first volunteer was to be james thomas thomas was born in alabama and was tall with broad shoulders and gave the physical appearance of the man who gets things done at the first sign of the jeep grinding up the little muddy bush path from the main highway the children ran to the picnic grounds shouting he is here the american is here with this notice all of the villagers including its first citizen the yearoldmr okeke called old man okeke behind his back adjusted their robes so as to look their best they were ready and beaming when the jeep pulled up amongst them and thomas got out after a slightly embarrassing moment of surprise and silence old man okeke reached to shake thomas hand with one hand and placed his other hand over the blabbering mouth of the child that stood next to him the child was saying ah the american is black after the handshake old man okeke made a toolong welcome address then offered thomas the heart of the roasted lamb thomas had been told that the honored guest always got the heart of the cooked animal and was expected to eat it with vigor to show his appreciation thomas munched heartily on the lamb heart wishing he could have had old man okekes leg of lamb instead and thinking through the speech he was expected to make at the end of the meat course of the feast when it came his turn to speak thomas said mr okeke citizens of kabbo i am delighted to be joining your village and i am confident and hopeful that our association will be mutually rewarding instead of indulging in a lot of tmproudtobehere platitudes thomas continued i think id prefer to tell you why i joined the american peace corps and why i came to africa first i joined the american peace corps because i have an overriding concern for the fate of my fellowman as thomas went on to spell out his concern for the fate of others old man okete who stood next to him became visibly nervous he kept fidgeting and looking at the ground never into the face of the guest i came to africa thomas went on because i have a special personal interest in africa as you can see he added humorously pointing to his black skin my forefathers came to america from africa i can not tell you from what part of africa he came but it could have been from any part it could have been from right here in kabbo as incredible as that may seem with that last statement old man okete really started shaking most of the villagers thought it was just his oldage nervousness but dr williams kabbos schoolmaster knew better thomas ended his speech old man okeke shook his hand again this time not looking thomas in the face then the old man left the grounds dr williams overtook him a few yards down the path what in the world was wrong with you then he asked old man okeke what made you so nervous old man okeke paused that young man he answered that black american i can not stand to look him in the eyes for it strikes terror in my soul what are you talking about williams asked he says his name is thomas old man okeke explained i would not expect you youngsters to know this but thomas is the englishmans name for tunde you know what tunde means it means coming back and im sure this is no accident of names i still dont know what youre talking about williams admitted ah old man okeke scoffed you young people only have book sense and no knowledge of your own history youll call it juju but i have a mysterious sense of knowledge it is related to this black americans coming here and it makes me terribly upset many many years ago segun of kabbo was sold into slavery and he promised he would return oh boy williams laughed you old people with your juju your superstition and your mysterious knowledge all thats a bunch of nonsense he declared then he laughed his way on back to the picnic in the halcyon days of vaudeville dancing especially tapdancing was considered a major form of entertainment to some extent it still is but with the death of blackface coonshouting and cakewalking the hoofing art contracted a sickness which some people believe will eventually lead to its unfortunate demise the graveness of the situation concerning individual dancers of today can best be seen by the lack of star performers on stage screen and television not since the heyday of bill bojangles robinson has there emerged a dancer who could begin to approach the popularity of that great artist he left a bountiful legacy to his profession but apparently he left no heirs such performers as sammy davis jr george kirby john bubbles peg leg bates and the nicholas brothers are still kicking up their heels but the truth is not one of them is considered a star dancer davis is alleverything kirby is a mimiccomic bates is considered by many as being over the hill and both john bubbles and the nicholas brothers are struggling along the comeback trail actually bigtime dancing began to get sore feet following world war ii whereas in prior years hollywood was turning out movies starring the likes of marge and gower champion gene kelly fred astaire ginger rogers the nicholas brothers and the four step brothers they now ceased to do so the movie kingdom like stage and television turned to mass choreography and a limited amount of modern dancing however when one recalls old fashioned dancing the renowned bojangles commands more attention than any other dancer in history it is an unchallenged fact that no dancer before or since has possessed a virtuosity comparable to his when bill first started in the business he was part of a team cooper robinson within a very short time however he ventured out on his own as a song and dance man with a few jokes thrown in for variety it was through a stroke of luck that he stumbled upon his bread and butter forteone day while performing at the palace theatre in new york city bill sauntered down the steps to acknowledge some friends upon returning to the stage he adlibbed a jig up the steps and the maneuver brought down the house from then on stair dancing was in and so was robinson eventually he occupied the position of being the greatest dancer in the world and in short order he was beckoned to hollywood in the early s he appeared in films such as dixiana the little colonel and many others in the s he starred opposite lena horne in stormy weather and few will forget his roles with americas darling of the era shirley temple by sheer artistry he broke through the wall of racial discrimination into the bigtime kings presidents mayors and statesmen applauded him without ever having had a formal dance lesson himself he became the teacher of every dancing great in the u s indeed he was the hero of the humiliated the protector of the poor and the codifier of hoofing his status as an entertainer testified to the stamina and persistence with which he and other members of the negro race reached for stardom through the clouds of jim crow i make music with my feet he once said and the millions who thrilled to his deft dance steps readily agreed as could be expected there were those who claimed that bojangles was an uncle tom maybe so but there are those who still say the same things about louis armstrong and this is without doubt an absurdity critics are correct when they say that looking for militancy in both men was and is respectively like looking for tigers in africa but not everyone has to be a dr martin_luther_king to be of service to racial justice both men were simply products of their time robinson was a tap dancer and an entertainer satchmo is a trumpet player and an entertainer thats all they ever were and thats all they ever wanted to be it is gratifying to know that they won their war with success irrespective of the weapons with which they chose to fight in armstrongs opinion bojangles was a showman without parallel he even confesses to copying some of his idols style which anyone who has ever seen louis in person knows what bill did and what louis does is not toming but entertainment seventyone years of age at the time of his death in bojangles spent a large portion of his life attempting to make others happy it is a matter of record that he died broke but it is also a matter of record that he died a legend perhaps there will someday be a successor to his title but not soon times have changed too much for example when robinson was a boy it was quite common for youngsters to dance on street corners and in alleyways but not any more nowadays they stand on street corners and sing rock n roll songs according to one dance expert the metamorphosis began to take place when dancers who for the most part were underpaid and underrated in vaudeville turned to other careers on the stage many of them switched to singing be cause it offered them the chance to reap overnight riches and fame on the strength of a single hit song shortly afterwards records became the rage and hoofers left their specialty in droves by now vaudeville was on its death bed talking movies and radio had not only robbed the circuits of their stars but most of their customers too theatres all across the country began padlocking their doors and this proved calamitious for youthful dance aspirants without the showcases with which to polish and perfect their art they lost interest in dancing as a profession and sought out other fields of occupation however there is still a ray of hope that hoofing can be rescued currently there are thousands of high school and college students across the country who are enrolled in dance courses and there are thousands more being trained in professional dance institutions but almost all of them are involved in modern dance or jazz dancing the forms promoted by martha graham katherine dunham pearl primus and talley beatty to them tapdancing and all its relatives is as archaic as the old twoaday routines at the palace and is therefore a lost art still in a sense they are preserving this art form and who knows their children might some day restore it to its proper place in the culture a wind of change came to dancing when john william sublett better known as john bubbles of the old buck bubbles duo hoofed his way into new york rather than reinterpret known dance steps of the day bojangles style he undertook to reexamine basic premises and in the process discovered what later became known as rhythm dancing his architectonic approach to movement received widespread recognition and gained him universal acclaim but not as much as robinson bubbles says a member of the four step brothers was one of the greatest dancers ever to place a shoe in a rosin box there were many things he could do that bojangles couldnt and bill would never accept any of his challenges but as far as im concerned robinson was the epitome of dance his steps were like poetry in motion robinson and bubbles were not the only big negro dancers in vaudeville others included worth thompson the five hot shots the three joints of rhythm the three lightnin flashes ford marshall and jones and the five cotton club boys they were experts in such styles as the clog cane toe softshoe adagio and neat song and dance during their peak years each group earned from to a week per man but then came the bad days and salaries were slashed almost to nothing in some instances stage managers made more than musicians and stage hands took home more money than dancers it was inevitable that something had to give at the present time there are only three dancing groups that are able to draw more than mere breath at the box office they are the three rhythm kings the nicholas brothers and of course the four step brothers but things are so bad only the step brothers work the major supper club route with any degree of regularity they are on the road weeks out of the year and they command a fourfigure salary somehow they have managed to survive for years and according to a spokesman they hope to be around that many more but how long will oldfashioned hoofing be around can anything be done to save it from extinction some experts say yes and others say no but all agree that dancing will never enjoy the popularity it once knew because the art like an evicted tenant has lost its house and homevaudeville there is a diminishing passing as clouds in the air of things that once were but now are not here for they passed there were adam and eve living in the garden without any evil fear or doubt then a snake came with an apple in its mouth and eden passed when it rained forty days and forty nights without stopping noah thought the water would never stop dropping but the flood passed hitler in munich drunk from many beers swore that nazism would last a thousand years yet it passed there was a time when men stood blinded by a cotton curtain for that curtain blotted out all light they lived and struggled in that dreary darkness and all their lives were long and lonely nights but that time passed the light of freedom now shines through the cotton curtain once men were blind but now they see though their struggle has not yet ended the dreary darkness is no more and their lives are not the long lonely nights they used to be for the nights are now brightened by the flame of desire and the fire of determination to be free and that flame and that fire has once again lit americas torch of liberty and as that torch brightens the night as the darkness recedes well find that not only the suppressed but also the suppressors themselves were blind for no man can lower a curtain around anyone else and remain in the place where darkness falls without being blinded himself there was a time when men rejoiced because they were freed from the chains but their rejoicing did not last very long for they found that after the visible shackles were broken other chains were welded invisible but just as strong and that time passed like the visible shackles of long ago the invisible chains are falling men have felt the weight of those chains and found that weight appalling for chains cannot imprison the hearts and minds of men nor can they bind the desire for freedom and bring it to an end those chains cannot withstand the pressure of men who want to see america become the true home of the brave and land of the free yet as the shackles lose their strength as the links weaken and wane the welders of those shackles will find that they too were bound by the chains for the man who chains another man must remain at hand to see that the shackles are not broken and therefore neither man is free there was a time when a man dreaded the approaching tomorrow as he gazed back on the fears of a fading yesterday he wondered if those fears would diminish in the night or if tomorrow would renew the horror of yesterdays fright that time too has passed today a man does not stand depressed and forlorn as he glances back at yesterday and toward the approaching morn though many fears are still with him as he stands in the twilight hour those fears will give him the desire and strength to fulfill tomorrows vows and those vows will be renewed each day until that coming night when all america will look backward and forward and find no need for fright and as a man goes forth each day to fulfill the vows he has made hell find that those who caused his fears are themselves afraid for the man who causes others fear is himself touched by the blight of fearing that the others will someday rise above their fright there was a time when it appeared that justice could not move forward that she stood blind and bewildered in a strange and foreign land it seemed as though she was bogged down in the mud of segregation and in the muck of mans inhumanity to man that time also passed the mud and muck has finally parted justice has at last taken a pace out of the depth her journey may indeed prove to be a long one but even the longest journey begins with a single step and her journey will lead far beyond the cotton curtain it will erode the invisible chains it will eliminate the fears and end at a place where america can face the world without shame and as justice begins her journey the entire world will see that america is willing to follow her to the place where all men are free now perhaps the picture will change in the minds of men who saw the eagle come forth with chains rather than an olive branch in its claw there were those times but a tide has come and washed them all away and riding high on the crest of that tide is an idea whose time has come the idea is freedom and the time is now america is being given the chance to show that the statue who stands with a torch in her hand has the right to stand near our shore but let not the tide stop with the washing away of old times let it also wash clean the conscience of our country may that cleansing enable each american to see that the good ship united states was built and launched by all our hands may we all look over the helm and across the bow and see that our ship now floats on a current which can lead on to greatness and glory for passage of the civil_rights bill has given america a finer hour on the stage and her citizens now have new roles in another different drama and when god and historians look back in judgment i am certain they will find that the drama ended in brotherhood and not blood hat is all this fuss over names one of our out standing negro writers wrote a book all about nobody knows my name many negroes contend they do not know who they are or where they came from originally i have news for them i am white and i dont know where i came from either what is more i dont really care i cannot live on the reputations of my ancestors and something tells me if i snooped around in history too much id find some ancestors i might be a little ashamed to acknowledge oh sure i could brag that back maybe a couple hundred years ago more or less two brothers came from virginia and settled in kentucky i might stretch the truth a bit and say they established productive plantations in the commonwealth but not only were the plantations productivesoon their descendants were scattered all over kentucky there was just bound to be a horse thief a card sharp a seducer or a moonshiner somewhere in the lot perhaps worse and how can i be sure how the original two brothers obtained their money to start their propagating so you can see i am not too eager to dig up my ancestors so to speak on the other hand where did those two brothers come from before virginia some folks like to brag that their ancestors came over on the mayflower now ive heard tell how there were a lot of petty criminals on that boat so you dont know who you are i am not sure either the best way i can figure it is that i am mixture of english irish and scotch not the liquid kind with a maiden name which is also chinese according to a couple chinese friends who had the same name and where did the ancestors come from before they got to england ireland and scotland i havent the faintest idea i dont care one thing i know and this is the only important thing to me i am an american i was born here i hope i shall die here we cannot stand on the deeds of our ancestors so my grandfather was wounded in the civil war or my uncle was killed in world war i they may have been heroes but not me i have no medals for bravery no purple hearts i am not brave i am a coward all i have done for my country is pay a few taxes and try to be a law abiding citizen it is not the name we use that is important but what we do with it make that name glow dont hide your light behind an x the black muslim says hate the white devil he enslaved us that is true he did search your history books and you will see that white men enslaved white men and in some cases black men enslaved black man was it not the man from galilee who said let he who is without sin cast the first stone hate is cancerous hate causes ulcers on my small salary i cannot support an ulcer sometimes it is hard to love our neighbors but we can begin by trying to understand them glory be i just thought of something suppose i find an ancestor who was a real rascal say old col jim dandy challenged the marquis de fantastic to a duel down in new orleans over the honor of a beautiful creole maiden or was it a quadroon what wonderful material for a short story eh sherlock of course all names will be changed to protect the innocent excuse me please i must do some research and the old colonel x held his head high and his shoulders straight as he stepped off the required number of paces he turned on the signal took steady aim and fired his adversary fell mortally wounded under the big oak tree colonel x approached him with dignity looked into his paintwisted face and said to the dying man nuthin personal suh i liked you but you should never call a member of a respectable old suthern family a carpetbagger suh then he walked away into the setting sun more than years ago abraham lincoln addressed himself to the duties of free men and free women in an age of rapid social change we cannot escape history he said the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation these words were spoken a hundred years ago but they cut to the bone of our current dilemmaa dilemma which cannot be solved without the help of free individuals who stand up to the challenge presented by the men women and little children who are sitting down in the marketplace we stand today at a forking point in the american experience we are in the middle of a nonviolent social revolution that goes to the heart of our meaning as a people the social revolution speaks to usas individuals and as community leadersand we must respondas individuals and as community leaders if we are to make an effective contribution to the continuation and the strengthening of the democratic way of life the national urban league is the lengthened shadow of men and womennegro and whitewho rose to the challenge of their times the baldwins the hayneses the woods the joneses and the grangers made a great contribution not only to the negro but also to america and the urban league tradition of interracial affirmation is maintained today by the youngs and the steegers and the thousands of other americans who are reminding us of the holy dream we were to be for more than a half century the urban league has hammered away at the wall that distorts the personalities of both negro and white americans we stand on a new plateau today as a direct result of the efforts of the league and other organizations but much work remains to be done our citiesthe chief area of urban league service are threatened today as they have never been before millions of americans are fleeing the central city in a white panic and millions of negroes are being tossed and turned by the cold black wind of despair the demonstrations in the streets are reflections of a despair rooted in figures cited by a prominent american who said the negro baby born in america todayregardless of the section or state in which he is bornhas about onehalf as much chance of completing high school as a white baby born in the same place on the same dayonethird as much chance of completing collegeonethird as much chance of becoming a professional mantwice as much chance of becoming unemployed about oneseventh as much chance of earning a yeara life expectancy which is seven years less and the prospects of earning only half as much malcolm_x didnt say that whitney young didnt say it james baldwin didnt say it john fitzgerald kennedy said it in a special message to congress and the statement contains a tremendous challenge to every individual american what can we do about this challenge more meetings more conferences i think not it seems to me that we will not make any real progress in this area until every individual assumes a personal responsibility for race relations in america in his book the ordeal of power emmett john hughes spoke of the cleansing anguish of responsibility and decision one of the great problems in all areas of american life is the lack of individual responsibility and commitment too many people say let george do it too many people are reluctant to take personal responsibility for hard decisions in the arenas of life they control the challenge we face today cannot be solved solely by education law or time but it cannot be solved without them we need law we need education we need time but most of all we need dedicated individuals carrying out the duties of free men and free women in their neighborhoods and offices free individuals negro and whitecan make a real contribution to american democracy by challenging the distorted images that blind us to racial and social reality the biggest stumbling block to interracial peace in america is the distorted negro image that poisons communications at the very roots millions of white americans react not to negroes but to their image of negroes an image that has always been out of date and out of focus an indispensable prerequisite for racial progress in america is the abandonment of the traditional american error of confusing the negro image with the individual negroes who enter into our lives there are negroes of every conceivable description of every shape and size and color there are negro millionaires and negro paupers negro phds and negro policemen and a strong negro middleclass which has grown by more than per cent in the last ten years there is a tendency in america to put negro facts and white facts into separate compartments there is poverty and then there is negro poverty there is immorality and then there is negro immorality and the two things are almost always interpreted by different lights millions of american negroes for example are poor but so according to president johnson are to million american whites at this crucial hour there is a desperate need for adequate understanding and precise interpretation of the negro in human terms we suffer in america from a distressing lack of communication between negroes and whites i am appalled by the large number of businessmen and professional people who have never known a negro as a friend and who have never exchanged home visits with negro couples white americans can make a real contributionto themselves and to americaby crossing the berlin wall that divides us i would also urge a special effort to grasp the disadvantages of negro americans a disproportionate number of negroes are members of lowerincome groups where among all people crime and social disorganization flourish more negroes than whites proportionately are on welfare rolls because they cannot find gainful employment because for years they have been the last hired and the first fired for too long now we have barred negroes from employment and condemned them for idleness for too long now we have barred negroes from the best schools and condemned them for illiteracy we must make a special effort to provide better educational and employment opportunities for negroes this effort will pay off in less crime less delinquency less maladjustment smaller tax bills and larger wholesale and retail revenue we can do these things and create garden cities for all americans if we abandon ghetto images and confront the human beings behind the myths that blind this is a task that recommends itself to both negroes and whites negroes have a responsibility to tell americans the truth about their lives and their aspirations in many areas they must take the first step in initiating a dialogue between real individuals who confront each other in truth in responsibility and in trust there is a similar need to upgrade the image of the white man millions of american negroes have never known a white man who was not insulting patronizing or exploitative we must make an immediate effort to stop the increasing polarization of american life based on the negative image of men who approach negroes with negative attitudes this will take deeds as well as words more negroes must be exposed to fairminded whites and fairminded whites must take the lead in debunking the widelyheld view that most white americans have a linein their hearts or in their neighborhoods beyond which they are not willing for negroes to go this whole problem of images negative and positiveis a responsibility of individual men and women as community leaders we must take the lead in redefining the negro and the white image in the process we will create an image not of the negro or the white man but an image of the americanneither white nor black jew nor gentile the urban league has made a great contribution in this area by insisting on interracial cooperation the league has exposed thousands of negroes and whites to sensitive members of the other race more importantly the negro community through the league has received a positive image of whites and negroes working together for the advancement of all people the urban league approach is as sound today as it was years ago there is an even greater need today for conciliation negotiation and preparation we need organizations to open doors but we still need an organization to prepare men to enter the doors and to negotiate with the men who open and close doors the league will play an even greater role in the years to come for what is at stake in the social revolution is the urban foundation of our urban civilization we have reached a point in america where we cannot continue business as usual the first order of business in america today is the salvation of the american city and the american city cannot be saved if we do not face the challenge and the opportunity of the urban negro there has been a great deal of comment recently about the tactics of different organizations most of the comments i think miss the basic point no army is composed entirely of foot soldiers men have different gifts and different insights some men are not fitted by instinct temperament or training for the front lines but we have a right to ask them to fight somewhere every individual ought to be involved at some levelif not on the firing line then at the conference table if not at the conference table then in logistics or supply giving money attending meetings holding up the right arm of the steegers and the youngs this campaign must be deepened and extended it will be necessary to interpret the negro to the white man and the white man to the negro but it will also be necessary to act to know and not to do an old proverb says is in fact not to know negroes today are judging men by what they do and not by what they say it is no longer possible to buy negroes off with token appointments and token commitments it is no longer possible to buy them off with rhetoric a deed is required in the italian film general della rovere there was an interesting scene that dramatized this whole problem of individual responsibility it was during the german occupation of italy and the nazis rounded up a group of people in a frantic effort to crush the resistance movement some of the people caught in the dragnet were members and leaders of the resistance but some were not the officer in charge tried to identify the resistance leaders and failed so he decided to shoot them allleaders and innocent bystanders on a cold morning the men were taken to a room to await their execution one man cried out in anguish im innocent i didnt do anything a resistance leader approached him and said you didnt do anything the man said no l didnt do anything the resistance leader said i dont understand our way of life was being destroyed minds were being warped babies jews christians and old men and women were being killed and you didnt do anything the man replied no i didnt do anything the resistance leader declared if you didnt do anything then you deserve to be shot what are you doing minds are being warped babies are dying jews christians and old men and women are being humiliated degraded and excluded what have you done to be human in this crucial age is to be precisely responsibleand no man can avoid the hard claims of responsibility by not acting this fight in the final analysis will be won or lost not by organizations although organizations are needed not by conferences although conferences are useful not by study groups although study groups serve a purpose not by tens and twenties and fifties but by individual men and women accepting responsibility for unpopular decisions in their neighborhoods offices clubs synagogues and churches we must not deceive ourselves we act now not for the negro but for america not for civil_rights but for the city not for love but for economic salvation and the preservation of the democratic way of life the road is not so rough as it once was no longer will chained men walk it to their dusty deaths no longer is it suffused by the dense air of suppression or overshadowed by hopelessness and despair for the road has wound up from the valley of depression to a mountain a summit of hope and it leads on to the peak that we seek to attainfreedomfor once forever and for all and on this mountain the air is so much sweeter the light is brighter and each dawn brings another ray of hope here a man can have a dream and walk with head held high for he knows that his dream will come true by and by he knows that his people have been unwilling actors in an unworthy play but he also knows that the curtain of justice is descending on this improper stage this struggle in which we are engaged began long ago we are continuing a journey that started long before they who began that struggle are now all gone and the first step of that journey was taken before you and i were born in our past there are those who pointed out the way and who led us through the darkness to the dawn of this new day the things of which they dreamed are now being accomplished by our race but it was their dreams and labor that led us here to this high place now let us pause for a moment as we stand here at this summit and look down the path stretching back away from us can you see the rocky road winding down into the depths where once we walked in a desolating smog can you see the rusty chains laying in the dusty plains where men struggled and threw their shackles off look at the pitfalls that were missed at the barriers that were climbed and at the crossless graves scattered along the way can you see where the dust has settled in spotssome wet some redfrom the blood and from the tears that were shed as you gaze down the path do the winds from the past bring ancient sounds to your earsthe anguished moans the tearful groans and in the wake of freedom the cheers do the winds bring the sounds of the hopeful songs that were sung and the faithful prayers that were prayed the hope in those songs and the faith in those prayers fired the torches that lit the way for those who guided us down that rocky road to this mountain we stand on today the view from this mountain shows that old rugged road its traps and treacherous pits its hazardous surface and dangerous curves that wind through the dark ness unlit after viewing that road is it strange that we marvel at the strength of those who led us this far who gave their lifework and their lifeblood so that we could reach this place where we are for it was those old leaders and workers who blazed the trail that led us up from the deep and who gave their strength hope dreams wishes and prayers to you and me they who gave us all those things who counseled us as we walked by their sides are the ones we now thank for bringing us here and for being our old guides not only statesmen like frederick douglass or educators like mary mcleod bethune but also the ones who labored and sweated in fields in the burning sunthe ones whose names will not be mentioned by the men who write history but whose gifts will live forever in the hearts of you and me though the old guides have left and are leaving the things that they passed on will stay with the young leaders and workers who fearlessly stand up today for when you see a young woman sitting passively in a stream of curses abuses and threats do you wonder whose words laid the foundations for her pillars of patience and strength as she sits there with tears in her eyes withstanding degrading taunts whose patient old voice comes to her from the past whispering the lord is my shepherd i shall not want does she still hear the voice that she heard as a child the voice that quieted her cries that gave her faith and diminished her fears when she went down to be baptized water from a fire hose knocks a young man down but he rises to come forward again his body is kicked and beaten but his courage never wanes when men on horses come with cattle prods and when dogs come with slashing teeth the young man falls back but advances againfor him there can be no retreat what makes him push on in the face of such oddsfire hoses maddened dogs and men on horses with prods as he struggles does he remember a man who lifted him up with calloused hands and talked to him as a child could it be the words of that man which now give him courage to stand and demand the rights and freedoms that were never given to he with the colloused hands and when that young man enters schools which he never could before do you think of those who gave him the ways and means to reach those doors which old guides gave up so much and yet were so very glad to do without so he could acquire the things they never had who fed and sheltered that young man until he went forth to learn and who waited and watched through many long nights praying for his return the price those old guides paid so he could enter such places is symbolized by their calloused hands and the wrinkles in their faces those are just a few of the things that will endure throughout the years from the old guides we received other gifts too numerous to recount here but every one of the gifts that they handed down to us will be remembered cherished and held in sacred trust and the old guides who are with us now as the peak of freedom nears stand honored by all of us during their twilight years for today the guides are changing we now float upon another sea where those who were helped now help and where those who were led now lead the ones who sacrificed so much to see this moment come can look at the fruit of their labor and tell themselves well done as we stand on this mountain humble thanks we offer to those old guides who gave their all in enabling us to climb this mountain side and we raise grateful voices in a prayer from our hearts and minds to the old guides who are not here to witness this great time how to bring out the best in tour children is your child making the most of his abilities or not doing as well as you know he could without even mentioning report cards to him you can help him improve his marks and more important establish learning habits which will benefit him all his life the way to do this is to establish a climate of learning in your home for according to a study financed by the u s department of education children achieve more in school subjectseven mathematicsin a flexible spontaneous atmosphere where their viewpoints count the study called project was first carried out at the university of minnesota researchers compared two teaching methodsone formal remote cutanddriedthe other flexible spontaneous and personal teachers who used the latter approach used some of their classroom time discussing the childrens personal interests viewpoints and experiences who watched last nights television documentary what did they think of it who read of a certain new development relating to the subject in this mornings newspaper what was their opinion of such a government policy or what reasons could they give for such a state of affairs in this climate of learning the student was encouraged to seek knowledgenot forced to receive it weve been criticized said one educator who favored this approach for not getting tough but which sounds tougher letting the student grow up and test the consequences of his teachers ideas or showing the student to develop and then test the consequences of his own ideas your own home can be a place where a student is encouraged to seek knowledge too the editors of colliers encyclopedia suggest the following tips to help you create your own home climate of learning take some adult education courses yourself millions of adults are going back to school learning everything from french cooking to symbolic logic and childrens grades improve when they see that their parents regard schoolwork as a worthwhile leisuretime activity not a horrid chore use games to help him learn word games are fun for the entire familyand help the schoolage child improve his vocabulary and his spelling to increase a young childs facility with numbers play games like dominoes or bingo if hes having trouble remembering multiplication tables make or buy flash cards rash cards are also available to help children learn foreign languages as for scientific kits games toysthere are enough of them on the shelves to solve any parents christmas problemsand give the kids a head start in this scientific age in addition you can invent your own games one family plays expert one evening a week the members of the family challenge each other to become experts on various topics each one is given minutes to look up his topic in the encyclopedia after which he tells the family what hes learned give him the basic equipment the minimum home reference works are a dictionary and an encyclopedia a world atlas is also helpful the encyclopedia is not only valuable as a reference aid for school reports and homework assignments but as a source of lifelong interests a child fascinated by a brief article on chemistry may be stimulated to do further reading on his own a boy or girl who had never liked reading may turn over a new leafand then another and anotherafter finding an entry on a subject which interests him in selecting an encyclopedia that school children will use look for clear lively language an abundance of pictures and mapsand most important of allthe most uptodate facts you can find give books for gifts the child who loves to read has a long head start for life and you can subtly encourage the love for books your childs teacher can recommend fiction fact books and biographies tailored for his agegroup and his skill in reading especially those that dovetail with topics being studied in school provide him with books relating to his special interests a boy who finds the classics a bore may devour books on automobiles or outer space put the tv set to work television can be a help not a hindrance to school workif your family watches all available documentariesand if you keep an encyclopedia and a world atlas handy during the show encourage him to use his school knowledge allow him to show off his arithmetic by doublechecking grocery tapes keep gas and mileage records when you travel show him you value books and learning praise him when he achieves and dont laugh at him when he tries to use a new word and mispronounces it help make your home a climate of learningand help junior make his mark why negro leaders lack power for more than twenty years some social scientists have been predicting the civil insurrections oneway riots that leapfrogged through northern cities last summer their social barometers were activated by fairly obvious and widely familiar causes for example police brutality in every case illfeelings fostered by general oppression overcrowding unemployment social discontent the slowpaced civil_rights struggle social dynamite comprised of unemployed and frustrated youths loss of faith in the integrity of white people and established authority the growing worldwide insurgence of oppressed races and in the words of the swedish social scientist gunnar myrdal a growing realization by negroes that peaceful requests for their rights are not getting them anywhere why then was little or nothing done to remedy these conditions before or after riots my hypothesis is that the white men of power who of course have a vested interest in blindly diminishing the signs of revolution more about that later have had the inadvertent aid of negroes themselves particularly our leaders how has this occurred broncobusting leaders item negro leaders were booed down whenever they sought to speak out in restraint against the negro crowds one philadelphia leader was hit on the leg with a brick for his efforts just as a broncobusters job is to tame and corral unruly stallions the new breed of negro leaders it would seem have the function of riding herd on mass negro rebellion they manage with the help of the white press and politics to get in front of negro rebellion then call moratoriums until the end of the current political campaign or whenever it may suit the fancy of white men of power preferring to negotiate rather than demonstrate they have in the recent past called off the worlds fair stallins the christmas boycott and by editing speeches and other means watered down the march on washington from lieins and civil disobedience a la gandhi their professed messiah to little more than an ov ergrown parade of jolly vacationers who climaxed matters with a grand and glorious dream affirming loyalty to the belief in ultimate justice from white america rev martin_luther_king jr who along with roy wilkins the washington post reports was called in to dampen the march on washington also was brought in by new york city mayor robert wagner over the heads of local leaders during the harlem riots however rev king core leaders naacp officials and others with a mind to halt the rebellion were conspicuously powerless white people dictate your policy one heckler yelled to core leaders being booed down similar reactions were met by such responsible leaders as an exprizefighter in philadelphia a disc jockey and a famous comedian it appeared indeed that as malcolm_x and an ebony editorial have observed negroes in the northern slumsif they ever had anyare fast losing faith in the efficacy of nonviolence as the answer to their troubles conference table revolution another general pattern was a belated effort by white powerwielders to pump up as leaders negroes who before the riots had been largely ignored except for an occasional grant for launching some study or pilot project they were eagerly placed on ad hoc committees for postmortem analyses and rehashing of the problem sure enough uncle tomism was the order of the day the harlem committee or jury of twentythree that reviewed the charge against the white cop who lit the fuse for the riot contained two negroes one a goldwater backer who unanimously freed the policeman of all charges made by eyewitnesses an naacp leader decried phony militancy and asserted that some white people in childhood had it rough too others preoccupied with token concessions and a peaceatanyprice philosophy took to the conference table however this is customary after any negro uprising violent or nonviolent as is also the stage when frightened negroes and their leaders quickly become again all teeth graciously smiling to let whites know that all is forgiven lowrating the rioters item during the harlem riots a policeman stood on a street corner and yelled through a bullhorn why dont you go home a negro standing in the crowd yelled back were at home this is our home baby the policeman had been trapped as were negro leaders in a propaganda line to undermine the respectability of the rioters to defame what some negroes call lowrate the character of the participants the technique was namecalling rioters were labeled outsiders as if local groups of negroes could not rebel on their own other names given included extremist elements the lunatic fringe hoodlums professional agitators agitators approved by whites are called leaders some said that the black muslims had a hand in the riots except in localities where black muslim leaders themselves quickly joined the jittery bandwagon of negro leaders going on record that we do not believe in violence black nationalists and of course communists also were blamed for the riots in order to defame them even wayward youth came under fire despite the fact that youths first got the sitin movement underway and not so much was made of the welloff white youths who rioted at hampton beach new hampshire and seaside oregon then there was the fact that only a small percentage though they numbered often in the hundreds and thousands had taken an active part even so this is as good a record as the passive resistance movement has mustered on spontaneous occasions and a survey conducted by a professional polling firm found that eight out of harlemites had never taken part in a nonviolent demonstration but negro leaders while gleefully approving the above namecalling and defamation added factors such as goldwaters nomination wine liquor and the waning number of white liberalsanything to evade criticism of the white power structure one group of ministers a full month later even took a second look at a chance to pounce on personal sin and called for a mass turnout as a silent christian witness to indicate their opposition to the riots and their affirmation of faith in the status quo others avowed that negroes were forfeiting their moral suasion and negroes of all varieties rolled their eyes toward high heaven poked out their lips and alleged ttiats a shame set us back years disgraceful to the colored race and the like along with whites some negroes were known to call it uncivilized behavior this said at a time when the worlds greatest modern civilizations are preoccupied with the preparation of mass war on a scale that makes the riots seem microscopic item leftists black nationalists and cultists were seized and raided often on tips from negro bigwigs on grounds that a couple of butcher knives an old rusty pistol and say a couple of beer bottles were found in their headquarters this despite the fact that the rioters even if organized were largely unarmed except for bricks and such readymade ammunition the arrests represented another technique what students of public opinion and propaganda call propaganda of the deed where no verbal statements are given but a deed is used to publicize the propaganda intended the tracking down of alleged culprits conveys the idea that the riots were ignited by no just grievance and were simply willfully stirred up for nothing by deranged or irresponsible individuals item during the riots signs appeared in store windows such as this store owned and operated by black men and reportedly in the case of a chinese gentleman me colored too although defamers of the rioters clung to the factor of looting as the basis for the riots looting was selective restricted on the whole to white stores besides the rioters did not merely loot they also pulled fire alarms in some cases broke windows and overturned trash cans this is in the fashion of the boston tea party during the american revolution and suggests that while looting may have been a factor for some participants it was overplayed by the white press and negro leaders this was designed to keep the riots distinct from a civil_rights quest in the public mind civil_rights leaders were anxious that their organizations would not be hurt but they unwittingly played into the hands of the white men of power who do not wish to recognize or let the world know that the denial of negro rights was the chief factor but even the first riot in harlem grew out of a demonstration against the police force over the shooting of a negro boy by a white heavyweight policeman after a white custodian turned the hose on the boy and said he was going to wash the black off him also nonviolent groups held rallies and demonstrations but merely ran out when the slum negoes who thought the ranting middle class leaders actually meant business got a bit out of hand if i had known this was going to happen one turncoat leader moaned i wouldnt have said anything both groups violent and nonviolent were striving to demonstrate discontent not merely being unruly the civil_rights tie also is apparent in the fact that groups of negro teenagers between the intermittent flareups in harlem for example gathered on street corners and sang we shall overcome and similar civil_rights songs they previously had gone to the police station to protest but were blocked out by five policemen who locked their arms and refused to listen killers must go they shouted police brutality must o the semantics of revolution although a perusal of the literature on the french revolution notes striking similarities to the summer riots and the public reaction they provoked there was a curious endeavor by many to write off the revolutionary aspects of the riots this was accomplished by way of a suspicious exercise in semantics peaceful picketing and boycottingmethods used for centuries by nonrevolutionary labor unionslong have anxiously been labeled the negro revolution this technique allows negroes to believe that they are carrying on a revolution in order to keep them from really revolting likewise meek compromising though bellowing conservative negro leaders are widely hailed as militant i believe that the sitins when not corralled by sellout leaders and the riots are part of the beginning of the second stage of an emerging revolution rex hopper from a study of social revolutions throughout the history of the world has divided them into four typical stages the preliminary stage of individual excitement and unrest the popular stage of crowd excitement and unrest the formal stage and the institutional stage the second stage which we may now be undergoing is characterized by the spread of discontent and the contagious extension of the several signs of unrest the riots that spread from harlem to brooklyn rochester jersey city elizabeth and patterson new jersey philadelphia kansas city and chicago loss of faith in their leadership on the part of the repressed group and the emergence of conflict with the outgroup in any case many of the aspects present in the riots and public reaction were as we said apparent during the french revolution there was in both selective looting and the ruling groups and the rioters own bourgeois allies similarly shouted bribery resorted to namecalling and set about track ing down conspirators instead of removing the social grievances it is only a conspiracy of silence and wishful thinking that lead white men of power and their colored henchmen to ignore the revolutionary aspects of the riots while trying to shame negroes back into complacency they prefer to use their armed superiority and scientific propaganda to restore the situation to a semblance of tranquility ignoring the devastating problems behind the riots if they were in hungary tossing molotov cocktails at russian tanks says an ebony editorial white america would consider them heroes if they were in cuba defying castro white america would be saying the government should be sending help but be that as it may if the forces behind the riots are not soon removed the rebellion will again be ignited and exploded perhaps more resoundingly next time for as kenneth b clark psychology professor at the city college of new york said recently with reference to the riots i dont know whether the average negro leader can ask his race to be moderate any longer this was the year when the negro struggle for equal rights moved out of americas alleys and into its main streets from mississippi courthouses and bronx lunch counters to the united states senate it was a noisy year but on a sweltering sunday last summer a handsome methodist minister rose in the pulpit of his newly assigned church in tucson arizona to deliver his first sermon to a congregation of strangers and with his soft carefully clipped syllables began an inspiring episode that earned scarcely a headline for the rev wilbur r johnson is a negro and his congregation is white as he spoke that first morning police cars cruised outside the pueblo gardens methodist church in answer to cowardly telephone threats that the church would be bombed if the new minister conducted the service but no bombs exploded and each sunday pastor johnson stands in the same pulpit on legs ravaged by polio and preaches to approximately the same congregation he faced last summerexcept that average attendance has risen nearly per cent as the objects of an unprecedented experiment mr johnson his family and the members of the little church knew that many eyes would be on them during their first year together not only methodists but leaders of other denominations were interested in bishop gerald kennedys bold plan to integrate a church beginning at the altar on june without advance warning the yearold minister was reassigned from an allnegro congregation in compton california to pueblo gardens less than two weeks later he had moved his wife and two school age daughters into the tucson parsonage we hardly had time to think about it recalls one church member two years earlier the congregation had voted overwhelmingly to accept any minister sent by the bishop regardless of his race but so had other churches and by last summer the vote was nearly forgotten many expressed open shock at the bishops choice at first i was worried when some members disappeared admits mr johnson even before he arrived in tucson more than a dozen people threatened to leave if he showed up but show up he did and within a few weeks all but one family had drifted back the fears of one parishioner that the little cinder block church would suddenly be overwhelmed with new negro members proved groundless in fact to several lay leaders the only disappointment of their new ministers first year was that no more than two negroes came forward to join the church they are the only two now on the rolls pueblo gardens is a white neighborhood of modest homes and many children nearby is a tidy negro community the parish boundaries include both areas but until last year the negroes declined repeated invitations to worship with their white neighbors this appointment was not made purely on the basis of race nor was it merely a token of the churchs belief in civil equality said the rev dr chilton mcpheeters superintendent of the tucson district of the methodist church in clarifying the controversial assignment frankly i recommended the appointment to the bishop in the hope and belief that the right minister would place the pueblo gardens church in a better position to serve the total community apparently he was right mr johnsons success was confirmed this summer when bishop kennedy who heads the southern california and arizona conference of the church granted the wish of both the minister and his flock and reappointed him for another months because it is in an admittedly low overhead part of town pueblo gardens has more than its share of struggling young couples and oldsters living on meager pensions both groups have special spiritual needs to be met by their pastor if by now people in all circumstances could not turn to me as their minister then i could have failed says pastor johnson allowing himself little room for shortcomings through its trial the parish has remained one of the leading small churches in the tucson district and continues to lead the districts other congregations in per capita giving if only the whole world could see how things have worked out here in pueblo gardens i think it would be much easier for people everywhere else said one member who admits she was skeptical at first while he sees his first duty as that of spiritual leader of his church mr johnson is not silent on matters closer to earth than heaven and hell a longtime member of the national association for the advancement of colored people he heads the tucson chapters labor and industry committee which fights job discrimination and he is active in all naacp activities i was raised in california not alabama or mississippi and unlike many of my race i did not have a chip on my shoulder by the circumstances of my birth and upbringing the minister explains but where i see wrong i must fight it and today i see wrong everywhere i look i cannot be a docile uncle tom the only fullfledged racial skirmish to mar tucsons progressive record on civil_rights resulted last fall when mr johnson and three other ministers two of them white walked into a small downtown restaurant and ordered hamburgers they were refused service and civil_rights pickets soon were marching outside the eatery after nine days the owner capitulated and agreed to serve hungry patrons without regard for their color but pastor johnson was not among the first to test the agreement instead he had embarked on a threeday fast and prayer session for the conversion of alabama governor george wallace and in protest against the bombing of an alabama church in which six little negro girls were killed as seen by the minister the racial problems confronting both pueblo gardens and the nation are the same and do not involve skin color as much as they do cold economics white people are not as afraid of having a colored family move in next door as they are of losing money on their own property as a result he observes and there are peopleboth black and whitewho are willing to capitalize on this fear and line their pockets at the expense of society he doesnt like the words but what mr johnson is talking about is the unscrupulous practice of block busting by conscienceless realtors who use scare tactics to force property values down for their own advantage after my appointment several pueblo gardens residents were approached by men who offered to buy their homes the minister reports for a bargaining lever they used the thinly veiled threat that droves of negroes would soon follow me into the area and knock the bottom out of the real estate market the same tactics were used over several years to destroy two nearby neighborhoods one is now a slum and is fast becoming tucsons biggest problem from the police standpoint and mr johnson has seen identical forces at work gobbling up california neighborhoods lashing out one morning at block busters and slum lords the quietly exciting preacher declared greed and hate know no racial bounds and it is up to us here in pueblo gardens to prove that christian understanding also transcends that barrier and is even stronger so far the people of pueblo gardens have shown staunch stuff three negro families beside the johnsons live among nearly white families but they are there not as the unwanted guests of fear and prejudice instead they came because they wanted and could afford to move to a pleasant section and they are among the first to work to keep it that way a minister who is unafraid to carry his convictions to the pulpit with him mr johnson is esteemed by fellow clergymen as a spontaneous speaker who rarely loses his point in too many words but between sermons a parish pastor finds more intimate proving grounds for his faith than the pulpit the bedside of a dying parishioner or the kitchen of a woman on the verge of destroying herself because of family problems makes a sterner challenge than talking to a hundred or so sunday morning sleepy heads though he admits there have been anxious moments in his first year mr johnson reports no outright rebuffs by his congregation during house calls hospital visits or other duties during the very early days i could never be sure what filled the gulf between the altar and the pews the negro minister recalls it is a lot easier to accept someone at arms length than it is to have him baptize your baby marry your daughter or bury your mother looking back he sees his first funeral as an important milestone in the year in this day of constant agitation and hypersensitivity to questions of race some people expect fireworks every time a white man and negro get together in the same room this may be true when you are talking about angry mobs but when the equation is reduced to two individuals the battle shifts back to their minds where it is won or lost on merit not blinding prejudice his words come after a year when he has won many such parlor battles as mr johnson predicted both he and pueblo gardens have drawn enthusiastic support from the cynics and scoffers who no longer respect a church that does not deal with life and wrestle with the issues of the market place his popularity sprang quickest from young people since his arrival a large number of college students from the nearby university of arizona have bolstered the list of regular worshipers though many of the churchs older members were slower to accept their new minister others were willing to meet him more than halfway despite special hardships one woman crippled and living out her final days in a small rest home happily welcomes his weekly visits but once he leaves she becomes the butt of sneers and gossip i am proud to shake his hand every sunday and to welcome him into my house declares a brave merchant who has been taunted kidded is the word he usesby several customers but i just let them talk he says stoically and i havent lost very many of them in tucson as in four previous assignments mr johnsons ministry is shared by his family often mrs johnson appears with her husband on hospital visits and house calls she is active in womens auxiliary work sings in the choir teaches sunday school and coaches the junior choir the couples two daughters gayle and karen adapted to their new environment and made friends quickly they too play an active role in the church and it is partly for their sake that mr johnson hopes for a long stay in tucson the whole family is fond of the wonderful friends we have made in tucson said mrs johnson after the first year but we would still be outsiders if we had just stayed in the parsonage and come out only once a week for sunday service the darkskinned minister adds sitting in his office one thinks back to missionaries trudging through black africa with a cargo of christianity now the faith of christ also comes in a brown earthen vessel he announces all of christendom finds itself embarrassed by the fact that it has been preaching for many many years the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man but now the churches find themselves lagging behind social and civic institutions in practicing the concept of equality for all men the danger to the christian church today is that it may be passed by the rest of the world we cannot continue to exist as a fancy little social club the negro is knocking and he is coming in he can come in lovingly or he can come in violently but he is coming in there are too many of us to be hanged burned or shot sometimes when he talks mr johnson sounds like a man who has known hate and violence all his life but he has not his early life in pasadena was almost devoid of racial strife the pain of his upbringing was inflicted not by brickbats but by a teenage bout with polio that left his legs weak and skinny providence is the word used by the minister to explain his life probably i would never be able to be here today if i had been raised in mississippi i am too much a fighter he declares surveying history mr johnson points out that the sidebyside relationship between negroes and whites has always been an intimate one we have fought beside you and you have made our women sleep beside you now all we ask is the right to sit beside you in a restaurant or on a bus and to share your voting booth lion of malawi the great ngwazi pmmr i kamuzu the lion of jbwlimalawi on july he b jrfeljre came into his own as prime minister of the independent state of malawi known for the last seventy years or so as the british protectorate of nyasaland he is dr banda one of africas best known personalities widely revered for his courageous and successful battle against the now dead central african federation and sir roy welensky he was born in of peasant parents in the kasungu district of nyasaland fifteen years after the establishment of the british protectorate there his parents called him kamuzu meaning little root because his mothers barrenness was ended by a root given her by a medicine man he was educated at the livingstonia mission of the church of scotland and adopted the name hastings after a missionary he admired in he set out to walk to south africa with typical nyasa zeal for betterment he travelled miles for nearly a year through bush country in search of better educational opportunities he worked for eight years on the rand goldfields and studied at night schools after hearing a lecture by dr aggrey the famous viceprincipal of achimota in the gold coast the man who also inspired nkrumah he decided in to travel to the united states for the next fifteen years the tough struggle to educate himself continued he went to high school took a degree as bachelor of philosophy at chicago university and qualified as a doctor at meharry medical college in nashville tennessee he helped pay for his schooling by working as a sunday school teacher during a recent visit to the us someone who was with him at chicago found a picture of the young banda in a college photograph a remarkably handsome man sporting a straw boater and sent it to him he went on to britain in and in took his lrcp in edinburgh to enable him to practice in british territories as a doctor this was the time when he became an elder of the church of scotland the next few years he practiced in london but he was also at the centre of the struggle for african self determination and his surgery at aylestone avenue kilburn not far from the west african stu dents union hostel in maida vale became a place of pilgrimage for all nationalists it was here that he formed his close association with kwame nkrumah and it was from here that he led the campaign against the central african federation after he had learnt from his close correspondence with his people of the deep opposition to the federation when it was proposed in in federation was finally forced through although in the summer of nyasa opposition had found militant expression but after federation was a reality the opposition collapsed dr banda decided to remain away from his people until there seemed a real chance of victory he continued work for a while longer among his white patients in kilburn one woman spoke of him thus that wonderful doctor with so many patients for years he tended everyones troubles we knew then he was a great man and then in he moved to ghana he set up practice in kumasi and abjured politics events in ghana between and cannot have escaped his attention however not only was there the rapid move towards independence but he must also have witnessed the worst period of political violence in ashanti his ties with ghana already strong were firmly cemented during this period in there was increased pressure for him to return from many quarters in nyasaland henry chipembere now a minister wrote that the country needed a kind of saviour a man of about fifty or sixty an intellectual with a character combining nationalism with honesty self denial and a spirit of cooperativeness and in the spring of he returned to london his mind made up it was one of the most sensational homecomings of modem times as far back as he was thought of as the great leader and when he actually materialized the excitement was tremendous this was the miscalculation of the british about banda they believed that because he had been abroad for so long he was out of touch and would have no popular support after all he could not even speak the language he had to address crowds in english but his absence had made him into a messiah so when he did return and discovered a taste for oratory and the knowledge that the people were behind him the initiative was all his although at first thought of as a moderate the feeling he stirred in nyasaland against the stupid federation particularly after he had returned to ghana for the allafrican peoples congress of december was bound to lead him to a direct clash with the colonial administration and the federal authorities which came in the state of emergency of march when he and many others were detained the massacre plot he had allegedly planned was convincingly disposed of by mr justice devlins report of later that year it was this plus the way banda had shown the unmistakable opposition of nyasas to federation that persuaded the macmillan government that the federation would have to end this more than anything else will ensure for banda african immortality the man called in to break the federation was significantly a scot iain macleod who still retains the close links he established then with banda the rest of the story is well known the release from prison the successive constitutional conferences the overwhelming victories in elections with his success in the battle against federation some thought dr banda mellowed but in fact he had always been a warm generous personality he was never as some of his enemies tried to make out a racialist his many years abroad showed that it was only the federation that roused his ire that presented the man with a challenge his present policy is to keep as many europeans as he can because malawi needs them even at the risk of offending some of his own party and as with kenyatta malawis europeans have mostly accepted bandas good intentions although some hostile propaganda mostly emanating from salisbury has tried to make out that all is not well in malawi the remarkable solidarity of all his people behind banda has made this one of the most stable of african states tribalism virtually does not exist they think of themselves as nyasas or rather now malawis he is free from ostentation and neither smokes nor drinks he had already ordered cuts in ministers salaries including his own even before independence autocratic he undoubtedly is with a will of his own and strong dislikes notably journalists and sir roy welensky but he is also a realist and quite prepared to sign a trade agreement with southern rhodesia because malawi exports labour and maintain close links with the portuguese because malawi depends economically on the beira railway if it is in the interest of malawi ill even have the devil as an ally this then is a remarkable new phenomenon on the african scene of all malawis and their traditional wanderlust has taken them to many parts of africa the most famous is also the one who will spring the most surprises from west africa usually as a sequel to the eternal question what do you think of this country negro americans are wont to ask the african what do you think about us those who have already been misinformed about the answer to the latter question will usually say i have been told or i understand that you people do not like us u the reply that the african makes to such a comment varies with the particular african the nature and extent of his previous association with negro americans his experience or inexperience in dealing with such questions and the relative formality or informality of the occasion on which he is called upon to make a statement whatever the situation and whatever the nature of the answer he strives to give he is heard with the utmost attention it is usual for part of his audience to be disillusioned by the explanations offered the rest may shake their heads in disbelief and go away with their misconceptions all the more fortified the number of times many friends of mine and i personally have encountered this question is simply alarming people are forever asking is it true that you people do not like us in homes at parties making speeches to colored groups and every time we meet people for the first time it is bound to come up negro americans are very anxious to know what africans think about them they would like to know how closely akin to them the africans feel they like to be reassured that africans sympathize with them in the social injustices they suffer most unfortunately however many of them have already reached the conclusion that africans in this country want to have nothing to do with them this is a most regrettable misunderstanding and it is often discussed by africans and negro americans among themselves and whenever the two groups meet it is my opinion that the issue which could easily have been disregarded as insignificant has grown to serious proportions by being discussed a little too frequently with hardly any attempt by either side to understand or tolerate the position of the other discussions which should aim at ironing out the differences often degenerate into sessions of recrimination and counterrecrimination perhaps the greatest fault of which either side is equally guilty is a tendency to treat isolated incidents as empirical evidence leading up to a generalized conclusion such extrapolations or projections are usually unjustifiable and misguided an unfriendly encounter between a particular african and a particular negro american is not considered simply as a case of two individuals failing to get along but must be misconstrued as proof of the fact that africans and negro americans do not get along in general after such an encounter the african goes home and tells his friends the negro goes home and tells his friends and theres one more evidence that further strengthens the misconception what we are all apt to forget is that people are people and as such will always have their differences africans differ among themselves so do negro americans even twins have their differences physical mental and emotional when a negro american asks an african if they are the same and the african says no he only means that he is an african and the negro is an american when africans refuse to be referred to as negroes they mean no offense to the negro american they are not trying to disown him they just want to dissociate themselves from the derogatory undertones of the word negro so whereas negritude is a bond binding all of us together and should therefore foster good relations it is at the same time too much to expect that just because negroes and africans have a common distant ancestry every african and every negro american should get along always and everywhere this isnt the case and will never be my intention in this article is not to traffic in the controversy but help bring it to a conclusion i hold no brief for either side though i have to admit that as an african i may not be able to divest myself completely of all of my own personal or national biases it is only fair to state that there have been faults on both sides and there have been areas of great misunderstanding where we have not taken time out to appreciate or tolerate the position of the other side africa is a huge continent so huge in fact that most people do not realize that the congo though one of the larger of the fiftysix countries that make up africa is about onethird the size of the united states africas two hundred million people though they have the common inheritance of being more or less dark vary considerably in culture traditions social outlook and the extent to which they have been affected by the colonial domination of europe nor can negro americans be placed all in one class the varying tinge of dark color in every one of them is not enough to nullify the differences in background social status parental upbringing and so on first let us consider the african in all probability he is a student in his early twenties his financial situation varies he is not the son of a tribal chief or a village head as the popular misconception goes but one can say that in the african context his means and accomplishments are above average some africans are urbane and sophisticated others may be quite rustic this varies with their countries and their background but they have all been schooled in the rigid and petty formalities and social conventions of europe and while being african their manners may bear the trade mark made in great britain or made in france thus they may be seeped in class consciousness intellectual snobbery apt to despise or sneer at whatever they consider downgraded they know who should not say what to them are not prone to be casual but are rather selective in making friends the differences cited above are not offensive per se what very frequently gives offense is the fact that some africans may be unduly supercilious or overbearing in attitude their peculiar flair for being prim and proper all the time is often irksome their airs of superiority make people want to cut them down to size they often strut around giving the impression impression of much travelled and widely read in the wrong places these are of course faults some africans mistakenly use the norms to which they are accustomed as yard sticks against which social practices here must be judged this is topsyturvy many africans refuse to adapt and persist in what may be considered outlandish behavior from the american point of view for example they wont do uncle willie or the monkey and keep talking of such things as the waltz and the quickstep eccentricities turn them into squares it is needless to say that the african student does not regard himself as a square he may not be hip according to the standards of those around him but his selfesteem is overriding he has no desire to compromise on his attitudes or what he believes is proper a certain class of negro americans fondly refer to themselves as bad or as tough cats in truth the african despises the average tough cat they consider his type of sophistication cheap and secondgrade to a more genteel and suave type of sophistication on account of these rivalries many young negro americans dislike the african they accuse him of trying to act cute or to act like white people the african on his part remains despising snobbish standoffish unwilling to become hip or to identify with this particular group i remember on one occasion a fellow student said to me why dont you take off those sillylooking things and get dressed he was speaking of my agbada he drove me to the brink of madness if you africans think you are so cool why didnt you stay over there why did you come here i have heard people say again and again some negro americans go to the extent of establishing an analogy between our relations and those of the twelve sons of jacob in the bible in any case one thing is sure before he or she comes here the african is eagerly looking forward to meeting the negro american in fact that for him is one of the major differences between studying in europe and studying in america but as the saying goes to travel hopefully is sometimes better than to arrive in seeking directions on a busy new york or chicago street the lost african naturally finds identity in the negro and is instinctively inclined to ask him for directions this may not always be the best thing to do he may receive the first jolt of disillusionment later on during his stay in this country he may discover some of the lower classes of negro americans at what he may consider downgraded behavior things like making a nuisance of oneself making noise or drawing unnecessary attention to oneself for the african this is a serious factor he suffers a let down on the long run he may be forced to the conclusion that such niggerly behavior is part of the reason why some white americans despise negro americans the thought fills him with disappointment and resentment there is an old african saying that he who befriends a chicken smells of fowls dung therefore the african student may start to dissociate from this class of negro american and find another identity for him self i have some personal experience in this field in birmingham alabama last summer while trying to be friendly to two negro boys i was robbed of at home in nigeria i wouldnt have been found so close to such boys as to let them get my money in the short scuffle that followed the police arrived and i was arrested for affray and disorderly conduct and spent the night in jail while generalizations are dangerously misleading one can still say with a fair amount of certainty that it is the lower or middle class negro that is apt to dislike the african or think that the african dislikes him he belongs to a subculture into which he has been forced by this inequities of american society in his group and among his own he is tops an established or aspiring tough cat and he conforms strictly to the edicts of his group wherein lies his dignity pride and self esteem he too is guilty of expecting everybody including the african to conform to the norms of his own subculture one of the first impressions i got after i arrived in this country three years ago is that many young negro americans have an inferiority complex about their color they owe nothing to it except the social injustices and discrimination they suffer they just want to be americans and it looks like the africans here remind them of something they would rather forget i am not exactly sure to what extent this inferiority complex is true but suffice it to say that it does exist one other factor in the misunderstanding is that africans and negroes are not always partners in suffering discrimination at least in northern us the african is apparently better received than the native negro american his airs of selfassurance good manners his robes and his farfetched accent very often unlock doors which may be explicitly or tacitly barred to negroes the reason for this is that all americans are anxious to show every visitor the goodness that is in their country they want the visitor to carry away nothing but the best impressions for this reason and because africa is playing an ever increasing role in the cold war white americans are more prone to accept the african before the negro american this is the irony of american life a negro once asked me do you think that the white family with whom you are staying would play host to a negro boy from say mississippi this was a question i was afraid to answer at that particular time though i wouldnt be now not at least in the case of this particular family on account of his socalled acceptance by the whites the african may be suspect or disliked by the negroes by his association with the whites he appears like a deserter of the negro cause who has abrogated his kin in preference for their persecutors a common misconception is that whites usually tell africans not to have anything to do with negroes they are unjustly accused of telling the african that he is not the same as the negro and must keep away from him this is as false as it is unfair in my opinion any white who is willing to entertain an african in his home could hardly be accused of negrophobia there is of course the story told of an african who sat beside a white couple in church the couple got up and moved to another pew after the service they came to the boy to apologize they had discovered that he was an african they even invited him to dinner in their home such is the irony of life in america in any case it is only fair to say that many wellmeaning white amercans find it easier to make their break with the african who is a foreigner and therefore bears no personal grudges against them once in a while one may meet an african who has been overwhelmed or taken in by the immensity of the cordiality extended to him by whites such an african may falsely reason that if whites are willing to extend to him such fair treatment when he the african is the epitome of blackness and negritude the negro must be to blame for the discrimination he suffers such africans are very few and will probably be found among the new arrivals most africans realize that the problem is deeper than that from the explanations offered it is obvious that in some instances the african has failed the negro while in others the negro has failed the african visiting africans can perhaps afford to be a little less condescending in attitude they could try to be a little less censorious of the negro but rather strive to understand him and his unfortunate social position in america on the other hand negroes should seek to know the african better while i have met or heard of some negroes whose knowledge of african history and current african politics would put me to shame i still maintain that such negroes are few most negroes know very little about africa except for a few impressions picked up from tarzan movies perhaps in the past the negro has had no reason to want to know about africa but the past is now past perhaps they were afraid of being disappointed at what they might find out in conclusion i would like to say that the biggest problems are a mutual ignorance of the others viewpoint and a lack of adequate communication it would be nice also to remind negro americans that africans of this generation are proud and selfassertive proud of themselves their continent their culture and their inheritance any negro who is explicitly or implicitly ashamed of our culture or considers his or her negritude a bane rather than a boon is hardly worthy of our friendship the audience is subtly invaded from the moment the curtainless play begins the spirituals pull you into the church where you become a part of sister margarets sermon against sin the invasion grows in intensity becoming less subtle as the characters peel off layers of protec tive covering to finally expose their pitiful nakedness you are carried along to this precipice you too are unclothed the play which packs this tremendous wallop is the amen corner by james baldwin produced and directed by frank silvera veteran actor of years on the stage and screen the play opened last march at a miniature workshop theatre in los angeles the robertson playhouse and was the vehicle silvera used to introduce his theatre of being a new concept of acting amen was an instantaneous success life termed it important a smash hit margaret harford in the los angeles times noted that amen corner is a play with no chip on the shoulder but rather a searing ache in the heart no boiling bitterness only the devastating despair and loneliness of people who have mismanaged their lives john g houser in the los angeles heraldexaminer felt that the play will mark baldwin not only as the top negro dramatist of our time but as one of our finest ranking with tennessee williams and arthur miller international fame too has come to baldwins first drama written in produced unspectacularly at howard university then buried in a trunk until silvera resurrected it a men has been invited to represent the united states at the vienna festival next summer sharing honors with the moiseyev ballet from russia the comedie frangais from france and the royal ballet from englandan unprecedented honor for a little theatre production after playing to delighted audiences for seven months in los angeles silvera took his cast to san francisco in september for a limited run before opening in new york in november the play revolves around sister margaret minister of a small storefront church in harlem brilliantly played by actress bea richards sister margaret left her husband ten years before the play opens and s obsessed with keeping her yearold son david the church pianist from reentering the world which to her is synonomous with sin margarets destitute musician husband luke reappears dying from tuberculosis determined that david shall have a chance to live his own life luke tells his wife i wont let you make david safe david wants to play jazz like his father but feels guilty about deserting his mother and the church in the meantime the congregation has decided that since margarets husband is upstairs dying in his sins and her son is fornicating in the wilderness she is no longer a shining example to guide them into heaven they set about to snatch the church from her beneath the surface of the story is the desperation of the negro who is born into a world of confusion and chaos luke tries desperately to maintain his dignity and man hood in a society which seems dedicated to his psychological castration david is symbolic of a multitude of negro youths who are raised in a matriarchy which subconsciously tends to channel active masculinity into feminine passivity margaret of course is trying to escape the agonies of living through religion she inoculate herself with the holy ghost not in order to expand her awareness but to quarantine herself from the outside world she forgot that jesus whom she calls upon so frequently said i have to die so that you may have life and have it more abundantly she accepts instead the moral ethics of the puritans who confused sex with sin renounced joy and glorified suffering to expiate guilt margaret tells luke that their sin was that they were too happy when their second child is born dead she feels this is punishment for their happiness luke asks her what did we ever do to be punished except be born poor but in her sorrow margaret rejects her husband and seeks solace in the lord i had to find me a hiding place she said luke bitterly resists accepting the church as a substitute for life when margaret wrestles with him on his deathbed to give his soul to god he tells her i aint gonna come crawlin to the lord now making out id do better if i had it all to do over aint gonna go out screaming against hellfire it would make me nothing but a dirty drunken man didnt do nothing but blow music and chase women all his life i aint gonna let it be like that you know that aint all there was to it luke dies and david leaves home to join a jazz band life has thrust itself in again upon sister margaret in her loss she wails with dawning terror somewhere i must have done something wrong this confession assaults the audience like an admission of its own guilt thinking of her misdirected love for the lord margaret tells her sister maybe luke needed it more maybe david could have used it better in the end the trinity is complete her son and her husband are gone and she is dethroned from the ministry but with the loss of the church margaret finally discovers what it means to love the lord it aint in all the singin and shoutin she tells her faithless congregation it aint in the reading of the bible it aint even in running all over everybody trying to get to heaven to love the lord is to love all his children all of them everyone to suffer with them and rejoice with them and never count the cost v baldwin explains that the price sister margaret pays for running from life to religion is the loss of her individuality she has to lock her femininity up in a closet in order to protect her son it is easier for a woman to embrace religion as an escape mechanism because she is passive by nature baldwin states but to escape from a society which constantly menaces him a man demands more action than the passivity of a church unable to retaliate against the threatening society the man vents his rage and frustration on himself in selfloathing and upon other members of his race in the seemingly senseless saturday night violence and when we stop hating ourselves baldwin added we can swing too far in the other direction we can experience an excess of bitterness for society but excesses can be corrected this is better than calling ourselves a zero and having nothing to begin with unwinding backstage after one of her emotionally shattering performances as sister margaret bea richards a slender dark woman whom one critic called pure africa confessed after my first rehearsal i cried really i was frightened i wanted to pack my bags and run back to new york silvera kept insisting that i go down into myself back to those hidden areas which i had forgotten existed or ever were but i didnt want to go back those areas were too painful that was why i left there in the first place then when i said that line somewhere i must have done something wrongsuddenly i was transported back to africa somewhere lord between here and there i had done something wrong it was like peeling off layer after layer of myself it was the most excruciating human emotion i have ever felt i had gone back into the beginning of my being and i was frightened yes i leaped years right back to africa its unbelievable what a tremendous loss our people have sustained it was so strange but i knew that this was the me i was forced by society to bury it is somethting to peel off all those layers she concluded vj and how does director frank silvera accomplish sending his actors back to their source he does it by speaking to them in his barely audible ponderous voice about his concept of the theatre of being for the past years silvera has played more caucasian mexican and indian roles on the stage and in the movies than he has negro parts last year he was nominated best actor of the year on broadway for his role in the lady of the camellias he created the role of john pope sr in a hatful of rain in which anthony franciosa and ben gazzara played his sons he directed and starred in the players ring production of arthur millers view from the bridge a member of new yorks famed actors studio he conducts an actors workshop in los angeles and previously directed one in new york silvera explains that the negro has long been denied his being he has not seen his image not on the stage not in movies not on television so he has been acting as if he were not in the picture but being cannot forever be suppressed what you are seeing is the negros bursting forth into being he is finding his image and showing it to the world and to himself this play goes beyond the stanislavsky method of illusion which portrays characters as if they existed amen is a play about a group of negroes not as they are thought to be like not as they would like to become but as they now are this is the essence of the theatre of being these characters are not as if we bes silvera who turned down a starring role in the hit play the deputy in order to direct amen continues bea says in the play somewhere i must have done something wrong in those words there is remorse and grief i tell her to be grief where does grief live where was this grief born after she did the scene a few times i told her no thats not where it is go deeper you know where that moment is you know where the pain the grief the guilt is go back further inside yourself and find it its all there it was born in africa it was born when you sold your mother into slavery now when she says itsomewhere i must have done something wrongi hurt inside the audience hurts because she takes us right into the experience with her she is being the remorse the grief the guilt the play is shattering silvera says because it allows a being to be hollywood and television are theatres of nonbeings for years ive played a mexican general a beverly hills banker a french gentleman but ive never been allowed to play a negro i dont mean a stereotype a pitiable person afflicted with color i mean a real man being is what the negro has been denied vrc the cast of amen are all members of silveras workshop and they all bes bob decoy turns in a sensitive portrayal as luke the dying horn player equally as effective and moving is john perrow as the guiltridden son a fine lusty performance is delivered by academy award nominee juanita moore almost stealing the show is isabelle sanford as the hyprocritical spinster whom no man has ever touched thank you jesus whitman maoy is also an accomplished scene stealer as a church elder veteran stage actress maidie norman is regal as margarets loyal sister and josie dotson evokes pathos as a young mother who cant understand why god in order to make her bow her head has put two of her babies in the graveyard all of this is spiced with fine musical direction by frank wilson and a compact efficient set designed with brilliance by vantile whitfield but it is bea richards as sister margaret who receives glorious hosannas from each and every critic a theatregoer paid her the supreme compliment when he said in the beginning shes just a plain black woman but in the end shes beautiful beautiful amen is not a satire on religion it exposes the falsity and subsequent penalty for confusing shallow amens based on fear with spiritual understanding based on true brotherhood as one character said if you dont love your brother who you can see how you gonna love god who you aint seen the church figures prominently in baldwins writings he admits now in retrospect that david represents him baldwin a minister at quit the church at seventeen and then left home he explains he entered the church in the hope it would make his preacher father love him but it didnt work out that way he says perhaps the universality of the amen corner which appeals to negro and white audiences alike can best be explained by the universality of its author what i have to understand baldwin says what we all must understand is that the facts of life are the same for everyone but the details are different we get all hung up in the details what we have to know about another person is that he suffers the same as we do of shakespeare james baldwin recently observed he saw as i think we should that the people who produce the poet are not responsible to him he is responsible to them that is why he is called a poet the remark was included in an article for the london observer in which the american author expressed deep regret at the traditional and stylish exodus of us writers to europe the writer as baldwin sees him is far too dependent on his environment where he was born grew up the language that he speaks to expect of the continentor any foreign retreatany magic solution to his ageold fight with society quite the contrary the really serious writer who would create as well as criticize who would exult in life as well as analyze can expect only barrenness and frustration in an alien climateone for which he has neither understanding nor feeling the point as regards shakespeare at least is well taken the eminent bard was anything but removed from his time its daytoday trivia its often absurd institutions and what a time elizabethan england producer of shakespeare bacon marlowe and jonson nevertheless has to go down in the books as among the crudest most banal epochs in western development yet here is shakespeare as businessman as landowner as amiable country squire contentedly going his way among the simple townsmen the farmers the merchants here is the father of hamlet and julius caesar partaking of pleasures cultivating friendships worthy of any innkeeperor as a modern counterpart any rotarian that he was able to bridge the gap however between art and as it were antiart has to attest solely to some fortunate and rare facet of shakespeares own individual temperament it cannot i think be used as an explanation or a condition of what he achieved as a poet to accept that proposition would be to deny the tragic example of countless wouldbe innovators through time immemorial who lacking shakespeares wellroundedness and toughness have fallen mournful victims to adverse and limited social climatesclimates that treated with neglect and stupidity their fledgling efforts at expression to accept that proposition would be to overlook the many sad casualties even today who despairing of contact of communication of comprehension even have sacked the contemplative role for some feebler more socially defined calling for indeed society is responsible to the poetin a way that only the most developed and sophisticated civilizations have ever understood and accepted why one has only to note the example of france the last three centuries or so an environment that has nurtured a vastly inordinate flowering of art and ideas including baldwins own within its studios and cafes and missionlike salons on the other side of the coin it is invariably america that is singled out as derelict america as every college sophomore knows is the actual epitome of societys neglect of the poet terms like wasteland babbittry and mammon have become almost synonymous with this muchlampooned land of the brave the truth is that the nation as a whole has matured considerably over the last several decadesin this one respect at least not so however with that distinct subculture referred to as negro america it is in fact perhaps fair to say that among negro americans taken as a society the twentieth centurythat weird exciting twentieth century of books and expresseshas not yet arrived that we are right now going through a cultural stage experienced by mainstream america more than half a century agoa stage characterized notably by mental dullness stolidity and prudishness now the word prudish would on the face of it seem the last to seriously describe the american negrothat bigcity epicurean that thoroughly emancipated bon vivant that hipster but i refer to intellectual prudishness which really has little to do with jazz and lovemaking the latter being furthermore a talent usually projected onto the hipster for people react to appearances i refer to prudishness of the mind of the intellectual faculties and its ultimate horrible result the death of the spirit a long time ago the novelist william faulkner in a somewhat fuzzy defense of the plantation cautioned southern negroes to beware of that twentieth century north the warning went unheeded as well it should have but in entering the twentieth century the negro has as faulkner perhaps guessed been cheated that is he has shared or been allowed to share only that which is absurd in its societythe automobile the televisionand has remained totally untouched by that societys one redeeming virtue a growing if belated exploration of the world of ideas for what actually are the values of current negro americana what does it hold important significant imitable well very much like the white mans puritan grandfather todays negro american and i speak of him as an entity which class notwithstanding he ultimately is places a grossly exaggerated premium on visible achievement among negroes it is generally that constituent who commands power or owns property or is conspicuously up and doing who takes the prize intellectually it is he who is most accommodating who operates on planes that are familiar to the crowdreinforcing its foolish doctrines rationalizing its preposterous mythswho is said to have contributed in short it is that constituent who fits into one of the neat categories the society of puritans has designed for itself and puritanlike defies contradiction who enjoys respect that luckless sinner who does not fit and who is hence unable as it were to render a reasonable justification for his existenceis either dismissed as different that final coup de grace or viewed with actual hostility these are to be sure quite universal conditions at work anywhere and anytime there is a newly emerging or in our case retarded social order even europe that quite definitive culture had its burghers but with us the lag is particularly lamentable living as we do among all the vestments of culture anthropology excuses any retardation in the event of isolation wanting of contact anthropology cannot answer for the american negro sociology perhaps can but that for later all this adds up to nothing short of tragedy in the classic sense of the term for it is blind unconscious and therefore needless even at the best of times in the best of climates the writers role is a staggering one not only must his craft be mastered he must somehow manage to relate his often unique mental and emotional experiences to audiences who normally couldnt care less this sounds despairing but it isnt really assuredly the marriagethe true marriagebetween writer and reader is a rare incident indeed as writers anywhere can testify but the marriage can take place what is needed is a socially recognized common ground a mutual frame of reference an identifiable and stylish language of dialogue in contemporary negro america however there exists absolutely no such language this dearth pervades the entire subculture as true of the college campus as the backwaters of the society i can recall the frustration of a prominent negro novelist as he recounted a conversation with a professor of english at a small southern college she didnt know who sartre was he plainted had never heard of him to that experience i can personally add a wealth and not all on the campuses the endless taverns for example that dot a city like chicago yield little in the way of dialogue that would stimulate even the dimmest imagination let alone ever nurture a samuel johnson for interchange is a most precious thing to the contemplative role that priceless giveand take of ideas of emotional experience so characteristic of continental creative life in the black mammon it is simply not to be attained is not to be approached my novelist friend and others like him too often are forced to fleefor contact for sustenanceto that very white community they so often attack and upbraid this is sad but necessary for that writer is rare indeed who can claim a really meaningful relationship in the american negro community who is judged and reacted to on terms that are important to him he is indeed rare who can communicate in those ecstatic electrified moments when communication is so desiredon planes that are anything but travesties on real selfexpression the sad truth is that that world in which he livesand on which he feeds for his very life is a foreign country to his community the plight of the writerthe negro writeris really a kind of paradox a riddle a joke there on the one hand is his audience that is there is the white man for negroes we have established do not read this one consideration is challenging enough for that audience is to say the least a most peculiar onerather like some rare and freak animal say with five extremely developed senses but totally lacking in the sixth that sixthby far the most important and certainly the most dangerous to be withoutis his perception of reality that is his humble acceptance of his own like our own rather inglorious condition in this universeacceptance of his equal stratification among other races of the world it is that very sixth sense that terrifying blind spot that the negro writer has the sheer responsibility to instill yes responsibilityfor the socalled white truthsayers giants like faulkner hemingway fitzgerald and mercy wolfe while they lived betrayed a most cowardly inability to broach the problem were themselves in fact every bit as deluded as those whom they would awaken and improve this task in itself at times seems hopeless and passages of dialogue from chester himes and john a williams are jolting reminders often exasperating often pathetic of the white mans unacknowledged but really urgent sickness yet as though this were not of itself formidable enough were not breathtaking and often cowing in its immensity there is the added matter of the negronot the writer but the reader or nonreader or antireader it is he after all to whom the warrior would repair at the height of the battlefor reassurance for understanding the irony is that the understanding indeed exists as the briefest remarks with any wino will suggestbut only suggest for language is lacking it is he who understands as the white reader does not that ours is not a very optimistic world and most importantly it is he for whom the writer would create weary of barren polemics or of perpetually refuting an obvious lie and desperately needing to return to art and herein lay the paradox for it is with him in his company that the writer finds himself immersed in a world more alien to his own than all the regions of the universe not even the most successful writers are totally excepted here not even those giants who apparently would enjoy great empathy that is reciprocal empathy with their brethren often among other negroes the established writer finds himself being assessed on planes very different from those of his major contribution it is often interesting in discussing say a writer like baldwin to discover that it is primarily to his role as champion of civil_rights that he owes his notoriety among negroes lost is the artist here that strange phenomenon who probably will share rank with camus lost completely the deeper manambiguous definitionlessfrom whom the real art which is actually thoroughly without cause has sprung as for other of the contemporary authors williams ralph ellison john o killens le roi jonesthey are virtually unknown and certainly unread among literate negroes gwendolyn brooks that poet so recognized among the white literati is often toasted by negroes but seldom discussed much of this complaint may seem unrealisticas it were asking too much assuredly there is scarcely one facet of the negro personality which does not have sound historical explanationsexplanations that reflect less on the race itself than the peculiar often surreal history that has produced it our art has been the art of anguish the blues the prayer ideas seldom flourish in shantytown when a negro professor of english values her automobile her wardrobe her social engagements above her library there is a kind of sadness there but also an explanation when negro college students are taught by precept and example that to wear the right clothes and join the right fraternities are ends more desirable than mastering kant and dostoievsky there is a kind of grim irony justified only by the realization often difficult that here after all is a race that did not create itself for what are we really but a tribe of eunuchs who have mystically come very near to being what the whites in fact believe us to be inhumanwho have lost that most essential possession of any tribe any human uncompromising belief in our own worth this has everything to do with the emphasis often grotesque which we place on things this has everything to do with our denial of all that is intangible in this worlddenial of art discussion thoughtdenial of those very things that redeem a civilization a society of its intrinsic absurdity this has everything to do finally with our assumption very smug and very puritan that we have sufficiently explored this universe of ours and have defined it for the universe is limitless and he who would explore it who would chart new courses among its constellations is the writer the poetunfettered by intellectual restrictions spiritual bounds moral considerationnourished and not stifled by his society and whatever the negro writer has to contribute however personal or abstract his approach he needs his own environmenthis daytoday contact and involvementto lend it substance and art he need not be estranged from his roots and most often does not want to be few writers start out for the ivory tower they are generally forced that wayby a blind indifferent social climate that frustrates and injures often unawares as the nation at large matures is more receptive to the contemplative role negro america has remained a straggler in this importantthis essentialregard and the current negro writer who does not have an unshakable faith in himself is frustrated indeed in looking about him for justification of himself of his chosen function this is not a plea for special consideration for the writer though i personally rate that member who is able to interpret his society to sing of it among that societys most valuable constituents it is simply to seek for him a clearly defined place in the social order and hopefully some semblance of empathy with it this calls for a thorough reevaluation of the lowly place to which we have assigned the entire realm of creativity and thought it calls for energy and imagination it calls for adventure foretaste of paradise a blue haze descended at night and with it strings of fairy lights on the broad avenues from the window of a small room in an apartment on fifth avenue and th street i looked over the rooftops of negrodom and tried to believe my eyes what a city what a world and what a year for a colored boy to be leaving home for the first time twentyone sixteen months out of college full of golden hopes and romantic dreams i had come all the way from los angeles to find the job i wanted to hear the music of my taste to see serious plays and god willing to become a writer it did not take long to discover that i was just one of many young negroes arriving in harlem for the first time and with many of the same thoughts and intentions within a year or two we began to recognize ourselves as a group and to become a little selfconscious about our significance when we were not too busy having fun we were shown off and exhibited and presented in scores of places to all kinds of people and we heard the sighs of wonder amazement and sometimes admiration when it was whispered or announced that here was one of the new negroes nothing could have been sweeter to young people who only a few weeks or months earlier had been regarded as anything but remarkable in topeka and cleveland and eatonville and salt lake city young people who more often than otherwise had seemed a trifle richard wright whacky to the home folks in harlem we were seen in a beautiful light we were heralds of a dawning day we were the firstborn of the dark renaissance we were not just struggling artists trying to find ourselves no there was something special about being young and a poet in harlem in the middle twenties we couldnt quite explain it but one of our advocates on park avenue made an interesting suggestion primitive man she said had contacts with the infinite which civilization has broken primitive man was sharper more acute in his intuition relying always on logic and reason civilized man has lost the one thing most essential in america the indian and the negro are nearer to the unspoiled primitive than are other people the indians spirit is crushed the negrowell see for yourself up and down the streets of harlem untamed youngsters were doing a wild dance called the charleston they were flitting over the sidewalks like mad while their companions squatting nearby beat out tomtom rhythms on kitchenware the unsuspecting stranger who paused to observe the performance was in danger of being surrounded shoved into their circle and compelled to attempt a camel walk at parties in ballrooms and on neighboring stages the older people proved that age or lack of it had nothing to do with this joy this abandon this primitivism they proved it too at houserent parties where they drank bathtub gin ate pigs knuckles and danced with the lights off darkness brings the jungle to our room darkness hangs our room with pendulums of vine the link with the jungle was obvious in the little housefront churches there was swaying and moaning and shouting wasnt that proof on a voodoo island such behavior would be called possession would it be any more real or complete than this no the american negro our friend insisted was not quite civilizedfortunately in his play and in his worship his wildness was still apparent in his work and his art it had almost disappeared the new negro was to recapture this definite though sometimes dim quality in poetry painting and song by this means he must transmit it to all america through us no less america would regain a certain value that civilization had destroyed the idea intoxicated us we went to work zealously and some americans saw the things we did and the miracle of the whole notion was that it came so near taking root our group came within an inch of giving america if not as much as our friend from park avenue had hoped at least a certain new aesthetic value it came close to repeating in the united states say what the preraphaelite brotherhood had done in england two generations or so earlier the gusto and flavor of zora neale hurstons storytelling for example long before the yarns were published in mules and men and other books became a local legend which might easily have spread further under different con ditions a tiny shift in the center of gravity could have made the books bestsellers and it is easy to see how the startled surprise that greeted the poems of countee cullen and the wonderment that followed discovery of langston hughes completely effortless lyrics might have taken other directions and given the young poets an even wider vogue than they enjoyed at first the same or more could have happened to the stylized figures in aaron douglas drawings his bookjackets and illustrations were followed by household decorations furniture designs public murals these might have started a trend had they gone into other rooms different hotel lobbies more strategically situated university libraries even so the reception which the new negroes received was warmly gratifying never before in america never since and perhaps not for much time to come has it been or will it be possible for a negro poet to say with feeling speaking of harlem let us roam the night together singing in those days it was said and meant but there were moments when the new negroes betrayed a strange uneasiness of course none went so far as to suggest that there might be something wrong with harlem or that the romantic concept that our group had the link with the primitive the key to joy and intuitive understanding might be a little farfetchedbut now and then one of us would say a shocking thing almost beyond understanding then i remember for example hearing countee cullen say that he thought it fitting that a creative artist should die young he himself wanted all his work crowded into the next few years he wouldnt care to live a day beyond the age of forty langston hughes less inclined toward selfanalysis but sharper in his intuitions than most of the group sometimes imagined that he would have his fill much sooner be kind to me oh great dark city i will not come to you again but whywhy this note in the music of the new negro something was wrong when the depression came and artists of every kind began to feel the pinch the harlem group was not excluded new negroes were scattered from boston to florida from pleasantville to carmelbythesea from alabama to the pearly gates a decade passed twelve years perhaps then some of us thought we could safely return to see what had happened to the city that had once filled us with song the harlem we found in and was another place one of the first things to shock us was the revelation that the people by whom harlem was favorably known did not live there any more paul robeson and marian anderson were less familiar figures in harlem in the early forties than were mrs roosevelt and mayor la guardia richard wright and countee cullen lived within shooting distance more or less but they were safely removed from the sounds of the streets it took an hours journey for either of them to see the rooftops of negrodom e simms campbell and w c handy lived on quiet hillsides surrounded by trees and lawns there was still a hill in harlem a fine proud one to be sure but it was not the same as theirs and the trees and lawns were not in peoples yards hazel scott and cab calloway and jimmie lunceford and the rest would certainly not have been moved by a poem which invited them to roam the night together in harlem they lived in westchester at least one reason for avoiding the harlem night streets in would have been the fear of muggers where poets went about singing in the days of the new awakening angry frustrated boys now prowled where primitive children had danced on the sidewalks hungry evileyed little criminals lurked in doorways the rent party was a forgotten legend outlandish cults were meeting in some of the housefront churches where the moaning and shouting had formerly been spontaneous and filled with joy what in gods name had happened to me there seemed only one explanation no matter what else one might see there harlem remained what it had always been in essence a black ghetto and slum a clot in the american bloodstream and the fruit it was bearing was the fruit of the ghetto and the slum the fruit of compulsory group segregation based on race the children born there in the beautiful years of the middle twenties had grown up to be muggers and cultists when harlem rioted somewhat later a fuller answer emerged it is now known that a negro soldier was shot and wounded slightly when he attempted to take the part of a harlem poulet in an altercation with a white policeman in the lobby of a small hotel the soldiers mother happened to be nearby word of mouth reports of the incident were brief intense untrue a colored soldier had been shot and killed by white policemen in the presence of the soldiers mother at first it seemed that the mad rage which followed this incident in harlem was a protest and a reaction against the true reports of the kicking around sometimes the killing of colored soldiers in the south it suggested to me a story i had once planned to write about a gang of tough slumhardened black kids in chicago who hearing about a lynching in mississippi went out and overturned the fruit cart of an italian peddler and beat him up in a south side alley this early tendency to see the riot simply as an extension of the conflict in the south seemed good enough at first to me it seemed to sweep away the claim that the south had a special right to deal with the problem of race relations in america as it sees fit irrespective of the interests of the nation as a wholeto maintain its caste mores as a leading editor asserted during world war ii in defiance if necessary of all the allied and axis armies it confirmed a belief which incidentally i still hold namely that the trouble with harlem is birmingham the trouble with los angeles is new orleans the trouble with illinois is mississippi the only flaw in that first impression as it related to harlem is that harlem did not riot against white people harlem rioted against harlem true it ravaged the shops and businesses of owners who get their living in harlem but do not live there likewise beyond dispute is the fact that the mob went for the symbols of exploitation and oppression but that was not its deepest impulse harlem was trying to commit suicide it was sick of muggers and cultists and zoot suits it was horrified and disgusted by the fruit of the beautiful years and in a moment of confusion and frustration it rioted against itself and tried to wipe the slate clean the young intellectuals who came to harlem in the middle twenties made a wonderful discovery they found that it is fun to be a negro under some conditions those who like myself had grown up in mixed or predominantly white communities even found that some segregation can be fun when its completely voluntary but the new negroes had lived long enough to learn that it is never fun to be alien it is neither pleasant nor wholesome to be deprived of the freedom of movement or of friendship or of participation in the essential life of ones country harlem must go the american bloodstream cannot manage hard clots of such size and density and all the other little harlems must change otherwise america will be balkanized into a nation of mutually incompatible minorities for the ideas and plans and the vigilance and distrust necessary to hem harlem in and to keep it there will create or maintain other harlems and all of them will not be black be towns only police l patrol car rolled slow j ly through hedonsville glowing coals of two cigarettes outlined the faces of the policemen inside two blocks down main street on the corner of fifth the car rolled to a stop in front of the bus station the two officers climbed out and with night sticks in hand walked toward the door of the only place in town to be open at that hour am a big picture window grimy with water spots from a recent shower and covered with insects around the neonlighted beer signs showed the men plainly that the establishment had no customers for either the bus or the small cafe inside the bigger of the two men who had a red face and a large paunch opened the door they both went inside and stood hands on hips gazing around there were two waiting rooms in the building and two drinking fountains both sets were equally dirty though and the waiting rooms were littered with old magazines and a conglomeration of paper cups napkins and cigarette butts on the floor when are you going to clean up this mess mae asked the policeman a hawkfaced small man in his early twenties he then threw his cigarette butt into the litter and the other policeman did the same i didnt hire out to be a janitor said the plump middleaged blond who wore her hair in the ringlets so popular in the shirley temple era she was mae bradley the combination ticket agent waitress and general gossip for the night shift the two men laughed and took off their western style hats they moved over to a small table pulled out three chairs and plopped down the bradley woman brought three steaming mugs of coffee and turned back to the counter keavy she said to the small hawkfaced man i cant remember if you do take sugar in your coffee or not he roared with laughter how come you dont have any trouble remembering what dinnett here takes she blushed well keavy i the door opened just then and the three stopped their conversation to look at the new arrivals two negroes walked across the room toward the first waiting room the older one sat down while the younger gave him a twinetied carton to hold then the younger one walked toward the ticket counter he was a tall muscular man perhaps twentyeight years old although he had an air of positiveness about him as if he knew his way around he was dressed like a farm worker aside from an armystyle fatigue cap which he had removed and crumpled in his hand he wore a plaid shirt with frayed cuffs his levis had neat patches on the knees and were rolled to reveal high topped army boots these were popular with the farm hands since a recent case of snakebite in a cotton field he waited silently while mae bradley took her time about helping him want somepin she said from the table where she was still sitting with the two policemen i would like to ask the departure time of the new york coach he said onethirty same as always want a ticket she shifted her bulk in the chair no thank you i have one the man shifted his weight to one foot but may we have coffee please the two officers who had been staring at the young man both reached for their western style hats and put them on they made no move to get up however mae bradley got up with a sigh and moved towards the coffee urnshe drew two cups half full and pushed them across the counter slopping them on the way the big man forked into the watch pocket of his levis for some change he found two dimes and handed them to her fifteen cents each and lay it on the counter mae indicated the rubber thing with upright spikes which lay there to receive change wordlessly the negro dug again and found two more nickels he lay them with the others thank you sir she said sarcastically then she returned to her seat that wasnt funny mae i know what you meant though keavy said seriously he pushed the hat back on his forehead the western style hat was a new innovation of the hedonsville police force all five of them it did however look rather out of place in such a small southern town so very far from the west carrying the two cups of cofiee the man moved back toward a table near the first waiting room he pulled out a chair for the older man and himself and they both sat down with their backs to the others although the signs labeling the waiting rooms and drinking fountains for being for white and colored had been removed the cleaner spots in the wall showed where they had been it was however the same as if they still remained for no one ever violated the taboo even the icc ruling prohibiting discrimination which was posted by the ticket office might just as well have not been there the older of the negroes had grey hair and a deeply lined face he was shabbily dressed in an old boy scout shirt which hadnt yet had the emblems removed his pants were the army fatigue kind with the big pockets on the sides the old shoes he wore were too big for him and even turned up at the toes a little he seemed proud though and as he sat talking to the younger man you could determine that he was someone who had a purpose in life officers dinnett and keavy were still staring at the backs of the two negroes keavy spoke whos he the old ones pop claridge he lives in the shack at the far end of harlan street and takes care of the dump dinnett lit another cigarette no i mean the other one the big jig keavy also lit a cigarette i guess the young guy must be his soni think his names david i think he goes to college somewhere in the north dinnett got up and went to another table to find an ashtray then he came back and sat down again mae bradley gave one of her high pitched laughs he dont look like no college man to me dont blame him none dinnett laughed and then stamped out his cigarette in the ashtray if he started lookin too fancy we might have to haul him injust on suspicion of course he laughed again very loudly david claridge and his father turned briefly to look at him then they resumed their intense conversation if hes goin back to new york i hope he stays keavy stamped out his cigarette also those ones whos been to the north come bringin all those ideas might brainwash our young folks the door opened just then and slim hankins the night cab driver came in carrying two blue suitcases after he got inside he sat them down by the door and held it open for the young woman who followed him in just then the new york express pulled up outside after it rolled to a stop the door opened and the driver stepped out he began to help the passengers out for the rest stop the ones who were awake that is slim put the suitcases in the baggage compartment then he waited while the young woman paid him he waved at the officers and mae bradley then he left the sleepy wrinkled wobbly line of passengers lined up at the lunch counter so mae reluctantly got up to serve them see you later boys she said while mae was busy at the counter the young woman who had just arrived went to the ticket booth to wait for service dinnett lit another cigarette hey keavy aint that old man watsons daughter yeah dinnett i used to date her in high school remember keavy stared at the girl unashamedly shes even got on the earrings i gave her oh i forgot dinnett replied you dated so many of them that i couldnt keep up is she fun shes a prude if thats what you mean and shes a little bit too much of a brain to suit me otherwise shes nice keavy continued to stare at her wonder where shes goin dawn watson straightened her blue dacron dress and ran her hand over her brown hair she carried her small suitcase in her left hand when she finally saw mae coming toward her she sat the suitcase on the floor the plump fortyish blond with the ringlets stood for a minute regarding the slim young girl a bitter smile crossed maes face where to mae asked new yorkone way dawn watson replied forty thirtyfive mae said without referring to the large ratebook dawn opened her purse and brought out four ten dollar bills then she dug in her coin purse and extracted thirtyfive cents in change she handed it all to mae mae took the money without asking her to place it on the counter and then she began to write out a ticket the bus driver had been having pie and coffee now he finished got up from his table and went to the center of the room will the passengers please reclaim their seats in the bus were due to leave in five minutes people began to walk slowly back to the bus most of them looking a bit more awake and refreshed than they had when they arrived the driver tagged dawns two suitcases and then carried them to the baggage compartment in the side of the bus dawn still carried her smallest suitcase her ticket envelope was clutched tightly to her purse she walked toward the side door of the station following the line of people david claridge and his father got up and shook hands then they embraced each other as if they expected it to be a long time before they met again david walked toward the line of people entering the bus outside the side door and took his place behind dawn guess we better think about goin ourselves keavy said he got up and began to walk towards the side door of the station im coming dinnett said he also got up and with a wave to mae followed keavy see ya boys mae called out she was waiting on a customer who was hurrying to buy a candy bar to carry aboard the bus keavy was looking out through the side door watching the passengers get on the bus hey dinnett come here dinnett quickly joined his partner at the door look how close hes standing to her man hes helpin her on the bus should i nab him keavy clenched his fists better not might be tourists on the bus and we cant afford any incidents see if his old mans still there dinnett looked around the waiting room but mr claridge was nowhere to be seen must have faded through the front door i guess all the passengers were aboard and the driver had shut the door the bus had started to roll down the driveway it stopped when it reached main street the driver shifted gears looked both ways and started to turn left in the di rection of the highway gosh no man look at that keavys face turned white and beads of perspiration appeared suddenly he pointed what dinnett said his eyes following the line of keavys finger no keavy and dinnett seemed to recover from their shock at the same moment then they started to run after the bus they ran waving their arms the driver turned out the inside lights on the bus just then and all was darkness on the inside when dinnett and keavy reached the middle of the street they saw it was too late keavys hat had fallen off and he went back to get it with my earrings on too he mumbled the bus gathered speed now that it was past the city limits most of the passengers had gone back to sleep near the back of the bus sat a large dark man dressed in levis and a plaid shirt he sat on the seat by the aisle on the luggage rack overhead was a carton from which a dress suit and shirt had been removed on the inside seat beside the man sat a girl in a blue dacron dress she was holding the suit and shirt on her lap her small suitcase was on the floor beside her it was very dark in the bus now there was a new moon which didnt give much light each of the seats had small reading lights for the passengers but few were on in the rear it was especially dark the girl grasped the mans large hand and held it in both of hers then he leaned over put his arm around her and gave her a long hard kiss the bus reached the highway then and turned north toward new york in his struggle to ati e tain a better present and more hopeful future the negro sometimes forgets the importance of the past which gives him roots the negro is not a newcomer to the annals of world history but can look back to a participation in international affairs related to biblical areas which dates back at least years to bc when negro soldiers served in the royal egyptian armies by bc negro monarchs ruled over the egyptian empire and fought against powerful assyrian armies many negroes have read the old testament carefully or have sung spirituals such as joshua fit the battle of jericho based on biblical themes but few of them realize the extent of the negro role in the bible very few for example are aware of the fact that moses married a negro wife and his sister miriam was punished with a loathsome disease when she made unkind remarks about her brothers spouse josephus the great jewish historian tells about the background of this negro woman in greater detail than the bible he notes that moses as a general in the egyptian army laid siege to the royal city of ethiopia tharbis the daughter of the king fell in love with moses and sent messengers to him offering her hand in marriage after the city was captured with the aid of tharbis moses married her and took her back with him to egypt when absalom davids beloved son was killed after his attempt at rebellion joab the general of the army of israel sent a trusted negro retainer to deliver the sad message to the king when the great prophet jeremiah was imprisoned by his enemies and cast into a mirefilled cistern it was ebedmelech the ethiopian negro courtier who informed king zedekiah about the seers perilous situation ebedmelech was then ordered by the king to take charge of men and lift jeremiah out of the cistern after his rescue jeremiah received a divine message which declared that ebedmelech would be saved from the foes sword because he had put his trust in the lord the book of kings relates that taharqa the valiant negro ruler of egypt was an ally of king hezekiah and helped him in his battle of bc against sennacherib the mighty assyrian chief the assyrian armies were stricken by a plague as they stood before the walls of jerusalem and the survivors were compelled to leave the holy land shortly after this sennacherib died his successor esarhardon then defeated the forces of taharqa in a subsequent battle taharqa was captured and the assyrian king set up a victory monument which showed him holding ropes attached to taharqas shackled figure somehow however taharqa managed to escape and after reassembling his troops through brilliant military tactics drove the assyrians out of the delta as scholars dig about the ruins of the ancient near east and are able to reconstruct the past it is quite likely that we shall learn more about the negros part in the biblical world just as archaeology has presented important information about great african empires so too will it shed more light on the history of the negro in bible lands her flamboyant life l years adah tlil isaacs menken went from the lowest depths to the gleaming pinnacle of renown as few women have ever done for two years she was an obscure streetwalker of havana eventually she became the most popular actress of america and europe and the friend of emperor napoleon ii and empress eugenie of france along the

awakened to every man who set eyes on her all who saw her wanted her immediately the first of the american glamor girls she is termed by the contemporary american writer paul lewis adah has exercised her fascination on generations of biographers of whom lewis is the latest his queen of the plaza has just been published by funk wagnalls adah always liked to style herself queen of the plaza that is of the havana theater although she never set foot on a havana stage she was as fearless and industrious as she was versatile she was a fifth rate actress poet and sculptor and a first rate beauty personality equestrienne conversationalist and eater she could eat more than anyone i ever knew man or woman said her friend edwin james editor of a theater journal her gastronomical feats did not mar her perfection of figure we must take the word of her contemporaries that she was dazzlingly beautiful the pictures which have come down to us provide a ludicrous letdown significantly there are no pictures in lewis book adah was born in near new orleans her father auguste theodore an octoroon and an unsuccessful storekeeper died six months later her mother soon was married to campbell josephs a most unusual man he taught languages horsemanship and marksmanship at an academy for young gentlemen joseph was fond of his lively precocious stepdaughter and he taught her greek latin french and spanish he also taught her to ride well and to shoot a rifle and pistol he died when she was to help support her mother and sister adah became a tutor in languages until an epidemic closed schools and classes then arrived the first of her protectors a footloose wealthy baron friedrich von eberstadt who was in temporary disgrace at the austrian court he persuaded adah to accompany him to havana there her flirtations and displays of temper annoyed him he deserted herand lived to regret it in her ensuing months on the primrose path adah adopted gaudy attire and developed an interest in the theater she was determined to be an actress and returned to new orleans unable to find work there she went to texas in quest of a stage job in the inn of a small town livingston she met isaac menken handsome son of a cincinnati dry goods manufacturer who was on the road for the firm they soon married and moved to cincinnati where she embraced judaism to please his family she never lived by that faith but she never forsook it still interested in the theater she induced her husband to become her agent assumed the name adah isaacs menken and returned to new orleans with him they convinced the managers that she was a star and she was accepted as one before she had ever acted in her first trivial farces she won local acclaim solely by personal attraction certainly not by her acting which was amateurishly wooden all her life in those days she dabbled in sculpture and poetry which were acceptable local talent outlets she was to write sentimental mystical verses to the end in those new orleans days of the late s adah became the first woman anywhere to smoke cigarets in public reports biographer lewis her husband was disgusted by this habit but nevertheless he accompanied her in her attempt to conquer new york there she was introduced to ed james editor of the clipper a leading theater and sports journal she was the most beautiful woman i had ever seen he wrote later so beautiful i could scarcely believe i was seeing aright her husband unable to compete with new york admirers departed and adah was married to tom heenan a contender for the world heavyweight boxing championship which he later won in europe heenan taught her to box and once when he was drunk she blackened his eye but he soon left her and she went hungry for months between brief vaudeville jobs in one vaudeville house a horse became frisky and while the other entertainers panicked adah easily calmed the animal james murdoch a leading showman heard of the incident and decided theres the girl to play mazeppa mazeppa was a hoary melodrama of heroics and villainies on the russian steppes in the climax the title character is lashed to the back of a plunging stallion and carried to doom adah gladly accepted the opportunity for new york stardom the broadway opening of mazeppa in june was an enormous success and was to make adah an international celebrity largely because the audiences never could be sure whether she was wearing anything actually she was but she never outlived one of her epithets the naked lady it was really a dangerous role but in her many hundreds of performances there was no serious mishap for the rest of her career adah played only roles like mazeppaa lightly clad equestrienne i will have to see her in other parts before i can determine what is her real line a critic wrote i feel certain it is not the clothes line the first mazeppa run lasted seven months during which she married newell the writer they soon quarreled and parted thus at she was thrice divorced such was her mazeppa notoriety that she was lured to san francisco where her success was immense on the return east she was persuaded to give a single outdoor performance at virginia city nev which was then enjoying a silver boom the miners were so delighted that they lined up to give her a total of in silver according to biographer lewis this is the alltime high for any single performance in theater history within a few months she squandered it all she could never hang onto money adah repeated her success at astleys theater in london where she took curtain calls on opening night the most popular of americas actresses has conquered us the morning post recorded britains foremost critic mark lemon turned to rhyme bare backed jade on a bare backed steed the london engagement was followed by a european tour in vienna she was sought out by her fugitive sweetheart of havana days the baron he implored her to renew their old relationship and she consented on one condition she must be introduced formally to the austrian royal family the baron with his influence made the arrangement at the grand formal reception adah wearing a voluminous cloak took her place in line at last it was her turn lewis records baron von eberstadt led her forward bowed and spoke her name to the emperor and empress she made a graceful curtsy and threw aside her cloak from a distance of feet she looked nude adah really had obtained revenge for the barons earlier desertion she was banished from the realm for which she cared nothing but the baron was forced to spend the rest of his life on his country estate bitter lonely and shunned her austrian escapade made her the toast of paris where one of her many conquests was the aging but ever amorous alexandre dumas the three musketeers the count of monte cristo adahs fourth marriage followed a casual liaison with a shipboard gambler james barkley who left her immediately their son was adopted after her death and his identity with adah was lost forever adahs last months were spent busily commuting between england and france acting publishing her verses consorting with numerous admirers she felt weary in the summer of and collapsed at a rehearsal in paris her death four weeks later was ascribed to the breaking of a malignant abscess she was buried in the jewish section of the famed pere lachaise cemetery dumas agreed to settle her estate and found no estate to settle bynow it is commonly assumed that the negro revolt is a protest of those wanting hhdfl to become a part of the existing order to get in there so to speak or so our middleclass leaders have always proclaimed but is this actually true of the great mass of slumbound negroes they want to be free of the shackles of segregation and discrimination to be sure but do they really want to become a part of white middleclass society and if they do want to get in will it ever be possible for them to overcome the obstacles and boobytraps lining their path at every turn then too those northern riots last summer were they staged by a people too filled with despair and desperation over the incredibly slow pace of their surge toward equality or were they simply a blind striking back by those who know deep in their hearts theyre never really going to make it in there and what are our leaders saying now that the much talkedabout civil_rights bill has been passed for more than a year and harlem mississippi and alabama still stand intact and are as formidable as ever in our schools we now want quality not necessarily integration roy wilkins national secretary of the naacp was recently quoted as saying now if that isnt a rerun of the old separate but equal lie then theres no such thing as a rerun if that is going to be the naacps official position why on earth did we ever expend all that time money heartache and blood trying to do away with that centuryold stumbling block the simple fact is there can be no worthwhile quality education in a segregated school that was the naacps main thesis when it presented its case before the us supreme court in the early fifties and it is just as true today granted integrated education is not automatically quality education but it is that wellworn step in the right direction i suspect that what mr wilkins really meant is we want some education as opposed to the none most of our ghettodwelling youngsters now get and admittedly some is usually better than none but some education never got anyone into harvard or bryn mawr or backwater u or even old roundthecorner tech and if you havent got into something somewhere after high school you are never going to make it in there to enjoy the good life of their affluent society not so long as your face is black that is whitney young executive director of the national urban league chided the newspapers not too long ago for the great todo they made when floyd patterson moved out of his exclusive home in a white neighborhood because none of the children would play with his kids said mr young stories such as these give a misleading picture of the actual situation plenty of white people get along fine with negroes in these communities of course that may be true but we really cant get too excited about whats happening with the plentyfew stop any five thousand negroes on any street and ask how many of their little friends are cavorting about in mansions in lilywhite neighborhoods and be prepared for the blank stare or the big horse laugh and in the meanwhile as congress made ready to pass a votingrights bill dr_king continued making headlines as friend and foe lauded and disparaged his every move but votingrights bill or no many suns will set before the majority of all eligible negroes are registered and voting in the south and long before that comes to pass they will have learned what the northern negro has always known voting wont get you in there either for who can honestly say that there is really any real difference between a george wallace of alabama and a william scranton of pennsylvania in the spring of billy scrantons troopers went to work on the heads of those chester demonstrators with as much if not more gusto and expertise as wallaces storm troopers did on dr_kings marchers in birmingham or even the heinous selma setto of last spring and although more than per cent of the negro vote was cast for lyndon johnson last november all too soon negroes are going to wake up to the fact that lbj hasnt changed one single spot hes simply talking out of a different side of his mouth nowadays as a master politician his strategy remains the same promise them everything the black muslims it seems cause white people an untold amount of worry and perhaps their concern is justified for privately most negroes agree with what the muslims are saying about white people however the muslims ultimate goal leaves most of us laughing or greatly perplexed after all we already live in a separate state that has always been our main complaint would malcolm_x have become the man with a plan at the time of his assassination last winter he seemed to be the only negro leader telling it like it is and as he told a group of students at dartmouth shortly before his death the summer of will be the longest hottest bloodiest summer ever of course malcolm made a similar prediction in the winter of only to have the heads of all the major northernbased civil_rights organizations lambast him for being absurd and that summer in philadelphia even after riots had occurred in new york and brooklyn one of the prominent negro judges called the city a tinderbox which was ready to explode as the other cities had done at the slightest provocation what cried the white hypocrites and their echoing uncle toms in pretended anguish our fair city of brotherly love a tinderbox reediculous then boom down came the roof burying them along with all their horrendous cliches interesting enough during or after the riot of none of the daily papers seemed to make mention of the riot that had occurred only ten months previous when a rookie italian cop allegedly in selfdefense killed a young negro falsely accused of shoplifting as he lay on the pavement having an epileptic seizure and so it goes again and again and again as each depressing summer wears away the paperthin walls of hope for there is really no evidence of any change of attitude in the white power structure or steppedup efforts to make justice and equality a more tangible reality for our untouchables in no mans land and even if there were some signs of change this would only effect a temporary delay in the final confrontation to put it bluntly we will never overcome so long as our society is structured in the form of a pyramid as of now there is really not enough space for all white people to get in there and until all of them make it most of us will simply cool our heels in the ghetto amongst our old friendsthe rats and roaches and the clubwielding copsknowing that the great society is only a slogan and we shall overcome is merely a dream my cousin is approaching the age when he will want to know if a negro is inferior if the fact has anything to do with his life to him life is a bright panorama of new sensations people and facts but the time is coming and it seems all too soon for he is a negro a child at present whose theoretically unlimited horizons will soon be limited by the american way of life ricky is a healthy boy of who considers himself the man of the house since his father died he has a natural interest in men and masculine pursuits though he lives with his mother and grandmother he and i are like father and son for i try to fill that void in his life i am a glamorous figure to him a sergeant in the united states air force this in itself is a source of pride to him my travels job and life seem like an exciting adventure to him we spend my yearly vacations together in new jersey i remember the trouble he was having at school one year the neighborhood gang of kids were beating the stuffing out of him his mother and grandmother were overprotecting him telling him to avoid fights and instead be a gentleman while i was there on leave his mother told me of his trouble at school ricky and i set aside a few hours each day and i taught him how to defend himself after winning his first school fight he acquired the aggressive spirit that is always a part of a man or boy some day confused and in doubt hell ask me are we really inferior to white people the answer i give will be very important to him it will direct rickys life and ambitions as a negro a responsibility i owe rickys father who cant be present i hope it is spring when he asks the question for i want to take him outside the house to his favorite spot the grape arbor his father planted its quite pretty there sowell walk in the warm sunshine towards the arbor two negroes an adult and a youth ill be seated in the grape arbor lighting a cigarette slowly collecting my thoughts while ricky gathers some grapes to eat then there will be that inevitable pause and ill begin its a long story ricky the negro race has a long rich and glorious past second to no other race no ricky we arent inferior the exploring parties of the past that charted this land contained negroes negroes have been emperors kings popes and statesmen but most of all they have been proud men the forefathers of our family came to america in the hold of a slave ship you must not think we were weak stupid or savages we fought escaped and many of us preferred death to a life of slavery our fathers built the south with their blood muscles and backs when you think of your slave background be proud your forefathers paid for your freedom they endured and in the end they won you are part of a proud family ricky we are from old virginia where your ancestors worked as slaves slavery for the american negro was awaiting its final death blow when your greatgreatgrandfather escaped from the plantation owner he wanted freedom so badly he accepted the risks of discovery and death when he was smuggled to the north on the underground railroad the underground railroad was the name of various escape routes for runaway slaves these slaves were hidden in homes wagons and forests as they traveled north to safety your greatgreatgrandfathers destination was a white quaker settlement in new jersey the quakers have long since died there but the settlement now a town still exists your greatgreatgrandfather spent his life there as a farmer its present name is the same springtown at the outbreak of the civil war your forefather joined the new jersey volunteers and served honorably as a soldiera front line soldierin the civil war each generation has had a military member since then your own father served in world war ii so you see ricky we have earned the right to live in this country i know i have not yet answered your question but i will now the white persons claim of our inferiority is usually based on a lack of understanding and knowledge a need to look down on others to feel good and what their own families have taught them the schoolmates who call you names and believe you are repulsive dont understand themselves remember that these are the same people who go to the beaches and try to darken their skin in the sun or wave their hair with chemicals i guess they want to be like us in their hearts our supposed inferiority is a myth just as the moon being made of green cheese is one if all their attempts to stop us from progressing were because we are inferior we would not have made progress but we have in spite of them in almost every job youll find a negro competing with a white man holding his own dont let talk destroy your dreams and ambitions remember that you will have to work and prepare yourself for your goals you may have to be twice as good as a white person but do it and you can have what you want in life also generation upon generation of negroes have done it before you now they are waiting for you to join them i hope the sun feels warm and life seems good when we start back for rickys home and his future life may he believe me as i believed his father one sunny day long ago horty old and years long is two has a pony tail i cant see her at the moment but a bouncing pony tail is visible over the top of the bookcase which separates me from the living room shorty is my daughter and right this minute shes chasing three cats all called goo actually thats not their name its a childish shortening of magoo ragoo and saboo the adult names of our cats she calls our cats all other animals and unfamiliar men goo its only embarrassing when the men sort of look like a goo but then thats another story shortys upper lip came out of africa it came and it lived in bondage imported by the spanish to replace the decimated red men of puerto rico there is a special pride in men who have lived in bondage and have thrown it off my daughters upper lip rich and full has that pride her lower lip came in steerage from county wexford long before the potatoes failed it had known slavery in its own land but it too pulled itself up proud and spit on grovelling and it came bringing its special gaelic defiance tight lipped and determined boisterous and gay shorty is as fluent as a two year old can be in both english and spanish she is defiant and obstinate in either language according to doctor gessell this is normal and is due to the maturational phase she is passing through im not about to quarrel with the doctor but i believe its due to her lips a couple of weeks ago shorty and i were doing some christmas window shopping on th street i took her to see the elaborate window displays in the big department stores i liked them but shorty was more interested in the ordinary toy windows i was deciding which set of electric trains would be best for her and whether or not it would be wise to buy her a football at this time when she called me her black eyes glittered and those defiant lips were smiling for all they were worth popie she said gesturing for me to come over to her she summons me with her right arm like john wayne does in those movies about the marines where he says follow me men its amazing just how much authority there is in a two year old arm mommy mommy she said pointing excitedly to the doll section and sure enough there was mommy she was about a foot high in a floral robe with rich brown skin and tight black hair it made me proud to see her in there with all those blond blue eyed walking talking wetting dolls integration is a wonderful thing shortys attention span isnt too long about thirty seconds at a shot off she ran to see some goos in the next window the more i looked at that doll the more i wanted it so with only that doll in mind i returned to toy land later in the week there was a big crowd of women in the doll section and way off on the far end of the counter sitting all alone and neglected was my doll i guess the window display was only token integration id like this one please i said to the elderly saleslady she seemed kindly and helpful she wore her grey hair in a bun and looked like everyones grandmother she glanced at the doll and then at me i dont look exactly like peter otoole but more like him than like sidney poitier she looked embarrassed fool that i am i felt sorry for her i was soon to learn that she was embarrassed for me she smiled tenderly i needed help and she would provide it she called me closer with her finger and i leaned over the counter its colored she whispered to ii i know i whispered back are you sure you want it she asked yes i whispered she looked a little ruffled but true to the shop girls code went to the storeroom to get a packaged doll when she returned she handed me the doll looking me straight in the eye damnedest looking sidney poitier shed ever seen its amazing what cosmetics can do i beckoned to her and she leaned across the counter its not colored you know its puerto rican i whispered into her ear getting a firm grip on my tongue with my incisors as soon as the words were out oh she said she stared at me very vaguely she was still staring as i stepped into the elevator shorty thinks its a great doll she calls it pretty mommy and no goos are allowed to touch it this year for the first time since the end of world war ii a buyers market exists in which the supply of homes exceeds the demand according to housing expert c w smith senior vice president of mortgage guaranty insurance corp the oversupply of homes the opportunities for the purchase of repossessed homes and the outlook for continued increases in taxes at the local and state levels plus increases in the cost of living can mean real dollar savings for those who buy homes now instead of waiting mr smith formerly director of the housing research foundation southwest research institute says one of the best ways the american family has of beating the inflationtax spiral is to buy as soon as possible with a small down payment the best home they can afford but if youre one of the millions of americans who dreams of owning a new home you probably share a common problem lack of a large down payment despite the existence of federal housing administration and veterans administration programs to encourage highratio loans of up to per cent of appraised value it is expensive difficult and time consuming for home buyers to qualify further most conventional uninsured home loans are limited to per cent of the homes appraised value thus you would need cash to buy a home in the past six years however the growth of private mortgage insurance has made it possible for lenders to safely make loans of up to per cent of a homes value firms such as the mortgage guaranty insurance corp or mgic as it is known insure the mortgage through the lending institution and provide a low cost private enterprise alternative to government sponsored programs this one firm one of the largest of the private enterprise competitors of fha now insures home mortgages with over institutions in states and the district of columbia and presently has over one billion dollars worth of insurance in force the fha was developed during the depression in the early s to stimulate home ownership by encouraging the making of higher ratio home loans to home buyers by protecting mortgage lenders against loss and widening the marketability of mortgage loans as an investment the va program was instituted to similarly guarantee mortgage loans for exservicemen although both fha and va have made substantial contributions to the field of housing finance in the s restrictions and procedural delays began to meet with resistance and mortgage lenders increasingly turned to conventional loans for one thing the interest rate ceilings imposed by congress now set at va per cent for both fha and va penalize home buyers by forcing investors to purchase loans at a discount to secure an adequate return the discount unlike an interest rate is not tax deductible neither can it be reduced by prepayment or financing prior to private insuring of mortgages a buyer seeking conventional financing who could afford to make only a low down payment might have had to resort to expensive secondary financing if a lender for example required a per cent down payment and the prospective buyer could afford only per cent he would have to take out a second mortgagein effect a loan for part of the down paymentat a high rate of interest this would be a short term loan of say three to five years and would frequently require a large final payment the buyer might not be prepared to meet moreover second mortgages are sold for discounts of up to per cent another item which is ultimately reflected in the price the buyer pays for his home in contrast a privately insured mortgage can be as high as per cent of the propertys appraised value and the cost amortized over its full term private mortgage insurance is considerably less costly than that of government programs some offer rates of about half that charged by the fha fha charges vi of one per cent per year on the declining balance for the life of the loan whereas mgics premium for example is only v of one per cent for the first year and va of one per cent for subsequent years many private mortgage insurance firms offer single payment plans of two per cent of the insured loan for the first years of coverage speed is also an important consideration for both sellers and buyers applicants for privately insured mortgages usually receive an answer within hours of receipt of the application as a result of efficient cooperation between these private firms and lending institutions whereas processing commitments under governmental programs can be very time consuming a generation ago it was neces sary for families to save as much as onethird of the price of a home before buying since the maximum available loans were about twothirds the cost of a house today even though you may be financially able to put down per cent to per cent it may be wiser to buy with only per cent down you can achieve your goal of providing your family with better living conditions sooner without unduly depleting your savings liquidating income producing investments or resorting to high cost secondary financing the buyer also usually has movingin expenses such as major appliances draperies carpeting and other household equipment by purchasing these items for cash with savings from a lower down payment the new owner avoids the high interest rates for short term credit and burden of additional payments a lower down payment allows him to amortize all his outlays over the period of his mortgage at a lower interest rate than would otherwise be available if we continue to experience gradual inflation the buyer will be able to repay the loan over a period of years with a greater number of cheaper dollars furthermore deductions can be made on the federal income tax return for loan interest and real estate taxes which further offset the larger mortgage finally ease of resale is a strong argument for buying a house with a small down payment want to sell your home when youre ready to trade up to a bigger home or must move to a new areaassuming the credit of the buyer is goodthe house with the larger mortgage will sell faster there will be more potential buyers who can meet the smaller down payment requirement as housing costs and living exm penses riselimiting buyers opportunities to accumulate savings for down paymentsthe demand for high ratio loans is expected to increase private mortgage insurance firms will enable conventional lending institutions to expand their services to meet home buyers demandsthus providing a continuing stimulus to the national housing economy the war on poverty has been the recipient of a great deal of coverage from all the various mass communication media almost all of us have heard of it but just what does it have to offer will it be like so many other large government programs in that the very people it was designed to aid might be left out because they really dont know how to avail themselves of its benefits it is hoped that this presentation will answer some of the general questions and present enough of a basis for interested negroes to discover just what the war on poverty can mean to them the major thrusts of the war on poverty are being directed by the office of economic opportunity of the executive office of the president the present director is r sargent shriver of the peace corps this organization was set up under the economic opportunity act of the act was passed last august and the money funded to the agency in october the original request from the presidents office was for million but the congress cut the actual award to million the request for the coming fiscal year will be one and one half billion dollars its obvious that there is already a great deal of money allocated for the poverty program and all indications point to an increase in such funds how does all of this affect the negrothe major drive of the program is to aid in eradicating poverty negroes have a higher per capita rate in the poverty category than any other ethnic group the natural consequence of this could be that the negro will benefit more per capita than any other ethnic group but in order to spell out in greater detail just how negroes can benefit it will be necessary to review the various provisions of the economic opportunity act itself a summary of the economic opportunity act of the director has a planning and coordinating staff responsible for coordinating the povertyrelated programs of all government agencies within the oeo separate staffs operate a job corps a program for volunteers in service to america vista a community action program and special programs for migrant workers in addition the oeo distributes funds to existing agencies to operate other programs authorized under the bill worktraining programs administered through the labor department workstudy programs and adults basic education through hew special rural antipoverty programs through agriculture small business loans through the small business administration and community work and training projects for welfare recipients through hew following is a summary of the programs authorized under the economic opportunity act of title iyouth programs there are certain inherent dynamics of the program as it now stands that make it particularly timely for negroes to avail themselves of the benefits from it the first being that both president johnson and the director r sargent shriver are known for their rather liberal attitudes both are aware that any such program that is geared to stamp out poverty has to have extraordinary significance forand contact withthe negro but knowing this they both supported and pushed for the program which of course takes them out of the area of theoretical liberals into the area of practicing liberals the upshot of it all is that negroes can expect most favorable consideration insofar as the top leaders of the program are concerned another dynamic of the program that makes it advantageous for negroes to act now stems from the fact that the office of economic opportunity didnt get its funds until october and thus is still in the process of organizing and must commit its present funds by june the end of the government fiscal year the result of this peculiar set of circumstances and pressures is that money is being awarded rather liberally to almost any legitimate program proposal another factor that works in the favor of favorable disposition of requests now is the fact that no hard and fast rules have been established as yet there are no precedents from former programs or those set by experience since there have never been any such previous programs the officials of the program are literally operating by the seat of their pants there are just two areas where the negro seeking aid might encounter difficulty there are some cities where the local government has chosen to act as the distributing agency for the government funds this means local government control of funds and the liberal aspect of the wards might be decreased or increased depending upon the convictions of the local government officials in addition to this there are usually conservative elements of the business community who bring pressure to bear against such programs this can be quite effective in cases where local administrators of the funds are susceptible to such pressures the second area of difficulty arises around the legitimacy and adequacy of the program proposed and the ability of the group involved to demonstrate that they have assets totaling per cent of the amount requested but assuming that a group of interested citizens have a serious and well planned proposal that meets a definite need of their community in the pertinent areas listed under the various titles then they should encounter no great difficulty in getting fair consideration for their proposals i say this even though i mentioned previously that there might be cases where conservative forces are at work these elements can be discounted a bit at this time because like the federal agency the local agency also has to award its money in order to get more for the next fiscal year so it behooves them to forget conservative considerations in the interest of anticipated increases in funds having attempted to show that generally speaking such funds are readily available to negroes the next step would be to explain something of the mechanics involved in getting the money the proposed organization must be a private nonprofit organization or a part of the existing local government structure in the case of a private group they would have to incorporate themselves as a private nonprofit agency the next step would be to organize the goals and ideals that the group wishes to accomplish following this should be a budget that would list the amount of funds needed to execute the proposed program for the next year all of this and other pertinent data should be submitted to the federal or local government agency handling the program heading under which the project falls in the case of the federal agency the usual procedure is for the agency to review the request and deciding favorably on it it would then make a small program development grant which would allow the new group to get better organized and consult with a counselor trom the agencyinquestion about the proposed program after this hurdle has been successfully cleared there usually follows a grant for the remainder of the approved request this is called a conduct and administration grant now the group is in business as previously mentioned the organizing group must show that it has assets of per cent of the total requested this doesnt necessarily have to be in the nature of cash it can be any tangible asset like equipment office space or free talent at the present the per cent aspect is rather liberally interpreted for two years the government will award up to per cent of the funds after two years the government at its discretion can maintain this relationship but more usually the relationship will gravitate to more exact and detailed advice and information can readily be gotten from the agency that administers the area under which the proposed program falls but now is definitely the most favorable time for negroes to attempt to get their proper portion of help under this program there are certain factors that are operating now that will eventually resolve themselves and accompanying them may also be the more liberal elements that now exist here is an opportunity for negro organizations to begin to take care of their own problems it is an unparalleled opportunity for negroes to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and compassion for their own people how long this chance remains with us depends on how effectively and dramatically we make our desires known and feltnow why wait the late insurrection in southampton has greatly excited the public mind and led to a thousand idle exaggerated and mischievous reports it is the first instance in our history of an open rebellion of the slaves and attended with such atrocious circumstances of cruelty and destruction as could not fail to leave a deep impression not only upon the minds of the community where this fearful tragedy was wrought but throughout every portion of our country in which this population is to be found public curiosity has been on the stretch to understand the origin and progress of this dreadful conspiracy and the motives which influences its diabolical actors the insurgent slaves had all been destroyed or apprehended tried and executed with the exception of the leader without revealing anything at all satisfactory as to the motives which governed them or the means by which they expected to accomplish their object every thing connected with this sad affair was wrapt in mystery until nat turner the leader of this ferocious band whose name has resounded throughout our widely extended empire was captured this great bandit was taken by a single individual in a cave near the residence of his late owner on sunday the thirtieth of october without attempting to make the slightest resistance and on the following day safely lodged in the jail of the county his captor was benjamin phipps with a shot gun well charged nats only weapon was a small light sword which he immediately surrendered and begged that his life might be spared since his confinement by permission of the jailor i have had ready access to him and finding that he was willing to make a full and free confession of the origin progress and consummation of the insurrectory movements of the slaves of which he was the contriver and head i determined for the gratification of public curiosity to commit his statements to writing and publish them with little or no variation from his own words that this is a faithful record of his confessions the annexed certificate of the county court of southampton will attest they certainly bear one stamp of truth and sincerity he makes no attempt as all the other insurgents who were examined did to exculpate himself but frankly acknowledges his full participation in all the guilt of the transaction he was not only the contriver of the conspiracy but gave the first blow towards its execution it will thus appear that whilst every thing upon the surface of society wore a calm and peaceful aspect whilst not one note of preparation was heard to warn the devoted inhabitants of woe and death a gloomy fanatic was revolving in the recesses of his own dark bewildered and overwrought mind schemes of indiscriminate massacre of the whitesschemes too fearfully executed as far as his fiendish band proceeded in their desolating march no cry for mercy penetrated their flinty bosoms no acts of remembered kindness made the least impression upon these remorseless murderers men women and children from hoary age to helpless infancy were involved in the same cruel fate never did a band of savages do their work of death more unsparingly apprehension for their own personal safety seems to have been the only principle of restraint in the whole course of their bloody proceedings and it is not the least remarkable feature in this horrid transaction that a band actuated by such hellish purposes should have resisted so feebly when met by the whites in arms desperation alone one would think might have led to greater efforts more than twenty of them attacked dr blunts house on tuesday morning a little before daybreak defended by two men and three boys they fled precipitately at the first fire and their future plans of mischief were entirely disconcerted and broken up escaping thence each individual sought his own safety either in concealment or by returning home with the hope that his participation might escape detection and all were shot down in the course of a few days or captured and brought to trial and punishment nat has survived all his followers and the gallows will speedily close his career his own account of the conspiracy is submitted to the public without comment it reads an awful and it is hoped a useful lesson as to the operations of a mind like his endeavoring to grapple with things beyond its reach how it first became bewildered and confounded and finally corrupted and led to the conception and perpetration of the most atrocious and heartrending deeds it is calculated also to demonstrate the policy of our laws in restraint of this class of our population and to induce all those entrusted with their execution as well as our citizens generally to see that they are strictly and rigidly enforced each particular community should look to its own safety whilst the general guardians of the laws keep a watchful eye over all if nats statements can be relied on the insurrection in this county was entirely local and his designs confided but to a few and these in his immediate vicinity it was not instigated by motives of revenge or sudden anger but the results of long deliberation and a settled purpose of mind the offspring of gloomy fanaticism acting upon materials but too well prepared for such impressions it will be long remembered in the annals of our country and many a mother as she presses her infant darling to her bosom will shudder at the recollections of nat turner and his band of ferocious miscreants believing the following narrative by removing doubts and conjectures from the public mind which otherwise must have remained would give general satisfaction it is respectfully submitted to the public by their obedient servant agreeable to his own appointment on the evening he was committed to prison with permission of the jailor i visited nat on tuesday the st november when without being questioned at all he commenced his narrative in the following words siryou have asked me to give a history of the motives which induced me to undertake the late insurrection as you call it to do so i must go back to the days of my infancy and even before i was born i was thirtyone years of age the d of october last and born the property of benj turner of this country in my childhood a circumstance occurred which made an indelible impression on my mind and laid the groundwork of that enthusiasm which has terminated so fatally to many both white and black and for which i am about to atone at the gallows it is here necessary to relate this circumstancetrifling as it may seem it was the commencement of that belief which has grown with time and even now sir in this dungeon helpless and forsaken as i am i cannot divest myself of being at play with other children when three or four years old i was telling them something which my mother overhearing said it had happened before i was born i stuck to my story however and related some things which went in her opinion to confirm it others being called on were greatly astonished knowing that these things had happened and caused them to say in my hearing i surely would be a prophet as the lord had shown me things that had happened before my birth and my father and mother strength ened me in this my first impression saying in my presence i was intended for some great purpose which they had always thought from certain marks on my head and breasta parcel of excresences which i believe are not at all uncommon particularly among negroes as i have seen several with the same in this case he has either cut them off or they have nearly disappeared my grandmother who was very religious and to whom i was much attached my master who belonged to the church and other religious persons who visited the house and whom i often saw at prayers noticing the singularity of my manners i suppose and my uncommon intelligence for a child remarked i had too much sense to be raised and if i was i would never be of any service to any one as a slave to a mind like mine restless inquisitive and observant of everything that was passing it is easy to suppose that religion was the subject to which it would be directed and although this subject principally occupied my thoughts there was nothing that i saw or heard of to which my attention was not directed the manner in which i learned to read and write not only had great influence on my own mind as i acquired it with the most perfect ease so much so that i have no recollection whatever of learning the alphabet but to the astonishment of the family one day when a book was shown me to keep me from crying i began spelling the names of the different objects this was a source of wonder to all in the neighborhood particularly the blacks and this learning was constantly improved at all opportunities when i got large enough to go to work while employed i was reflecting on many things that would present themselves to my imagination and whenever an opportunity occurred of looking at a book when the school children were getting their lessons i would find many things that the fertility of my own imagination had depicted to me before all my time not devoted to my masters service was spent either in prayer or in making experiments in casting different things in moulds made of earth in attempting to make paper gunpowder and many other experiments that although i could not perfect yet convinced me of its practicability if i had the means i was not addicted to stealing in my youth nor have ever been yet such was the confidence of the negroes in the neighborhood even at this early period of my life in my superior judgment that they would often carry me with them when they were going on any roguery to plan for them growing up among them with this confidence in my superior judgment and when this in their opinions were perfected by divine inspiration from the circumstances already alluded to in my infancy and which belief was ever afterwards zealously inculcated by the austerity of my life and manners which became the subject of remark by white and black having soon discovered to be great i must appear so and therefore studiously avoided mixing in society and wrapped myself in mystery devoting my time to fasting and prayer by this time having arrived to mans estate and hearing the scriptures commented on at meetings i was struck with that particular passage which says seek ye the kingdom of heaven and all things shall be added unto you i reflected much on this passage and prayed daily for light on this subject as i was praying one day at my plough the spirit spoke to me saying seek ye the kingdom of heaven and all things shall be added unto you questionwhat do you mean by the spirit answerthe spirit that spoke to the prophets in former days and i was greatly astonished and for two years prayed continually whenever my duty would permit and then again i had the same revelation which fully confirmed me in the impression that i was ordained for some great purpose in the hands of the almighty several years rolled round in which many events occurred to strengthen me in this my belief at this time i reverted in my mind to the remarks made of me in my childhood and the things that had been shown me and as it had been said of me in my childhood by those by whom i had been taught to pray both white and black and in whom i had the greatest confidence that i had too much sense to be raised and if i was i would never be of any use as a slave now finding i had arrived to mans estate and was a slave and these revelations being made known to me i began to direct my attention to this great object to fulfil the purpose for which by this time i felt assured was intended knowing the influence i had obtained over the minds of my fellowservants not by the means of conjuring and such like tricks for to them i always spoke of such things with contempt but by the communion of the spirit whose revelations i often communicated to them and they believed and said my wisdom came from god i now began to prepare them for my purpose by telling them something was about to happen that would terminate in fulfilling the great promise that had been made to me about this time i was placed under an overseer from whom i ran away and after remaining in the woods thirty days i returned to the astonishment of the negroes on the plantation who thought i had made my escape to some other part of the country as my father had done before but the reason of my return was that the spirit appeared to me and said i had my wishes directed to the things of this world and not to the kingdom of heaven and that i should return to the service of my earthly masterfor he who knoweth his masters will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes and thus have i chastened you and the negroes found fault and murmured against me saying that if they had my sense they would not serve any master in the world and about this time i had a visionand i saw white spirits and black spirits engaged in battle and the sun was darkenedthe thunder rolled in the heavens and blood flowed in streamsand i heard a voice saying such is your luck such you are called to see and let it come rough or smooth you must surely bear it i now withdrew myself as much as my situation would permit from the intercourse of my fellowservants for the avowed purpose of serving the spirit more fully and it appeared to me and reminded me of the things it had already shown me and that it would then reveal to me the knowledge of the elements the revolution of the planets the operation of tides and changes of the seasons after this revelation in the year and the knowledge of the elements being made known to me i sought more than ever to obtain true holiness before the great day of judgment should appear and then i began to receive the true knowledge of faith and from the first steps of righteousness until the last was i made perfect and the holy ghost was with me and said behold me as i stand in the heavens and i looked and saw the forms of men in different attitudes and there were lights in the sky to which the children of darkness gave other names than what they really were for they were the lights of the saviours hands stretched forth from east to west even as they were extended on the cross on calvary for the redemption of sinners and i wondered greatly at these miracles and prayed to be informed of a certainty of the meaning thereof and shortly afterwards while laboring in the field i discovered drops of blood on the corn as though it were dew from heaven and i communicated it to many both white and black in the neighborhood and i then found on the leaves in the woods hieroglyphic characters and numbers with the forms of men in different attitudes portrayed in blood and representing the figures i had seen before in the heavens and now the holy ghost had revealed itself to me and made plain the miracles it had shown me for as the blood of christ had been shed on this earth and had ascended to heaven for the salvation of sinners and was now returning to earth again in the form of dew and as the leaves on the trees bore the impression of the figures i had seen in the heavens it was plain to me that the saviour was about to lay down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men and the great day of judgment was at hand about this time i told these things to a white man etheldred t brantley on whom it had a wonderful effect and he ceased from his wickedness and was attacked immediately with a cutaneous eruption and blood oozed from the pores of his skin and after praying and fasting nine days he was healed and the spirit appeared to me again and said as the saviour had been baptized so should we be alsoand when the white people would not let us be baptized by the church we went down into the water together in the sight of many who reviled us and were baptized by the spirit after this i rejoiced greatly and gave thanks to god and on the th of may i heard a loud noise in the heavens and the spirit instantly appeared to me and said the serpent was loosened and christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men and that i should take it on and fight against the serpent for the time was fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first questiondo you not find yourself mistaken now answerwas not christ crucified and by signs in the heavens that it would make known to me when i should commence the great work and until the first sign appeared i should conceal it from the knowledge of men and on the appearance of the sign the eclipse of the sun last february i should arise and prepare myself and slay my enemies with their own weapons and immediately on the sign appearing in the heavens the seal was removed from my lips and i communicated the great work laid out for me to do to four in whom i had the greatest confidence henry hark nelson and sam it was intended by us to have begun the work of death on the th of july last many were the plans formed and rejected by us and it affected my mind to such a degree that i fell sick and the time passed without our coming to any determination how to commence still forming new schemes and rejecting them when the sign appeared again which determined me not to wait longer since the commencement of i had been living with mr joseph travis who was to me a kind master and placed the greatest confidence in me in fact i had no cause to complain of his treatment to me on saturday evening the th of august it was agreed between henry hark and myself to prepare a dinner the next day for the men we expected and then to concert a plan as we had not yet determined on any hark on the following morning brought a pig and henry brandy and being joined by sam nelson will and jack they prepared in the woods a dinner where about three oclock i joined them questionwhy were you so backward in joining them answerthe same reason that had caused me not to mix with them for years before i saluted them on coming up and asked will how came he there he answered his life was worth no more than others and his liberty as dear to him i asked him if he thought to obtain it he said he would or lose his life this was enough to put him in full confidence jack i knew was only a tool in the hands of hark it was quickly agreed we should commence at home mr j travis on that night and until we had armed and equipped ourselves and gathered sufficient force neither age nor sex was to be spared which was invariably adhered to we remained at the feast until about two hours in the night when we went to the house and found austin they all went to the cider press and drank except myself on returning to the house hark went to the door with an axe for the purpose of breaking it open as we knew we were strong enough to murder the family if they were awaked by the noise but reflecting that it might create an alarm in the neighborhood we determined to enter the house secretly and murder them whilst sleeping hark got a ladder and set it against the chimney on which i ascended and hoisting a window entered and came down stairs unbarred the door and removed the guns from their places it was then observed that i must spill the first blood on which armed with a hatchet and accompanied by will i entered my masters chamber it being dark i could not give a death blow the hatchet glanced from his head he sprang from the bed and called his wife it was his last word will laid him dead with a blow of his axe and mrs travis shared the same fate as she lay in bed the murder of this family five in number was the work of a moment not one of them awoke there was a little infant sleeping in a cradle that was forgotten until we had left the house and gone some distance when henry and will returned and killed it we got here four guns that would shoot and several old muskets with a pound or two of powder we remained some time at the barn where we paraded i formed them in line as soldiers and after carrying them through all the manoeuvers i was master of marched them off to mr salathul francis about six hundred yards distant sam and will went to the door and knocked mr francis asked who was there sam replied it was him and he had a letter for him on which he got up and came to the door they immediately seized him and dragging him out a little from the door he was dispatched by repeated blows on the head there was no other white person in the family we started from there for mrs reeses maintaining the most perfect silence on our march where finding the door unlocked we entered and murdered mrs reese in her bed while sleeping her son awoke but it was only to sleep the sleep of death he had only time to say who is that and he was no more from mrs reeses we went to mrs turners a mile distant which we reached about sunrise on monday morning henry austin and sam went to the still where finding mr peebles austin shot him and the rest of us went to the house as we approached the family discovered us and shut the door vain hope will with one stroke of his axe opened it and we entered and found mrs turner and mrs newsome in the middle of the room almost frightened to death will immediately killed mrs turner with one blow of his axe i took mrs newsome by the hand and with the sword i had when i was apprehended i struck her several blows over the head but not being able to kill her as the sword was dull will turning around and discovering it dispatched her also a general destruction of property and search for money and ammunition always succeeded the murders by this time my company amounted to fifteen and nine men mounted who started for mrs whiteheads the other six were to go through a byway to mr bryants and rejoin us at mrs whiteheads as we approached the house we discovered mr richard whitehead standing in the cotton patch near the lane fence we called him over into the lane and will the executioner was near at hand with his fatal axe to send him to an untimely grave as we pushed on to the house i discovered some one run around the garden and thinking it was some of the white family i pursued them but finding it was a servant girl belonging to the house i returned to commence the work of death but they whom i left had not been idle all the family were already murdered but mrs whitehead and her daughter margaret as i came round to the door i saw will pulling mrs whitehead out of the house and at the step he nearly severed her head from her body with his broad axe miss margaret when i discovered her had concealed herself in the corner formed by the projection of the cellar cap from the house on my approach she fled but was soon overtaken and after repeated blows with the sword i killed her by a blow on the head with a fence rail by this time the six who had gone by mr bryants rejoined us and informed me they had done the work of death assigned them we again divided part going to mr richard porters and from thence to nathaniel francis the others to mr howell harris and mr t doyles on my reaching mr porters he had escaped with his family i understood there that the alarm had already spread and i immediately returned to bring up those sent to mr doyles and mr howell harristhe party i left going on to mr francis having told them i would join them in that neighborhood i met those sent to mr doyles and mr harris returning having met mr doyle on the road and killed him and learning from some who joined them that mr harris was from home i immediately pursued the course taken by the party gone on before but knowing they would complete the work of death and pillage at mr francis before i could get there i went to mr peter edwards expecting to find them there but they had been here also i then went to mr john t barrows they had been here and murdered him i pursued on their track to capt newit harris where i found the greater part mounted and ready to start the men now amounting to about forty shouted and hurrahed as i rode up some were in the yard loading their guns others drinking they said captain harris and his family had escaped the property in the house they destroyed robbing him of money and other valuables i ordered them to mount and march instantly this was about nine or ten oclock monday morning i proceeded to mr levi wallers two or three miles distant i took my station in the rear and as it was my object to carry terror and devastation wherever we went i placed fifteen or twenty of the best armed and most to be relied on in front who generally approached the houses as fast as their horses could run this was for two purposesto prevent their escape and strike terror to the inhabitants on this account i never got to the houses after leaving mrs whiteheads until the murders were committed except in one case i some times got in sight in time to see the work of death completed viewed the mangled bodies as they lay in silent satisfaction and immediately started in quest of other victims having murdered mrs waller and ten children we started for mr william williams having killed him and two little boys that were there while engaged in this mrs williams fled and got some distance from the house but she was pursued overtaken and compelled to get up behind one of the company who brought her back and after showing her the mangled body of her lifeless husband she was told to get down and lay by his side where she was shot dead i then started for mr jacob williams where the family were murdered here we found a young man named drury who had come on business with mr williams he was pursued overtaken and shot mrs vaughans was the next place we visited and after murdering the family here i determined on starting for jerusalem our number amounted now to fifty or sixty all mounted and armed with guns axes swords and clubs on reaching mr james w parkers gate immediately on the road leading to jerusalem and about three miles distant it was proposed to me to call there but i objected as i knew he was gone to jerusalem and my object was to reach there as soon as possible but some of the men having relations at mr parkers it was agreed that they might call and get his people i remained at the gate on the road with seven or eight the others going across the field to the house about half a mile off after waiting some time for them i became impatient and started to the house for them and on our return we were met by a party of white men who had pursued our bloodstained track and who had fired on those at the gate and dispersed them which i knew nothing of not having been at that time rejoined by any of them immediately on discovering the whites i ordered my men to halt and form as they appeared to be alarmed the white men eighteen in number approached us in about one hundred yards when one of them fired this was against the positive orders of captain alexander p peete who commanded and who had directed the men to reserve their fire until within thirty paces and i discovered about half of them retreating i then ordered my men to fire and rush on them the few remaining stood their ground until we approached within fifty yards when they fired and retreated we pursued and overtook some of them who we thought we left dead they were not killed after pursuing them about two hundred yards and rising a little hill i discovered they were met by another party and had halted and were reloading their guns this was a small party from jerusalem who knew the negroes were in the field and had just tied their horses to await their return to the road knowing that mr parker and family were in jerusalem but knew nothing of the party that had gone in with captain peete on hearing the firing they immediately rushed to the spot and arrived just in time to arrest the progress of these barbarous villians and save the lives of their friends and fellowcitizens thinking that those who retreated first and the party who fired on us at fifty or sixty yards distant had all only fallen back to meet others with ammunition as i saw them reloading their guns and more coming up than i saw at first and several of my bravest men being wounded the others became panicstruck and squandered over the field the white men pursued and fired on us several times hark had his horse shot under him and i caught another for him as it was running by me five or six of my men were wounded but none left on the field finding myself defeated here i instantly determined to go through a private way and cross the nottoway river at the cypress bridge three miles below jerusalem and attack that place in the rear as i expected they would look for me on the other road and i had a great desire to get there to procure arms and ammunition after going a short distance in this private way accompanied by about twenty men i overtook two or three who told me the others were dispersed in every direction after trying in vain to collect a sufficient force to proceed to jerusalem i determined to return as i was sure they would make back to their old neighborhood where they would rejoin me make new recruits and come down again on my way back i called at mrs thomas mrs spencers and several other places the white families having fled we found no more victims to gratify our thirst for blood we stopped at maj ridleys quarter for the night and being joined by four of his men with the recruits made since my defeat we mustered now about forty strong after placing out sentinels i laid down to sleep but was quickly roused by a great racket starting up i found some mounted and others in great confusion one of the sentinels having given the alarm that we were about to be attacked i ordered some to ride round and reconnoitre and on their return the others being more alarmed not knowing who they were fled in different ways so that i was reduced to about twenty again with this i determined to attempt to recruit and proceed to rally in the neighborhood i had left dr blunts was the nearest house which we reached just before day on riding up the yard hark fired a gun we expected dr blunt and his family were at maj rileys as i know there was a company of men there the gun was fired to ascertain if any of the family were at home we were immediately fired upon and retreated leaving several of my men i do not know what became of them as i never saw them afterwards pursuing our course back and coming in sight of captain harris where we had been the day before we discovered a party of white men at the house on which all deserted me but two jacob and nat we concealed ourselves in the woods until near night when i sent them in search of henry sam nelson and hark and directed them to rally all they could at the place we had had our dinner the sunday before where they would find me and i accordingly returned there as soon as it was dark and remained until wednesday evening when discovering white men riding around the place as though they were looking for some one and none of my men joining me i concluded jacob and nat had been taken and compelled to betray me on this i gave up all hope for the present and on thursday night after having supplied myself with provisions from mr travis i scratched a hole under a pile of fence rails in a field where i concealed myself for six weeks never leaving my hiding place but for a few minutes in the dead of night to get water which was very near thinking by this time i could venture out i began to go about in the night and eavesdrop the houses in the neighborhood pursuing this course for about a fortnight and gathering little or no intelligence afraid of speaking to any human being and returning every morning to my cave before the dawn of day i know not how long i might have led this life if accident had not betrayed me a dog in the neighborhood passing by my hidingplace one night while i was out was attracted by some meat i had in my cave and crawled in and stole it and was coming out just as i returned a few nights after two negroes having started to go hunting with the same dog and passed that way the dog came again to the place and having just gone out to walk about discovered me and barked on which thinking myself discovered i spoke to them to beg concealment on making myself known they fled from me knowing then they would betray me i immediately left my hiding place and was pursued almost incessantly until i was taken a fortnight afterwards by mr benjamin phipps in a little hole i had dug out with my sword for the purpose of concealment under the top of a fallen tree on mr phipps discovering the place of my concealment he cocked his gun and aimed at me i requested him not to shoot and i would give up upon which he demanded my sword i delivered it to him and he brought me to prison during the time i was pursued i had many hairbreadth escapes which your time will not permit me to relate i am here loaded with chains and willing to suffer the fate that awaits me i here proceeded to make some inquiries of him after assuring him of the certain death that awaited him and that concealment would only bring destruction on the innocent as well as the guilty of his own color if he knew of any extensive or concerted plan his answer was i do not when i questioned him as to the insurrection in north carolina happening about the same time he denied any knowledge of it and when i looked him in the face as though i would search his inmost thoughts he replied i see sir you doubt my word but can you not think the same ideas and strange appearances about this time in the heavens might prompt others as well as myself to this undertaking i now had much conversation with and asked him many questions having forborn to do so previously except in the cases noted in parenthesis but during his statement i had unnoticed by him taken notes as to some particular circumstances and having the advantage of his statement before me in writing on the evening of the third day that i had been with him i began a crossexamination and found his statement corroborated by every circumstance coming within my own knowledge or the confessions of others whom had been either killed or executed and whom he had not seen nor had any knowledge since d of august last he expressed himself fully satisfied as to the impracticability of his attempt it has been said he was ignorant and cowardly and that his object was to murder and rob for the purpose of obtaining money to make his escape it is notorious that he was never known to have a dollar in his life to swear an oath or drink a drop of spirits as to his ignorance he certainly never had the advantages of education but he can read and write it was taught him by his parents and for natural intelligence and quickness of apprehension is surpassed by few men i have ever seen as to his being a coward his reason as given for not resisting mr phipps shows the decision of his character when he saw mr phipps present his gun he said he knew it was impossible for him to escape as the woods were full of men he therefore thought it was better to surrender and trust to fortune for his escape he is a complete fanatic or plays his part most admirably on other subjects he possesses an uncommon share of intelligence with a mind capable of attaining anything but warped and perverted by the influence of early impressions he is below the ordinary stature though strong and active having the true negro face every feature of which is strongly marked i shall not attempt to describe the effect of his narrative as told and commented on by himself in the condemned hole of the prison the calm deliberate composure with which he spoke of his late deeds and intentions the expression of his fiendlike face when excited by enthusiasm still bearing the stains of the blood of helpless innocence about him clothed with rags and covered with chains yet daring to raise his manacled hands to heaven with a spirit soaring above the attributes of man i looked on him and my blood curdled in my veins i will not shock the feelings of humanity nor wound afresh the bosoms of the disconsolate sufferers in this unparalleled and inhuman massacre by detailing the deeds of their fiendlike barbarity there were two or three who were in the power of these wretches had they known it and who escaped in the most providential manner there were two whom they thought they left dead on the field at mr parkers but who were only stunned by the blows of their guns as they did not take time to reload when they charged on them the escape of a little girl who went to school at mr wallers and where the children were collecting for that purpose excited general sympathy as their teacher had not arrived they were at play in the yard and seeing the negroes approach she ran up a dirt chimney such as are common to log houses and remained there unnoticed during the massacre of the eleven that were killed at this place she remained in her hiding place till just before the arrival of a party who were in pursuit of the murderers when she came down and fled to a swamp where a mere child as she was with the horrors of the late scene before her she lay concealed until the next day when seeing a party go up to the house she came up and on being asked how she escaped replied with the utmost simplicity the lord helped her she was taken up behind a gentleman of the party and returned to the arms of her weeping mother miss whitehead concealed herself between the bed and the mat that supported it while they murdered her sister in the same room without discovering her she was afterwards carried off and concealed for protection by a slave of the family who gave evidence against several of them on their trial mrs nathaniel francis while concealed in a closet heard their blows and the shrieks of the victims of these ruthless savages they then entered the closet where she was concealed and went out without discovering her while in this hidingplace she heard two of her women in a quarrel about the division of her clothes mr john t baron discovering them approaching his house told his wife to make her escape and scorning to fly fell fighting on his own threshold after firing his rifle he discharged his gun at them and then broke it over the villain who first approached him but he was overpowered and slain his bravery however saved from the hands of these monsters his lovely and amiable wife who will long lament a husband so deserving of her love as directed by him she attempted to escape through the garden when she was caught and held by one of her servant girls but another coming to her rescue she fled to the woods and concealed herself few indeed were those who escaped their work of death but fortunate for society the hand of retributive justice has overtaken them and not one that was known to be concerned has escaped leroi jones two short plays the toilet and the slave presented together on an evenings bill might indeed be a little much but not we hasten to add for any of the reasons many of the plays critics have advanced the plays are brief tight intense theatrical units exploding with emotion and therefore calculated to elicit heightened emotional response in the audience furthermore the plays deal with unorthodox matter experimentally and they are plainly designed to shock it is not at all surprising that some spectatorscritics among themelected to leave the close quarters of the st marks theatre in the middle of the first play the toilet but a word about the plays action the toilet which opened the evenings entertainment concerns a group of boys in a metropolitan high school and the ordinary gang politics and powerplays complicated by racial antagonisms most of the boys are negroes and a white boy or two seek identification with the gang well integration if you like one of the white boys had scribbled a note to a husky negro who properly resentful manfully proceeds to rebuff this advance with his fists aided and abetted by his negro cohorts the aggrieved negro youth succeeds in leaving his admirer bloody and belittled on the floor of the boys restroom where all the action takes place however when the bell rings and all the boys have run off to their next classes the manly negro returns and gently holds his vanquished white confrere in his arms the action of the slave takes place in a duplex apartment of a professorial white man and his wife while a revolution is raging in the streets outside the revolution is racial and apparently the blacks are winning into the apartment storms one of the black rebels who it turns out is the exhusband of the professors wife father of the two halfcaste daughters sleeping upstairs and leader of the revolution he is brandishing a revolver and murder is clearly in his heart now much of the criticism of these two plays has been directed at the language used by some of the characters in the toilet for in tance a variety of fourletter words usually withheld from publication are heard in virtually every sentence the language is strongly bravado and overemphasized for effect nevertheless it is easy to see that the squeamish may not wish to be subjected to it the rebel leader in the slave employs abusive language like a weapon it slashes still the mature theatergoer should be willing to suppress the reaction against what might seem to him obscenity long enough to evaluate the plays with some degree of objectivity in doing so it is possible that he will discover two plays of considerable power one quite effective in terms of artistic creation the other all but a failure the toilet manages to be arresting and interesting throughout and its evocation of compassion is not confined to the final scene of reconciliation it is important to remember that in the little world on stage through which the playwright is guiding the psychic vision of the audience all is toughness and vanity love except for self is an alien and unwelcome quantity it is a vile place where these young people find themselves but they are alive in it the slave is neither arresting nor ultimately very interesting despite the raging war without and the cruel violence within there is too much talk and much of it sounds irrelevant after awhile in the end one from the slave is left with the taste of anger ana with no memory of any of the characters humanity the slave also suffered by being the second play on the bill slower in pace deeper in symbol and meaning it might have gained by being considered firstbefore the audiences energies had been milked and it is altogether possible that the slave needs three acts rather than one in which to establish its premises and develop its points for what it would say remains of great importance in his second novel a drop of patience doubleday william melvin kelley recreates the night world of cabarets and musicians with economy and skill even though he is restricted to the sensations of the blind musician ludlow washington creator of a new jazz style however it is not ludlows music which is central in the novel but his relationships with women his first and humiliating experience with sex is with malveen a prostitute his marriage with ettasue fails ragan an educated white woman who lives with him is afraid to marry him finally a negro college girl attaches herself to him in all these relation hips there is misunderstanding blindness on their part to his needs and his own blindness in not knowing how much or how little he can expect of them kelley has written an absorbing novel in which he ranges from the eerie atmosphere of the first chapter where ludlow is left in a home for blind children and a boy claims him as his slave to the deadpan humor of a party where ludlow puts a fellow musician onto a white southern woman burdened with guiltdudley randall the order we impose upon history is modified by the entrance of new elements within that order this is a quote from william barretts what is existentialism it has particular pertinence to the subject at hand namely dave dexter jrs the jazz story because dexters book does just thatit modifies in some ways the history of jazz as we have known it the past is never really a fixed or completed thing it is always subject to new discoveries or approaches nowhere is this more evident than in the treatment of the history of jazz for the most part the past of jazz has remained relatively fuzzy and unclear probably due to the reluctance of publishers to print books on the subject until there was enough popular demand to make such books sell in the last few years there have been quite a few attempts at histories of jazz strangely enough some of the better ones have come from for eign authors dexter joins a growing group of writers who feel moved to record the development of this particular american art form because the topic is too broad for one man and one work to encompass it is desirable that more people are turning their efforts to this task for only after we have many many versions and views on the subject will there exist enough background for a realistic consensus and consensus is about all one can expect from the history of jazz dexters particularly strong contributions revolve around his knowledge of the kansas city development for years we have heard of kansas city jazz but dexters is perhaps the most thorough analysis of what actually constituted and produced kansas city jazz as a young writer and jazz fan who lived in kansas city at its most strategic and flourishing time jazzically speaking he is able to relate personal experiences about that hitherto vague mecca of an even more vague jazz style another contribution of the book is the chapter on charlie parker reams have been written on the high priest of bop but most such writing on jazz dieties is usually too emotional and biased in content to have much historical value mr dexter breaks away from this with his frank and candid views based upon personal contact with charlie parker and his close associates but just as his pinnacle of achievement in the book concerns one of the creators of modern jazz so the book also reaches one of its low points in the same area statements mr dexter makes would lead one to suspect that he too has a bias he seems to favor the more traditional kinds of jazz to the contemporary music for this he cannot be criticized for this is a matter of personal taste but what is objectionable is his sometimes questionable statements such as this one on miles davis for all his unquestioned musicianship it is obvious why he has achieved so little in all the years he has worked as a leader and recording artist im not sure what mr dexter uses as a yardstick to measure achievement but judged by all of the traditional criteria his statement must ring a bit thin later on he relates that the modern jazz quartet is a combo appealing exclusively to the intellectuals the group had no beat really generally speaking the book moves along pretty well propelled by the momentum of the readers interest and not from any particularly outstanding style in its presentation but it is readable and interesting the book is probably a very useful addition to a jazz collection because it does present us with another competently done work in areas where the author is most at home brooks johnson perhaps the most controversial of the ideologies of twentieth century africa is that of negritude the concept whose basis is the idea of a particular essence common to black people derived from their common african heritage developed among negro intellectuals under french colonial rule and since its inception has inspired vigorous reaction in african circles but the man who has been the most astonished by the extraordinary career of negritude has been its creator the poet aime cesaire it is not surprising that this should be so for when cesaire first used the term in his celebrated long poem cahier dun re tour au pays natal it had no precise ideological content even today cesaire regards it less as a rational and comprehensive system of thought though he readily accepts some of the objective deductions made from it than as a personal stand in the context of his career as a writer and active politician this adventure started in his native island of martinique where he was born in he received his secondary education at the local lycee as a scholarship student and was early revolted by the spectacle of his island poor and miserable for the most part but what revolted him most was the mulatto mentality of his compatriots who under the pressure of colonial rule had come to accept the canons of judgment borrowed from their white overlords and had set up a vicious racial discrimination among themselves cesaire later went on to paris to continue his studies at the lycee louis le grand and later at the ecole normale superieure it was at louis le grand that his intimate friendship with leopold senghor who was a fellow student was to open out a new world of feelings and ideas and to plant in the very centre of his experience what has now become its principal aspect namely the sense of racial belonging when i met senghor i knew myself to be african he recalls together they discovered the writings of the new school of anthropology of frobenius and delaforse who began to contest the theory of inherent black inferiority and later the writings of marcel giraule and father tempels who drew attention to the intense spiritual life of african traditional society dissatisfaction with the french policy of assimilation which was based on an official attitude of contempt for the negro though singling out a few individuals for a kind of whitening process soon developed into a reaction among negro intellectuals a racial consciousness born out of indignation against the exactions and ravages of french colonialism on one hand and a new awareness of the human potential of the black race was to lead cesaire and senghor to found a paper with the collaboration of leon damas at the time an already established writer the paper letudiant noir served as an organ for anticolonialism as well as african culture it was in the midst of this intellectual ferment that in cesaire produced his masterpiece cahier dun re tour au pays natal in which the intense spiritual turmoil of the black intellectual under colonial rule was expressed in the most forceful language for cahier is animated with the bitter wrath of a man who had seen and felt to the remotest nook of being the injustice and indignity of oppression in it cesaire has interiorized the collective drama of his race to such a degree that the poem is no longer the espousal of a cause but rather the assumption of a personal destiny make of me the commissary of its blood make of me the depository of its resentment make of me a man of initiation make of me a man of contemplation but make of me also a man of sowing the cahier is at the same time a protest poema political document evenas well as a personal testament andre breton who met cesaire during the war in martinique where cesaire had returned to teach literature at the local lycee proclaimed the poem no less than the greatest lyrical monument of our age and his judgment has been confirmed by cesaires subsequent literary career which has made him one of the leading poets in the french language today in cesaire was elected a deputy to the french national assembly and later became mayor of fort de france capital of martinique he has since led an active political life as the outspoken spokesman for the french caribbean population in this respect his political programme has been autonomy for the french caribbean a formula for giving the antilles a measure of selfdetermination within the framework of frances departmental constitution for cesaire considers the present arrangement by which the west indian territories are directly administered from paris as a concealed form of colonialism cesaires greatest preoccupation has been decolonization in africa and elsewhere as the only condition for the spiritual development of subject peoples he was a prominent figure at the two congresses organized by presence africaine at the second congress in rome he delivered a paper on the role of the writer in the liberation struggle we must hasten the process of decolonization he said that is to say employ all means to hasten the ripening of a popular consciousness in the same spirit he wrote his famous pamphlet discours sur le colonialisme in which he attacked the pretensions of the colonial enterprise from colonization to civilization the distance is infinite and in advocating the recognition of an independent neoafrican culture he wrote it is not a dead society that we want to revive it is a new society that we need to create a society rich with all the powerful means of modern production and warm with all the ancient fraternitythus cesaires political preoccupation is only a part of a wider problem and his advocacy of the ancient fraternity of african culture is at once affirmation and quest this latter aspect is worked out in the poems where he attempts a revaluation in modern terms through surrealistic imageryof the mystic life of traditional africa as well as an effort at personal identification with its values this is seen in his poem to africa peasant the wind where hulls glide fixes around my face the distant hand of a dream your field in its pillage bursts open with sea monsters that l am helpless to ward off and my gesture is as pure as a forehead of oblivion strike peasant l am your son yet beyond his immediate concern with the regeneration of africa and her farflung sons his ultimate message is that of the universal brotherhood of manas he says there is room for all at the rendezvous of victory for his poetry as a whole is the expression of a vision of a state when humanity will have achieved the rock without dialect the leaf without keep the fragile water without femur in other words when man will have achieved a concordance with a universe restored to its primal purity william had told her to go back to his folk in tennessee when he was gone because there wouldnt be any insurance money and she was too old to work sadie had always listened to william and they had lived together years without getting into trouble but now that summer was coming on and her money running out and william six months in his grave she had got to feeling that she wanted to see something before she passed he had always told her how dangerous it was to see anything beyond the end of your own land or your table and they had lived peaceful this way but she had always known that there was more to see than met her eyes had known it even as a girl walking along the road that went further to nashville when she saw folks in cars riding by with a kind of look in their eyes which said im going someplace where there is something to see it had come into her head lately especially late at night that none in her line of kin had ever seen anything the old people had come up in slavery and momma after poppa got in trouble and was taken away worked for one family all her years she and william did have plans for charles they meant for him to go to the city and work but he had passed in the war and williams people had always farmed just kept quiet and farmed so none of them had ever seen anything unless maybe charles but she didnt mean the kind of seeing things where you got killed she meant something like just looking where you werent noticed where you could just walk around have nothing special to do and maybe learn something that didnt have colored people written on it so when she had gone to the doctors office for her swoledup leg and saw the pictures in life magazine of all those people milling around the fair she knew thats where she had to go william wouldnt like it a bit it went against everything he believed about peaceful living but he was old fashioned and after charles had passed in france he didnt want to hear anything about going anyplace she never argued with william he had cut out a good life for them but she wondered to herself if maybe that wasnt the trouble all along folks not going anywhere and not seeing anything that way a war comes along and you get killed and you never know why it happened sometimes when william complained about not having more money and then laid it up to god she wanted to say were just ignorant william weve never seen anything and dont know anything but william was too good and he prided himself on knowing enough to get by so she didnt say anything and even from the grave he had a powerful influence over her but she had made up her mind to go to the fair if the time came later in the next world when she would have to explain herself to william she would tell him the truth then there would be plenty of time to straighten things out up there meanwhile she couldnt get all those pictures out of her head all those people and all those lights and what they called exhibits where you could look all day and everyone to busy to watch who else was looking which would give her a chance to have eyes for everything and everyone unless others folks had the same idea and she had the money twohundred and forty dollars and twentyone cents it would be enough to get to new york city and then back to tennessee her leg was hurting her quite a bit though and she was worried about all the walking shed have to do but even so so far as she was concerned she was on her way to the fair and she went to bed feeling that all the world was lit up for her to see it then she got this hot pain running from her leg all through her body and she knew she was going to die she cried some for what she was going to miss for what all her people had ever missed and how could she explain to them all up there why she had waited so long to see something then she got sensible and fixed some words in her mind for william who would wonder what had gotten into her head anyway take the first step they said my child is laying down there one foot they say half stuck in a bag of garbage like he had crawled out of it black beans and candy wrappers bones rags and coffee grounds and robert brown on the stoop this street in the morning looks like a burnt mattress after the firemen put the fire out the children burst out of the doors like black seed pods and they take all that glassis it my window that brokeand all those bottles and they smash them up after school when the street is done smoking and stinking the children make knives from the busted springs and jump outbamfrom the doors i saywhooshand they run away with the springs and the glass they got

almost a baby and they got him and sent him to the place and he come back and got hooked again and now he lay around on the couch all day and look tired but robert brown is nobodys fool he see them all around here on this street sleepy and scratching theyselves all the long day and leaning up against nothing he laugh he says look at the fools mamma but i dont even look here is gloria screaming

he say no peace around here at all and he walk off and she laugh now ha ha ha but then i never seen anything like the way after a woman tells a man to get out how she looks when he goes and stand there saying ha ha ha and he dont turn around he walk up the street with his cap just so his hands in his pocket and dont turn around there she is pretending she got her own business too and when he is far from her sight she take off after him walking fast like him and still shaking with it gloria going to find out now if you tell them to go they go i take the third step willie prentice in his life got himself cut six ways and hes fixing up to fight again i see that portorican grinding his teeth and they are going to cut each other right here in the hall now theyre just looking head turning right left slow getting ready but the portorican is going to scream pretty soon like a buzzsaw knives when buddy was little and he cut his toe with the axe our daddy poured kerosene into the cut and took ashes from the stove and poured them over that toe and bound it up with flannel and he got well we stole too from my daddy sewed up eggs in the hems of our coat and went down the road to school and stopped by the store and traded those eggs for stockings and candy on monday we washed on tuesday we ironed on wednesday we scrubbed the floor with potash on thursday we run off and did what we did my little brother buddy he threw a turtle in the fire once and it walked clean out of its shell but robert brown never hurt the cats around here and he took care of that dog till it run off he went to school and learned what he had to and he went to the store and sometimes he polished his own shoes and he watched all the fighting around here and never said nothing and he never went up on the roof with the rest of them to do what they do up there and he never stole from nobody but me once he asked me why they come around sometime and i didnt tell him they looking for colored tail or the stuff i said they was policemen checking up he say checking up on what and i say the city got all these policemen and they got to do something with them i take the fourth step the old women are crowding up on me they step when i stepand i go slow i dont believe robert brown got into a fight he is too fast a boy and he never got mixed up with nobody around here no he say he got his own friends then he brought her around he say this is my mamma and she say hello mrs brown but did she mean mrs brown she never been in a place like this before i could see and she grin all the time and

fifth step he take her around in that little car and he wear a white scarf and he shoot out his cuffs like he had to go someplace to learn to do it i told him to be careful and he say i got to learn what did i mean and what do he mean they are crowding up in front of me now but i cant hear what they say because the city is taking up the garbage which they do ten times a day and ten times a night where do we get all this garbage from they crowding up there in front of me but i see whitey got a bottle of texas rum in his back pocket and george he is going to lift it right out like it was a straight splinter they are all looking down at the stoop i push them away easy because they made of sticks they weak i can see him hes laying there and his foot is half stuck in a bag of garbage like they said is he drunk because i dont see that blood robert brownrobert brown are you drunk boy red top and i share a tworoom apartment out here in nothing weve lived here for two years and will probably stay put until they raise the rent or until a highway comes through or some kind of urban renewal its a nice place if you like old obsolete buildings and substandard living we used to have a cat here about a year ago but the rats chased him away we used to wash walls and windows and sweep the place once in a while too but it just gets that way again so whats the use i remember how it looked when we moved in and how we put black flag down all around the rooms every night before we went to bed until the people in the other apartments complained that we were disturbing the equal distribution of roaches and threatened to kick us out of here if we didnt accept our share of the bastards and stop trying to be such aristocrats we live in a democracy out here and we didnt want to make enemies of our neighbors so we accepted our quota and learned to live with them we havent learned to eat them yet we eat just about everything else but not these slimy little companions red top is my roommate and quite obviously hes a negro he has a real name but ive forgotten it i guess hes what youd call a handsome man about eight inches over five feet pounds a head full of nappy red hair gray eyes that slant upward slightly and practically no beard at all he manages to stay in pretty good shape for his age and hes quite popular he never has to buy any he says i should be half so lucky my checks might go a lot farther if i didnt have to pass a little around among the ladies lingerie lounges and at supermarkets for that occasional loaf of bread or bottle of wine from time to time i get most it backin time ill get it all back from them people like red top and sometimes they come by to visit and bring little things for us red top gets out more than i do sometimes he stays out all day once they locked him up for two weeks as a material witness in a murder trial i thought he was dead it seemed like a logical assumption to me he didnt come home so he must have been dead i was a little disappointed when he finally returned because i had already cashed his check and spent most of it he was disturbed about this he was angry with me hes a pretty vicious guy sometimes i had to get a job to pay him back two weeks he made me work just for money and then he made me pay the rent myself we understand each other though and the arrangement works pretty good most of the time red top is not a native of the city is anybody he was born on a farm the son of a sharecropper who was the son of a sharecropper who was the son of a slavethe son of a white mans slave the son of a son of a bitch he got a chance to break away from home during the big war when he was drafted into the army as a cook and after he had helped free the rest of the world he came back home to become a modernday slave in the great usa he fought the old ways for a while joining every group that promised him equality and freedom but always ended up being investigated by the feds for membership in a subversive organization any damn organization with letters is communist inspired and any movement to correct an existing deformity is communist inspired and any outspoken critic of the good old american way whatever the hell that is is stamped and sealed communistic and red top was one of the hottest communistic noncommunist in the usa they shook him up so he was afraid to sign his name on a pledge card in church he was smart aggressive and on the way up good job and all but he wanted to charge out in front of the ranks carrying the flag of the cause and he did and when he looked around for the rest of the troops they were miles behind him and nobody was near to defend him when they pulled the flag away and cut him up in little pieces and left him for deadand left him dead spiritually without substance without soul dead he drifted around the country for a few years after that sleeping where he could and living from time to time but dying away a little more every day we bumped into each other one day outside the cutrate liquor store we were both standing outside waiting for one of the guys to come out with a bottle of wine and let us have a taste when three little punks appeared with a basket of bottles they had collected throughout the neighborhood and brought to the store to cash in for the grand deposit when the kids came out i took their basket and started to enmass my own personal fortune red top followed me down the alley we struck up a conversation joined forces and spent the afternoon talking about nothing and the effect it has on the rest of the city and searching for bottles the kids had stripped the alleys cleanwe could find only a half dozen bottles scarcely enough for a bottle and a loaf of bread when we got back to the store there was a pop truck parked at the curb the driver and his helper were inside restocking the place when we hit on the idea to take the empties right off the truck you get the bottles and ill watch these cats red top said and i began unloading the truck as id take a case off the truck id hurry around to the side of the building and hide it among the boxes piled there i got twenty cases of empties before red top alerted me after the truck left we carried the cases down the alley and stacked them where theyd be safe for a while and then returned to the store with enough bottles for two pints of wine we turned in a few others at the grocery store and got bologna and bread the idea to buy food was red tops i wanted to drink it all up but hes the kind of guy who has to take care of his stomach since its all fouled up i sort of felt he had the right idea but it was a strange feeling to spend money for food instead of begging for itbuy what you want and beg for what you need thats been our philosophy out here for generations its always worked why should i suddenly have to buy food when its out there if you stand long enough and put it on real strong for some goodnatured chump weve got all kinds of dogooders walking around just praying to find somebody begging for a meal but they always have to give you a lecture the bastards its not enough that you say thank you hell no they want some assurance that youre not going to buy wine they want to ease their conscience because they cant stand the sight of you and though they want to take you to a restaurant and buy a dinner for you its just too much to ask that they should have to socialize with you theyre feeding you and thats enough they keep telling themselves so they say it just before they drop the money in your hand of course they drop it you think they want to touch your hand and it always sounds the same way now youre sure you wont use this to buy yourself a drink or they say now get something to eat and you stand there smiling and lying and agreeing to anything they say so theyll let go of the change and drop it into your crummy black hand and you can take off and get some bread and cheeze or bologna or a cup of coffee and most of all a pint of something thats really drinkable they dont give you that much though just nickels and dimes just small change to help ease their conscience once in a while theyll try to proposition you too like the cat who asked me to go to bed with his sister so he could watch us she was a nut about negroesshe was a nut about menand he was another kind of nut who was nuts about her being nuts about negroes it takes all kinds and then there was the old lady about nine hundred years old and the little fairy hes always around hes a safety valve for some of us and all kinds of weird people so red top and i got along pretty good we got on relief about the same time and moved into this crummy place and have been here ever since at first i used to go out and find odd jobs but that got to be too laborious and i decided to just stay home sometimes i write sometimes i read most of the time i get drunkthats making sense out of life red top worked for a while but the welfare officer caught up with him and was taking fifty percent of his pay as a kickback and red top said to hell with him why should the white man get rich off him he quit the job and now just takes it easy like me and has a little hustle going at night down the street in one of the houses he sort of sees to it that the girls are properly protected before during and after i think thats why he never has to buy it he says its not true but i know it ishes not that good nobody is everybody has to pay sooner or later everybody has to pay its sort of a quiet life we lead here no television or radio to distract us from our thoughts and dreams and drinks for a long time we had a rather interesting schedule for the first week of the money what with money being plentiful and dwindling away to absolutely nothing by the middle of the monthbeginning with monday as the first day to find out what had taken place over the weekend wed start out at marovitz grocery store standing in front of the meat counter listening to the women relate their long narratives about susans kitchenette whippin this applies strictly to adults fighting not children to sams encounter with the book who never pays on time all the way to big p bailing a couple of his girls out of jail and mr marovitz you should have seed her when she came runnin out of her room why she had blood all over her and not a stitch of clothes onnot even well just not a stitch mr marovitz eyes would light up and he would be lost to the story and not see the children stealing sweets for that matter he wouldnt even see me and red top stealing well i sure saw that woman a lady interrupted she bust right into my place and begged me to help her and all the time my husband the damn fool he just standing there smilin like some stupid asshe just smilin and lookin i gave her my housecoat and told her i didnt want no blood on it and i wanted it back wed hang around there until we found where they were holding the inquest thats right the inquest monday without an inquest would have been like monday without daylight it would have been like monday without breathing we had to have an inquest because somebody always got killed over the weekend either by car or knife or gun or heroin or a policeman or falling from a window anything but suicide we dont do that we leave suicide for white people because theyre fragile and cant take it suicide is for the whites because theyve got everything suicide is for the whites because they dont have anything so by monday morning the weekend of drinking had caught up with us and it was a pleasure to sit in a quiet funeral parlor and smell the flowers and listen to the witnesses lie everybody blaming the dead man or woman the flowers were always pretty we got to love this time of the week the clean floors the high ceilings the beautiful flower arrangements the various scents filling the room we got so we enjoyed the damn places so much we started stopping by in the evenings during the middle of the week to see if there was a wake going onthe black pat and mike paying our respects to the bereaved family if we were lucky and didnt look too bad they might invite us by for a drink afterwards we had some swinging wakes sometimes red top would make out with the cats wife or aunt or cousin or maybe even his brother i never made out with anyone but then i never do so thats not too important after leaving the inquest on this first day of the first week of the month our checks in our pockets wed go back to mr marovitz store cash our checks bring the food accounts up to date and head for the hottest spot on the street herbs barber shop everybody was there they loved the place the guys in show business staying at the hotel used the shop as their conversation corner during the day a few of the policy runners with their little books would stop in between deliveries on their runs and joke with the rest of the sitters sitting around living and reliving the weekend before they cut out to start back to the hustle herb was about hes always been about except hes losing his hair now and can no longer stand in front of the mirror combing and pushing his pompand used to be a little on the heavy side before he started playing golf like everybody started playing golf at about the same time because the money got big for all of them at about the same time and the courses began to open up a couple of them anyway and take negroes in on a large scale herb was happy smooth dapper and everyone loved him he had a memory like an elephant and could recall vividly incidents that happened when he first came to the city at the age of nine he knew everybody and didnt seem to be impressed with status one way or the other oh he respected authority and was pleased when someone who grew up with him made the big time but it didnt really move him he just liked people and didnt give a damn where they come from or what line they were in so long as they conducted themselves like gentlemen when they were in his establishment herb had a barber working with him back a few years agowell before that he had three barbers working there but that was during the war when things were really goodand the cat couldnt leave the bottle alone herb wouldnt let his barber drink in the shop so youd see the cat cut a while talk a while cut a while and then step outside and around the corner to a place where he stashed his pint and then come tipping sheepishly back to his customer making some excuse about not being able to get his throat cleared herb would cut his eyes at him and the message would be delivered without words herb would never have said anything in front of the customers the cat used to get so stoned that by oclock he couldnt cut another head and herb would tell him to go home hed come back the next morning apologizing and promising never to do it again and always herb would forgive him things went on like that for a year until herb finally had to let him go and the cat went up and down the street telling everybody what a rotten bastard herb was for kicking him out after the way he had run the shop so efficiently for him and all and the way he used to stay late and see to it that herb would get away for business and how tight herb was for not giving him what he was really worth but instead all he gave him was a kick in the ass you know people believed this guysome of them actually believed him its convenient to believe only what you want to believe sometimes a singer who had made it up the ladder to one of the big clubs downtown would come in and tell stories of things that had happened to him in detroit and new york and philadelphia and san francisco and everyone would sit quietly through each tale and then prime him for another black jack kept us posted on who had hit the numbers and for how much and slick and mr p would argue about who had the best girls cats would come in selling hot shoes and shirts and socks and jackets and coats and furs and cufflinks and all kinds of good buys sometimes red top and i would buy but mostly wed just look the crap over and pass it on to the next cat who would look it over and pass it on to the next who would look it over and somebody was always stopping in to put the quiet touch on herb theyd come in and whisper something in his ear hed nod and run his hand in his pocket and bring out the right amount he had a knack for bringing out just what the guy had asked for and no more and he would nonchalantly slide it into the cats hand with his left hand while his right hand kept cutting and cutting and cutting and the slickemback boys would sit under the dryers with their scalps tingling and their inner souls bursting with anticipation the longing for the waves to be meticulously set by the barber who has grown to be barberbeautician with the advent of the new hair straightening operation called the process now the whole world can have straight hair wed get our monthly haircut and sit around for another hour or two soaking up the stories and then wed cut out for jakes lounge and sit for a while drinking whisky and beer and then drop by the cutrate liquor store for the stockpile of wine take the blood home and hide it from ourselves and then take off for the street with a pint in the back pocket off for the big street stopping in alleys from time to time to taste up and down the street one side and the other pinching butts joking making out trying to make out but youve always got to pay the best we knew how and sharing a wine with the cats who didnt have any because theyd have some sooner or later and we damn sure wanted to be on the list when they started paying back and as always wed get damn good and drunk and end up with some of the reserve supply gone and a babe in the bed whos still drunk she had to be drunk when you woke up or it didnt seem real if you got one who was as sober as you the next morning you didnt trust her you just knew she had taken all of the blood and hid it some place while you were stoned youd wake her up and kick her out of your bed and start tuesday off with a tall glass of ice cold water trying to activate the high and get it going again without drinking any of your blood it never worked though so youd have to start in again in order to remain stable and steady in his new book who speaks for the negro poetnovelist robert penn warren states the following the italics are added it is selfinterest to want to live in a society operating by the love of justice and the concept of law we have not been living in such a society it is selfinterest to want all members of society to contribute as fully as possible to the enrichment of that society the structure of our society has prevented that it is selfinterest to want to escape from the pressure to conform to values which we feel immoral or antiquated our society has maintained such pressures it is selfinterest to want to escape from the burden of vanity into the hard and happy realization that in the diminishment of others there is a deep diminishment of the self our society has been organized for the diminishment of others more than a half century ago in the souls of black folk w e b dubois called us this happygolucky nation which goes blundering along with its reconstruction tragedies its spanish war interludes and philippine matinees just as though god were really dead a lot has happened since he said that but perhaps god is not dead yet it would be sentimentality to think that our society can be changed easily and without pain it would be worse sentimentality to think that it can be changed without some pain to our particular selvesblack and white it would be realism to think that that pain would be a reasonable price to pay for what we all selfishly might get out of it our own freedom this passage and others like it from mr warrens book is being praised for its wisdom and insight but as mr warren inferred dubois was saying it all a half century ago and james baldwin has been saying it lately how odd that the words take on so much more significance when the hand that holds the pen is white not so very long ago the earth numbered two thousand mil lion inhabitants five hundred million men and one thousand five hundred million natives the former had the word the i others had the use of it between the two there were hired kinglets overlords and a bourgeoisie sham from beginning to end which served as gobetweens in the colonies the truth stood naked but the citizens of the mothercountry preferred it with clothes on the native had to love them something in the way mothers are loved the european elite undertook to manufacture a native elite they picked out promising adolescents they branded them as with a redhot iron with the principles of western culture they stuffed their mouths full with highsounding phrases grand glutinous words that stuck to the teeth after a short stay in the mother country they were sent home whitewashed these walking lies had nothing left to say to their brothers they only echoed from paris from london from amsterdam we would utter the words parthenon brotherhood and somewhere in africa or asia lips would open thenon therhood it was the golden age it came to an end the mouths opened by themselves the yellow and black voices still spoke of our humanism but only to reproach us with our inhumanity we listened without displeasure to these polite statements of resentment at first with proud amazement what they are able to talk by themselves just look at what we have made of them we did not doubt but that they would accept our ideals since they accused us of not being faithful to them then indeed europe could believe in her mission she had hellenized the asians she had created a new breed the grecolatin negroes we might add quite between ourselves as men of the world after all let them bawl their heads off it relieves their feelings dogs that bark dont bite a new generation came on the scene which changed the issue with unbelievable patience its writers and poets tried to explain to us that our values and the true facts of their lives did not hang together and that they could neither reject them completely nor yet assimilate them by and large what they were saying was this you are making us into monstrosities your humanism claims we are at one with the rest of humanity but your racist methods set us apart very much at our ease we listened to them all colonial administrators are not paid to read hegel and for that matter they do not read much of him but they do not need a philosopher to tell them that uneasy consciences are caught up in their own contradictions they will not get anywhere so let us perpetuate their discomfort nothing will come of it but talk if they were the experts told us asking for anything at all precise in their wailing it would be integration of course there is no question of granting that the system which depends on overexploitation as you know would be ruined but its enough to hold the carrot in front of their noses theyll gallop all right as to a revolt we need not worry at all what native in his senses would go off to massacre the fair sons of europe simply to become european as they are in short we encouraged these disconsolate spirits and thought it not a bad idea for once to award the prix goncourt to a negro that was before listen let us waste no time in sterile litanies and nauseating mimicry leave this europe where they are never done talking of man yet murder men everywhere they find them at the corner of every one of their own streets in all the corners of the globe for centuries they have stifled almost the whole of humanity in the name of a socalled spiritual experience the tone is new who dares to speak thus it is an african a man from the third world an exnative he adds europe now lives at such a mad reckless pace that she is running headlong into the abyss we would do well to keep away from it in other words shes done for a truth which is not pleasant to state but of which we are all convinced are we not felloweuropeans in the marrow of our bones we must however make one reservation when a frenchman for example says to other frenchmen the country is done forwhich has happened i should think almost every day since it is emotional talk burning with love and fury the speaker includes himself with his fellowcountrymen and then usually he adds unless his meaning is clear no more mistakes must be made if his instructions are not carried out to the letter then and only then will the country go to pieces in short it is a threat followed by a piece of advice and these remarks are so much the less shocking in that they spring from a national intersubjectivity but on the contrary when fanon says of europe that she is rushing to her doom far from sounding the alarm he is merely setting out a diagnosis this doctor neither claims that she is a hopeless case miracles have been known to existnor does he give her the means to cure herself he certifies that she is dying on external evidence founded on symptoms that he can observe as to curing her no he has other things to think about he does not give a damn whether she lives or dies because of this his book is scandalous and if you murmur jokingly embarrassed he has it in for us the true nature of the scandal escapes you for fanon has nothing in it for you at all his workredhot for some in what concerns you is as cold as ice he speaks of you often never to you the black goncourts and the yellow nobels are finished the days of colonized laureats are over an exnative frenchspeaking bends that language to new requirements makes use of it and speaks to the colonized only natives of all underdeveloped countries unite what a downfall for the fathers we alone were the speakers the sons no longer even consider us as valid intermediaries we are the objects of their speeches of course fanon mentions in passing our wellknown crimes setif hanoi madagascar but he does not waste his time in condemning them he uses them if he demonstrates the tactics of colonialism the complex play of relations which unite and oppose the colonists to the people of the mother country it is for his brothers his aim is to teach them to beat us at our own game in short the third world finds itself and speaks to itself through his voice we know that it is not a homogeneous world we know too that enslaved peoples are still to be found there together with some who have achieved a simulacrum of phoney independence others who are still fighting to attain sovereignty and others again who have obtained complete freedom but who live under the constant menace of imperialist aggression these differences are bom of colonial history in other words of oppression here the mother country is satisfied to keep some feudal rulers in her pay there dividing and ruling she has created a native bourgeosie sham from beginning to end elsewhere she has played a double game the colony is planted with settlers and exploited at the same time thus europe has multiplied divisions and opposing groups has fashioned classes and sometimes even racial prejudices and has endeavoured by every means to bring about and intensify the stratification of colonised societies fanon hides nothing in order to fight against us the former colony must fight against itself or rather the two struggles form part of a whole in the heat of battle all internal barriers break down the puppet bourgeoisie of businessmen and shopkeepers the urban proletariat which is always in a privileged position the lumpenproletariat of the shanty townsall fall into line with the stand made by the rural masses that veritable reservoir of a national revolutionary army for in those countries where colonialism has deliberately held up development the peasantry when it rises quickly stands out as the revolutionary class for it knows naked oppression and suffers far more from it than the workers in the towns and in order not to die of hunger it demands no less than a complete demolishing of all existing structures in order to triumph the national revolution must be socialist if its career is cut short if the native bourgeoisie takes over power the new state in spite of its formal sovereignty remains in the hands of the imperialists the example of katanga illustrates this quite well thus the unity of the third world is not yet achieved it is a work in progress which begins by the union in each country after independence as before of the whole of the colonised people under the command of the peasant class this is what fanon explains to his brothers in africa asia and latin america we must achieve revolutionary socialism all together everywhere or else one by one we will be defeated by our former masters he hides nothing neither weaknesses nor discords nor mystification here the movement gets off to a bad start there after a striking initial success it loses momentum elsewhere it has come to a standstill and if it is to start again the peasants must throw their bourgeoisie overboard the reader is sternly put on his guard against the most dangerous will o the wisps the cult of the leader and of personalities western culture and what is equally to be feared the withdrawal into the twilight of past african culture for the only true culture is that of the revolution that is to say it is constantly in the making fanon speaks out loud we europeans can hear him as the fact that you hold this book in your hand proves is he not then afraid that the colonial powers may take advantage of his sincerity no he fears nothing our methods are outofdate they can sometimes delay emancipation but not stop it and do not think that we can change our ways neocolonialism that idle dream of mothercountries is a lot of hot air the third forces dont exist or if they do they are only the tinpot bourgeoisies that colonialism has already placed in the saddle our machiavellianism has little purchase on this wideawake world that has run our falsehoods to earth one after the other the settler has only recourse to one thing brute force when he can command it the native has only one choice between servitude or supremacy what does fanon care whether you read his work or not it is to his brothers that he denounces our old tricks and he is sure we have no more up our sleeves it is to them he says europe has laid her hands on our continents and we must slash at her fingers till she lets go its a good moment nothing can happen at bizerta at elizabethville or in the algerian bled that the whole world does not hear about the rival blocks take opposite sides and hold each other in check let us take advantage of this paralysis let us burst into history forcing it by our invasion into universality for the first time let us start fighting and if weve no other arms the waiting knifes enough europeans you must open this book and enter into it after a few steps in the darkness you will see strangers gathered around a fire come close and listen for they are talking of the destiny they will mete out to your tradingcentres and to the hired soldiers who defend them they will see you perhaps but they will go on talking among themselves without even lowering their voices this indifference strikes home their fathers shadowy creatures your creatures were but dead souls you it was who allowed them glimpses of light to you only did they dare speak and you did not bother to reply to such zombies their sons ignore you a fire warms them and sheds light around them and you have not lit it now upcountry in north africa transl at a respectful distance it is you who will feel furtive nightbound and perished with cold turn and turn about in these shadows from whence a new dawn will break it is you who are the zombies in this case you will say lets throw away this book why read it if it is not written for us for two reasons the first is that fanon explains you to his brothers and shows them the mechanism by which we are estranged from ourselves take advantage of this and get to know yourselves seen in the light of truth objectively our victims know us by their scars and by their chains and it is this that makes their evidence irrefutable it is enough that they show us what we have made of them for us to realise what we have made of ourselves but is it any use yet for europe is at deaths door but you will say we live in the mother country and we disapprove of her excesses it is true you are not settlers but you are no better for the pioneers belonged to you you sent them overseas and it was you they enriched you warned them that if they shed too much blood you would disown them or say you did in something of the same way as any state maintains abroad a mob of agitators agents provocateurs and spies whom it disowns when they are caught you who are so liberal and so humane who have such an exaggerated adoration of culture that it verges on affectation you pretend to forget that you own colonies and that in them men are massacred in your name fanon reveals to his comradesabove all to some of them who are rather too westernisedthe solidarity of the people of the mothercountry and of their representatives in the colonies have the courage to read this book for in the first place it will make you ashamed and shame as marx said is a revolutionary sentiment you see i too am incapable of ridding myself of subjective illusions i too say to you all is lost unless as a european i steal the enemys book and out of it i fashion a remedy for europe make the most of it and here is the second reason if you set aside sorels fascist utterances you will find that fanon is the first since engels to bring the processes of history into the clear light of day moreover you need not think that hotheadedness or an unhappy childhood have given him some uncommon taste for violence he acts as the interpreter of the situation thats all but this is enough to enable him to constitute step by step the dialectic which liberal hypocrisy hides from you and which is as much responsible for our existence as for his during the last century the middle classes looked on the workers as covetous creatures made lawless by their greedy desires but they took care to include these great brutes in our own species or at least they considered that they were free menthat is to say free to sell their labour in france as in england humanism claimed to be universal in the case of forced labour it is quite the contrary there is no contract moreover there must be intimidation and thus oppression grows our soldiers overseas rejecting the universalism of the mother country apply the numerous clausus to the human race since none may enslave rob or kill his fellowman without committing a crime they lay down the principle that the native is not one of our fellowmen our strikingpower has been given the mission of changing this abstract certainty into reality the order is given to reduce the inhabitants of the annexed country to the level of superior monkeys in order to justify the settlers treatment of them as beasts of burden violence in the colonies does not only have for its aim the keeping of these enslaved men at arms length it seeks to dehumanise them everything will be done to wipe out their traditions to substitute our language for theirs and to destroy their culture without giving them ours sheer physical fatigue will stupefy them starved and ill if they have any spirit left fear will finish the job guns are levelled at the peasant civilians come to take over his land and force him by dint of flogging to till the land for them if he shows fight the soldiers fire and hes a dead man if he gives in he degrades himself and he is no longer a man at all shame and fear will split up his character and make his inmost self fall to pieces the business is conducted with flying colours and by experts the psychological services werent established yesterday nor was brainwashing and yet in spite of all these efforts their ends are nowhere achieved neither in the congo where negroes hands were cut off nor in angola where until very recently malcontents lips were pierced in order to shut them with padlocks i do not say that it is impossible to change a man into an animal i simply say that you wont get there without weakening him considerably blows will never suffice you have to push the starvation further and thats the trouble with slavery for when you domesticate a member of our own species you reduce his output and however little you may give him a farmyard man finishes by costing more than he brings in for this reason the settlers are obliged to stop the breakinginhalfway the result neither man nor animal is the native beaten undernourished ill terrifiedbut only up to a certain pointhe has whether hes black yellow or white always the same traits of character hes a slyboots a lazybones and a thief who lives on nothing and who understands only violence poor settler here is his contradiction naked shorn of its trappings he ought to kill those he plunders as they say djinns do now this is not possible because he must exploit them as well because he cant carry massacre on to genocide and slavery to animallike degradation he loses control the machine goes into reverse and a relentless logic leads him on to decolonisation but it does not happen immediately at first the europeans reign continues he has already lost the battle but this is not obvious he does not yet know that the natives are only halfnative to hear him talk it would seem that he illtreats them in order to destroy or to repress the evil that they have rooted in them and after three generations their pernicious instincts will reappear no more what instincts does he mean the instincts that urge slaves on to massacre their master can he not here recognise his own cruelty turned against himself in the savagery of these oppressed peasants does he not find his own settlers savagery which they have absorbed through every pore and for which there is no cure the reason is simple this imperious being crazed by his absolute power and by the fear of losing it no longer remembers clearly that he was once a man he takes himself for a horsewhip or a gun he has come to believe that the domestication of the inferior races will come about by the conditioning of their reflexes but in this he leaves out of account the human memory and the ineffaceable marks left upon it and then above all there is something which perhaps he has never known we only become what we are by the radical and deepseated refusal of that which others have made of us three generations did we say hardly has the second generation opened their eyes than from then on theyve seen their fathers being flogged in psychiatric terms they are traumatised for life but these constantly renewed aggressions far from bringing them to submission thrust them into an unbearable contradiction which the european will pay for sooner or later after that when it is their turn to be broken in when they are taught what shame and hunger and pain are all that is stirred up in them is a volcanic fury whose force is equal to that of the pressure put upon them you said they understand nothing but violence of course first the only violence is the settlers but soon they will make it their own that is to say the same violence is thrown back upon us as when our reflection comes forward to meet us when we go towards a mirror make no mistake about it by this mad fury by this bitterness and spleen by their everpresent desire to kill us by the permanent tensing of powerful muscles which are afraid to relax they have become men men because of the settler who wants to make beasts of burden of them because of him and against him hatred blind hatred which is as yet an abstraction is their only wealth the master calls it forth because he seeks to reduce them to animals but he fails to break it down because his interests stop him halfway thus the half natives are still humans through the power and the weakness of the oppressor which is transformed within them into a stubborn refusal of the animal condition we realise what follows theyre lazy of courseits a form of sabotage theyre sly and thieving just imagine but their petty thefts mark the beginning of a resistance which is still unorganised that is not enough there are those among them who assert themselves by throwing themselves barehanded against the guns these are their heros others make men of themselves by murdering europeans and these are shot down brigands or martyrs their agony exalts the terrified masses yes terrified at this fresh stage colonial aggression turns inward in a current of terror among the natives by this i do not only mean the fear that they experience when faced with our inexhaustible means of repression but also that which their own fury produces in them they are cornered between our guns pointed at them and those terrifying compulsions those desires for murder which spring from the depth of their spirits and which they do not always recognise for at first it is not their violence it is ours which turns back on itself and rends them and the first action of these oppressed creatures is to bury deep down that hidden anger which their and our moralities condemn and which is however only the last refuge of their humanity read fanon you will learn how in the period of their helplessness their mad impulse to murder is the expression of the natives collective unconscious if this suppressed fury fails to find an outlet it turns in a vacuum and devastates the oppressed creatures themselves in order to free themselves they even massacre each other the different tribes fight between themselves since they cannot face the real enemyand you can count on colonial policy to keep up their rivalries the man who raises his knife against his brother thinks that he has destroyed once and for all the detested image of their common degradation even though these expiatory victims dont quench their thirst for blood they can only stop themselves from marching against the machineguns by doing our work for us of their own accord they will speed up the dehumanisation that they reject under the amused eye of the settler they will take the greatest precautions against their own kind by setting up supernatural barriers at times reviving old and terrible myths at others binding themselves by scrupulous rites it is in this way that an obsessed person flees from his deepest needsby binding himself to certain observances which require his attention at every turn they dance that keeps them busy it relaxes their painfully contracted muscles and then the dance mimes secretly often without their knowing the refusal they cannot utter and the murders they dare not commit in certain districts they make use of that last resortpossession by spirits formerly this was a religious experience in all its simplicity a certain communion of the faithful with sacred things now they make of it a weapon against humiliation and despair mumbojumbo and all the idols of the tribe come down among them rule over their violence and waste it in trances until it is exhausted at the same time these highplaced personages protect them in other words the colonised people protect themselves against colonial estrangement by going one better in religious estrangement with the unique result that finally they add the two estrangements together and each reinforces the other thus in certain psychoses the hallucinated person tired of always being insulted by his demon one fine day starts hearing the voice of an angel who pays him compliments but the jeers dont stop for all that only from then on they alternate with congratulations this is a defence but it is also the end of the story the self is disassociated and the patient heads for madness let us add for certain other carefully selected unfortunates that other witchery of which i have already spoken western culture if i were them you may say id prefer my mumbojumbo to their acropolis very good youve grasped the situation but not altogether because you arent themor not yet otherwise you would know that they cant choose they must have both two worlds that makes two bewitchings they dance all night and at dawn they crowd into the churches to hear mass each day the split widens our enemy betrays his brothers and becomes our accomplice his brothers do the same thing the status of native is a nervous condition introduced and maintained by the settler among colonised people with their consent laying claim to and denying the human condition at the same time the contradiction is explosive for that matter it does explode you know as well as i do and we are living at the moment when the match is put to the fuse when the rising birthrate brings wider famine in its wake when these newcomers have life to fear rather more than death the torrent of violence sweeps away all barriers in algeria and angola europeans are massacred at sight it is the moment of the boomerang it is the third phase of violence it comes back on us it strikes us and we do not realise any more than we did the other times that its we that have launched it the liberals are stupefied they admit that we were not polite enough to the natives that it would have been wiser and fairer to allow them certain rights in so far as this was possible they ask nothing better than to admit them in batches and without sponsors to that very exclusive club our species and now this barbarous mad outburst doesnt spare them any more than the bad settlers the left at home is embarrassed they know the true situation of the natives the merciless oppression they are submitted to they do not condemn their revolt knowing full well that we have done everything to provoke it but all the same they think to themselves there are limits these guerillas should be bent on showing that they are chivalrous that would be the best way of showing they are men sometimes the left scolds them youre going too far we wont support you any more the natives dont give a damn about their support for all the good it does them they might as well stuff it up their backsides once their war began they saw this hard truth that every single one of us has made his bit has got something out of them they dont need to call anyone to witness theyll grant favoured treatment to no one there is one duty to be done one end to achieve to thrust out colonialism by every means in their power the more farseeing among us will be in the last resort ready to admit this duty and this end but we cannot help seeing in this ordeal by force the altogether inhuman means that these lessthanmen make use of to win the concession of a charter of humanity accord it to them at once then and let them endeavour by peaceful undertakings to deserve it our worthiest souls contain racial prejudice they would do well to read fanon for he shows clearly that this irrepressible violence is neither sound and fury nor the resurrection of savage instincts nor even the effect of resentment it is man recreating himself i think we understood this truth at one time but we have forgotten itthat no gentleness can efface the marks of violence only violence itself can destroy them the native cures himself of colonial neurosis by thrusting out the settler through force of arms when his rage boils over he rediscovers his lost innocence and he comes to know himself in that he himself creates his self far removed from his war we consider it as a triumph of barbarism but of its own volition it achieves slowly but surely the emancipation of the rebel for bit by bit it destroys in him and around him the colonial gloom once begun it is a war that gives no quarter you may fear or be feared that is to say abandon yourself to the disassociations of a sham existence or conquer your birthright of unity when the peasant takes a gun in his hands the old myths grow dim and the prohibitions are one by one forgotten the rebels weapon is the proof of his humanity for in the first days of the revolt you must kill to shoot down a european is to kill two birds with one stone to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time there remain a dead man and a free man the survivor for the first time feels a national soil under his foot at this moment the nation does not shrink from him wherever he goes wherever he may be she is she follows and is never lost to view for she is one with his liberty but after the first surprise the colonial army strikes and then all must unite or be slaughtered tribal dissensions weaken and tend to disappear in the first place because they endanger the revolution but for the more profound reason that they served no other purpose before than to divert violence against false foes when they remainas in the congoits because they are kept up by the agents of colonialism the nation marches forward for each of her children she is to be found wherever his brothers are fighting their feeling for each other is the reverse of the hatred they feel for you they are bothers inasmuch as each of them has killed and may at any moment have to kill again fanon shows his readers the limits of spontaneity and the need for and dangers of organisation but however great may be the task at each turning of the way the revolutionary consciousness deepens the last complexes flee away no one need come to us talking of the dependency complex of an aln soldier c with his blinkers off the peasant takes account of his real needs before they were enough to kill him but he tried to ignore them now he sees them as infinitely great requirements in this violence which springs from the people which enables them to hold out for five yearsfor eight years as the algerians have donethe military political and social necessities cannot be separated the war by merely setting the question of command and responsibility institutes new structures which will become the first institutions of peace here then is man even now established in new traditions the future children of a horrible present here then we see him legitimised by a law which will be bom or is born each day under fire once the last settler is killed shipped home or assimilated the minority breed disappears to be replaced by socialism and thats not enough the rebel does not stop there for you can be quite sure that he is not risking his skin to find himself at the level of a former inhabitant of the old mother country look how patient he is perhaps he dreams of another dien bien phu but dont think hes really counting on it hes a beggar fighting in his poverty against rich men powerfully armed while he is waiting for decisive victories or even without expecting them at all he tires out his adversaries until they are sick of him it will not be without fearful losses the colonial army becomes ferocious the country is marked out there are moppingup operations transfers of population reprisal expeditions and they massacre women and children he knows this this new man begins his life as a man at the end of it he considers himself as a potential corpse he will be killed not only does he accept this risk hes sure of it this potential dead man has lost his wife and his children he has seen so many dying men that he prefers victory to survival others not he will have the fruits of victory he is too weary of it all but this weariness of the heart is the root of an unbelievable courage we find our humanity on this side of death and despair he finds it beyond torture and death we have sown the wind he is the whirlwind the child of violence at every moment he draws from it his humanity we were men at his expense he makes himself man at ours a different man of higher quality here fanon stops he has shown the way forward he is the spokesman of those who are fighting and he has called for union that is to say the unity of the african continent against all dissensions and all particularisms he has gained his end if he had wished to describe in all its details the historical phenomenon of decolonisation he would have to have spoken of us this is not at all his intention but when we have closed the book the argument continues within us in spite of its author for we feel the strength of the peoples in revolt and we answer by force thus there is a fresh moment of violence and this time we ourselves are involved for by its nature this violence is changing us accordingly as the halfnative is changed everyone of us must think for himselfalways provided that he thinks at all for in europe today stunned as she is by the blows received by france belgium or england even to allow your mind to be diverted however slightly is as good as being the accomplice in crime of colonialism this book had not the slightest need of a preface all the less because it is not addressed to us yet i have written one in order to bring the argument to its conclusion for we in europe too are being decolonised that is to say that the settler which is in every one of us is being savagely rooted out let us look at ourselves if we can bear to and see what is becoming of us first we must face that unexpected revelation the striptease of our humanism there you can see it quite naked and its not a pretty sight it was nothing but an ideology of lies a perfect justification for pillage its honeyed words its affectation of sensibility were only alibis for our aggressions a fine sight they are too the believers in nonviolence saying that they are neither executioners nor victims very well then if youre not victims when the government which youve voted for when the army in which your younger brothers are serving without hesitation or remorse have undertaken race murder you are without a shadow of doubt executioners and if you choose to be victims and to risk being put in prison for a day or two you are simply choosing to pull your irons out of the fire but you will not be able to pull them out theyll have to stay there till the end try to understand this at any rate if violence began this very evening and if exploitation and oppression had never existed on the earth perhaps the slogans of nonviolence might end the quarrel but if the whole regime even your nonviolent ideas are conditioned by a thousand yearold oppression your passivity serves only to place you in the ranks of the oppressors you know well enough that we are exploiters you know too that we have laid hands on first the gold and metals then the petroleum of the new continents and that we have brought them back to the old countries this was not without excellent results as witness our palaces our cathedrals and our great industrial cities and then when there was the threat of a slump the colonial markets were there to soften the blow or to divert it crammed with riches europe accorded the human status de jure to its inhabitants with us to be a man is to be an accomplice of colonialism since all of us without exception have profited by colonial exploitation this fat pale continent ends by falling into what fanon rightly calls narcissism cocteau became irritated with paris that city which talks about itself the whole time is europe any different and that supereuropean monstrosity north america chatter chatter liberty equality fraternity love honour patriotism and what have you all this did not prevent us from making antiracial speeches about dirty niggers dirty jews and dirty arabs highminded people liberal or just softhearted protest that they were shocked by such inconsistency but they were either mistaken or dishonest for with us there is nothing more consistent than a racist humanism since the european has only been able to become a man through creating slaves and monsters while there was a native population somewhere this imposture was not shown up in the notion of the human race we found an abstract assumption of universality which served as cover for the most realistic practices on the other side of the ocean there was a race of lessthanhumans who thanks to us might reach our status a thousand years hence perhaps in short we mistook the elite for the genus today the native populations reveal their true nature and at the same time our exclusive club reveals its weaknessthat its neither more nor less than a minority worse than that since the others become men in name against us it seems that we are the enemies of mankind the elite shows itself in its true coloursit is nothing more than a gang our precious sets of values begin to moult on closer scrutiny you wont see one that isnt stained with blood if you are looking for an example remember these fine words how generous france is us generous what about setif then and those eight years of ferocious war which have cost the lives of over a million algerians and the tortures but let it be understood that nobody reproaches us with having been false to suchandsuch a missionfor the very good reason that we had no mission at all it is generosity itself thats in question this fine melodious word has only one meaning the granting of a statutory charter for the folk across the water new men freed men no one has the power nor the right to give anything to anybody for each of them has every right and the right to everything and when one day our human kind becomes fullgrown it will not define itself as the sum total of the whole worlds inhabitants but as the infinite unity of their mutual needs here i stop you will have no trouble in finishing the job all you have to do is to look our aristocratic virtues straight in the face for the first and last time they are cracking up how could they survive the aristocracy of underlings who brought them into being a few years ago a bourgeois colonialist commentator found only this to say in defence of the west we arent angels but we at least feel some remorse what a confession formerly our continent was buoyed up by other means the parthenon chartres the rights of man or the swastika now we know what these are worth and the only chance of our being saved from shipwreck is the very christian sentiment of guilt you can see its the end europe is springing leaks everywhere what then has happened it simply is that in the past we made history and now it is being made of us the ratio of forces has been inverted decolonisation has begun all that our hired soldiers can do is to delay its completion the old mother countries have still to go the whole hog they still have to engage their entire forces in a battle which is lost before it has begun at the end of the adventure we again find that colonial brutality which was bugeauds doubtful glory but though it has been multiplied tenfold its still not enough the national service units are sent to algeria and they remain there seven years with no result violence has changed its direction when we were victorious we practised it without its seeming to alter us it broke down the others but for us men our humanism remained intact united by their profits the peoples of the mother countries baptised their commonwealth of crimes calling them fraternity and love today violence blocked everywhere comes back on us through our soldiers comes inside and takes possession of us involution starts the native recreates himself and we settlers and europeans ultras and liberals we break up rage and fear are already blatant they show themselves openly in the niggerhunts in algiers now which side are the savages on where is barbarism nothing is missing not even the tomtoms the motorhorns beat out algerie frangaise while the europeans bum moslems alive fanon reminds us that not so very long ago a congress of psychiatrists was distressed by the criminal propensities of the native population those people kill each other they said that isnt normal the algerians cortex must be underdeveloped in central africa others have established that the african makes very little use of his frontal lobes these learned men would do well today to follow up their investigations in europe and particularly with regard to the french for we too during the last few years must be victims of frontal sluggishness since our patriots do quite a bit of assassinating of their fellowcountrymen and if theyre not at home they blow up their house and their concierge this is only a beginning civil war is forecast for the autumn or for the spring of next year yet our lobes seem to be in perfect condition is it not rather the case that since we cannot crush the natives violence comes back on its tracks accumulates in the very depths of our nature and seeks a way out the union of the algerian people causes the disunion of the french people throughout the whole territory of the exmothercountry the tribes are dancing their wardances the terror has left africa and is settling here for quite obviously there are certain furious beings who want to make us pay with our own blood for the shame of having been beaten by the native then too there are the others all the others who are equally guilty for after bizerta after the lynchings of september who among them came out into the streets to shout weve had enough but less spectacularthe liberals and the toughs of the tender left the fever is mounting amongst them too and resentment at the same time and they certainly have the wind up they hide their rage in myths and complicated rites in order to stave off the day of reckoning and the need for decision they have put at the head of our affairs a grand magician whose business it is to keep us all in the dark at all costs nothing is being done violence proclaimed by some disowned by others turns in a vacuum one day it bursts out at metz the next at bordeaux its here there and everywhere like in a game of hunt the slipper its our turn to tread the path step by step which leads down to native level but to become natives altogether our soil must be occupied by a formerly colonised people and we must starve of hunger this wont happen for its a discredited colonialism which is taking hold on us this is the senile arrogant master who will straddle us here he comes our mumbojumbo and when you have read fanons last chapter you will be convinced that it would be better for you to be a native at the uttermost depths of his misery than to be a former settler it is not right for a police official to be obliged to torture for ten hours a day at that rate his nerves will fall to bits unless the torturers are forbidden in their own interests to work overtime when it is desirable that the morality of the nation and the army should be protected by the rigours of the law it is not right that the former should systematically demoralise the latter nor that a country with a republican tradition should confide hundreds and thousands of its young folk to the care of putschist officers it is not right my fellowcountrymen you who know very well all the crimes committed in our name its not at all right that you do not breathe a word about them to anyone not even to your own soul for fear of having to stand in judgement on yourself i am willing to believe that at the beginning you did not realise what was happening later you doubted whether such things could be true but now you know and still you hold your tongues eight years of silence what degradation and your silence is all of no avail today the blinding sun of torture is at its zenith it lights up the whole country under that merciless glare there is not a laugh that does not ring false not a face that is not painted to hide fear or anger not a single action that does not betray our disgust and our complicity it is enough today for two french people to meet together for there to be a dead man between them one dead man did i say in other days france was the name of a country we should take care that in it does not become the name of a nervous disease will we recover yes for violence like achilles lance can heal the wounds that it has inflicted today we are bound hand and foot humiliated and sick with fear we cannot fall lower happily this is not yet enough for the colonialist aristocracy it cannot complete its delaying mission in algeria until it has first finished colonising the french every day we retreat in front of the battle but you may be sure that we will not avoid it the killers need it theyll go for us and hit out blindly to left and right thus the day of magicians and fetishes will end you will have to fight or rot in concentration camps this is the end of the dialectic you condemn this war but do not yet dare to declare yourselves to be on the side of the algerian fighters never fear you can count on the settlers and the hired soldiers theyll make you take the plunge then perhaps when your back is to the wall you will let loose at last that new violence which is raised up in you by old oftrepeated crimes but as they say thats another story the history of mankind the time is drawing near i am sure when we will join the ranks of those who make it now that we in america face a new world indeed on the whole a receptive world and now that we are developing a sense of history long delayed what shall be the purpose of the negro from nowinto the future should we not call for a summit meeting of all the acknowledged leaders of the civil_rights movement to a round table conference in an endeavor to formalize a joint program of action for those basic human rights still denied the negro in the social political economic and educational area of life these leaders in the order of their standing both in america and abroad and in my own estimation of their contribution to the cause of the negro are dr martin_luther_king southern christian leadership conference sclc roy wilkins national association for the advancement of colored people naacp whitney young the national urban league james farmer congress of racial equality core john lewis student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc there are no longer any fundamental doctrinal issues that separate these groups or their leaders isnt there in fact too much fragmentation with the danger of even greater stratification and division between the groups that have been accepted as spokesmen for the american negro citizenry is not the drain on the treasury of each of these groups admittedly dangerous because of the excessive costs of operating on such a great national scale i refuse to believe that anyone of these leaders would deny the urgent need to meet to discuss these issues i am likewise convinced that each leader of each group would upon an urgent national call from the ranks of the negro people of america reply with a resounding yes who shall sound the call to these leaders these men in whose hands lie the plans for the virtual destiny of millions of their fellowmen these men who by their program will put america to the continuing litmus paper test of its humanism and its equal treatment of the negro i personally call upon the negro church the great religious leaders of the masses of the negro people too long under eclipse and too long surrendering their traditional roles as spokesmen for their million enrolled church members i also call upon the restless negro and white students in colleges north and south young men and women of energy and imagination the visionaries who give such impetus and life to these movements to urge these leaders to cease their bureaucratic differences and sit down at the conference table work out a common bargaining ground a concensus and elect a leader then merge their forces and formalize in a joint statement a series of resolutions of demands in every area of human rights and bring these demands to the attention of the president of the united states the attorney general and the leaders of both houses of congress such a demand for human rights based upon a strong legal and moral foundation will be unassailable and will be heralded and praised throughout america and the world and finally i ask those of you who will make this call to our leaders to urge the distinguished dr martin_luther_king who was recently honored with the bestowal of the nobel peace prize to become chairman and spokesman for the group i am certain the white churches and synagogues of america the great protestant catholic and jewish leaders will do as they did in their march to selma alabama give this proclamation their united support this group action in essence is what dr_king referred to when speaking of the needless waste of assets in the various drives for equality of the negro in the weeks following the assassination of malcolm_x when it appeared that a bitter and costly feuding between his followers and his former muslim group would erupt in bloodshed dr_king offered to mediate the differences between the two groups these two instances are but straws in the wind of what could happen in the area of agreement between the civil_rights groups if a clarion call for such a summit meeting were made and from the sources above suggested great miracles have often been wrought out of the commitment to a cause by a few people a word on the danger to the american negro and his present crusade for equal rights and participation in the american society by such movements as the black muslims the negro no longer lives as he did years ago in an isolated community what he does in harlem philadelphia cleveland detroit chicago and particularly in the south is broadcast throughout america and the world various interpretations are given to whatever may be reported about him or pictured about him depending upon the attitude of the news media or the place of coverage the death of malcolm_x for example was reported in the foreign press as the result of a giant conspiracy of white antinegro groups to kill negro civil_rights leaders this completely false picture was spread throughout europe asia africa and the communist world resulting in violent demonstrations in many of the african countries under the theory that malcolm_x was an american lumumba i point to the above as a warning note to the great and growing body of young negroes in the schools and colleges of america upon whom the destiny of the entire negro race depends that a renewed sense of purpose and a clarification of the objectives of the american negro is a prime necessity first and foremost it is imperative that we support every effort on the part of our local state and national governments for widespread and total education of the negro masses especially those in densely populated ghettos and pockets of poverty in the deep south and their counterparts in the metropolitan cities of the north there is a heavy responsibility on the part of the professional upperclass the better circumstanced and welltodo negro to sacrifice much of his time to help his brother at the lower level and particularly to give liberally of his money to those causes and there are many working to this end he must be willing to speak up and be heard in public meetings before the various boards of education not only for integrated education but for high quality education by the best and most qualified teachers he must assert that the negro taxpayer will support an increase in the tax rate however high it may be when funds are needed to build better schools and provide higher salaries for better quality education the poor of all races are the beneficiaries and our poor percentagewise unfortunately is the greater and he should be the first to support and insist upon a program of preschool education at the age of two and onehalf years and a longer school day and a shorter vacation period there is an urgent need for guidance values of negro children in their early years of life i have referred above to what history has done to them and their families for more than two centuries america is paying the cost of thisand we are the victims of that benighted history next of importance are the need of guidance values and a new awareness for the negro youth early in life beginning at preschool age and continuing through the primary and high school years with concentration on the need for total perfection and discipline a hierarchy of values and culture is an absolute necessity nothing has been a greater contributing factor to the negros lack of readiness for full participation in american opportunity today than the grave losses sustained by the negro because of the traditional treatment of the negro masses in our schools both north and south historically he was segregated by law in the south and provided with a minimum of education given by poorly trained and poorly equipped teachers in totally inadequate buildings worse the term of the school year was substantially less than that for white children in the north he found himself in ghetto schools for the most part defacto segregated confronted with a teaching staff with little interest or motivation it becomes necessary therefore for the negro to approach the necessity for mass education with a sense of tragedy that if we fail in thisall else fails we must inquire in the secondary or high school courses to find those unusual minds of excellence or those with unusual skills in the various sciences physical chemical and biological in the manual and creative arts the performing arts of music drama acting and expressionall to the end that the american negro heirs of a rich and vaunted african heritage of many centuries with a history of gigantic accomplishments in these and many other fields which leading world authorities now fully recognize may rise again to a place long denied the negro as one of the truly great races of the world we must give up our lives to this test of excellence and supremacy in this struggle for a place among the great races of the world which in its accomplishment will carry our native america to an even higher place among the nations of the world i speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy i urge members of both partiesamericans of all religions and c l rsfrom every sectionto join me in that cause at times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in mans unending search for freedom so it was at lexington and concord so it was a century ago at appomattox so it was last week in selma ala there longsuffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as americans many were brutally assaulted one good mana man of godwas killed there is no cause for pride in what happened in selma there is no cause for selfsatisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of americans but there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight for the cries of pain the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of the government of the greatest nation on earth our mission is at once the oldest and most basic of this country to right wrong to do justice to serve man in our time we have come to live with moments of great crisis our lives have been marked with debate about great issuesissues of war and peace of prosperity and depression but rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of america itself rarely are we met with a challenge not to our growth or abundance our welfare or security but to the values and purpose and meaning of our nation the issue of equal rights for american negroes is such an issue and should we defeat every enemy double our wealth conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue then we will have failed as a people and a nation for with a country as with a person what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul there is no negro problem there is no southern problem or northern problem there is only an american problem and we are met here tonight as americans not as democrats and republicans to solve that problem this was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose the great phrases of that purpose still sound in every american heart north and south all men are created equalgovernment by consent of the governed give me liberty or give me death those are not just clever words those are not just empty theories in their name americans have fought and died for two centuries and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty risking their lives those words are promised to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man this dignity cannot be found in mans possessions it cannot be found in his power it rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others it says that he shall share in freedom choose his leaders educate his children provide for his family according to his ability and merits as a human being to apply any other testto deny a man his hopes because of his color or race his religion or the place of his birthis not only to do injustice it is to deny america and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for freedom our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish it must be rooted in democracy the most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders the history of this country is in large measure the history of the expansion of that right to all our people many of the issues of civil_rights are complex and difficult but about this there can be no argument every american citizen must have an equal right to vote there is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right there is no duty which weighs more heavily on us to ensure that right yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting because they are negroes every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right the negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong the hour is late or the official in charge is absent if he persists and manages to present himself to the registrar he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application if he manages to fill out an application he is given a test the registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test he may be asked to recite the entire constitution or explain the most complex provision of state law even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read or write for the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination no law that we now have on the books and i have helped to put three of them there can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it in such a case our duty must be clear to all of us the constitution says no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color we have all sworn an oath before god to support and defend that constitution we must now act in obedience to that oath wednesday i will send to congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote the broad principles of that will be in the hands of democratic and republican leaders tomorrow after they have reviewed it it will come here formally as a bill i am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends to give them my views and to visit with my former colleagues i have prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which i had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which i will submit to the clerks tonight but i want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposals of this legislation this bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all electionsfederal state and localwhich have been used to deny negroes the right to vote it will establish a simple uniform standard which cannot be used however ingenious the effort to flout our constitution it will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the united states government if state officials refuse to cooperate it will eliminate tedious unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote finally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting i will welcome suggestions from all the members of congressi have no doubt i will get someon ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective but experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the constitution to those who seek to avoid action by their national government in their communitieswho seek to maintain purely local control over electionsthe answer is simple open your polling places to all your people allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin extend the rights of citizens to every citizen there is no constitutional issue here the command of the constitution is plain there is no moral issue it is wrong to deny any american the right to vote there is no issue of states rights or national rights there is only the struggle for human rights i have no doubt what will be your answer last time a president sent a civil_rights bill to congress it contained a provision to protect voting rights that bill was passed after eight long months of debate and when that bill came to my desk for signature the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated this time on this issue there must be no delay no hesitation no compromise with our purpose we cannot we must not refuse to protect the right of every american to vote in every election he may desire to participate in and we ought not and we cannot and we must not wait another eight months before we get a bill we have already waited years and more and the time for waiting is gone so i ask you to join me in working long hours nights and weekends if necessary to pass this bill and i dont make that request lightly for from the window where i sat with the problems of our country i recognize that outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of the nation the grave concern of many nationsand the harsh judgment of history on our acts but even if we pass this bill the battle will not be over what happened in selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of america it is the effort of american negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of american life their cause must be our cause too it is not just negroes but all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice and we shall overcome as a man whose roots go deeply into southern soil i know how agonizing racial feelings are i know how difficult it is to reshape attitudes and the structure of society but a century has passed more than years since the negro was freed and he is not fully freed tonight it was more than years ago that abraham lincoln a great president of another party signed the emancipation proclamation but emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact a century has passed more than years since the equality was promised and yet the negro is not equal the time of justice has now come no force can hold it back if it is right in the eyes of man and god that it should come and when it does that day will brighten the lives of every american for negroes are not the only victims how many white children have gone uneducated how many white families have lived in poverty how many white lives have been scarred by fear because we have wasted our energy and substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror those who ask you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future this great rich restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to allblack and white north and south sharecropper and city dweller these are the enemiespoverty and ignoranceand not our fellow man and these too shall be overcome let no one in any section look with prideful righteousness on the troubles of his neighbors there is no part of america where the promise of equality has been fully kept in buffalo as well as birmingham in philadelphia as well as selma americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom this is one nation what happens in selma or in cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every citizen but let each of us look within our own communities and our own hearts and root out injustice there tonight men from the south as well as the north men from the east as well as from the west are all americans all fighting together in viet nam men from every region fought for us across the world years ago in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the south made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region of the great republic i have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this countryfrom the great lakes down to the gulf of mexico from the golden gate to the harbors along the atlanticwill rally now together in this cause to vindicate the freedom of us all for all of us owe this duty all of us will respond to it the real hero of this struggle is the american negro his actions and protestshis courage to risk safety and even lifehave awaked the conscience of the nation his demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice to provoke change and stir reform he has called upon us to make good the promise of america and who among us can say we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery and his faith in american democracy for at the heart of battle for equality is a belief in the democratic process equality depends not on the force of arms but the force of moral rightnot on recourse to violence but on respect for law and there have been many pressures upon your president and there will be others as the days come and go but i pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be foughtin the courts and in the congress and in the hearts of men we must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly but the right of free speech does not carry with it as has been said the right to holler fire in a crowded theater we must preserve the right of free assembly but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares we do have a right to protestand a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors i intend to protect all those rights as long as i am permitted to serve in this office we will guard against violence knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons with which we seek progressobedience to law and belief in american values in selma as elsewhere we seek peace we seek order we seek unity but we will not accept the peace of stifled rights the order imposed by fear the unity that stifles protest for peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty in selma as in every city we are working for just and peaceful settlement we must remember that after this speechafter the police and the marshals have goneafter this bill is passed the people of selma must still live and work together when the attention of the nation has gone elsewhere they must try to heal the wounds and build a new community this cannot easily be done on a battleground of violence as the history of the south itself shows it is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such impressive responsibility in recent days the bill i am presenting will be known as a civil_rights bill but in a larger sense most of the program i am recommending is a civil_rights program its object is to open the city of hope to all our people all americans must have the right to vote and we are going to give them that right all americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race and they are going to have those privileges but to exercise that privilege takes more than legal right it requires a trained mind and a healthy body it requires a decent home and the chance to find a job and the opportunity to escape from poverty of course people cannot contribute to the nation if they are never taught to read or write if their bodies are stunted from hunger if their sickness goes untended if their life is spent in hopeless poverty we want to open the gates to opportunity but we are also going to give all our peopleblack and whitethe help they need to walk through those gates my first job after college was as a teacher in a small mexicanamerican school my students were poor and often hungry and they knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice they didnt understand why people disliked them but they knew it was so you could see it in their eyes i often walked home after classes wishing there was more i could do but all i knew was to teach them the little i knew hoping it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a child but now i do have that chance and ill let you in on a secreti mean to use it and i hope that you will use it with me this is the richest and most powerful country which ever occupied the globe the might of past empires is little compared to ours but i do not want to be the president who built empires or sought grandeur or extended dominion i want to be the president who educated young children to the wonders of their world i want to be the president who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be taxpayers instead of taxeaters i want to be the president who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election i want to be the president who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties i want to be the president who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth and so at the request of your beloved speaker and the senator from montana the majority leader and the senator from illinois the minority leader mr mcculloch rep william m mcculloch rohio and other members of both parties i came here tonight not as president roosevelt came down one time in person to veto a bonus bill not as president truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill but i came down here to ask you to share this task with me and to share it with the people we both work for i want this to be the congress republicans and democrats alike which did all these things for all these people beyond this great chamber out yonder in states are the people we serve who cannot tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen we all can guess from our own lives how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness how many problems each little family faces they look most of all to themselves for their futures but i think they also look to each of us above the pyramid of the great seal of the united states it says in latin god has favored our undertaking god will not favor everything that we do it is rather our duty to divine his will but i cannot help believing that he truly understands and that he really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight the struggle for ra v rial justice and brother i hood the time has jj come and is overdue for objectivity perspective calmness and reason dramatic heroism has served a useful function but oversimplification name calling and demagoguery are not the proper tools with which to resolve complex issues white and black men are offended and even angered when one attempts to evaluate racial problems without prejudice and misguided emotion nevertheless i shall now make such an attempt of course i realize that all men have prejudices and are only deceiving themselves when they claim to have no prejudices i too may unwittingly be indulging in that popular pastime which confuses thinking with a mere rearrangement of ones prejudices if so i ask your indulgence for my weakness and lack of insight although it is scarcely helpful to have prejudice in anyone who is trying to rectify what he considers to be prejudices in others that the white race has as a whole grossly mistreated colored races especially the negro race is a fact on which i assume we can all agree i also take for granted that many white people are thoroughly ashamed of the way white men have exploited black men and that we all sincerely want to atone personally for the past present and future racial sins of ourselves and other white men moreover i am aware that john steinbeck spoke rather accurately when he said i am constantly amazed at the qualities we expect in negroes no race has ever offered another such high regard we expect negroes to be wiser than we are more tolerant than we are braver more dignified than we more selfcontrolled and selfdisciplined we expect them to obey rules of conduct we flout to be more courteous more gallant more proud more steadfast nevertheless it is time that some white liberal points out to negroes how some whites who believe in equality for all people feel about negro prejudices which are damaging to both races the white man is not the only one who must answer whether he is his brothers keeper of course i know that many negroes understand this and act accordingly there is no such thing as a typical negro just as there is no such thing as a typical white mannot even a typical southern white man what i am saying is directed primarily at those negroes who generalize from particulars and hate or distrust all white men failing to give credit where it is due and willing to believe the worst about a white mans motives for his words and actions the fall issue of columbia college today quotes several negro college students whom i believe would understand what i am trying to say george sneed jr said the important thing to me is to be considered as an individual refuse to be thought of as a part of a mass problem and i dont feel any gratitude toward campus groups who treat me this way for negroes to be treated as individuals the key thing is to have more association between the races its hard to hate people you really know mr sneed was referring i am sure to an association on the basis of full equality and respect henry white said most people in harlem and i suspect other negroes feel very discouraged and are full of resentment against whitestoo much so i think negroes have to stop feeling so sorry for themselves my parents have taught me not to expect to have things handed to me but to work hard and get what i wanted my teachers have encouraged me in the same way but maybe if i had different parents and teacher i would feel trapped and bitter too i hope and trust that mr white realizes however that presentday american social and economic forces especially where negroes are concerned make it extremely difficult for some people to rise above their environment no matter how hard they work james alexander said when i first came to columbia i felt insecure every time i saw a negro face i automatically introduced myself now i have a lot of friends at the college and many of my white friends are as close as the negro ones r these young negro men and others like them represent the hope for the negro race and indeed for the entire human race while perhaps more fortunate in environment and opportunities than most other negroes or whites they nevertheless demonstrate that they have been able to keep intact their per sonalities and selfesteem in spite of white injustice and discrimination as charles eliot silberman a white economist and journalist points out in the same columbia magazine the negro will be unable to compete on equal terms until he stops despising himself and his fellows and purges from his mind all sense of black inferiority until he really believes with all his being that he is a free man and acts accordingly what i am saying is applicable not only to american negroes but to negro people everywhere when in december the united nations security council was debating the congo rescue action there was demonstrated among some of the african and asian nations an antiwhite bias which was both unbecoming and damaging adlai stevenson is a man of considerable patience understanding and concern for negro people therefore his words were not taken lightly when he spoke with indignation and sorrow i have served in the united nations from the day of its inception off and on for seven years but never before have i heard such irrational irresponsible insulting and repugnant language in these chambers language used if you please contemptuously to impugn and slander a gallant and successful effort to save human lives of many nationalities and colours i say that racial hatred racial strife has cursed the world for too long i make no defense of the sins of the white race in this respect but the antidote for white racism is not black racism racism of any form by anybody is an offense to the conscience of mankind and to the charter of the united nations racial problems are so numerous and complex and so interrelated with other problems that no wise person can expect easy answers in one master plan the back cover of negro digest wisely states that knowledge is the key to a better tomorrow i should like to add that so is trust better laws and social planning are necessary to help resolve racial problems but in the long run nothing will take the place of the permanent and solid way of daybyday relationships in numerous ordinary ways until people cease to think in terms of black and white as making any difference except color it is difficult now for negroes and whites to be natural around each other even men of good will in both races are just a little too enthusiastic to members of the opposite race white writers for negro magazines are often almost fawning in their attempts to assure negroes that while other white men may be prejudiced they themselves are not i should think any selfrespecting negro while appreciating the effort would cringe with embarrassment negroes in positive as well as negative ways must help white people break down the barriers of strangeness that help perpetuate segregation and all the evils that go with it it is true that communists both openly and subtly have exploited race prejudices and legitimate negro aspirations for their own purposes i dont believe however that many negro people anywhere in the world have long been deceived by communists if anything negro people have as a result become more cynical about white motives thus a negro comedian can jokingly but nonetheless bitterly condemn liberals who rent a negro to prove how liberal they are this comedian has a valid point to make but white people who are really trying to break down barriers between races are also treated with suspicion concerning their motives but here we must have help and understanding from negroes if we are to be in a position to help them in a sense our white children are underprivileged we talk about brotherhood but our children dont know any negro children to learn to take for granted as being just like white children negro people if they are really serious about brotherhood rather than merely seeking a reversal of injustice have an obligation to help white people rear their children without the blight of prejudice certainly i know that one runs the risk of being offended or having ones children hurt by a prejudiced remark made by a white child recently my five year old daughter reflecting certain community attitudes was heard by our older children using disparaging language concerning negroes the spanking we gave her will help her get her values straighter in the future but the job would be easier for white parents who are trying to rear their children without racial prejudice if negroes would be more understanding and helpful i am told that once when a negro visitor came into our church a white visitor walked out i can only say that if this happened and if it happened because of race prejudice that the visitor was not typical of our congregation in fact we do not have any members like that and we do not want members who have such attitudes it is somewhat ironic that the church of which i am the minister regularly loses some prospective white members because we are integrated and because of our ideas in racial matters yet negro people make a fetish of trying to integrate churches where they are obviously not wanted while ignoring a church that obviously does want them on a genuinely integrated basis and not merely as a token of integration but even without the risk of offense it is difficult to go where at least temporarily one stands out as different also one does not like to leave his friends at other churches nevertheless i am convinced that some negroes must be willing to make these sacrifices in order to help us all mature and get used to each other our family and mem bers of our congregation do visit negro churches in support of this ideal i remember that i used to dance with negro girls when i was a student at yale divinity school and i really didnt think i was prejudiced until one day in my hometown in georgia a white girl i was with sat down by a negro on a bus a white man then exclaimed that she was not any better than the negro a remark which made me extremely angry you see my prejudice was still showing it was years later before i could preach yes i would want my daughter to marry a negro negro digest july and mean it negroes and whites have to associate with each other on equal terms until the strangeness and prejudices wear off v equality friendship and brotherhood imply a free give and take negro and white people of good will must learn to speak frankly to each other without suspecting prejudices and inferior motivation negroes are not treated as equals as long as they are handled with kid gloves by whites afraid that feelings will be hurt or that they themselves will be misunderstood nor can negroes continue to have one face for negroes and another for whites neither negro nor white people can mature so long as white liberals pretend that negroes can do no wrong and are not subject to rules of decency and morality this is true no matter how immoral and vicious other white people are or how lax white people of good will are in protecting negro people against unjust white people uncontrolled and lawless negro gangs are just as vicious and wrong as their counterparts in the ku klux klan as a white man i can work to counter white prejudice but negro prejudice is something about which i as a white man can do little in the october issue of look jim brown a cleveland browns negro football star spoke of how he was being lionized by a crowd one day until confronted with a little white girl who wanted to hug him mr brown spoke of friendly looks becoming frozen he did not let the little white girl express her admiration for him he seemed to be mad at the entire white race for this prejudice but i should like to point out to jim brown that he himself is contributing to continued prejudice he should have let the little girl hug him even if smiles did become frozen does mr brown believe that courage is only demonstrated on the football field or in picket lines or in defiant attitudes if looks ever are to become unfrozen the jim browns are going to have to risk rejection and prejudice it seems to me that in a way that crowd was overcoming its prejudice more than jim brown was his when white people make an effort please my negro brother do not rebuff them because other white men have hurt you please forgive our past ignorance and callousness if we are now trying to atone forgiveness is essential if life is to be based on reality give credit for growth dont reject friendship even if there are still prejudices to be overcome and even if many white people fumble awkwardly and ineffectively in our attempts to be brotherly and righteous of course it goes without saying that negroes also have to be accepted with their prejudices by white people indeed negroes in order to be tolerant and just have to be more understanding and tolerant than white people there is so infinitely much more to understand and forgive but i am pleading with negroes for their own sakes and the cause of civilization everywhere that they try to rid themselves of the poison of hatred many negroes have done so wonderfully well and i am not speaking of the mask put on by socalled buffoons or uncle toms here again however it is easy for negroes to criticize the constructive permanent methods of fair and realistic negro leaders while being swept off their emotional feet by demagoguery as woodrow wilson ironically said the man on horseback is always a hero the apostles of hate of all colors may yet win the day if so in the long run it will not matter whether there is black or white supremacy the world will not be a fit place for anybody soapbox oratory is not going to bring brotherhood the future belongs to countless unsung negro and white people who are determined to love to forgive and to understand in order to find permanently satisfactory solutions to their problems segregation is on the way out future generations will read about us in their history books and wonder how we could have been so blindly prejudiced the time will come when races will have merged because the taboo of color will no longer separate people in marriage or in any other meaningful human relationship within a year after the civil war ended a negro entered a fashionable richmond virginia church and knelt at the altar while communion was being served emotions ran high until a distinguished layman arose in his pew stepped forward to the altar and knelt beside his negro brother the layman was general robert e lee moved by his example the whole congregation came forward and knelt at the altar today there is increasingly real hope that when courageous forgiving seeking negroes kneel at the altars of white churches they will be permanently joined by repentant whites as we all pray let us break bread together on our knees when im on my knees with my face to the rising sun o lord have mercy on me the american consumer is a trusting soul and because of this he has become fairgame for hucksters and unscrupulous businessmen using deceit and insincerity the baitvertiser fools his victims so completely that most times they dont have the slightest idea that theyve been tricked and dont think that you are immune from getting hooked by a bait ad more than once youll see what appears to be a tremendous bargain rush to the store or invite the firms sales representative for a free home demonstration youll soon discover that the bait advertiser isnt very eager to sell you the product he advertised it will be temporarily out of stock or youll be told it really isnt for you because it is an inferior product gradually the sales pitch will start to upsell you to a product that sells for a lot more than the one advertised the bait advertiser spends big sums for direct mail newspaper radio and tvall designed to offer something which he has little or no intention to sell but in reality to get you on the hook did you ever see an ad for a vacuum cleaner with a picture of an upright upon which you can read the name hoover do you really think that you are being given a chance to purchase a rebuilt hoover vacuum cleaner for just ok you take the bait and invite the salesman to your home how wrong can you go for for even a used cleaner the salesman will arrive at your home and place a few sprinkles of baking soda on your living room rug the machine will wheeze in agony and the powder will stay put on the carpet a pretty poor machine id say the salesman says these old rebuilt machines never seem to work right i cant offer you any guarantee of any sort so why do you want to buy such a piece of junk it isnt by accident that the salesman just happens to have a new machine in his automobile trunk he brings it into the house and it works perfectly this ought to do the trick and the price is only but im going to let you have it for only you can readily see that the ad was just a comeon in fact the price mentioned is not the regular price of the machine he demonstrated its regular price is only but a reputable store would be a better source because it will stand in back of its written guarantee the bait advertiser could not compete on equal terms with a reputable dealer one reason for him to misuse the name of a good firm like hoover the second hand house you may have bought will have an old heating system youve been dickering with a neighborhood firm to install a new gas furnace but before you sign the contract you notice an ad for a much lower price than that which was quoted to you by the first firm beware an actual case in the records of the better business bureau of cleveland tells the story of a home owner who bought a bargain installation the bill was for more than above the newspaper advertised price and when she remonstrated she was told that the ad said btus hardly large enough to heat her home and the ad had a small notation saying that installation was extra does your home need asbestos siding home owners throughout the east have been plagued by a firm which advertised to cover an average x home for only if you take note of these measurements youll realize that the average home spoken of will almost fit into your living room those who signed contracts for this installation received bills from two to four times the advertised price want to save money now and not refurnish your own apartment ok lets make your old furniture do there are ads offering to reupholster a sofa and a chair in decorators fabrics for only the salesman for this firm wasnt even subtle lady he said to one housewife you couldnt possibly redo two pieces of furniture for only and get nice fabrics the ad is only a comeon so that i can show you samples of better grade fabrics you may think that you can cut corners on the family budget by buying a sewing machine and making some clothes at home dont be hooked by the ad offering a genuine rebuilt singer sewing machine for only there is no such thing the machine is rebuilt all right with japanese parts or with inferior bootleg parts try as you might the salesman wont even let you buy the machine hell pitch for you to buy a more expensive model and dont even apologize for the unauthorized use of the singer name want to save on your fuel bills radio advertising will blare forth the tremendous bargain of a combination storm and screen offered to home owners for just installed free of charge just try to buy one the storekeeper will all but hit you over the head trying to convince you why you should buy his regular special at a price several times the amount of the advertised special many states have had so many complaints filed with the attorney generals office that consumer frauds bureaus were established in quite a few the authorities are attempting to protect the consumer from the merchants who trick and deceive by bait advertising and from merchants who use other devious methods to cheat the public in practice bait ads are damaging to the entire community these ads give business to the advertiser who stoops to trickery taking away business from the honest merchant yet how do you spot a bait ad many reputable firms run ads which feature what is known in the trade as loss leaders they offer merchandise at rock bottom prices to entice you to come to the store and possibly make other purchases in fact the bait advertiser is right when he tells you that the higher priced product will give you better service and might very well cost less in the long run but the fact remains that if you are going to spend more for a product than the bargain price advertised youd be better off not dealing with the bait advertiser after all anyone whod trick you to make a sale wont hesitate to give ou poor service sell shoddy products and fail to back up the products guarantee most businessmen try to offer top quality merchandise at fair prices this is how they grow in reputation and in sales however the rotten minority can hurt you in your pocketbook here are some ways in which you can protect yourself against the baitvertiser remember that you cant get something for nothing shy away from amazing or fantastic bargains the stores you know and trust seldom use such terms talk to your friends and neighbors about the reputation of any firm you plan to do business with a good reputation is the result of fair play and stores with such a reputation dont have to resort to bait ads shop around and obtain comparative prices on merchandise or services you plan to buy to make sure you are on the trail of a good product at a fair price before you expose yourself to a firm of unknown reputation a price far below that quoted by a reputable firm is a danger signal ado not buy from anyone unless he can show you the product he advertises and is willing to sell it without knocking it a reputable firm does not handle products which it considers inferior never sign any paper of any kind until you have read it and are sure you understand it a firm interested in its reputation wants you to know exactly what you are getting before you commit yourself remember that bait advertising the alluring but insincere offer to sell something is going to trick a lot of people out of a lot of money today and every day dont let it trick you suspicious that you are the planned victim of a bait advertiser call your local office of the better business bureau or your local chamber of commerce and ask if the firm has a clean record did you fall victim to a baitvertiser swallow your pride and bring the facts to the attention of the consumer frauds bureau of your state president johnson designated may as senior citizens month in the hope that all citizensof will participate in helping make life beyond a better life for senior citizens of our land why suddenly a special month designated for considering the problems of old folks perhaps some statistics from the presidents council on aging will help to focus the light of information on this largeand growing american minority fred panzer director of public information for the council provides the following data every seconds one american turns thats an hour a day million a year today nearly million men and women in the united states are over by the year the number will be more than million adds mr panzer a numerous aged population is a uniquely modern achievement and challenge three powerful social forces are responsibleindustrialization urbanization and medical progress together they create the conditions that generate an aged population and its problems these problems confront americans of all ages indirectly through our parents and grandparents directly as we ourselves grow older these problems have to do with a usually diminishing income a scarcity of jobs declining health and high medical costs inadequate or unavailable housing and special living requirements mr panzer describes the problems as follows income our old people are quite frequently our poor people as the economic mainstream has risen from scarcity to affluence it has left millions of our aged stranded in the backwaters of poverty there are elderly families with less than a year nearly elderly individuals live on less than a year jobs in most respects the aged have the same problems as the rest of the populationonly more so this is certainly true about employment age bias begins at and age alone is too often the excuse for arbitrarily removins men and women from active participation in life health the hardships of hospitalization in later years are commonplace only one out of ten senior citizens will escape at least one lengthy costly stay in a hospital older persons need three times more hospital care than the rest of the population yet their average income is only half as high housing the important field of housing for older americans commands attention one out of each five dwelling units occupied by persons over is substandard housing for our aged is complex and neglected social needs modern living shatters traditional family life and relations between children parents and grandparents the gap between the generations widens it is being partly filled by social service agencies public and private they try to provide the care that too many families can no longer provide for themselves and what of the negro aged the minority within this special minoritythe manpower report to president johnson in march had the following observations the difficulties which beset the older worker in the job market are multiplied manyfold for the older negro not only is he hurt by discriminatory employment practices because of race but the factors which are a disadvantage to older workers generally inadequate education and employment in less skilled occupations are even more pronounced among the older negroes among men to years of age in the median number of years of school completed by nonwhites nearly all negroes and hereafter so referred to was only about six years compared with nine years for whites in this age group only about per cent of the negro men in these ages in were employed in clerical professional and other types of whitecollar jobs as against about per cent of the white men nearly half of all the older negroes were either laborers or service workers and thus subject to frequent and extended periods of joblessness and to meager incomes the rate of unemployment for negro men workers aged and over was per cent in march two and onehalf times as high as that for older white workers moreover among those to about one and onethird times as high a proportion of negro as white men were not in the labor force presumably many of them had decided there was little or no possibility of finding employment consequently the average income of older negro men is only about half that of older white men an even greater income disparity than exists between negroes and whites in the younger age groups although differences in education and other qualifications partly explain the income gap between white and negro workers there is ample evidence of unequal renumeration for equally qualified workers older negro workers have considerably lower average earnings than white workers with the same years of education in the same occupation the older negro professional men as a group earned less than the overall average for older white men in all occupations including laborers the housing and home finance agency released a report on the aging nonwhite negro and his housing which further pointed up the disparity between the white and black aged and the conditions under which they live for example of the negroes of or over reported in the census some per cent or live inside cities most in substandard dwellings more than threefifths had income of less than while only one of eight had an income of or more and aged negroes lived in generally more overcrowded homes than whites fortunately something is now being done to help the aged both black and white and to bring the gap between financial resources and general living conditions available to the two racial groups in the annual report to president johnson from the council on aging health education and welfare secretary anthony j celebrezze said that the federal government spent more than billion during to assist the aged in the fields of income payments housing employment health and welfare there are a total of federal programs for older americans hospital insurance through social security was arranged last november the presidents council on aging founded in may assists the president in meeting the problems of the aged it keeps up a continuing study of the governments responsibilities to these problems and makes recommendations regarding policies and programs council members include heads of cabinet departments and independent agencies that administer the major federal programs in aging mr celebrezze is chairman and warren t roudebush is staff director other members of the council are c douglas dillon secretary of the treasury orville l freeman secretary of agriculture john t connor secretary of commerce w willard wirtz secretary of labor robert c weaver administrator housing and home finance agency john w macy jr chairman civil service commission and william j driver administrator of veterans affairs o often one hears the accusation that the negro has made few if any significant contributions to the culture of america even the eminent university of chicago physiologist dr dwight j ingle has said as much in his statement that there is historical evidence to assert that the white race has made greater contribution than the negro race in terms of discovery and social evolution dr ingle does try to be objective in his studies on these matters presenting an apparent contradiction or refutation perhaps of each negative theory that he presents yet few persons have not heard these accusations and often their refutations seem weak somehow thus many persons including the negro himself are often puzzled about this subculture creature called the american negro who has been accused of being at best only a secondrate imitator who like the horrid barnacle has clung to the bottom of society which never wanted him anyway giving little or nothing to that society as a candid observation of the american language will show however the negro has made a contribution but like so many of his efforts as a member of a minority this too has gone largely ignored henry l mencken often spoke of the distinct quality of american english for taking any word or phrase and utilizing it to its own advantage even if it took liberties linguists note that a word which is slang dialectal provincial or otherwise substandard today may tomorrow change its course a looksee into any good etymological dictionary will show that this has certainly happened to two standard words namely silly and nice to recall only twoand this happened before these words reached american shores there is simply no end to the words and expressions deliberate creations of the american negro often used by those who have no idea of their origin who can say which among these will not defy time itself and emerge one day at the pinnacle of linguistic esteem language grows out of a mutual agreement between one or more people that one must communicate that one must make himself understood that one must give thus something of the history of the negros struggle for identity and often utter salvation is to be found in his unique capacity to communicate with a pungency that is purely his own what depth of meaning is conveyed in the negros classification of his god as a waymaker or of his overbearing neighbor as seditty no known spelling by the way or highpolluted a much more accurate metaphor than highfalutin of whih it is a corruption and who can use sugared terms with such casual endearment words like baby sugar or honey how many irksome situations those epithets have soothed moreover no one uses the word us as the negro does in embracing all of his people friends and enemies alike so long as they are negroes whites tend to use them especially in considering their foes and take the word signify no race uses that word with such insinuation and innuendo literally the merriamwebster dictionaries say that the word denotes to show by sign to communicate by words signals and the like to make known to mean denote import to have meaning to matter often used impersonally the oxford dictionary indicates that the word has carried such meanings since the fifteenth century but in my childhood i heard my neighbors use that word with weighty significance to signify meant something tantamount to cardinal sin hes always signifyin on me was an expression to cause consternation to all hearers no one could speculate on what might result to the guilty fellow proof that the negro is a keen observer of mankind is to be found in such words as busthead for an intellectual negro hammerman for the person of authority alligator now shortened to the jive word gate for a dude a sporty swaggering welldressed hep cat the sophisticated fellow who did not have to prove his manliness by fighting alligators or indians the very use of mister before any term object or concept in order to personify it verbs and nouns are rich in onomatopoeia in negro speech consider the following to have ones glasses on meaning to be haughty or formal to igg to ignore a cruncher a road or street conkbuster cheap liquor headlight a lightskinned negro hanging out not up to par as a descriptive adjective or to be rained on to be disappointed or tricked some words are actually of pure african origin among these are cuffee goober and pinder cuffee is an african word for negro goober is from the bantu word nuguba and pinder comes from a nigerian word the latter two words meaning peanut are deliberately derogatory usages which reflect disdain for efforts of the negro toward the culture of the language yet strongly refute the claim that the negro has made no contribution thereto both the plant and the word were transported bodily from africa it is perfectly natural for peoples to corrupt pronunciations of perfectly good words when those words change environs whites not knowing the literary accuracy of goober and pinder laughed these words to the derision of illiteracy who knows how many other words long since lost have followed this same course another fine linguistic contribution to the colloquy is bill bojangles robinsons copacetic no dictionary gives bill robinson this credit some claim the word comes from the yiddish with an original kspelling nevertheless it still remains that bill robinson gave the word its special flavor of meaning for fine all right or ok one hears a close onomatopoetic association with the latin word copia from which comes copious with the meaning of spatial abundance hence a state of allrightness the examples could be multiplied by research the negros use of the american language reflects strongly his battlesemotional psychological sociological economic and spiritualas he has journeyed from slavery toward freedom in a recent article alan rich writing in the new york herald tribune has said the following negro singers almost without exception as many writers have pointed out have a special gift for making the language beautiful and natural few caucasians can come within miles of this with the possible exception of the welsh and the english from the north of their country it may be a matter of dialect or it may be something physical if one reviews the many years the negro has lived in america there can be little doubt that this gift of tongues is a combination of many factors none of which can be ignored in evaluating the negros place in the american colloquy someone said he didnt care who made the laws of a people as long as he could write their songs in songs ones words become part of the speech and thought of a people and influence their ideas and attitudes some of the words of our poets have attained this influence at least to the extent of being used as titles of books john howard griffin took the title of his book black like me about a white man who darkens his skin and travels through the south to find out what it is like to be a negro from langston hughes dream variations just to mention the spirituals reminds us of how deep an impress they have made on our language and through it on our minds titles taken from the spirituals rush to the memory baldwins go tell it on the mountain alan lomaxs the rainbow sign mary whitt ovingtons the walls came tumbling down howard thurmans deep river albert luthulis and henrietta buckmasters let my people go anna arnold hedgemans the trumpet sounds eugene oneills all gods chillum got wings ama bontemps golden slippers frederic ramseys been here and gone has a title taken from those other black and unknown bards the folk singers who left us our legacy of ballads blues work songs hollers and other folk songs if all the roads the buildings the dams the artifacts that negroes have built in their three hundred years in this country were to vanish suddenly yet their monuments would still remain in the lines and phrases which the poets known and unknown have left in the songs and in the daily speech of men in his declining years sam clemens may have been critical of the bible but as a journalist most of his life he had learned one of its lessons this lesson was to be his key for unlocking the meaning of his stories know you the truth and the truth shall make you free clemens as mark twain used truth as a weapon in his lifelong fight against mans inhumanity to man as manifested in slavery and more subtly in bigotry because he was the only southern writer to write the truth about life in the south he was called by william dean howels the most desouthernized southerner i know and the lincoln of our literature most of us have read huckleberry finn and pondered over the section where huck struggles with his conscience this wasnt just a morality lesson this was huck speaking in the language and logic of the southland trying to understand the irrational it was twains way of putting the south under the searing light of truth he wanted them to realize their attitudes and actions toward the negro were unfair unreasonable cruel and hypocritical in the light of their christian upbringing it appears he hoped too optimistically that the southerner would understand and seek to mend his ways but after all the truth hurts and these truths were not the sort to be admitted especially when the myth of magnolia blossoms romance and genteel living were the image the south tried to put forward the hypocrisy of the churches in the matter did not escape in an essay about the decay of lying twain bemoaned the fact that lying in its noble formstorytelling about jumping frogs and the like had been replaced by the vicious and degrading practice of preachers who stand in pulpits and rationalize slavery ministers today who have been chastised for failing to take a stand on the greatest moral issue of our time can look back and see how long they have been procrastinating even mark twain was concerned about it most readers then did not take him seriously on these matters because his outcries were just an abolitionists opinion and worse the opinion of a man who deserted the confederate army after being drafted into it or maybe they just called him names to cloak their guilty consciences the most shocking truth twain was to explore was of course miscegenation in puddnhead wilson some were critical because it glorified the atheist some hooted at its using fingerprints but they all steered clear of the horrible truth that the footprints of two children revealed he was no joel chandler harris when he wrote that tale of a young white raised thinking he was a negro and a young negro raised as a white no it was mark twain using truth who told how they found out who they were at he left the reader the problem of deciding what kind of life the pair would then face because after all the reader had helped make the world they lived in it was here that the indignities forced upon negro women by white men were told of with a cas f ualness that misled the southern reader they were so used to the practice and safe in the knowledge that reprisals never followed that they failed to realize that twain was the only writer who dared to mention this degrading and sorry element of life among the magnoliablossomcovered southern aristocracy no gone with the wind will ever wipe out the truth that twain told it was after all the sort of things one doesnt talk about but he did he not only talked about it he built his book around it when after all the fingerprint theory could have been examined in hundreds of other plots most southern writers painted a picture of the negro that kept the bigot happy saying there see what they are like or see how happy they always are twain knew the happy negro was a myth because he had learned young in his autobiography he told of the young slave boy who was always cutting up laughing and shouting to the point of annoying young sam clemens then on one of his midnight walks around the aunts plantation where the slave boy lived sam came upon the boys cabin he listened and heard a gentle sobbing the sobbing continued all night and so it was every night that sam visited the place it was then that he learned the slave boys parents were in maryland where the boy would never see them again so the happy slave boy cried himself to sleep every night but his oh so human pride would not let him reveal that deep sorrow to any whitesthe myth would have been punctured twains comment was that boy showed more courage than any man i ever met so when jim moans over his familys being so far away we see this childhood episode being replayed when huck shows the love and understanding that the southern white always has for the negro and says why he misses his folks as much as white folks do it dont seem natural but he does we see this isnt just an ignorant boy muttering this is mark twain again damning the south and quietly asking man to let the truth set all men free truth was used in so many ways although some was more theory at the time at the top of a page in puddnhead wilsons calendar was the inscription training is everything the peach was once a bitter almond cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education here was the great humorist putting forth the idea that environment made the man and so in the book about puddrihead valet de chambre although really white southern aristocrat was at illiterate able to use only the basest dialect was vulgar and uncouth could not feel at home in a drawing room but was at ease in a kitchen but nothing could change him now that he learned he was white rich and free he could wear fine clothes move in the best circles but he could not endure these new terrors he was now a caricature a pathetic and sorry humanthe stereotyped negro of southern writers but if he was terrified what about tom actually a negro but he had lived as a dandy attending yale and coming home as a sort of conquering hero he also could not face his new life and roxy the slave whose son by her white master had been raised as a white through her switching babies in their cribs was called by twain heir of two centuries of unatoned insult and outrage there was nothing subtle about that remark it was twain using the truth again although twain left the confederacy and its army behind because he was bitterly antiwar the absurdity and cruelty of the southern system and cause made it easy for him he looked at that southern system and gave descriptions of masters a fairly humane man toward slaves and other animals but lest that phrase mislead you the same master was called a thief because he was the man who daily robbed him the slave of an inestimable treasuryhis liberty langston hughes has called twain as modern as faulkner for his handling of the puddnhead story this seems to fit for both twain and faulkner loved their southland but their writings about them were as acid as any goya etching painting people as they were in the hopes that men would see themselves as others do and so become the men they should be the book roughing it contains many examples of twains desouthernization at least in attitude he occasionally gave in and deleted something a chapter in life on the mississippi was taken out but a story was left in that was a cozy tale of the southern ideas of delicacy refinement religion and womanhood and he illustrated them with nice examples of southern gentlemen shooting and stabbing others this also explains twains distaste for sir walter scott to him scott was an early perpetrator of the sort of roses and magnolia legend of the prewar south the sentimentality of scott romances were just false to twain who had grown up in such a place some said that twain deleted that rarely read chapter from life on the mississippi because it would have offended his friends in the southland those who say that must not have read huck for hucks straight reporting of the scene in the south at that time is an indictment of a nation a region a people and certainly a tradition the lowlife pap who promises not to vote as long as a free negro is allowed to vote is real just like the cotton aristocracyhotheads like jefferson davis who made the civil war twain the journalist had long ago learned that the truth is better than any exaggeration and usually more flamboyant so huck reports calmly and coolly seeing brutality cowardice chicanery loyalty and courage in all the people he met and it wasnt just rednecks such as pap the bustling old mrs phelps wanted huck to explain why he had been delayed in getting where he didnt know he was heading it warnt the groundingthat didnt keep us back but a little we blowed out a cylinder head good gracious anybody hurt no mam killed a nigger well its lucky because sometimes people do get hurt now if the phelps were not at the top of the social ladder then colonel sherburn was and the good colonel shot down the drunken boggs in cold blood because he had promised to kill him if boggs insulted him again so when old boggs staggers up and insults the colonel again well the colonel as any gentleman should keeps his promise and shoots him dead the fact that he was killing a helpless man is apparently immaterial if an aristocrats honor is at stake when jim says he will steal his wife and child if he cant earn the money to buy them huck is shocked that he was plannin to steal his child from a man he didnt even know and who had never done him no harm but very soon after that huck lies to the men searching for runaways and saves jims life he then ponders why he feels so good after having done something wrong twain made gentle suggestions too in innocents abroad he recommended the system he found in certain lands of freeing slaves who showed an aptitude for some useful trade here he was asking the south if the myth that the negro showed no ambition couldnt be tested by giving a slave some reason to have ambition certainly he must have reasoned who would be ambitious when life offered only utter despair in those extraordinary twins he showed wales mccormick making jesting advances to aments mulato girl and the girls mother made almost no objection it was the privilege of the dominant race to exercise the droit du seigneur if it chose there again was utter despair in an essay he wrote that the happy songs the negro sings all seem to be about life after death and dying mark twain told truths as a journalist and he asked questions he asked why the southerner does not trust the shiftless negro and yet trusts mammies to raise their young children when the offspring are at their most impressionable ages when asked twain said the noblest trait a man can have is to love his fellow man but the rarest trait he does have is love for his enemy that man was called old and sick when he wrote an essay the united states of lyncherdom no longer subtle he came out ripping and tearing into lynching and said justice must be equitable the same for all he asked he wrote an essay to foreigners so they might understand the missionaries we send in to a person sitting in darkness he asked shall we go on conferring our civilization on those sitting in darkness when we as a nation set people free only to put them back in chains and kill to take a mans land he was also upset about the treatment of the indian when he attacked ministers who rationalized slavery twain was not aiming at religion itself he was attacking men for their lack of responsibility he was displeased because they had not achieved what he felt they were capable of achieving so in picturing the south twain painted a picture of dorian gray a looking into the soul a sinister soul whose crime of constant crime of indignity to humans wason earth at leastunpunished so twains negroes lived in a hell on earth as did their real brothers but he didnt make them mute they spoke outrealistically of courseto each other and to the huck finns who represented the wisdom of youth that hant been taught to hate yet their simple pleas for the basic comforts and dignity ring out as did martin_luther_kings plea for his dream jim just wanted his wife and child with him the sobbing slave boy just wanted his parents when roxy switched babies she just wanted the best of life for her son as would any mother they spoke from no soapboxes they spoke from their hearts and most important they spoke truth through the pen of mark twain truth is accuracy and when he had mrs phelps make her callous and stupid remark about the negro killed by the cylinder head he was being accurate it was not out of place it was in some ways the sort of thing we dont talk about but the reporter twain didnt think offtherecord comments belonged offtherecord when they told a real truth of sickness of a people yet van wyck brooks criticized twain for writing for the masses and not for the intellectual elite the masses of twains day were not used to reading anything much less the truth about miscegenation and other quaint practices of the southland they didnt even talk about such things twains observations about what white mans civilization had meant to the sandwich isles leave no doubt as to his belief that other races deserve a chance to build a better world because his own race had sure botched things up but he rarely shouted out about these outrages oh near the time when haleys comet was to come take him away he said some very bitter things about man god and everything in between but it was more just rehashing what he had been saying all along in his life with the pen he had gone from the gentle lessons of huckleberry finn to the discussing of the peculiar institutions peculiar institution was his name for slavery most vile evil in puddn head wilson in the latter he let two lives be ruined not by roxys switch but by a system that was and is ugly but we often miss his message with indifference similar to that of new yorkers who watched a woman stabbed to death we have read this panorama of mans inhumanity to man on a far larger and more revolting scale and then remembered only the laughs mark twain had not thought it necessary to say here it is i am telling you all about whats wrong down there like the girl who was stabbed he thought just a simple sight of what was happeningof the truthwas enough so unlike the weather which they talk about but do nothing about here was a problem that they didnt even talk about but mark twain did and today some talk about it and some do something about it sam clemens was born and reared in the south but before the hate was drilled into his head he heard another boy sobbing in the night this was truth this was injustice so when he told stories about other such injustices he thought others would see he couldnt know that parents would hurry up the hateteaching process so that whole legislatures would reel in terror at the thought of three or four small children going to a school his truth of mrs phelps was just as real as the whitesheeted maniac who sneered about the four children who died in the birmingham bomb blast he called a master a thief for stealing anothers liberty and that truth is still with us in certain senators and congressmen but mark twain apparently thought man could and would learn he knew the truth he wrote the truth so men could read the truth he wanted them to know the truth for if man knew the truth the truth shall make you free the american society of african culture amsac held a threeday student news editors conference at hampton institute toward the end of last march and several african and american student editors had the opportunity of getting to know each other under amsac auspices there is no certainty that the two groups established any concrete bridges of mutual understanding however during one explosive session there occurred an exchange of bareboned viewpoints which should have established a basis for an ultimate meeting of minds a young man from howard university taking the floor after amsac director calvin h raullerson had observed that american students had not participated in the sessions to the extent of the africans lit the torch to the inflammable situation he was weary he said in effect of ceaseless complaining from the africans who in their own countries offered no better examples of the institutions and customs they criticized in america in response a young man from kenya seized the spotlight and elo quently explained why the africans complained their complaints he insisted was a matter of defense we were told that america had the ideal form of government that there was a democracy in the united states and that we should aspire to that form of government he declared but was shocked when i came here to find that there is no democracy here i have been here four years now and i am still shocked we were told by the americans that we should emulate this form of government but now we know that we must defend our own customs and our own idea of government that is why we complain the kenyan was followed to the microphone by a young man from southern rhodesia who while affirming the sentiments of his colleague from kenya added that he complained because of the way his brothers in america were treated under the american government in the burst of spontaneous applause the dangerous heat subsided core chief james farmer flew in from the southern wars to address the open session of the conference resource people who participated were saunders redding hampton professor then serving as writerinresidence at duke university abctv newsman mai goode editor john mccormally of the hutchinson kansas news and negro digest editor hoyt w fuller it was a literary luncheon for bert and katya gilden the coauthors of that huge bestseller hurry sundown that we met roy newquist book editor of chicagos american only the day before we had sent mr newquist tearsheets of our review of his book counterpoint april counterpoint is a big book also a collection of some interviews of writers rangingas we noted in the reviewfrom irwin shaw to basil rathbone we found it impossible to resist asking mr newquist how he had managed in collecting interviews of writers to bypass all the negro writers in the world seeing as how he had traveled some miles to interview the writers the question of course threw mr newquist off his poise especially since it was asked in the presence of all those literary people and he turned appropriately ruddy and fumbled with words his first coherent response was that many of the writers in his book had mentioned negroes and the negro problem and we said well of course how could they avoid doing so since negroes and the problem constitute the most pressing concern in the country today we repeated how did you manage to ignore negro writers mr newquist recovered adequately enough to explain that he had indeed interviewed james baldwin but that mr baldwin didnt come off so well we smiled indulgently at that knowing james baldwin as we do and then having met mr newquist we had our own ideas as to who didnt come off so well in that interview mr newquist had no answer as to how he had missed all the negro writers in organizing his book and then when we learned that mr newquist was flying off presently to russia a dark suspicion arose in our mind why we asked was he going to russia well the good mr newquist blushed again and gave weight to our suspicions he was going behind the iron curtain to interview writers however he hastened to explain that his next book counterpoint ii would contain interviews of negro writers bully we told mr newquist it was very white of him we thought perhaps this threeday session was a natural outgrowth of last augusts fiveday talkfest out on the monterey peninsula under the auspices of the university of california at berkeley that beseiged institution on the bay indeed the april conference had many things the california conference lacked including james baldwin it also had all of new york city outside the new school auditorium a less cozy atmosphere and some extremely rude people masquerading as militants the new school auditorium as it turned out wasnt big enough to accommodate all the people willing to pay to hear the speakers sermonize argue harangue and occasionally enlighten and delight the star of the conference might well have been richard gilman drama critic for newsweek magazine who in effect told negro playwrights they were incapable of creating art incredibly only le roi jones even bothered to respond to him on this particular point and playwright jones who has all but ceased trying to communicate with white people mostly shrugged mr gilman away mr gilmans precise words are unavailable but their essence was this the creation of a mature artistic play demands a playwright who is free to consider the nature of being for it is in such exploration that good plays emerge negro playwrights are engaged in seeking to establish their being therefore until negro playwrights reach the point where they have no need to establish their being rather than to explore its nature they cannot create good plays consensus among many at the conference was that the ladies provided the most moving panel discussion the everlovely abbey lincoln was a joy playwright alice childress always on track rode to the heart of the matter and poet sarah wright was profound but it was paule marshall the able novelistshort story writer who most stirred the audience hers was a complex lucid presentation that put the negro woman in american literature in ripe perspective sterling brown too long submerged in the clouds of academia illustrated the kind of wit and erudition howard university english students have been exposed to all these years the crowds that roared to his sallies never missed the point at one session mr brown read a passage from robert penn warren of years ago that would put that southern poetnovelist to shame today mr warren has just published a book on negroes not merely getting into the act but even upstaging the actors a poet and folklorist of no mean accomplishments mr brown enlivened the panel on image of the afroamerican in literature how does one describe calvin hernton no not physically thats easy enough he is tall slender even angular betterlooking than he knows with eyes perenially hidden behind dark glassesbut the way he comes on that boy shook up the conference arriving extremely late for the panel on poetry and polemics he led off his assault with a quite original explanation for the souths predicament in language which was to say the very least earthy this is a family magazine so mr hernton might forgive our presuming to paraphrase him he strongly suggested that the southerners lack of access to satisfying sex was the source of all his maladjustments well now mr baldwin delivered the keynote address on the negro writers vision for america which was the theme of the conference for those who have heard mr baldwin on other occasions and have read his work there was nothing startlingly new from himwhich is no criticism what he has to say cannot be repeated and emphasized too often although the white publicas actorplaywright douglas turner observed seems to be deaf the white public however is not alone in seeming to be deaf as black questioners from the floor found it expedient to demonstrate there was the inevitable young man who found that he had no ties with africans other than a sameness of color and there was the prim young lady who wondered why mr baldwin particularly dwelt on the less noble characters out of the ghetto sylvester leaks a writer who breathes fire told the young man he had been brainwashed and directed him to the schomburg collection in the harlem branch library and mr baldwin assured the young lady that though he patterned his writing on whores junkies and jazz musicians he too was reared by one of those longsuffering negro maids perhaps the conferences most exotic panelist was a colored lady named myrna baines who works for yes this is correct the national review she called james baldwin an extremely talented literary prostitute but not alas to mr baldwins face miss baines proved a provocative antidote to the noisy delegates from peking john o killens sparkplug of the conference told his audience that the black american is the white americans hope black writers must save america if it is to be saved he said james baldwin said that the liberation of this country depends on whether or not we are able to make a real confrontation with our history the authors critics poets historians and professors paraded before the capacityplus audiences their

and one which might set the precedent for something betterif not bigger next time around cillens promises another conference this is the fourth of a series of national educational television programs on african writers which have been transcribed and published in negro digest the first the black writer in exile appeared in the december issue the second black writers white readers appeared in the march issue the third the literary impact of negritude appeared in the may issue in this instalment host lewis nkosi of south africa is joined by the nigerian playwright wole soyinka in putting questions to ghanas william abraham associate professor of philosophy at the university of ghana and author of the book the mind of a frica mr nkosi is an author journalist and broadcaster mr soyinka is a lecturer in english at the university of ife in nigeria the interview was taped in ghana bll rogers and aaron craig were rising writers each had published two novels a collection of essays and an occasional article each was considered a serious artist concerned with the fate of mankind they often expressed this concern on lively television programs where they discussed race problems rogers was black and craig was white once they accepted invitations to speak at a seminar at goatwater college in iowa the theme of the seminar was is there a difference between the negro and the white writer by coincidence each decided to drive to iowa bill from new york and aaron from san francisco aarons trip was uneventful he drove leisurely to vegas where he lost at roulette and picked up a girl the next day he pushed on to denver and the day after to omaha stopping at good motels and restaurants along the way he arrived at goatwater college greatly refreshed bursting with liberal goodwill looking forward to meet ing his pal bill whom he hadnt seen since the march on washington bills trouble started before he left new york state at fishkill he stopped at a diner and asked for a hamburger the waitress told him she didnt serve niggers he laughed suavely and said he didnt want any niggers just a hamburger but she didnt have any sense of humor her cold blue eyes stared at him with such unrelenting hatred that he shrugged and left after two similar experiences he was a desperately hungry man and drove as fast as the hertz car would take him to cleveland where he ate enough for three men and packed in enough sandwiches to last him until he reached iowa on the highway again he became sleepy and began to look for a nice motel for the night but whenever bill asked for a room it seemed there werent any vacancies no matter what the neon signs outside proclaimed finally bill pulled off the highway and fell into an exhausted sleep only to be awakened a few minutes later by a state trooper whatchu doin here boy bill rogers whose books had been translated into eight languages including japanese who had appeared on cbstv and nbctv countless times protested that he was no damn boy but a man so the cop beat him on various parts of his head and took him to jail where after two days he was found guilty of assaulting an officer of the law and fined finally bruised and battered he arrived at goatwater college just as the seminar was about to begin after a long flattering introduction he hobbled painfully to the microphone is there a difference between the black writer and the white writer youre goddamned right there is that was the last time bill was invited to goatwater college naturally all writn v ers attempting to crei ate works of art have s problems in common whether they live in saskatchewan uzbek or hattiesburg mississippi but having affirmed this i must insist that the black writer lives in an entirely different world from his white counterpart and therefore their works are bound to reflect different realities it would be foolish to say that one writes better than the otherthats a matter of individual talentbut it does seem to me that the black writer has the advantage as far as material is concerned for his is the one story that has never been told his is the story which in every form tragedy farce comedy epic etc cries out to be heard the black writer however hard he may try cannot escape the unique experience of his people which has no parallel in modern history for years a continent was depopulated to furnish the labour supply for another continent which has become the richest in the world those were years of hell out of which a great literature ought to be produced the task of the black writer is to illuminate as fully as possible all the tragedy and pathos all the humor vigor and excitement which those centuries of oppression have generated he must avoid the stereotyped formula and never subscribe to dogma but he must care very much about his worknever mind what anyone else thinks never mind what the current fashion may be he above all must care so deeply that nothing can persuade him to cheapen his work this is what is meant by integrity and commitment those writers who dont care enough those who are not committed seldom finish anything worthwhile simply because they dont know where they stand finally and most important the black writer must be aware of the fact that a fierce revolution is raging in the world today nearly everywhere the little guy is trying to get the man off his back it is class against class slave against master nationalist against imperialist in the united states it is a racial war where the confines of a humans life from cradle to grave are determined by whether his ancestors came from europe or africa it has been possible for thousands of white writers to ignore this central fact of american life to the black writer it is an inescapable matter of life or death but it also offers him his richest material james washburn stepped out of his little house of brown wood among the other little houses of brown wood and he walked down the sidewalk into another world he shuffled over the cracked and crumbling concrete and stood on the sewer cover to wait for the bus that would take him to work and into another world people moved around him passing from one world into another and as they passed through his world many would nod and say a word and he responded in kind and then they would be gone into another world with james left in his awaiting the bus and a passerby for the worlds are overlaid on this planet like a stack of photograph negatives separate but parts of the whole and difficult to identify like holding more than one negative up to light and being unable to determine how much of the picture is in the first negative and how much belongs to the one immediately behind the people unaware that they were changing worlds would speak to james and he would respond with the youthful enthusiasm possessed by many of the elderly which was his most remarkable trait the bus came and he boarded it dropping his cents into the glass box where the handle turned beside the driver and made a cling cling cling sound like a cash register and then he walked haltingly down the aisle while the bus pulled away from the curb with its engine straining and james took a seat at the back as was his custom in his hand he clutched the brown paper sack from the brown wooden house and in it was his lunch two sandwiches an apple a piece of chewing gum the bus trundled on and somewhere along the line he left it with a blue piece of paper that was a transfer and he boarded another bus showing the paper that vouched for his fare and he rode to work watching the buildings go by the back of the bus he left the second bus and shuffled over the neat wide squares of concrete to the building of white granite and he pushed open the large glass door rimmed with aluminum and he shuffled down the marble tile floor of the hall morning james the voice said morning mistah harris james replied lovely day yassuh what do you say we skip out and go fishing harris laughed cant do that keep up the record harris approved james had not missed a day of work in years but he had not parried the offer to keep up the record it had been to remain content in the worlds of overlaid negatives where all things are black or white and the voice had been white and it would have required sustaining two worlds at once which could not be done he shuffled on down the hall and the other voices acknowledged his passing and he replied with exuberant yassuhs like the machine going cling cling cling but it was yassuh it was never nawsuh james washburn was a good nigger it was not a matter of knowing his place and wanting no trouble because he had avoided an awareness of the issues it was that he expected little and was satisfied there was a tale that james had been with the company longer than anyone but the boss whothe tale wenthad won james in a poker game often he served at parties given by the boss and other executives not only for extra money but as a favor to his company friends james shuffled to the end of the hall and turned into the room where the sign on the door had said maintenance cleotis haynes big and stupid and turner phillips young and cynical awaited him they were aides to the maintenance chief james washburn the ride to the building had been made in the morning sunblaze that is early summer and the twoblock walk and the dampness not yet baked out of the atmosphere made the air of the maintenance room steamy and sticky and james began to sweat beneath the veil of perspiration he was alternately hot and cold and he pulled a large handkerchief from his pocket and wiped it against his face hot enough for you boys he asked sho nuff cleotis said shwhew james said stuffing the sack into a locker wonder when theyll aircondition this place he had not put forth the words as a question but simply as a statement a few words thrown out in gesture to stir the air around and make the room more bearable to indicate the hope that a god unseen might bring the pleasures of modernity even to a maintenance room but turner had supplied an answer when they hire white janitors the sudden silent conflict created nervous static in the humid air james turned and saw the open door of the maintenance elevator and soas he always did first thing in the morninghe stepped into the elevator and rode to the second floor seeking a cup of coffee in the cafeteria a breath of cool air and the uncalamitous peace of a world his own james sipped the coffee and pondered what had been said minutes before but it was a passing recollection which slid away when the coffee warmed his belly he was one of the company men in the cafeteria for a morning cup of coffee in his own world in the kitchen with the younger men of higher rank in the dining room each in their separate worlds abutting architecturally then he stood and the worlds began to slide apart and he made his way down the hall again into the unmarked room separate from the hall and the other rooms and he stepped into the elevator and pushed the button as he descended he considered turner phillips james did not like what he saw and he sensed upheaval confusion and disregard for the status quo and the wonderful abutment of worlds turner and ceotis waited in the maintenance room the privilege of the morning cup of coffee in the company cafeteria necessarily denied to them not by james but by the great overlaid system of worlds where all things are black and white but the white worlds allow the good nigger to come close though he cannot enter and he can linger there on the fringe of the white world like a hapless soul standing and staring before the show window at the fine goods beyond it the rebel rejects his world as unsane and treads between worlds without his own forever in the outskirts of the system the white world reflects the man who lives in it the rebels world is rejected and it is the good nigger who reflects his worldrather than his world reflecting him cleotis james said bring the ladder lets check the lights turner go to the basement and bring up some bulbs the long kind cleotis gathered up the ladder clumsily and james led him from the room turner rode the elevator into the cool dark depths of the basement where supplies were stored and there his tension eased for he was alone where the darkness demanded no action and the coolness no penance turner languished in the peace and solitude a world temporarily his own inviolable but there remained in him the emptiness that is fear the hollowness of frailty and the fear was cold and clung like a ball of ice in his inner being for today was the day all the tomorrows were held in abeyance of the action prepared by all the yesterdays and the action would be today turner probed in the darkness and found the light switch flipped it gathered up the fluorescent bulbs turned out the light and resumed his duties at midmorning when the chores had been accomplished for the hour turner in the unobligated minutes asked james did you ever think that maybe you could be president of the company it was a question that surprised james although it had been coming since early in the morning when turner had said that the maintenance department might be physically better if white janitors were employed james turned it in his mind for it had been thoughtfully offered and then he said never seriously would you like to have been turner asked theres no way to say james said turning away but you never had a chance did you aint you full of questions not a chance in the world turner said maybe not a chance in the world the words hung in the heavy air like a requiem a cannon heard from afar the last clear word uttered at graveside the word that goes with you always and even when it is lost in the confusion of the conscious the feeling of it still is there fresh and strong maybe youll be president james chuckled i want the chance turner said james turned further away and took a step i want a chance james i cant do nothing for you boy you can help me turner said theres nothing i can do i just work here i dont own it you can help me turner argued james touched the elevator door you know what the ceo is turner said the committee for equal opportunity they send you here james demanded i told them to leave me alone theyre working for all of us turner said they need help they cant do anything if we dont help them trouble makers james said angrily i want no part of them we got to help turner said we need you james we need everybody people will listen if we stand together you one of them why didnt you tell me before now theyre educated men turner said its all been thought out its the only sensible way we just want whats right whats right whats right james exploded how you know whats right youre just a pup you dont know nothing all that booking and studies dont tell you whats right help us get away from me youre making trouble i dont want no part of it why wont you help us turner demanded because you like washing toilets you like sweeping floors youre too scared youd rather turn your own kind in and get patted on the head and sent back to the maintenance room youre too scared i got no quarrel with nobody no reason to be afraid how much will you get a twenty cent raise get out for the last time get out youre scared turner said scornfully too scared to save yourself you wont ever be free to sit where you want to or eat where you want to because thats where the white man is i dont want to eat with the white man youll never have the chance i dont want it im black im not ashamed of it i am what i am and nothings wrong with that turner whirled from the conflict hurrying to the door and as he grasped the knob he turned back with muscles stretching angrily over his high cheekbones and his mind uncoiled the word and he spat it out through clenched teeth and with disgust nigger and he was gone james sank down on the bench overcome with the violence of the argument turner plunged out of the building and onto the large neat squares of concrete under the white sky of midmorning in early summer the air was now warm and dry and everywhere was the sunglare the heat the straight silver light and his subsiding anger left him breathing deeply and perspiring under the sun and his mind snatched up flashes of the conflict and he wondered why did james refuse but james had no motive conviction bound him and it was earnest serious sincere he felt uncausably insulted when turner challenged his reasons immutabilities do not stand on reasons the lines of thought and knowledge that crisscrossed his brain were the etchings of tradition and his mind could not suddenly transform itself into a new and fresh organism vital in its origin and undestined by habit he had not fathomed the truth of his defense it had been instinct tradition speaking for itself when he had exploded and shouted turner down i am what i am and nothing wrong with that but out in the street in the hard dry heat turner stood before a show window staring at the fine goods beyond and decided that today was still the day in the building the noon hour came and employees poured into the halls with the elevator shuttling them to the second floor where the cafeteria smelled of steaming food and there was the noise of plates utensils talk the scraping and scooting of chairs on the floor and the sound of laughter there was turner phillips standing in the doorway with a sign this company cafeteria unfair to employees behind him were other signbearers out of their worlds treading between worlds about to launch a drive to enter this new world turner sensed a retaliatory mood like bees about to swarm an alien or ants deploying to drive out an invader but he entered carrying the sign awkwardly and the others followed him taking seats the press had been dutifully notified cameras whirred and popped in the sudden stillness recording the oversystem of worlds in another moment the boss appeared in the doorway a big man with a leathery face from which business success had not erased the look of country toughness his glare was chilling stern firm he moved out of the doorway and out of sight again james protested mightily that he knew nothing of the sitin and his mind boiled furiously over what had transpired in the room little more than an hour ago you worked for me a long time nigger but i wont put up with this the boss warned he stormed out of the maintenance room for the heat intensified his anger and he returned to the cafeteria where all was quiet again he surveyed the room and asked whos in charge i am turner said standing you work for me the boss said i might have known a flashbulb popped hows the restaurant unfair colored workers cant eat here turner said well the boss said breathing slowly theres two ways we can solve that problem no three ways we can close it up is that what you want no sir well then we can get along without colored workers is that what youd like no sir yes sir the boss fingered his thick chin a moment with a rough hand and he stared at turner and he measured the situation suppose we try it today and maybe we can work something out we appreciate that turner said but what we want is the right to eat here anytime like everybody else not just today what if we throw you out i guess youll just come back turner did not answer you better have money the boss said turner took a tray leaning his sign against the wall and he took a plate and utensils and went along the rail to where the food was displayed and the cameras were whirring again ham please he said the girl behind the glass looked beyond him to the boss ham please turner repeated and the word floated into the stillness but she looked at the boss well damn it girl what did i hire you for its okay she said meekly i guess so the boss said what about the others turner asked them too the boss said and headed for the doorway the silence broke into quiet talk and released breath and turner relished the slap of the meat on the plate james washburn opened the brown paper sack and reached inside for the sandwiches he had made in the morning the air was oppressive his hunger faded the boss rode down on the elevator reconsidering his decision which he had not enjoyed making he had not given it serious thought but he had known that it had to come there would be a reaction and some discontent of course but he wouldnt plan for that either sometimes spot judgments were the best he made he paused by the door to the maintenance room thinking maybe he should apologize to old james no he would understand james was not like this new breed james would understand he was a good nigger i am the white mother of a negro child this fact has brought me some problems and some heartaches but it has also brought me many joys my problems began before my daughter was born when a member of my immediate family found that i was pregnant she strongly urged me to obtain an abortion when i would not even consider it i was then advised to give the baby to its father to raise since we were separated this i refused to consider also i loved my baby even before she was born just like any mother then too i believe that while every child should have two parents to love and care for him if that is impossible a child feels more secure with the mother if she is at all conscientious no matter the difference in color i have no desire to make life easier for myself at the expense of my child since i insisted on bearing my child and rearing her i was the recipient of one more bit of advice from this same family member tell everyone that she is adopted when she is eight or so you can tell her the truth and tell her to let it be your secret people will think more of you that way this last gem of wisdom i absolutely refused to follow i am proud of my daughter not ashamed of her i see no reason to keep her a secret i want the whole world to know that she is my child whether people think less of me nr or more of me is not important only my childs happiness should be of concern by the age of eight the formative years are largely passed to lead her to believe that she is adopted and then for her to discover that her own mother lied to her to hide their true relationship could do her irreparable emotional damage since much of our true happiness in life depends on our own estimate of our worth to hide her identity would lead her to believe that there is something disgraceful about being a negro this belief set me on a road of thought which led me to a philosophy by which i hoped to raise my daughter since she is at the age of eight a happy well adjusted child in love with life perhaps the tenets by which i have raised her have some value firstly i have from the beginning not hidden from her the fact that there is prejudice in the world living in an allwhite neighborhood where she is the most popular child in the block and with the only relatives that she knows white her fathers relatives live in france it would be easy to hide this fact of life from her for the time being however since i cannot protect her forever i believe if she is prepared in advance for what she will probably have to face some day she will be better armored to meet it more importantly i want her to learn early that there are constructive ways to battle prejudice her first test of how well she is prepared to meet this contingency came in her seventh year one of the local swimming pools sought to bar my daughter on racial grounds we quickly solved that problem nonviolently by appealing to one of the race relation groups in our city the favorable outcome of this problem in prejudice gave me the opportunity to demonstrate to my child in a practical way the value of fighting back in a constructive manner if she learns this valuable lesson future experiences of this nature can not crush her spirit but can only serve to strengthen her awareness of her true worth as a human being above all i hope that she never becomes steeped in deep personal vindictiveness against persons with whom she comes in contact who personify racial prejudice that type of hate is selfdestructive it can destroy the one who hates as a reasoning human being and leave untouched the hated i have also sought to instill in my daughter a sense of solidarity of identification with the negro race two of the most bitterly unhappy people i know are women who with a background similar to my childs have sought to deny their race i believe that she will gain far greater happiness by being proud of her heritage by loving instead of hating the race with which she is identified by the people with whom she comes in contact but most of all when she is mature i think that she will know great happiness if she seeks the advancement of this race rather than trying to run away from a priceless heritage if she can achieve this sense of identification she may never experience a sense of being lost between two worlds forever a stranger to both secondly i have sought to instill selfconfidence in this little being for if she believes in herself if she realizes that she is a worthwhile person no one can make her feel inferior to this end i have put a great deal of emphasis on education we do a great deal of talking about the desirability of good grades scholarship and college i have also encouraged any natural talent that she might have artistically a deep appreciation of the creative process can give an individual a strength of spirit and mind which can help to weather many an emotional storm lastly i have sought to instill in my daughter an appreciation of the cultural things of life she has been to the theatre to art galleries museums heard music and read good literature whenever possible i have called her attention to the glories of natureto the vast peace of a starry sky to the moon in all of its phases to the soulfilling awe of a sunset i want her to realize that although there is ugliness and hate in the world there is also great beauty and this alone makes life worth living if the magnitude of a problem is to be measured in terms of the contradictions and paradoxes it embraces then the silent explosion by philip appleman beacon press makes a very strong case for the uncontrolled growth of the worlds population as the most critical problem facing the world the simple fact is that too many people are being born too fast another way of stating the problem is that in more than half of the countries of the world the birth rate is higher than the food production rate the results are too apparent hunger is the rule around the world and filling the void in the stomach with food is more pressing to the masses of the world than filling their heads with political theories and philosophies there are many who recognize the threat of the population explosion and the dangers it carries with it the central point at issue is what to do about the problem the obvious answer is to reduce the birth rate contraceptives come immediately to mind and with it comes one of the strange paradoxes of the problem it seems that the two major forces against some sort of universal birth control device are the catholic church and communism each has its own reason for opposing contraception the catholic church bases its opposition to a great extent on the morality issue but dr appleman very convincingly refutes the grounds for such an argument his feeling is that overpopulation brings about overcrowded and congested conditions which naturally breed conditions directly related to immorality the communists base their opposition to contraception as being an imperialist capitalist doctrine but many of the very top officials in russia quietly practice birth control to further explore the contradictions it would be well to note that poland both a catholic and communist country has officially accepted contraception as a valid means for coping with her population problems dr appleman is very skillful and effective in his utilization of irony paradox and contradiction to bring a point home for example he points out that it is the colored nations of the world precursors of the modern wellfed civilizations that now are the most hardpressed in the claws of hunger he further demonstrates that good deeds alone are not the answer for instance the fact that certain fatal diseases have been substantially controlled in some countries by american aid merely adds to the problem because we now have more mouths to feed than before in countries that couldnt feed their people in the first place the questions ultimately revolve around catholicism communism contraception contradiction and colored peoples until this riddle of alliteration can effectively be solved we cannot possibly hope for world peace how long can we expect twothirds of the world to go to bed hungry each night when the remaining onethird consumes twothirds of the food of the world how long can we expect empty bellies to blithely overlook the fact that americans consume per cent more food than they need to survive is it rational to think that people will love us when they know that we store more food in a year just to keep farm prices up than they produce for their starving people is it intelligent to expect people to believe us when we say were their friends and spend billions to explore the barrenness of the moon with virtually nothing for the scientific prevention of overpopulation and starvation dr applemans book offers a very strong and penetrating analysis of the problem its readable enlightening and frightening its a must for anyone interested in the world situation humanity or the horrible facts of life in many parts of the worldbrooks johnson national home visit day is gaining ground across the country and there is reason to expect that soon like brotherhood week it will be a national institution last year we understand there were some cities in states and washington dc with home visit day exchanges for the benefit of those readers not yet initiated as to the meaning of this program here is a brief resume under the auspices of local groups interested in interracial goodwill visits are arranged among a selected number of whites and negroes over tea and coffee these people sit in the living rooms of their hosts and make an effort to overcome the tensions and strains which so many americans bring to even minimal contacts with people of races different from their own the aim is to discuss problems of race which existor might arisein their communities to speak openly and honestly and make an effort to come to an understanding in human terms when one thinks of it it is plainly astonishing how few negroes and whites have had this experience it is extremely rare in this country where the two races have lived together for nearly years to find negroes and whites who visit each others homes as friends and neighbors and only that that is what national home visit day is all about and who can argue with itwell we didnt want to argue with it in truth we were perfectly willing simply to leave it alone after all these years out here on the battle lines the inclination is to be a little cynical about all these advertised gestures at friendship and goodwill we dont go around knocking them but we dont give them much encouragement either were inclined to think that the best way for people to get along is to leave each other alone dont erect any barriers and dont do any forcing thats the way people of the same color get along and thats the way people of varying colors can get along as we said we were willing to leave national home visit day alone and then an old and good friend phoned she and another lady were driving up to the north shore to visit in a home there and wouldnt i come along no pretty please no and then she put it another way the year before the negro groups had been embarrassed because there were so few negro men taking part this year only one or two men had volunteered only negro women seemed to be carrying the ball well this is a dilemma older than national home visit day and we were moved we steadfastly refuse to add to the burdens on the backs of negro women we went the north shore suburb that we visited is one of the most exclusive among that string of restricted municipalities and we were surprised to find the home of our hostess so humble humble that is by comparison with most of the other abodes in the community the house originally a onefamily structure we surmised hadlike topsyjust growed with the owner a partiallydeaf but marvellous little lady occupying the top floor of what now was a twofamily flat the humbleness of the home was deceptive on another point as well the owner a maiden lady bore the name of one of the richest and most illustrious of americas mercantile families we were the first negroes to arrive and we were ushered into the salon where three ladies of progressive middle years and one gentleman waited they were all quite sweet as we had expected they would be and the conversation daintily touched on the weather the drive from chicago and the welcome spring as we knew it would the civility and goodwill were all but paralyzing we were tempted several times to abandon breeding and to plunge brutally to the heart of the matter with some statement on the ridiculousness of the occasion but we refrained sadism alas is beyond us and then the other guests began arriving my friend and her entouragea group of negro ladies ranging in age from about to very mature credited their lateness to mistaken directions and perhaps they were indeed blameless the new white guests included a couple from texas the lady one of a type to whom subtlety ordinarily seems alien but who managed to appear subdued through the early part of the afternoon the rest of the white guests were all local residents some of them we learned quite prominent in the civic and business life of chicago as well as of the suburb settled over tea and coffee and assorted sandwiches and cakes the dialogue began and abruptly our attitude changed the suburbanites drew out newspapers and petitions and related documents and described their quiet campaign to persuade their neighbors to open the community to negroes through advertisements in the local paper endorsed by dozens of their friends and acquaintances and sympathizers they had sought to illustrate that more than morality and charity were involved in welcoming negroes to live among them in the world of today and tomorrow they had argued it is imperative that people of all races and creeds learn to accept each other these people had gone from door to door broached the subject at parties and at their clubs risked alienating friends of long standing by daring to suggest that negroes be invited into the suburb they had put gentle pressure on real estate agents extracting promises that these usually solid partisans of negro exclusion would consider negro home shoppers as they considered any others the result had been astonishingly favorable for them and for us it was all but unbelievable we sat next to a thin whitehaired lady a grandmother many times over who was interested in the theater as we are and there was much to discuss she mentioned her own children of whom she was very proud and remarked that her grandchildren were being properly brought up my children grew up understanding the evil of any kind of hatred and they are passing this understanding on to their children she said they will at least get a fair start toward being equipped to live in the world we had announced upon arrival that we had to leave early and when the time came we reluctantly departed later we talked with the friend who had asked us to participate in the national home visit day ceremonies and she thanked us for our presence we had been as she expected the only negro male in the group and the negro ladies had been most grateful that there was at least one but we told her that it was we who owed her a debt of gratitude she had allowed us to discover the sincerity and courage of some white suburbanitesand she had enabled us to glimpse the image of our own embarrassing prejudice it is more than a hunw dred years since abra kji ham lincoln charqed themselves to the unfinished work of the dead at gettysburg even lincoln with his deep sense of mans imperfections could not know that a century later we would still be striving to abolish injustice no task is more deeply rooted in the complexities of american life poverty and tradition fear and ignorance the structure of our society and the workings of our economy all converge on this enormous wrong which has troubled the american conscience from the beginning its just solution is essential not only to give the full blessings of freedom to negroes but to liberate all of us there are those who say it has taken us a century to move this far it will take another hundred years to finish the job i do not agree great social change tends to come rapidly in periods of intense activity and progress before the impulse slows i believe we are in the midst of such a period of change it is our task to carry forward nothing less than the full assimilation of more than negroes into american life this is not to be assimilation of bland conformity our object is not to make all people alike it is as it has always been to allow ready access to every blessing of liberty while permitting each to keep his sense of identity with a culture and tradition in this way we enlarge our freedom and enrich our nation we have just passed a milestone in this task the civil_rights bill of extends the protection of law to many of the demands of justice this bill of course is not the whole answer but i ask each of you to think what an enormous setback failure to pass it would have been now your government must and will move rapidly to carry out that legislation we also intend to give new vigor to our many activities in the field of equal opportunity the congress in the civil_rights act established the principle that race or color can be no criteria for participation in federal programs last week i approved the first set of regulations to implement that principle those regulations are designed to provide just and prompt and reasoned resolution of all disputes our first objective will always be to assure nondiscriminatory operation rather than to put an end to programs which are vital to the welfare of all americans the widespread voluntary support in all parts of the country of the public accommodation title is proof of the educational value of law and the great reservoir of goodwill among americans i believe this section too will find wide acceptance it is simple justice that all should share in programs financed by all and directed by the government of all the people within your government there are many programs dedicated to the goal of equal opportunity they range from the civil_rights division of the justice department the civil_rights commission and the presidents committee on equal opportunity in housing to the community relations service the presidents committee on equal opportunity in employment and the soontobecreated equal employment opportunity commission each of these groups has a distinct and important mission those now in existence have done a difficult task in an impressive way but they all share the same general objective and they must pursue that objective through cooperation among themselves and with private groups with so many groups in a single field there is always the danger of duplication overlap or unnecessary delay therefore i am delighted to announce that i have asked vice presidentelect hubert humphrey and he has agreedto take responsibility for working with all these groups assisting in coordination of their efforts and guiding them toward energetic pursuit of equal opportunity for all these are some of the steps we are taking there will be more for as the problem of civil_rights has grown in urgency it has also grown in complexity we must open the doors of opportunity but we must also equip our people to walk through those doors thus programs to eliminate poverty to improve education and to provide housing by enlarging the opportunities of all americans assure new opportunities for negro americans there are those who predict that the struggle for full equality in america will be marked by violence and hateand it will tear at the fabric of our society for myself i cannot claim to see so clearly into the future but i do not agree i know that radical feelings flow from many deep and resistant sources in our history in the pattern of our lives and in the nature of man but i believe there are other forcesstronger because they are armed with truthwhich will bring us toward our goal in peace they consist in the sense of morality and justice which is written in our laws and more importantly nourished in the hearts of our people these feelings carried forward by men of goodwill in every part of the land will lead this nation toward the great and necessary fulfillment of american freedom in this way our peoples will once again prove equal to the ideals and values on which this nation rests is man a gorilla with a gun extrapolation say the dictionaries is the method of finding by calculation based on the known a series other terms whether preceding or following the method is proper to mathematics and works efficiently when dealing with number and quantity when it is transferred to the realm of quality and of organic life more still to that of history and of culture it tends to lose its precisely exact scientific quality and becomes a venture in creativity or at any rate a work of fantasy imagination now takes the place of calculation there can be no doubt that the scientist who seeks to learn the origin of man from a fossilized remnant of a skull that might have belonged to a man or to a baboon must be blessed with a creative imagination as well as with a scientifically exact intelligence i suppose that when robert ardrey a playwright rather than a professional scientist sub titles his book a personal investigation into the animal origins and nature of man he is serving notice that he intends to extrapolate with unrestrained imaginative abandon at any rate this is what he does there is of course a good basis of scientific evidence in african genesis the most recent discoveries of paleontology made in africa especially the most notable those of dr l s b leakey at olduvai in tanganyika give very convincing indications that the origin of man was in africa and not in asia the olduvai gorge is a deep canyon fantastically rich in fossils and in primitive tools which has preserved a seemingly completely and continuous record of the millionyear period in which man appeared and here it must be clearly said that the conclusions of this book differ radically from those of dr leakey who is certainly the most credible authority on the subject leakey says that the tools at olduvai were the work of man in his earliest known form zinjanthropus mr ardreys thesis is that the tools are the work not of man but of an ape indeed of an inferior ape a vegetarian and pacifist ape who was not even to be the ancestor of man the real ancestor of man in ardreys thesis was an ape who made not tools but weaponsand was a killer so while admitting that l s b leakey is a great scientist mr ardrey says that on this point he has gone wrong mislead by sentimentality and romanticism the term romantic fallacy occurs everywhere in the book and is used to discredit any and every theory of man which does not admit that he is a descendant in the direct line from a killer ape and therefore it must be said that the reader who picks up this book looking for precise and coherent information about the important new discoveries in africa is himself the victim of an illusion what information there is concerns mainly the discoveries and hypotheses of certain south africans whom mr ardrey greatly admires and even this information is buried in autobiographical reminiscence picaresque anecdote and pages of philosophical improvisation on the basis of the remote possibility that there were in africa perhaps a million years ago toolandweapon using homiuids or prehuman apes mr ardrey delivers a very aggressive homily in atheistic evolutionism he attacks not only the traditional christian worldview but also much more radically the worldviews of marx freud darwin and practically everyone else you can think of one theory of man after another is tossed out the window with glorious enthusiasm as romantic fallacy and all because some ape seems to have picked up the leg bone of an antelope and used it to crack the skull of one of his fellows this is all we need in order to entirely reconstruct all social philosophy all history all anthropology all psychology all economics for mr ardrey this one monumental act of violence explains everything homo sapiens including modern man is therefore the direct legitimate descendant of a transitional carnivorous erectwalking righthanded and weaponusing anthropoid because this ape was no ordinary mildmannered vegetarian no generalized fruiteating ape but a ruthless killer ape man emerged man is according to ardrey the child not only of the ape but of the weapon it was the weapon that fathered man not only that but mr ardrey even goes so far as to hint that instead of man developing weapons for himself he was in some sense developed by biology to be a user of weapons whether man is in fact a biological invention to suit the purposes of the weapon must be a matter of future debate whatever that debate may be to suppose that instead of weapons being developed for man man was developed for weapons is carrying alienation pretty far but it is quite characteristic of mr ardreys worldview and of his south african sources the consequence follows immediately man is by his very nature an inventor and user of weapons and a defender of territory the essence of human nature is therefore not so much rationality as triggerhappiness or at least clubhappiness and territoriality even sex is set aside as a secondary relatively meaningless urge compared with mans essential drive to beat up anything and anyone that threatens to invade his territory yes territory is very important here crucially important man is not really interested in woman in love in the warmth of satisfied libido as freud may have thought man is not so deeply engaged in making a living that his very existence is shaped and dominated by the system of production according to marxian dogma man is an ape that goes berserk when he thinks he is running out of lebensraum and i must admit that mr ardreys description of two rival teams of howling monkeys trying to jam each others broadcasts is very suggestive of modern political life the chief contention of robert ardreys highpowered social message is that any philosophy religious or otherwise which takes an optimistic view of man regards him as basically rational and progressive and postulates that he can better himself by using his intelligence to improve his social system is basically a romantic illusion it is absurd says mr ardrey to hope that man can settle his differences over territory by means of arbitration rather than by bombs man is a predator whose natural instinct is to kill with a weapon it is fortunate that some members of the human race are still capable of thinking otherwise for instance pope john xxiii in his encyclical pacem in terris quite apart from religious faith and christian hope it seems to me that mr ardreys thesis negates any real hope there may be for man in evolutionism after all the theory of natural selection postulates that a species is able to survive by progressive adaptation to new and more difficult conditions we armed gorillas have now reached a rather crucial point in our evolutionary development in which killing with a weapon is about the least effective way of settling our problems and guaranteeing our survival it would seem that if we cannot get beyond the stage where we were a million years agoin other words if we cannot adapt to a new situation and settle our problems by reason instead of with clubswe are soon going to be as extinct as any dinosaur the amusing thing about all this is that we are a species that has been given the choice of survival or nonsurvival we have very large skulls and presuming there is still a proportionate content inside them it is up to us to make use of them for something besides inventing ways to blow ourselves up this is so obvious that even mr ardrey after ignoring and scouting it for over three hundred pages finally has to face it in his last chapter cains children with conclusions that we shall presently see the author of african genesis is totally and slavishly committed to a philosophy of ironbound determinism which is dominated by one inexorable obsession the killer ape armed with the legbone of an antelope because man descended in a direct line from an ape with a weapon then he is predetermined to be a killer he is before all else a killer and it is folly to even consider him being anything else at least until his lucky genes have had a few hundred thousand more years mr ardrey confesses himself to be firmly convinced of mans pristine depravity thus he is committed to a worldview in which violence barbarism murder and every form of violence are bound to prevail yet the whole picture is not all of unrelieved darknessotherwise the book would hardly have been a bestseller in america what about freedom man is predetermined to be a killer but fortunately his killing habits are the basis of his freedomfreedom from vegetarianism freedom to leave the jungle and roam around the world living on highcalory foods and having a wonderful time man is a gorilla with a gunand a credit card freedom was the first gift of the predatory way and doubtless as man exists for the weapon so does freedom the progress of the weapon is mankinds most significant cultural endowment however the idea that man is capable of destroying all life with his weapons is dismissed by mr ardrey as neoromantic it presumes too much of mans capacities while a giant effort on the part of man could conceivably bring extinction to all land vertebrates it is impossible to believe that a world of insects would not survive though a nuclear disaster is according to him very likely it cannot be more than a partial disaster as a result of which overpopulation will cease to be a problem in india and instead there will be plague and anarchy a depleted population of radiated mutants may end up being devoured by rats says our author cheerfully but even this evolution will come out on top nevertheless he has another optimistic alternative which is a surprising variant of the new red or dead realism man has indeed reached his peak he has developed the absolute weapon but now he must learn to live without it at this point we begin to wonder if mr ardrey is suddenly going to say something useful what he says is this if man has to live without war he is heading for a deep decline society and culture will disintegrate without armed conflict to keep them going moral j order sheltered throughout all history by the judgment of arms will collapse but perhaps evolution will finally develop out of our race a new breed that really has and uses reason however mr ardrey would not have us be romantics putting our trust in conscience to preserve sanity and life for conscience is irrational is in league with our illusions entirely subjective and provincial it is consequently amoral it operates with symbols and emotions not with ideas and principles it is animal not rational in fact it is essentially an antirational power it has created a chamber of dull horrors called civilization and neither conscience nor civilization can save us our only hope is the presence of cain our unpredictable ancestor living in our wild genes he will take care of everything whether it be firing the weapon or avoiding a general disaster because he prefers to fight in the back streets with a switchblade knife it is old daddy cain who alone knows the answers and makes the choices we are children of cain and were it not so then for humanity there would be small hope i am prompted to reflect that this is where you end up when you lose your grasp on the real import of the higher religion no man can really exist completely without a religion and a philosophy if he gets rid of good ones he will unconsciously exchange them for bad ones if he is impatient of myth in higher religion then he will end up fabricating a myth of his own and organizing his own crude fantasies into another homemade system which pleases him better with consequences that are only too well known now mr ardreys exploits in mythmaking are not hard to observe they are evident on every page of his book to take just one example on page he wants to give a brief description of lake victoria as the spot near which man came into existence there are innumerable ways in which one could describe lake victoria out of a hundred possible qualifiers mr ardrey characteristically selects the following a hundred miles to the east spreads sprawling and enormous the cynically smiling face of lake victoria poisonous with disease crawling with crocodiles the probable focus of our earliest human experience i submit that people who read books like this need a little elementary training in semantics in the interests of their basic mental and spiritual hygiene such a sentence ana there are hundreds like it in the book has one function above all others it attempts to predispose the readers emotions by a suitable feeling of disillusionment an awareness of the general dominion of evil and violence as the basic law of all existence once one feels this one will resist the romantic fallacy and will experience less compunction in reaching for a gun or firing an icbm this kind of thinking is all too common in the twentieth century theories which substituted genes for intelligence and conscience abounded in the europe of mussolini of hitler of goebbels the second world war was not the direct consequence of mental conditioning by pseudoscientific myth the nazi dogma of race blood and land developed an ideology of war and conquest out of just this kind of emotionally loaded anthropology everyone is aware that hitlers racism was in part simply a crudely misunderstood mishmash of popular evolutionism hitlers attempts to help the processes of natural selection with his gas chambers are mentioned in the book with no particular expression of romantic disapproval once when the quiet and distinguished spanish philosopher miguel de uramuno was lecturing at salamanca in the early thirties a falangist general leaped up and expressed his impatience with all forms of humanism by shouting viva la muerte the heroes of african genesis are the killer gorilla and daddy cain the god if we can call it that which has watched over the gorillas fortune and destiny is no other than death mr ardrey is cool toward all other gods particularly to the ones that favor nonviolence and compas sion about death he waxes lyrical death is the evaluator death choses death disposes we should all be lost in a wilderness of chance had not death through a bill on choosings erected the value of the world i know if this last sentence had a meaning and i am not able to find a meaning in it myself it would be that death is a kind of free and personal absolute and mr ardrev w turns out to be no atheist after all nothing can better dispose us for a third world war than the conviction that we are doomed to fight anyway that our enemies are all wellarmed gorillas too and the only smart thing to do is to let them have it before they ambush us in the chaotic atmosphere of a nation torn by race riots deafened by the stridency of hate groups and of fanatics it is understandable that readers may deride a kind of perverse comfort from this mythology they will do so all the more readily because there is an unquestionably important basis of scientific data mixed in with the theatrical rhetoric and sermonizing of a frican genesis romanticism has more forms than one the sentimentally optimistic kind that served the purpose of nineteenth century laissez faire and the liberal myth of perpetual easy progress has obviously had its day but it has yielded to the tough and callous romanticism of the street gang or of the fascist storm troopa romanticism no less fallacious and deceptive for the fact that it also on occasion covers itself with a veneer of realism and pseudoscience this second kind of fallacy is that which we find developed and indeed monstrously overdeveloped in african genesis it is all the more regrettable because it is rooted in an intuition one which in our day has become completely unavoidableof the desperateness of the human situation this is the greatest and most urgent truth of our time we live in the presence of the meaninglessness and absurdity to which we have been inexorably reduced by our own more or less dishonest attempts to convince ourselves that we were progressing toward a definite and even a noble goal the pessimism of the existentialists may indeed be dour and frustrated but it has at least a certain stoic dignity about it but this fraudulent attempt to organize the negativity and desperation of modern man around a stupidly melodramatic killer image assembled from the less responsible surmises of popular anthropology can do nothing whatever to help modern man in his quest for identity and for meaning it is one thing to admit our violence and face it humbly and realistically quite another to turn that acceptance into the shouting and posturing of racist selfcongratulation periodically the air staff board a group of general officers meet in the pentagon to insure that their collective judgment and experience are brought to bear upon important matters concerning the air force among this starstudded group is maj gen benjamin o davis jr air force director of manpower and organization and the only negro general officer in the u s armed forces near minot air force base n d feet below the surface of the ground a white minuteman missile crew commander places a key around the neck of captain leonard i saunders the ritual denotes that full responsibility for the alert status of the missiles becomes that of the yearold negro these experiences point out the increased responsibility given negroes in the u s air force since it became a separate service in at that time military units were segregated because the war department felt it segregation has proven satisfactory over a long period of years and to make changes would produce situations destructive to morale and detrimental to the preparation for national defense prominent negroes protested the arrangement during the s some progress had been made however general davis father now retired became the first of his race to be promoted to brigadier general judge william hastie was appointed civilian aide to the secretary of war officer candidate schools were desegregated these advances however had very little effect upon the average negro airman those who couldnt fly or were never given the opportunity to learn aircraft maintenance were restricted to construction and transportation duties or other specialized tasks his skills and even his ability were a matter of debate the largest percentage of negroes about were stationed at lockbourne field near columbus ohio they operated as a separatebutequal combat unit on july the beginning of the end of military segregation came at that time president truman as commanderinchief of the armed forces issued an executive order to promote the highest standards of democracy in the armed forces the legal effect of this was to nullify separatebutequal recruitment training and service the order according to general davis was received with mixed reactions some of the men were reluctant to being uprooted and assigned to different environments however the largest percentage of the men considered the change a challenge and were eager to correct a long injustice he said lt col george j friedline who at the time commanded a segregated unit at andrews field maryland said integration of his unit took place without incident we integrated by moving all the men out of the barracks and reassigned them to quarters by alphabet there wasnt any other fair way of doing it he said in the early s integration became a practical necessity the korean crisis brought an immediate swelling of the armed forces this plus the policy of replacing troops in korea by regular rotation gradually eliminated segregation for the first time the negro was permitted to fight as an integrated member of a unit yet even with this impetus integration took almost six years to accomplish in the office of the assistant secretary of defense reported that full integration of negro personnel contributed to improved utilization of personnel overconcentration of negroes in certain specialties and shortages in others tended to disappear as full advantages were taken of the equal ity of opportunity to attend service schools and to advance on the basis of experience and ability the change wasnt as smooth as the defense department indicated it had been however it meant that identification of race had to be eliminated from certain service records and assignment orders it meant that a negro first sergeant could order a mississippian to perform kp kitchen police duty or other unpleasant duties if need be above all it meant restraint on the part of the colored airman who was assigned to a unit and found that the top bunk near the latrine was left vacant for him or that after attending preparatory school for personnel duties he was assigned to a base as disposal officer because he just wouldnt fit in with the rest of the staff for all the challenge was great but the negro airman made progress senior master sergeant grant s williams sr a sergeant major at selfridge air force base mich said attitude played an important part in the change i never carried a chip on my shoulder said sergeant williams i maintained restraint and later won the cooperation of suspicious whites who had never worked for or with a negro general davis recalls that unlike lieutenant frederick d gregory a recent graduate of the air force academy he lived alone during his fouryear attendance at west point from the other students all white lived in twoman rooms yet he was the first of his race to graduate from the school in years gregory was one of several negroes to earn a commission from the academy in its brief nineyear history after integration the general went on to command units in korea and formosa and to hold management positions with the far east air forces and u s air forces in europe today as the air forces director of manpower and organization he is responsible for all matters pertaining to manpower organization and management engineering a position comparable to a corporate vice president he directs a pentagon staff of military and civilian personnel they must justify to the department of defense bureau of budget and the congress the six billion dollar manpower requirement of the air force the general describes his job as important interesting and unglamourous one order for a reduction in personnel and i become the most unpopular man in the world he said awesome could well describe captain saunders assignment as a missile combat crew commander for around his neck in a minuteman missile silo near minot air force base hangs one of the keys that would destroy enemy targets in the event of a nuclear attack on this nation the captain is one of a handful of highly trained and skilled negroes working in one of the most selective jobs in the air force surrounded by a maze of colored lights cables and switches saunders indicated an awareness of his responsibilities by explaining that the missiles can be launched only on orders from the president of the united states by turning two keys once the order has been authenticated i cant launch without my deputy meaning capt ross w randolph also colored these keys he said pointing to the objects hanging from their necks must be turned simultaneously by both of us neither man accepted the quip that they may well be the first to send minuteman missiles soaring toward their targets if a nuclear war should break out it is highly unlikely that such responsibility would have been bestowed upon saunders and randolph prior to true negroes dropped bombs on enemy targets and strafed enemy territory during world war ii and were recommended for more than distinguished flying crosses but to have the authority to unleash tons of tnt takes stability and maturity these ingredients it was then believed were rare in the negro today the negro airman has been conceded the right to be qualified for a delicate assignment and be depended upon to carry it out note these examples during the cuban crisis capt thomas l hennagan flew reconnaissance missions over cuba in the mileanhour rf jet aircraft for exemplary courage and professional competence under hazardous flight conditions he was awarded the distinguished flying cross the nations second highest decoration for combat capt joseph s grant jr was one of the first negroes to be selected to train vietnamese air force pilots in combat support activities a test pilot capt edward j dwight is currently serving as an experimental flight test officer at wrightpatterson afb ohio he performs flight test evaluation on new improvements in design and instrumentation of bomber aircraft applicable to both military and civilian aircraft while men like grant dwight and hernagan are making history others of their race are making unheralded progress at changing the air force image of the negro at the grass roots level at an air base in georgia lieutenant walter a collins and technical sergeant bennie sparks supervise integrated staffs of military and civilians capt annie l lawrence is a personable general duty nurse at andrews afb md she cares for some patients including wives and dependents of military personnel and diplomats at mather afb calif maj haldane king a member of the first class of negro bomber pilots accounts for and budgets millions of dollars necessary for the operation of the base col william a campbell now branch chief aerospace forces division at air force headquarters has served in a quasidiplomatic post in turkey he was an advisor with the joint u s military assistance training team in ankara these men and women and thousands like them justified president trumans annulment of the separatebutequal policy which applied until the military once said that it was not a sociological laboratory true it was not and should not be but it has done much to provide a means of communication and education between the races when a negro officer or sergeant tells a middleaged white southerner assigned to his office to perform a task and it is accomplished in an attitude of cooperation this is a significant social achievement more often than not the mere performance of an assigned responsibility can at least temporarily lower racial barriers in some communities as in the case of capt keaver holley iii in brownfield texas holley braving intense heat and high winds for over half an hour piloted a helicopter which rescued an injured worker from a foot grain elevator shaft to show their appreciation for his heroism the city held a dinner in his honor holley and his wife set a precedent by being seated at the head table with civic leaders at the affair in a community which practiced strict segregation and so it has been with the negro airman so dedicated to democracy so deeply committed to justice and freedom he has had conflicts and through it all maintained restraint there have been significant breakthroughs and the negro has achieved the beginnings of equality in the air force while freedomseeking organizations struggle for civil_rights in labor education public accommodations voting numerous other areas while the press radio and television give dazzling coverage of throngs of negroes and whites demonstrating for the cause of human dignity one might easily deduce that the negro population because the goals sought are primarily for its benefit is completely activated this is not true to be sure one of the most lamentable facts to be dealt with in the movement for civil_rights is that of apathy in large sectors of the negro population the slothful attitude of persons who seem contented with things just as they are and who are unwilling to join the fight for rights is of no small frustration to negro leaders who spearhead rights movements three areas where this dispiriting situation exists are considered here first the negro elite it is in this segment of successful professional and business men and women that one would normally expect solidarity in the push not only for unlimited horizons in their own fields but also for broader opportunities and full assimilation of the less fortunate of their race i say this because the relative secureness of this group which not incidentally has been largely gained through negro patronage makes less likely their suffering from reprisals from the adversary moreover it is from this group that leadership should logically spring it doesbut in fartoomany cases negroes of the upper bracket are selfishly content to enjoy the fruits of their own success caring little or nothing about the social revolution now in progress which seeks to deliver all peoples of this land to the doors of freedom and dignity there too are some such as one of the wealthiest negro businessmen and manufacturers who refused to endorse the battle for civil_rights legislation scorning the efforts to remove racial barriers he declared that the negro automatically created the barrier himself by the lack of positive action in his own behalf that the lack of initiative courage integrity loyalty and wisdom are responsible for his not making the rate of progress that he should make secondly and probably to negro leadership the most discouraging of all groups comes the complacent element that has succumbed to tokenism these negroes gullibly note scattered privileges at places of public accommodation and the scant hiring of negroes on white collar jobs and placidly resign themselves in blind faith to an unquestioned dream about things that will naturally get betterbecause they are better now than they were fifty years ago but more than years ago w e burghardt du bois author of the souls of black folk pointed to certain human essentials which were sorely needed in that day many of which remain unattained at this time work culture libertyall these we need not singly but together not successively but together each growing and aiding each he wrote and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims before the negro people the ideal of human brotherhood gained through the unifying ideal of race such ideal is not attainable by inaction and credulity but is best achieved through positive efforts through politics moral appeals law suits public protests etc nevertheless some kind of effort must be spentin concert probably nowhere are greater efforts needed than in the third group consideredthat multitude of non and semiliterates whose lives liberty and pursuits of happiness are but unpitied abortions struck by the knife of the southern way of life blinded by ignorance circumscribed by fear degraded by the standard setters these are people who have little faith in the possibility that they too may someday be free to contribute to and share in the fulfillment of the american dream but fulfillment of this dream for the negro first requires a vigorous demolition of all apathetic obstructions that darken his vision and thwart the equality process he must take unrelenting action to remedy all the frustrating conditions mentioned afore what can be done well obviously a distinct approach must be made to each area to successful negro professionals business men and women doctors merchants lawyers manufacturers dealers in services etc who scorn positive efforts to gain in all fields full equality for the negro who fail to align themselves with the swelling freedom movement who about the race problem openly express an attitude of unconcern i would apply the same kind of technique that is now effectively used to sway obdurate white merchantsboycott there simply is no reason why these negro magnates who have made fortunes in the markets of their own race should be spared the ax of selective patronage as concerns the group that has been mesmerized by tokenism those who cannot see the hollowness of their plight because of a few dazzling democracylabeled trinkets dangling before their eyes the leadership has a kingsize task cut out for itself it must find ways of communicating to these people the truth that there are many other rights more meaningful and longoverdue where the scant tokens came fromright underneath the trampling feet of the racists to fail to demand these rights while credulously applauding the measly crumbs that have been grudgingly doled out by the moderates is to guarantee that there is where they will remain to prepare the selfsatisfied to realize this truth perhaps it is necessary to in every possible way dispossess them of their illusions take them a step backwards and snatch from them their pacifying baubles of freedom and opportunity they must not be allowed to go about unpressured stubbornly insisting that everything is all right the freedomconscious should flatly reject the apathetic demonstrators should vigorously demonstrate against them the negro press should ceaselessly condemn them the rights of the unconcerned to partake of token freedomgimmicks must be challenged at every point the complacent negro must be awakenedin a way not wholly unlike that of the proverbial farmer who sometimes had to slam a twobyfour between the eyes of his mule simply to get his attention but there are some this third group who find nothing meaningful upon which their attention can focus mainly because it is obstructed by the veils of ignorance and despair not largely selfimposed these factors of misdirection have shunted their victims far adrift of the mainstream of american democracy one vivid example of what must beand what isbeing done to lift veils from these nonparticipating citizens is the voterregistration training program in the deep south pursuing a doortodoor campaign to enlist votingage persons in classes where they can be taught to overcome some of the roadblocks set up by intimidating arbitrary registrars the young people of sncc student nonviolent coordinating committee courageously attack the mammoth problem of getting negro americans in position to exercise their most fundamental right as citizens more grass roots programs for adults must be undertaken by the leadership negro coops banks and insurance companies while upon first mention might appear to be institutions which concede and give support to a segregated system are vitally necessary to cushion the misfortunes of awakened negroes who struggling to make the transition from peonage and indignity to freedom and equality become victims of violent and revengeful racists who ruthlessly evict them from property and dispossess them of goods a notable point here however is that when the veil is lifted the negro then evicts hitnselj from his house of despair dispossesses himself of his attitude of apathy generally apathetic attitudes of the negro come about as a result of longstanding restrictive conditions that have been imposed upon him he has in the past been limited to small benefits lying within a defined sphere he has from past experience found it futile to expect any other good that lies outside this boundary thus this mental attitude has become hardened and resists change even when the restrictions which have heretofore limited his progress have been removed if this attitude is to be removed it must immediately be replaced by anotherone of hopefulness the method by which the supplantation must be made is precisely the problem of negro leadership a sultry summer day two gate posts of crumy i y bling brick stand at the city limits of holly springs mississippi as you enter to your left is rust college a humble methodl ist college very much involved in the black revolution across the street is mississippi industrial statefunded and therefore uninvolved turn left at the first block and you are on rust avenue the first building you come to an old frame bungalow is the cofo council of federated organizations center next to it is the holly springs freedom school my fellow traveler edward sheehan author of kingdom of illusion and i had traveled a long way to see ivanhoe donaldson on a night in chicago a few months earlier we had listened to this young new yorker describe the mississippi summer project ivanhoe had been a junior at michigan state university when four years before he had joined sncc now he was the director of a fivecounty program of voter registration campaign and freedom schools all centered here in holly springs we stopped the car in front of rust avenue the stifling mississippi heat and the fact that we had been tailed for miles by the police in the last town led me to shed my clerical collar and coat the collar not only made me hot but apparently aroused the suspicions of the mississippi officers feeling a sense of relief at having reached our destination safely i was surprised to be greeted by a young angry negro squat and husky dressed outlandishly in coveralls and a huge farmers straw hat he asked crisply who are you smiling as friendly as i could manage i replied that i was a chicago priest friend of ivanhoe donaldson but for this fellow this was no password lets see some id he demanded i proceeded to show him my drivers license my collar voters card etc and said brother youre worse than some mississippi police to him my joking remark was not funny listen he retorted a mans life might depend on this resentfully but convinced he thrust out his hand and said im hardy frye we shook hands he walked off and we headed into the headquarters the next person to greet us was indeed happy to see us kathy dahl is my name are you the catholic priest from chicago she asked ivanhoe donaldson had mentioned i was coming and kathy was a catholic nurse originally from the midwest she was working to become registered in mississippi so that she might stay on in the project after the summer was over kathy was very happy to meet a priest of her faith interested at all in a cause for which she was daily risking her life ironically kathy had come to the project through the protestant council of churches a tall negro teenager from the town who was present at the headquarters offered to direct me to the church so that i might arrange to say mass on the next day sunday if the priest wanted me we went first to the spanking new catholic church and school standing out almost grotesquely amid the frame buildings in the colored section of town the same priest was pastor of both the colored and white church and wasnt enthusiastic at all about the mississippi project but told me i could say the oclock mass the next morning his attitude regarding the unkemptness of the workers and especially of communist influence among them was a common one i had during the week the criticisms seemed to me to be largely irrelevant and out of touch with one of the real authentic social revolutions taking place in our times at most one of the hundred workers i met larry rubin had an uncle who was a red we went back to the center and ivanhoe still had not returned rev e g freud presbyterian chaplain to the group was glad to see us and exchanged some pleasant conversation about dear old pope john and the new spirit he engendered then we sat out on the front steps talking again to kathy dahl talking about many things but always coming back to the noninvolvement of our church suddenly a pickup truck pulled up in front of the house a young fellow hurried toward us addressed himself to kathy and asked do you know wayne yancey yes she replied but hes in memphis no hes dead he died out on the road six miles out from here they ran headon into another car the other fellows on his way to the hospital abruptly he turned went back to his truck and kathy shuddered silently she turned to me and advised me to say nothing to the others who hadnt paid any attention to the young mans coming she whispered to one young white fellow asked him to come with us and asked me to drive her and him to the hospital as i pulled the car out i remembered the wailing sirens of a quarter of an hour before at that moment kathys premonition and her experience in the project had led her to remark that she prayed that none of the workers were involved in what must be an accident on the road indeed some were involved and one was dead what i saw in that next hour will remain indelibly fixed in my memory hurriedly i put on my collar and suitcoat pulled out our rented car and hurriedly drove the mileandahalf that brought us to the greenwood hospital kathy was as i mentioned a registered nurse and was anxious to see what help she might be indeed during the next hourandahalf she was the only person with any professional medical knowledge who treated charley scales a young man in terrific pain with a smashed hip broken jaw and many lacerations the doctor of the hospital was reportedly over on the other side of the institution treating a seriously sick white man i had rushed into the hospital with kathy and was given free entry now perhaps due to my clerical garb after kathy began to give whatever ministrations she could to the injured man i decided to go back out the door and to see if what i had glimpsed as we hurried in could possibly be true indeed it had been true there across the street in a blue combination ambulancehearse lay the body of a human being horribly from the rear window a foot stuck out there like the carcass of an animal lay the strong broken dead black body of wayne yancey mr brittenum the negro mortician of holly springs stood beside the vehicle which he owned and at the direction of a policeman threw back the canvas cloth revealing the smashed face of a young man a young student from hawaii positively identified the remains as those of wayne yancey we walked back to the hospital steps in a few moments ivanhoe donaldson made his first appearance on the scene he came hurrying across the front lawn of the hospital then crossed the street heading with two companions toward the ambulance he waved a hasty greeting to me at his side was the young man who had been our greeter hardy frye his face impassive dressed in blue jeans and a tshirt his feet in sandals the frail figure of ivanhoe donaldson belied his importance this young man is a key figure in the movement which had finally begun to shake the whole nation and which a few weeks hence would be thrust before the conscience of the nation at the democratic convention observing from the sidewalk a softbellied white man his thin blond hair sleeked back barked an order to the policeman he was mayor cooperwood dont let nobody touch the body mayor cooperwood shouted hardy frye let out a cry of rage turned and ran past the policeman and gathering crowd toward the rear steps of the hospital i thought surely that one of the gathering group of policemen would seize him hardys rage at the death of his companion was compounded by a fear that a list of the names and addresses of negro farmers friendly to the movement might be in waynes pocket and thereby likely to fall into the hands of the police a sickening resentment that was new to me though not to those experienced in mississippis way began to seize me no doctor at all had even taken the time to see if perhaps one ounce of life might be left in wayne yancey in fact no doctor ever had or ever would come out to certify him as dead mayor cooperwood walked to his car and we could all hear him summoning the rest of his police force in a few minutes more policemen were on the scene including the fish and game warden in his truck when they appeared the mayor ordered the negro undertaker to get out of there with the body the only official recognition of waynes death was the police charging charley scales the driver of the car who at that moment lay in the hospital attended only by kathy dahl with manslaughter a charge which carried a maximum sentence of twenty years a civil_rights worker would certainly get the maximum ivanhoe asked me to hurry back to the headquarters and pick up one of the young lawyers who were part of the project something had to be done to see if it would be possible to make the tragedy just the death of wayne and not the slow death of the other young man in a mississippi jail as i hurried back and forth to the hospital i realized that the fatal accident in any estimation had little to do with the whole movement the car of the rights workers had been passing on one of the many hills on the road between memphis and holly springs and collided headon with a car driven by another young negro who was also hurt but not so seriously but then i thought of the constant tensions these people lived under for just one week now i had been in mississippi everytime i gripped the wheel of the car i was tense that very afternoon a police car had tailed us bumper to bumper through oxford mississippi trailed us a mile or so out of town your tension and fear as you go milesanhour dreading any minute to be stopped for speeding or for obstructing traffic for some obscure license violation for any of dozens of charges has a maddening effect on your nerves only god knows what effect it had had on this tragic afternoon at any rate wayne yancey was dead charley scales was placed under arrest and ivanhoe was told that he would have to get an ambulance to take charley to the john gaston hospital in memphis tennessee brittenums ambulance was summoned again he had to be paid and ivanhoe and kathy made the trip to memphis to get medical care for charley and to see the lawyers headquartered in a memphis hotel to find if there might be a way to keep charley from the terrifying charade of mississippi justice the evening came on quickly and quietly i promised that the next mornings mass would be offered for wayne and arrangements were made by rev freud and a young negro minister to conduct evening services on sunday for him on the campus of rust college a scheduled dance for the youngsters of town was held at the college that night sheehan and i went over and mingled with the young people and the professors many of them yaleys taking their summer vacation from yale by teaching at rust i met several young people from the catholic high school and enjoyed the evenings music played by three local students hardy frye sat around with us at the dance somehow our few hours of involvement at holly springs had won hardy over to us he was a californian finishing college at berkeley his coveralls and farmers hat were the habit of the movement brash tough willing to die hardy wears the coveralls in somewhat the same manner that francis wore brown in assissi long ago they call me mr freedom it makes me angry to realize that we need the white workers to protect us but we do if those first three martyrs this summer werent two of em white nobody would have cared but the fbi is around now if they kill me the country will hear about it and the white sheriff hes beginning to be fair he sees me on the freedom days marching people to the courthouse to register he knows that per cent or more of the people here are negro and he likes his airconditioned office and fancy cigars hes getting to think that maybe its time to start being a little fairer his deputy is still a sadist though every morning this summer ive headed downtown my job is voter registration in town the first thing i do is go to the country courthouse in the town square and fall asleep the policeman comes along and nudges me and says move on boy i talk back and say man ill move on when you move all those rednecks off the steps too and he lets me be it does the young colored kids a lot of good to see a black man talk back and like i say if they kill me theyll hear about it hardy had been arrested since the afternoon at the hospital they arrested his companion cleve for resisting arrest by not replying sir to a policeman hardy was picked up because they claimed the tennessee license on the rented car in which he sat was invalid hardy chose to go right to trial on the spot and they took him to the judge who ran a grocery store in town the fine was hardys last dollar for the moment but he paid it rather than spend the weekend in jail when he might be needed laughingly he said what are you going to do father in a place where the judge who finds you guilty and fines you cant even spell california in writing out my address some of hardys talk seemed at variance with a totally nonviolent approach but it seems to me that a totally nonviolent approach is now humanly impossible the philosophy of dr martin_luther_king jr seemed based upon the fact that redemptive suffering and nonviolence would change the hearts of the dominant white society this has not happened at least not with requisite speed robert moses leader of the mississippi project has evolved a new approach that combines nonviolence with a realization that violent reactions might come in reply and the hope must be that the violent reactions will bring a response from the power structure of the south not of love but of law enforcement to prevent further anarchy the leaders say that the last thing they want is federal occupation of mississippi federal occupation always means the preservation of the status quo federal intervention is absolutely necessary to get voters registered but the real solution lies in men like the sheriff beginning to realize that the status quo is being changed gradually but really in ten years the negro will have a real substantial voice in the destiny of his state that at least is the hope i offered mass the next morning for wayne yancey my last mississippi meal was breakfast in the backroom of a negro tavern canteloupe and coffee with kathy sheehan and frye sunday was a day to eat in the back room because the police turned out in full force on sunday mornings to stop any attempts of the freedom workers to integrate sunday worship services in the churches of holly springs finally after breakfast ed sheehan and i got to visit with a very weary ivanhoe donaldson ivanhoe wished that we could have been around longer to see what was being done so successfully in the rural areas at least as we sat talking in the center we saw the fruits of months of work for dozens of people men and women dressed in their sunday best began to arrive from holly springs and from the nearby farms they were going to leave together in a sixcar caravan and head for the district convention in greenville mississippi that afternoon it seems unjust to call the freedom democratic party a mock party or a symbolic protest as senator humphrey compromisingly described it in atlantic city the freedom democratic party is a political party real people from hattiesburg and jackson and greenville and greenwood from city shacks and barren farms people coming alive at frightful personal risk coming alive to a sense of their own dignity and power ivanhoe told us that after this days meeting in greenville the state convention in jackson would come on thursday and then on to atlantic city television recorded for millions the reality of the freedom democratic party and brought to the fore the brave clarksdale druggist dr aaron henry who summarized amidst the swirling confusion of the convention the reality of the work of young negroes like ivanhoe donaldson and the hundreds who joined them in mississippi and remain there now the freedom democratic party did not and could not compromise the whole essence of the lives of those involved is an uncompromising commitment to really change things in mississippi and the nation the compromises of credentials committees and politicians anxious to hold on to votes do not make sense to people who daily risk their lives and jobs and families the cries of senator eastland of communism the complaints about the way that the young people dress seemed so ludicrous to us at the climax of our trip and i hope to the whole nation who viewed the atlantic city convention it would be good if everyone of us who seeks false compromises could spend time in mississippi we all need to look often at the quiet dignity of ivanhoe and kathy and hardy we cannot turn away when it is time to contemplate the neglected smashed remains of wayne yancey who made the long trip back to the south from his home on jackson boulevard in chicago in order to really do something about freedom the regular mississippi democrats walked out of the national convention and after much ado the sergeantsatarms managed to keep the seats empty but we cannot go on pretending that mississippi is empty or isnt there those crumbling gate posts at the entrance of holly springs open to an integral part of america until we realize that with all that it takes in the personal committment of our lives in our own homes then our efforts in viet nam or anywhere else ring false wayne yancey is dead so are the three chaney schwerner and goodman but hardy frye and hundreds like him are alive mayor cooperwood and his like are also alive the outcome of the battle is far from certain the cost in lives is impossible to tell as you pass those crumbling gate posts the brown scenery of dead grass on the campus of rust college is noticeably devoid of any signs of new construction but as i pulled out of that town after a quick week of visiting the freedom centers i was convinced that a new holly springs a whole new mississippi and america is being built not by architects and laborers with bricks but by the dedicated young men and women of the mississippi project return of a native daughter with the inflection of surprise the young turkish woman had said well you are the very first american i have ever met who was not looking forward to going home then came her candid second thought but you are the first american black i have known i considered my bleak past as a negro in america and the uncertain future for me and my generation of american blacks of course i assured her my color has a great deal to do with my reluctance my dread of returning to the united states did not speak of returning as going home the country had never provided me with the safety the comfort the freedom that the word home implies there was something else i felt compelled to say if i were white with similar values and aspirations i daresay i still would be reluctant to return there are some things about america which render much of the country virtually unlivable for certain types or groups of peopleirrespective of race the pockets of american expatriates all over the world are evidence of that evidence of the search for a kind of freedom that is not available to substantial minorities of people in the united states this indictment astonished my listener whose interactions with americans had occurred most frequently across her desk at the us information service in istanbul i hastened to elaborate on the charge what i mean is there are strict limits on a most personal kind of freedomthe freedom to be ones self it is very keenly felt if the self you happen to be does not fit the general pattern that is summarized succinctly in the cliches allround and allamerilean this of course needed clarification i went on to describe the risks one takes in america when it is apparent that he holds an unorthodox political view or prefers to wear a beard or favors chess over baseball or elects to spend an evening in a library rather than at a party a pattern of such preferences excludes a person from conventional social contacts in america his interest and preferences are dismissed as idiosyncracies quirks or eccentricities and he is dismissed as a candidate for conventional community life there was not time then to continue my discourse on america and my paranoid streak reminded me that the usis building was not the place for such revelations rather abruptly i ended my conversation with the lady who was beginning to look skeptical but a monologue with the same theme began within me i continued thinking of the individual who is rejected because he is unconventional in american terms and how much more complex his situation is when he happens also to have the conspicuous distinction of being black his position is much more insecure his dilemma much more dangerous his condition much more tragic when an american negro discovers that he can resolve his dilemma and change his condition simply by living in another country how must he feel when he discovers also that he must return to america to live again it is like stepping naked and refreshed from a pool of sweet waters and then again putting on mudcaked ragged clothes that reek with a terrible stench such was my feeling when faced with the knowledge that some irresistible motives were forcing me back to the united states in previous generations a few american negroes known and unknown left the legendary land of the free for a european freedom left and never returned in my own generation unnumbered american negro emigrants are finding permanent niches for themselves in tokyo stockholm lagos and other places where they can move freely be themselves and at long last live for others of us however permanent exile and expatriation are themes of frequent fantasies but never will become realities i never have experienced the conviction one must feel when he knowingly buys his last oneway ticket from the united states twice i initiated plans for remaining abroad and twice the plans were abandoned why i recalled my first time abroad i was years old when i went when i returned to the united statesold enough yet too naive to have anticipated the potential impact of the european experience i hardly was prepared for the transition from restricted life in segregated washington dc to the permissive atmosphere of paris indeed i was at first bewildered by the strange unnamed sensation i experienced when i looked for a hotel bought a theater ticket or selected a restaurant for lunch or dinner later i realized that that strange unnamed sensation was the feeling of freedom sheer freedom of movement a sensation i have yet to feel in the united states that sensation accompa nied me through the streets i was aware of a difference in other peoples reactions to me and my reactions to them en passant i felt we viewed each other with curiosity or interest or indifference never with the apprehension or anxiety or disdain that i have perceived in the black and white exchange of glances on the sidewalks of america in paris during the course of development of relationships i observed that a difference in skin color was an irrelevant difference the parisians i encountered seemed to possess a kind of social intelligence which penetrates superficial aspects of an individual such as the color of his skin shape of his nose his hair texturean intelligence which searches beneath for signs of beliefs and personal identity although racial characteristics did not seem relevant in their assessments of people parisians in particular and europeans in general are wellinformed about racial conflicts in various parts of the world and especially in the united states only a few have a clear idea of what the daytoday existence of a negro in america must be like many however realize that it must be a miserable existence often i recall the compassion of their invitations to living you ought not suffer the injustices and indignities of your like in america why go back to be mistreated stay here and make paris your home in other placesstockholm geneva rome belgrade istanbul beirutthe same invitation has been extended for the same reasons it is an invitation that i have been unable to accept why the answer and insight were to be found in some lines by james baldwin it is the day he the american living in europe realizes that there are no untroubled countries in this fearfully troubled world that if he has been preparing himself for anything in europe he has been preparing himselffor america preparation for what kind of life in what kind of america am i now prepared to do battle continually on an american front or shall i avoid and evade the conflict in an insulated suburban retreat and where is the retreat that is not in touch by radio television and the press however incomplete the news with the many scattered battle grounds isnt the battle after all mine indeed it is more mine now since i have known the feeling of freedomand the feeling was good the european preparation was essential it was preparation for the role of combatantdefender a role one must be able to play until the final curtain the role carries with it a responsibility for helping to establish a firm basis for a secure freedom in america for myself and my people to leave america permanently would mean abdication of that responsibility for the sake of my people i returned indeed for the sake of all america i returned this has a righteous and an embarrassingly patriotic ring i know but rightly or wrongly it rings true is it not for the sake of america that this war against ignorance and intolerance is being waged it is an extremely patriotic act on the part of the citizens black and white who care enough for the present and the future of the united states to sacrifice personal desires and material gains to risk limb and sometimes life in this fight for freedom the success or the failure of their efforts is crucial to the survival of america america speaks to the free world as its leader what an hypocrisy what a great hoax and who in the world does not know it if america is to make credible her championing a free society obviously freedom must be extended to all the american people moreover the concept of freedom must be clarified for the multitude that does not understand it i am convinced that most americans regardless of race never have experienced the feeling of freedom they do not know what it means to be denied freedom since they never have known what it means to be free the negro in the united states is continually aware that he is not free the white american is reminded of the boundaries and restrictions in the society each time he confronts a negro facetoface or a reference to a negro in the past five years there have occurred a series of very poignant and desperate expressions of the need for freedom in the united states in many places and at many levels it has been demonstrated clearly that the winds of freedom will not blow over the land for a spell last year saw some changes in practices and the lovering of some barriers in hitherto impregnable quarters of the south but it saw also the unflagging strength of the resistance in other southern quarters and the extent of the duplicity and deceit in the rest of the country although there were several positive events negative ones seemed more salient conservatives and segregationists were demoralized and disappointed as were liberals and integrationists white integrationists ran scared while black nationalists grew more hostile it was last year that the names chaney goodman and schwerner were etched painfully in the hideous history of mississippi and just the year before the assassinations of evers then kennedy had revealed the horror that lies deep in the land that same year the year of the centennial celebration of the civil war saw the populace yet immersed in but another stage of that same war it was in that i returnedin time to watch the final preparations for our great march a march that lay bare the breadth of the unrest and the depth of the hope throughout america the march brought out people brown yellow black and white from every region of the united states people went to washington because they wanted to express their support of the current movement more important though they went because they were and are extremely concerned about their own personal freedom and wished to demonstrate their concern this seems especially true for the nonnegroes who participated theirs especially was a proclamation of the desire to be able to be ones self an often frustrated desire that troubles a significant minority of people in this strange land the march too was a disclosure of the confidence in the american system that is held by that black and white minority so often frustrated and betrayed by the american system itself it is this very system and its values which must be modified by the current movement specifically pressures toward uniformity which pervade american society are not compatible with the kind of permissiveness and tolerance which must exist in a free society by virtue of a bizarre contradiction in the culture the process of integration is a response to some pressures toward a uniform society although the likelihood of such an amalgamation is remote it may well be a threat to the remnants of negro culture that generations from now negroes may have to struggle to retain for now though the march must be toward the moment of freedom and the social implications of freedom in a new american way of life it must be recognized however that such freedom will not be achieved in america in our time from the shores of europe my eyes have the grotesque confusion the grim paradox of the real america and the ideal america from that distance the real america seemed a monstrous thing from my peculiar vantage point of extreme marginality in america black and illequipped for conventional living the confusion and the paradoxes are more vivid the image more monstrous it is very tempting to turn away from it all on those dismal days when the newscasters report all defeats and no victories i sometimes ask why should i or anybody else give a damn about this country once more i am beset by fantasies of settling down in a foreign haven where i might enjoy freedom and sanctuary then i return to reality i might find freedom there but there is no true sanctuary no hiding place i think of my unborn children and of their unborn again i know why i am here i renew my pledge to myself my pledge to the future of a free america however remote however elusive that freedom this generation has its responsibility for contributing to it i returned knowing that i wanted this period in american history to be a part of my personal history yet i know too how very distant the realization of american freedom is a fineprint item that appeared near the end of californias long november ballot may prove to be the superweapon segregationists across the country have been looking for it shows a way to wipe out all laws designed to open the housing market to negroesall the antidiscrimination legislation liberals have pushed into enactment in eleven states and nine cities over the past decade that small itema constitutional amendment which california voters approved two to one placed in the state constitution a clause which forbids either the state or any municipality to deny limit or abridge directly or indirectly the right of any person to decline to sell lease or rent any part or all of his real property to any person or persons as he in his absolute discretion chooses in one swipe it nullifies the states two fair housing laws which inhibit discrimination against renters and home buyers and bars any such laws in the future racial discrimination has been indubitably legalized the california brainchild answers the prayers of racists who complain indignantly that no sooner do they beat down one scheme to let negroes in than another rears its head here finally is machinery with the breadth and strength to do the job they want done the solidity of the constitutional amendment makes the referendum seem as ephemeral as a butterfly illinois segregationists already are gathering signatures proposing a constitutional amendment cut after the ingenious california model while in a number of other states basic groundwork is quietly being laid but the product itself is not all that dazzles the technique of marketing it to california voters was equally brilliant the most racist measure ever placed on an american ballot from first to last was characterized as having nothing whatever to do with race its sponsors the state realty and apartment house associations professed to abhor discrimination and to favor integration the issue they insisted was rights the two fair housing laws violated our inherent property rightsthe right to do what one chooses with ones own these mild laws both of them weak in enforcement provisions and administrative machinery were said to constitute forced housing it was claimed they gave government control over the traditionally free housing market and were the opening wedge for government to seize full control over private property in the future and our lives along with it in short the gimmick was confusion the whole area of rights of course is fantastically easy to confuse psychology experiments have proven the strong propensity of humans to respond negatively to anything that suggests a restriction of our rights in a gallup poll that included the south per cent of those interviewed said they would not move if negroes moved next door but in another poll which excluded the south when the question was framed the other way and persons were asked if they thought they should have the right to refuse to sell to negroes per cent said they should berkeley realtor jay force one of the architects of the campaign quite knew what he was saying much as he sounds like he doesnt when he declared were simply asking for the people of our great state to have the right to vote on legislation affecting their constitutional rights to decide for themselves whether or not they want legislation denying limiting or abridging their property rights in the th century ordinarily rational people were similarly confused by the argument that to restrict child labor would be to infringe on our right to hire without interference and that to abolish slavery would be to violate personal property rights campaign strategists foreseeing that there would be insufficient overt racists to carry the measure welded a coalitiona coalition which was characterized by congressman philip burton as the confused and the contemptible californias achievement should not have surprised anyone no state has demonstrated more racial savvy than california which has been the prime provider of our national segregation techniquesnot the south as some suppose southern negroes were still docile plantation slaves when california began fencing in its orientals san franciscos packed swarming chinatown wasnt designed to amuse tourists with techniques sharpened on yellow skin california during the past decade has quietly received and insulated a half million negro newcomers tucking them away so neatly few californians ever see them los angeles one of the most segregated cities in america thus partitions more than negro arrivals each month negro californians who number almost an even million comprise the most phenomenal component of the phenomenal growth rate of the nations largest state in election postmortems journalists observed that california had become the first state to write racism into its constitution they were years late with that credit line california won that laurel in when the state constitution acquired an amendment granting all necessary power to cities and towns for the removal of chinese without the limits of such cities or towns or for their location within proscribed portions of municipalities citizens had been so removing and locating chinese since the latter began arriving in precivil war days but the chinese had begun wondering out loud if it were legal the golden state retained this gem in its constitution until when the japanese came they promptly committed the transgression of being too industrious and they had to be told their place the infamous land acts of and prohibited japanese from owning or leasing farm land though they were sought after as hands at token wages and lands already acquired by them passed to the state these laws which withstood constitutional condemnation until after world war ii served as models for similar land acts throughout the west but california will shine brightest in the segregationist heaven for showing how to make restrictive covenants work since the ancient origin of the land deed property owners had been loading them with covenants saying the estate could be sold only to a certain class or race but how to make them stick had eluded the cleverest minds down through the agesuntil a san diego lawyer thought of asking courts to enforce them the scheme failed when an appeal court ruled that the covenant in questiona bar on chineseviolated the th amendment but gold had been glimpsed and the san diego example set off a chain reaction of similar suits across the country finally in a louisiana suit succeeded and the negro owner of a raciallyrestricted property was ordered to vacate it everywhere lower courts obliged with similar eviction orders in some states however as in california appeal courts upset the evictions ruling that racial restrictions against sale or rental violated the th amendment then a los angeles lawyer cleared that road block he was inspired to test a covenant that contained in addition to restrictions on sale and rental additional ones on use and occupancy eureka the court ruled that while the former restrictions were unconstitutional the latter two were not therefore the chinese owner of the property in question could not be forced to surrender his deed but he could beand was barred from residing on his property or conducting business on it where restrictive covenants had failed they began working again when injected with use and occupancy clauses they did that is until when the supreme court upset the whole apple cart by declaring all four racial restrictions to be unconstitutional but all was not lost as milpitas california soon demonstrated during the s that small bay area city became a veritable showcase of how to segregate sans covenants when negro employees of ford motor companys milpitas plant were unable to find housing the united auto workers decided to build an integrated housing project to accommodate them a suitable tract was found outside milpitas but the land was swiftly rezoned for industrial use at a second site authorities refused to approve the subdivision plan a start on a third site brought a sudden upgrading of building regulations when a fourth site was stymied the builder gave up and withdrew after searching four years the union finally persuaded another builder to tackle the milpitas obstacle course only to have the sewer connection fee hiked to a ransom but that outrage caused a clamor that brought state action only direct intervention by the attorney general permitted the builder to construct the project these are a few of the legalized barbed fences which the campaign of confusion painted as our free housing market that has had its indemic freedoms abused of course the negro like the oriental is not confused as to whether the real estate market has been open and competitive or closed and restrictive he knows he is forced to buy from a small fenced segment of it where a dollar buys less than in the market from which he is barred nor is the negro confused about which is the basic property right the right to buy or the right to sell knowing he cant sell property until he owns property he sees travesty in the claimed right to sell in a restricted way that robs him of his right to buy one who has been bruised by such a right knows it is not a right but a privilegea privilege those in power have granted to themselves yet californias negroes and its other minorities are not without allies alongside californias his torical racist strain has dwelled a hardheaded egalitarian breed which has demanded that all humans be treated decently and these opposites sometimes give the state the appearance of advanced schizophrenia a coalition of minorities and liberals have been able to win some important battlesrepealing the infamous land acts and zoning ordinances clearing the way for integrated housing in milpitas and passing the two fair housing laws and the war is not over currently this coalition is huddling in strategy sessions and reconnoitering for an assault on the enemys new stronghold which it will not admit to be impregnable tentative plans call for a barrage of carefullylaid lawsuits to test the federal constitutionality of the racist statute which so long as it exists gives the lie to californias claim to an open society the legislation we have j long awaited was final jj ly passed but the v ybk struggle is not yet over in the months and years ahead we must resolve in fact what the civil_rights act is resolving in law the common enemy remains the enemy is segregationand segregation hurts us all whether it be blatant in the south or subtle in the north it saps and diminishes democracy and justice let us be clear about segregation whether it exists by law or by custom by edict or by tradition by patterns of employment or patterns of housing segregation hurts our children negro and white alike and nowhere is this damage more devastating than in education for democracy the war against segregation is a single war but all too often it is waged on many flanks which are secondary to our objective the elimination of racial discrimination in education these flanking skirmishes take place over neighborhood schools over mobile classrooms over compensatory education and even over the use of a school bus these secondary struggles confuse and divide and frustrate our primary purpose they lead citizens of good will to take passionate issue on one side or the other to become rigid inflexible and frozen to forget what the enemy is and where the enemy stands the shortsightedness of many the recklessness of some is seen when good and allied policies of education are turned one against the other when the justice of integration takes a collision course against the quality of education let us examine these flanking skirmishes which lead us away from our prime objective first the neighborhood school in some cities the neighborhood school has been used as an instrument to perpetrate segregation turning our struggle for integration into a condemnation of the neighborhood school and all its works to be sure some who extol the neighborhood school do so because they abhor integration but many who defend the neighborhood school genuine desire a school sensibly close to home so conflict arises positions are taken motives are impugned and a smoke screen goes up to protect the enemy yet the neighborhood school and the integrated school are not incompatible both are good they should go hand in hand whenever possible if we must choose between them we choose integration but why must we choose we must work for both integration and the neighborhood school simultaneously we must achieve each to the greatest degree possible second the mobile classroom in some cities portable extensionsmobile classroomsmerely enlarge the segregated school expanding and containing the ghettos of education turning our struggle for integration into another skirmish this isnt mobility this is merely anchoring the status quo but mobile classrooms can be used as integrated preschool centers and reading centers they can be used for these services as an instrument toward integration the misuse of mobile classrooms does not make them bad in themselves any more than the misuse of neighborhood schools makes them bad in themselves the mobile classroom and integrated education are not incompatible the mobile classroom can play a useful affirmative role if we must choose we choose integration but why must we choose let us use mobile classrooms to achieve a greater degree of integration and quality education third compensatory education a highquality highintensity program of the very best education we can provide for those who need it mostthe children of discrimination poverty and neglect in some cities compensatory education like the neighborhood school and the mobile classroom is misused is employed as an excuse to put off and postpone integration and our struggle for integration is once again turned into a senseless flanking fight yet compensatory education and integrated education are not incompatible they are logical effective paths to precisely the same objective but here once more they have been represented as two sides of an argument and we are maneuvered into taking senseless positions if we must choose we choose integration but why must we choose we need both compensatory education and integrated education at one and the same time fourth and last is bussing and here the smoke screen is densest of all bussing is an unfortunate word it has been used in unfortunate ways when those who oppose integration speak of bussing they almost always paint a picture of school children traveling for hours and hours and miles and miles until there is little time or appetite left for school such trips to nowhere are not envisioned by the most ardent supporters of bussing a school bus of course is a means of transportation and transportation is a means of getting children to school it can also be a logical reasonable way to increase integration in some of our cities but a school bus is not a policy or a panacea the question remains what is the most effective approach to desegregation in a given city in a given school system if we must choose between segregated schools and the school bus as a vehicle toward integration negro digest march s then we must choose for the school bus and see that it is headed in the right direction and we must head in the right direction ourselves to end for all time the blight of segregation wherever it exists and in whatever forms and shapes it assumes when the enemy becomes the neighborhood school policy when the enemy becomes compensatory education whenin an ultimate kind of madnessthe enemy becomes the school itself segregation gains and all of us lose by turning once and for all from these distracting issues we shall find in ourselves and in our schools an alliance that can be strengthened and will prevail schoolmen and educators everywhere must come to realize that their natural interests lie along the road to full equality for all our citizens that our schools can teach no lesson more important for all our children than integration that they must do far more than they have ever done to see that our schools are leadersnot followersin the struggle to eliminate segregation and civil_rights leaders too must reassess their relations with the schools they must recognize that all too vital energies can be dissipated in false skirmishes they must not merely be veto groups they must move from the position of naysayer and yeasayer into creative positions saying this is what we wantbecause good education demands it all civil_rights organizations as some have should study and know about nongraded school organization about team teaching about the model school system about the experimental programs now being advanced about ways to bring all our young people toward the highest levels of education of which they are capable essential to our success in the years ahead is a working partnership between education and the civil_rights movement in carrying forward our present momentum for change we can expect that there will be strains and stresses and initial misunderstandings but these creative tensions are always vital to the process of progress our schools should be can be the peoples major instrument to democratize society to give substance and meaning to the promise of america when the creative energies of the civil_rights movement are allied and joined with the best traditions of american education then we shall find beyond legislation for equality the reality of equalityin education and in every other realm of our lives taken strictly as a poet leroi jones poems should be considered in a literary context for instance he is not a jazz poet he is not a negro poet he is not a race post as in so far as he was a poet at all richard wright was a race poet jones is not i mean a jazz poet in the sense that kenneth rexroth tries to be but when i say he is not a negro poet i mean that he is not one in the sense that paul laurence dunbar was now by placing jones work in the literary context i mean that he suceeds as a poet struggling with form and with meaning in his poems this is very clear he is a poet in the sense that kenneth patchen is a poet in the same sense that robert creely is a poet concerned with form jones may not be as accomplished a poet as creeley but he is surely in that range leroi jones titles are always good good and interesting in a poetic sense titles like a poem some people will have to understand and the insidious dr fu man chu have the necessary elements of mystery though they reek of what is often called the new american language advocated by dr william carlos williams et al the poem as an art form demands titles have to be creative too and jones well realizes this ake up wake up w boys pa was gently rolling us back and forth grinning his mischief through his toothstudded purple gums get up and help your mama it was lunchtime again and pa always walked back to the house for a hot meal because cold biscuits and eggs choke me near to death hed say now he was bending over us his seamed and lumpy face looking so much like a roughfinished bust with scrape marks of the sculptors spatula still on itrousing us for our midday chores pa was tall and a bit stooped and coal dust blackened every crack and ravine in his face and body but he was gentle and good and comforting except on his rare occasions of anger he was very angry the time he caught us throwing rocks down into the blackberry pit hed scooped us up one under each arm my brother herman and me and stormed down slades road to our house and into our room his usually squinting eyes flared wide and bloodshot as he banged shut the door threw us to the plank floor and took off his belt in one motion his nostrils quivered coltlike as he strapped us til we burned all over and ma had to come and make him stop you leave em alone leave em alone and they wont bother us he wheezed through his angry teeth and through his anger we saw fear wed never seen pa afraid before the time old man sim had come to our house to beat us because we had bloodied his boys nose for calling us niggers pa had stood up real tall you get the hell outta my house or i throws you out and old sim had left red as a poker iron another time sheriff jenkins had come to the door with luke sedges who owned the mine and called pa out into the yard and asked him about some union agitator who was stirring up the men pa shook his head though we boys knew the man had stayed with us for two nights pa never explained to us when it was good to lie and when it was bad blackberry pit was an old deserted openpit mine that had been worked out before we were born now it was overgrown with sassafras and blackberry bushes clear down to the bottom the floor of the pit was shaley and mosaiclike with white clay and rusty dust it was a kind of irregular amphitheatre relentlessly encroached with underbrush and the best blackberries in newton grew there also the biggest rattlers the pit was fested with the snakes they retreated to the shelter of the roots and stones in the bottom on warm days theyd come out into the west virginia sun to sleep and stretch one evening we counted twentyone squirming and lazing in the dust below all of the kids were forbidden to trespass even the upper rim of the pit superstition about snakes and the concomitant fears were grounded deep in the community folklore and the respect paid the pit was close to the character of primitive tribal religion of course young innocence and curiosity always make blasphemers of children the pit was well harvested despite parental taboo one day we gathered our army and laid siege to the pit and threw rocks down there to see if the snakes would get mad and come up and kill the whole town we werent afraid even if the grownups were our army would destroy them then everybody would talk about how brave the boys had been the whole neighborhood would go picking all the way down to the bottom after the battle down there the berries were as big as your thumb there would be berry cobblers with buttery crusts bubbling in the coal stove ovens juicy dumplings steaming in iron pots puffing spices and sugar smells all over the kitchen and thered be rich black jam and biscuits and sweet butter and heady blackberry wine pa cut our dreams short and chased the other kids home every buttock under sixteen was sore that night herman and i gave each other knowing glances when we got up aw pa and we put the mattresses back on the bedsprings i was to help ma hang the clothes while herman took script to the commissary for cheese and flour after chores we and the gorham boys and ned stevens were going berrypicking five left out of that gallant company of two weeks ago pa swatted us playfully as we scampered past him out of the room past the kitchen and out into the dancing sunlight ma straightened up from the wash basket to give herman the company script from her apron pocket i started to hang up blue workshirts and flour sack pillow cases the basket was bottomless i still had five pieces to go when herman got back landsakes you younguns is in a hurry interjected ma as she took the goods from herman go and eat the hot bread and crisp fatback and ambercolored pear preserves stuck in our throats and had to be washed down with buttermilk were going ma we yelled as we skipped past her on the porch you stay out of devilment she warned looking up from her lapful of snapbeans and the marbled blue and white pan into which she was throwing them we were already through the hole in the back fence we crossed the tracks coming out of old number three mine and ran up the road to hells hill slate pile and turned off at the cart trail to pick up our buckets we were late the others were already at the pit we were going to the picnic grounds afterwards to devour the forbidden fruits up ahead ned stevens who was fourteen and older than the rest of us stood beckoning us on herman was thirteen and he and ned were rivals for leadership ned led by his wits but herman was stronger and big ger hey jim herman come on where ya been all this time aw shut up we had to get our buckets herman replied as we climbed the scrubby rise of earth that rimmed the pit raymond and deane gorman stopped their game of mumbledepeg as we descended the other side everyone walked over to the pits edge with his bucket here the further down you

to him mr stevens turned ashy gray as he pushed past us and fell on his knees at the edge of the pit oh lawdy my boy my boy oh lawdy he screamed falling on his face we could see ned on his knees rolling and scrambling in the midst of the coiling and striking rattlesnakes then he went wide eyed with a loud eeeeee eeeeee and we couldnt tell anymore whether he was moving or just twitching from the fangblows as the snakes kept on striking and bobbing and dancing up little puffs of gray dust and whirring the rattles on their angry tails a long shout from the mine whistle blasted away the spell the gorham boys had run all the way to the mine for help an old company truck growled and rattled down the dusty road towards us its solid tire chain transmission groaned and jangled to a stop and twenty frightened men scrambled from its bed and front fenders gimme that spyglass growled the foreman a body less hand obeyed my gawd he swolled up biggern a cow wouldnt go down ther for all of sedges money you kids git home ma was waiting on the back stoop when we crawled through the back fence you all go on and wash face and hands theres milk and cornbread on the china boy we washed conscientiously for the first time scrubbing and soaping ourselves in silence save for the noise of splashing water and soap suds being blown from our nostrils we abluted and purged our sins in the mildewed wooden tubs and outside of a sudden came a shriek that curdled courage and twisted the heart together jesus lawdy gimme back my ned jesus help me help me help me jeeee suss and when we crept furtively to the door we saw ma stevens down the dustquilted road rolling and tearing at her bosom as though her agony had been made molten like hot lava and poured searing and scalding over her breasts then ma came in from the back and wrapped an arm about each of us and hugged us ever so tight eat your bread and milk boys when we finished we tipped to our room made the pallets and went to sleep as for me i slept deeply and dreamlessly till i was awakened by what sounded like thunder dynamiting the pit cant get the boy out they still sleep yes said ma im glad said pa although many racial barriers have fallen and others are in the process of decay the area of marriage remains one in which negroes and whites are clearly separated by the law this is true not only throughout the south but in a number of other states as well in some of these states interracial marriages are classified as misdemeanors and in others they are felonies in all states prohibiting miscegenous marriages such unions are declared to be null and void thus we see that court decisions integrating municipal golf courses and swimming pools and civil_rights acts affecting areas of public accommodation have not in any way lessened either the effectiveness or the legality of state laws prohibiting marriage between individuals of different races the supreme court has never ruled on the constitutionality of such laws and until no statute of this kind had ever been stricken by a state court a number of such statutes have been upheld within the past several years miscegenation legislation has a long history extending back to the very beginnings of the american legal system a look at this history will enable us to view the current legal question in some perspective the first law banning mixed marriages was passed in by the colony of maryland virginia followed in with a statute providing that a white man having a bastard by a negro or mulatto should pay a fine of pounds or in default of payment be sold for five years it also punished such women for marriage to a negro a mulatto or indian massachusetts enacted its first antimiscegenation statute in followed by delaware pennsylvania and north carolina by thirty states forbade miscegenation and the penalties provided for the violation of these laws varied from imprisonment for a few months to a term of up to ten years and fines ranging up to californias antimiscegenation statute dates from its first legislative session though frequently attacked on constitutional grounds they have always been upheld as a valid state regulation until recent times as of miscegenous marriages were felonies in these states alabama florida georgia indiana maryland mississippi missouri oregon south dakota tennessee and texas they were misdemeanors in delaware nevada south carolina west virginia and wyoming as late as twentyfour states maintained prohibitions against miscegenous marriages prior to fourteen states repealed antimiscegenation statutes these states are iowa kansas maine massachusetts michigan new mexico ohio rhode island washington north dakota south dakota oregon colorado and montana the exercise of control over the marriage relation by the states dates back to our earliest legal decisions as early as chief justice john marshall pointed out that all of our marriage and divorce laws are state laws and state statutes the national power with us not having legislative or judicial cognizance of the matter within these localities the control of the state in this area seems to have been almost beyond question in the supreme court noted that marriage as creating the most important relation in life as having more to do with the morals and civilization of a people than any other institution has always been subject to the control of state legislatures control however cannot be an unreasonable control in the case of american sugar refining company v louisiana the court stated that the doctrine of legislative control does not carry with it the right to enact race and class legislation such legislation may not be discriminatory irrational with no legitimate end but rather an unreasonable expression of popular prejudice courts which have upheld miscegenation statutes have pointed to the allegedly valid reason for their establishment and enforcement in scott v georgia it was held that the amalgamation of the races was not only unnatural but is always productive of deplorable results the decision said that our daily observation shows us that the offspring of these unnatural connections are generally sickly and effeminate and that they are inferior to the fullblooded of either race in physical development and strength in an early missouri case state v jackson it was held that mixed unions were incapable of reproduction later courts merely followed this precedent the courts often talk in general terms declaring that it is well established law that such statutes are a proper exercise of the states police power often substantiating this by analogy to statutes prohibiting incestuous marriages polygamy and restrictions based upon age the first case involving miscegenation to reach the supreme court and the only one to be decided on the merits to date was pace v alabama the case was tried under an indictment charging the defendants a white and negro with cohabitation in violation of the alabama code the code provided heavier penalties for interracial cohabitation than for the same offense by members of the same race the court ruled that it was constitutional and speaking through mr justice field said indeed the offense cannot be committed without involving persons of both races in the same punishment the punishment of each offending person whether white or black is the same among the state cases directly upholding these statutes as valid are kirby v kirby an arizona case which holds that marriage is purely a subject for state regulation dodson v state an arkansas case which holds that marriage is subject to the state police power green v state an alabama case which states that god made black and white different and meant them to be separate and state v gibson an indiana case holding that natural law forbids racial intermarriage in a significant case meyer v nebraska the right to marry is said to be protected by the due process clause and cannot be infringed upon by action that is arbitrary and bears no reasonable relation to legitimate legislative objectives the argument advanced most frequently to justify legislation prohibiting interracial marriage is that of nonwhite mental and physical inferiority the reasoning of a judge sitting on the tennessee supreme court is typical we know that the complainants belong to a race but recently emancipated from slavery that as a race they are far below the white man in intelligence another contention to prove that these states have a reasonable relation to some purpose within the competence of a statute to effect a reasonable regulation is the idea that racial intermarriage would produce such strong and widespread group feelings and racial repulsions and antagonisms as to threaten the security and tranquillity of the state scientific knowledge concerning the nature of race and the inherent abilities of the races has been completely ignored in recent cases which sound as if they might have been written more than a century ago the famous naim v naim case provides an excellent example of this the court said we find in the constitution no requirements that the states shall not legislate to prevent the obliteration of racial pride but must permit the corruption of blood even though it weaken or destroy the quality of its citizenship this case which was decided in makes references to racial pride and corruption of blood reminiscent of earlier decisions in the supreme court of california in the case of perez v sharp struck down that states miscegenation statute the court stated the regulation of marriage is considered a proper function of the state if a regulation is directed at a social evil and employs a reasonable means to prevent that evil it is valid regardless of its incidental effect upon the conduct of particular groups the right to marry is as fundamental as the right to send ones child to a particular school or the right to have offspring a statute that prohibits an individual from marrying a member of a race other than his own restricts the scope of his choice and thereby restricts his right to marry distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality the right to marry is the right of individuals not of racial groups the equal protection clause of the united states constitution does not refer to the rights of the negro race the caucasian race or any other race but to the rights of the individuals the argument of those courts which have upheld miscegenation statutes on the grounds that they are necessary for the public peace and order would seem even less persuasive when viewed against the holding of the supreme court in cantwell v connecticut the court held in every case the power to regulate must be so exercised as not in attaining a permissible end unduly to infringe the protected freedom the danger in these times from the coercive activities of those who in the delusion of racial or religious conceit would incite violence and breaches of the peace in order to deprive others of their equal right to the exercise of their liberties is emphasized by events familiar to all the supreme court has finally agreed to hear a case which deals with the question of miscegenation statutes in a florida court upheld a statute which proscribed cohabitation by persons of different races the court concluded its opinion in mclaughlin v state by setting forth its views concerning miscegenation statutes it said if the newfound concept of social justice has outdated the law of the land and by consequence some new law is necessary it must be enacted by legislative process or some other court must write it the florida court felt that it was obligated to uphold miscegenation statutes by the sound rule of the stare decises and the precedent of past decisions this is the case which the supreme court heard and ruled on last december it avoided the greater issue of those statutes prohibiting interracial marriage itself ruling only that the florida law prohibiting interracial cohabitation was unconstitutional but most observers believe that the court will strike down all such laws it is admittedly up to the states to establish a public policy concerning the marriage relation if we accept the view that such policies may be based upon whim or prejudice however we might decide that it is wrong for baptists to marry presbyterians or catholics to marry lutherans or jews to marry methodists no end is in sight when men may write their prejudices into the law with no standard to meet we have ceased to be a society of law and have become a society ruled merely by men discussing the possible aftermath of an elimination of the various miscegenation statutes an article in the university of illinois law review presented this assessment although emotion dictates that the consequence of a sweeping invalidation of interracial marriage statutes would be widespread other indications are to the contrary human behaviour in the area of sex is not basically motivated by a careful regard for the statute book above and beyond considerations of racial equality all who defend such laws must remember the legal axiom that a law should cease when the reason for the law has been removed a scientific view that holds the races to be inferior has been cast aside the idea that government may deny rights to people because allowing them their rights may cause trouble has also been abandoned the marriage relation is within the realm of state authority but every restriction must have a reason once these two ancient reasons for prohibiting racial intermarriage have been removed only prejudice remains to enforce them afewerk tekle is an extraordinarily imposing manin both physical stature and artistic achievement standing over six feet he has

ethiopian visitor toured major museums and art centers in chicago he confided that he had made a similar tour of european art centers following the completion of his studies at the central school of arts and crafts and the slade school of the university of london dont get yourself iny volved in the racial troubles of the couno was the recurring advice i received prior to my departure for this country scores of people must have said to me in almost the same words so when i reached the airport in new york my first step on american soil seemed to have encored those identical words i almost said aloud i wont please i was determined not to become involved as i had promised my wellwishers at home not knowing that as long as i came along with my skin there was no way out of it it is a year now since i left home and within this short time not only have i heard and read so much about the racial discrimination of this country but i also have had occasion to experience it personally i now know what an awful experience it is most of the racial friction that one comes in contact with is that between the white and the colored people one rarely hears of discrimination among negroes themselves there are negroes whose color is on the borderline between white and black and if given a choice some of them would rather choose to be classified as whites from what i have seen here in manhattan kansas it seems there are two categories of negroes white negroes and regular negroes negroes who due to some unfortunate circumstances were born with a very light skin seem to regard themselves as a more privileged class of negroes than those with a darker skin this is something i cannot understand i first noticed this attitude on our campus observed that most of the white negroes prefer the company of either white americans or other white negroes and the black negroes kept to themselves the black negroes in turn loathe the company of african students this to me indicates that some of these negroes regard the whites as superior to the blacks by virtue of their white skin and that is precisely what some people have dedicated their lives to correct or is it not outside the campus the situation is not any better downtown i usually see negro couples who seem to pair up according to their color this looks so intentional that i find it difficult to dismiss as merely coincidental of course there is nothing wrong with this as long as it is coincidental but it is when the choice is made with a definite preference to a lighter skin that find it objectionable this white preferentialism is perhaps more noticeable in the negro clubs here it is very rare to see a very darkskinned negro boy with a very lightcolored girl in fact one of the boys i met in the club told me in the course of a conversation that among the negro boys there is a mad rush for any girl with a light skin and the lighter her skin the more keen the competition for her the girls too scramble to win the favors of a boy with a white skin just what is all this about i cannot imagine a more inappropriate time for this fashion craze it is bad enough for whites to discriminate against blacks and vice versa but is it not ridiculous for blacks to despise other blacks because of a slight difference in intensity of skin pigmentation is this situation helping the fight for racial equality what is wrong with the black skin that one should be ashamed of it i think god made the right choice in everybodys color and i dont believe one is superior to the other in fact my dark skin is one of the things i have that i can be proud of while this mania may not be sufficiently obvious to the indigenous citizens we should remember that we do not always see ourselves as others see us it may all turn out to be a peculiarity of the negroes in this community alone but there may be a danger of its spreading to infect some healthy societies i do sincerely hope that this situation does not exist among negroes in other parts of the country let us all wear our skin with dignity and pride for black is the right color for us she came across the front promenade of the upper tier of the park behind the library at th ave and nd st she walked slowly looking up with unhappy little eyes at the idlers lounging and leaning against the benches and balustrades on both sides of her of all that polyglot crowd escaping the hateful june sun by crowding into the shade of the park trees she was unquestionably the tiniest and most spectacular she stood under five feet and her thin body and fleshless legs attested to her need of proper food and care even if her face which was oddly fat and rosy denied it as she neared the spot where i stood where the balustrades broke into a stairway leading to the parks lower tier i saw that her skin was unhealthily yellow beneath the rouge that the uncombed fragments of hair which hung from under a onceelegant embroidered hat were in need of fresh henna and that her faded cotton frock her woolen jacket and unseasonably heavy cotton hose were exceedingly dirty i admit i stared at her seeing the womans busted nearsoleless shoes i suddenly thought of my own mother who must have been this womans age and who has even now an unconquerable passion for shoes in almost such a state of disrepair i felt a great compassion and sympathy for the little woman i had been occupied with the approach of the disreputable brown oxfords when i raised my head and looked straight into her slategray eyes she stopped a few feet in front of me and spread her shapeless little legs thrusting her hands to her hips in a startling motion and while i stood looking at her the dull eyes flashed like steel blue flames her tight little mouth opened revealing three or four tobaccobrowned teeth and a coarse incongruous voice spat out at me you black sonof abitch standing there rolling your eyes at me dont blame me cause im white and youre black that said she puckered her thin lips as if spitting or me then continued haughtily down the steps and through the park lane without changing her leisurely pace on one of those warm sunny october days in florence found myself wandering about the narrow streets of the old city keeping always within reasonable proximity to the puny arno so as not to get lost i went unnoticed over the cobblestones between gray and crumbling buildings for most italians had long since accustomed themselves to the presence of all shapes and sizes and colors of soldiers but when i emerged from a sunless thoroughfare we in america would call it an alley just at the base of the rambling and imposing stairway of the pitti palace i met a spunky little old lady who did notice me i had no idea of her age other than that she was beyond sixty she had not one tooth in her head and apparently had had none for a great many years but she had striking little blueblack eyes and an aggressive chin untidy and lustreless gray hair and a beaked nose like the ones all witches are supposed to have she was barely five feet tall and she wore a faded black sack of a frock which though not large was like a tent over her slight frame she flashed her charming toothless smile at me and irather ashamed at the moment of my strong set of natural foodgnashers smiled down at her she abruptly reached out her bronzed and bony right hand and took my left hand her strength was quite as surprising as this unexpected maneuver but not nearly so surprising as what she went on to do her other hand slid along the right side of my face and the rough fingers experimentally touched my lips all the time a stream of language poured forth from her throat in a low liquid tone but the only words i recognized were nero black and belli denti beautiful teeth then satisfied i was not an apparition she suddenly gripped me behind the neck and pulled me forward and downward and before i had time to think anything at all she kissed me dryly on the cheek and released me she stood there for a moment afterwards composed and smiling while i felt flushed and foolish when her hand moved toward me again i started but she merely gave my arm three very gentle pats and still smiling alluringly said arrivedici and glided resolutely down the dim alley of a street the average fan of marian anderson greeted with the rumor that she will retire this year reacts rather as if he had been told that the statue of liberty had decided to take a seat the singer draws a careful distinction between her announced farewell tour and retirement i have never said i would retire she explains all the announcements have carefully called this a farewell tour to retire means you put the lid on this and its finished but reactions to the news have given her great happiness i was leaving a store the other day with a package tucked under my arm and i heard this voice behind me saying yous quittiny i didnt turn around and it said again yous quittiny i looked and saw it was a sales girl not of my race this time she looked at me accusingly and said yous quittin you cant do that i know that you cant always sing but it is not like a faucet you can turn off and say this is it if it was many people would have found it easy to stop and not come back to make those endless series of farewell tours if you are not to be exclusively involved in singing one believes this is the way to do it not by giving a few less concerts each year until you finally give just one people keep asking you what you are going to do afterwards we thought one would like to work with children the idea is to be of service one does not want to sit and hold her hands it would be work for the young who cannot get help the world and people are so uncertain it is not easy to find foster homes when things are so uncertain so precarious but one thinks many people would take children if foster homes were explained to them in a different way this plan helps the doer and then the community and then the state and finally the whole government one cant be paid back it is a thing of the heart and of the soul miss anderson was sitting in the living room of the ranch house her architect husband built in the connecticut hills she was wearing a dress of navy blue chiffon with white polka dots and navy blue sneakers and may well be the only woman in the world who can somehow make sneakers elegant it is a fascinating thing in talking to her to find how aware one is forced to become of her eyes her face is strong and exquisitely modeled but over and over again the listener is made aware of her eyes dark liquid and infinitely expressive suddenly you know that whatever her own reason is for singing so often with her eyes closed it is just as well because if you watch these eloquent eyes you might find it difficult to hear the music and although the nature of her artistry has never made miss anderson noted for comical gifts she has for punctuation of a joke one of the best winks in the business perhaps her dedication to the fate of children was begun a few years ago when she went back to the philadelphia neighborhood where she grew up there were beautiful big brownstones now even the rooms were cut up you find two families living in one divided room a child or is taking care of the little ones while the parents work where do you suppose a childs mind is she cant wait for the day to get out of school for good we think a great deal is lost in not letting them be susceptible to the good things as well as the bad when you think of what one would like to do the area broadens all the time and you feel smaller and smaller and smaller we have not found yet the absolute niche in which one would hope to fit but it would be to help the young people in their teens and the young parents the older parents too if some sort of elevating entertainment could be arranged to find what they like and give them what makes them reach so many people wonder what they could do wonder what we could have done and didnt but you can t upbraid other people and you cant let others do it for you like peace it must begin in the heart and the soul the singer is well aware that this dream of hers is a matter for the future the tour of farewell this season opens next month in washington and will conclude easter sunday in new york but already there are requests from europe especially scandinavia where she made her first sensational successes and from south america there is also a proposal to sing in africa where she has never been she welcomes the idea of going back to places where she has sung before always with the hope that some day she may see something of the cities she whisked through so often it was a close miss arriving at six giving the concert and then away early the next morning one did not worry at the time but always felt one would come back you did not feel that the years were taking you with them then you realize youve been going along with them miss anderson takes apparent pleasure at this point of her career in recalling what her early hopes and ambitions were you see so many young people getting out of college rosy eyed the world is theirs and you wonder about years later how many will get what they wanted at a very early age i knew music took absolute precedence at the start even when music was soft it drowned out any conversation for me one of the first desires i remember was to go away and sing not to leave my family but to travel and most of all it was in geometry class where i was a poor student and always thought this is the day i want to be on a train going away i prayed to the evening stars to have concerts and go away and in high school i prayed to sing at the metropolitan with that company there there wasnt enough money to go when it came to philadelphia but once my teacher advised me to find out about tickets when they told me how much the price was i answered but i only want onev in agreeing that so often through her career her publicity has seemed impersonal the singer says one often talks of all the people who made this moment possible but then the selection is up to the reporter one has no control over it vehemently she recalls that it was utterly utterly hopeless to see mr hurok in new york when she first hoped to have him manage her and she likes to recount how by chance he finally came to hear her in paris we have never had a contract he would send me one but somehow i never signed it i would not advise this for other people but it has been our way that sentence ended with one of her best winks the history of the united states in the first half of this century will always be inextricably entwined with the career of marian anderson as a negro she endured many slights in the early days which undoubtedly accentuated her natural shyness but they could not have been more vividly counterbalanced than on that famous easter in when at the lincoln memorial she sang to people there is so much pride and joy in my people for the united states the only country they know there are all classes all kinds among negroes just like anyone else sometimes it is not thought that we think feel and see as others sometimes there are things unknown to a person who thinks he does not have prejudice a person in a strange place will look up and a frown comes on his forehead you say what your mission is but you generally dont know what to expect i was delivering something to an affair recently and in this hall a young woman looked up with furrows in her brow then someone said to her thats so and so then it was all right but you are not different after you are identified you are not taken at face value but you can only feel sorry for people who need these things to live on who havent found other things if one can be mean for any reason because a person is black or anything he can be mean to his own people if circumstances inspire it at home the singer is mrs orpheus fisher and she delights in telling how she arrived with her husband after the wedding and heard him announce to the servants loudly anybody who calls my wife miss anderson gets fired prominent in the living room of the house is a beautiful long low table with drawers in it cut down from a sideboard bar in mr fishers workshop i found it in the back of an antique shop miss anderson recalls i ran my finger along the edge of it and then around the end and my heart began to go bump bump bump i got it home but i told my young man before he saw it that if he didnt like it i would take it back he said darling its wonderful then i kept getting up in the middle of the night to see if it was still there miss anderson has recorded for publication this winter a collection of spirituals hall johnson has a whole storehouse of them that have never been heard of the seven we talked about i had never even heard of five of them before a strong believer in the powers of affection the singer likes to tell of a friend who took a rose from her garden this new rose was given our name and a friend of mine took a bud in her car to new york and it drooped but she cared and restored it and it was as erect as can be so many things respond to the tiniest touch of consideration or love the recognition that you or it exists like a swelling theme the singer returns with her classic calm to the subject of prejudice you may think you know whats in anothers head but you dont if a man has an intelligent reason theres nothing wrong with him not liking one negro or all negroes but not if he does not have an intelligent reason you can put a stigma on a person so easily you can say theres a dangerous dog but remember that maybe the person he bit was someone who hit him aperusal of recent studies reveals some curious facts about the way negroes spend iheir money they were found to splurge in certain spheres in a pathetic effortsome authors believeto compensate for white contempt while there is not much new about that hypothesis some of the elements of negro spending when compared to whites at the same income levels are interesting enough to warrant close inspection take for example the negros special devotion to clothing particularly their preoccupation with hats and shoes negroes buy dress shoes almost twice as frequently as whites the new york times reports a survey of neighborhood stores conducted by jack schwartz a social science research analyst for the united states information agency found hats and shoes more frequently exhibited to negroes and more frequently placed in ebony advertisements than in life however i do not accept in full schwartzs explanation that negroes buy hats and shoes in a way to conceal their personal characteristics such as long narrow shoes for thick chubby feet and hats to hide the texture of their hair although this is done sometimes in an effort to approximate the frail characteristics of the white ideal i believe that the basic explanation rests in a cultural pattern whose roots reach back to slavery negro slaves were often compelled to go without shoes even in winter and without hats under the hot summer sun according to accounts by ullrich phillips in american negro slavery and the testimony of my late paternal grandmother who was a slave child in tennessee negroes accordingly came to overvalue these apparels as indicated by the songs they sang they sang in their fantasies that all gods chilluns had shoes and were going to put them on when we got to heaven anyway slaves in general were sick of wearing only handmedown clothes from white masters and their families and placed a high value on the possession of personal clothing but the fixation of todays urban negro on clothing has some subtle sociopsychological foundations thorsten veblen theory of the leisure class describing the antics of the white leisure class of a generation or more agowhich the negro particularly the upper class is just now emulatingpointed out that clothing gained a special significance in the city in the small rural communities from which most big city negroes have migrated everybody knew how many suits you owned and whether you ordered them from montgomery wards or spiegels and what price you paid as well as your general socioeconomic status so it was useless to put on a front but in the anonymity of the city to which negroes have more suddenly and extensively been exposed the strangers one encounters on the bus and the subway do not know ones true status thus the need to spotlight position by attire veblen also observed that the practice of creasing pants and shining shoes arose because of the need for leisure class individuals to show that they were free from work working class persons began to emulate them pretending themselves when possible to be free from work since one could not have done manual labor and kept shoes shined and pants creased during my days as a dishwasher busboy and factory laborer i observed some persons wearing their dress suits to work and leaving them in the locker while they changed over to work shoes and clothes one individual even carried a brief case so that people on public vehicles would think he was a lawyer all of this is to say that a negro dressed in a hat and fancy shoes is obviously not a laborer this condition occurs so seldom that he desires to spotlight it when he can add to this the fact that negroes are more likely to have a rural background where they grew accustomed to walking more and to wearing out their shoes by more walking the resulting corns may cause them to pay more attention to the quality of their shoes hats however cannot be readily rationalized except as stated above in general negroes appear to buy what they want instead of what they need or as one oldtimer put it they buy what they want and borrow what they need they devote a smaller share of their budget to medical care for example despite a greater exposure to accidents and ill health it is pathetic to watch some children with correctable defects in the negro ghetto neglected in the matter of medical attention by parents who spend the money on other things one of the most interesting areas of negro consumption is food in spite of the popular belief that the best way to attract a negro is with food negroes spend a smaller proportion of their income on food than do whites at the same income levels it may well be that negroes seeking to make amends for conspicuous consumption in other spheres cut back on food intake or its quality i have known more than one individual to rely on a diet such as oatmeal or bananas three meals a day while paying for an expensive car true part of the difference in food expenditures is explained says marcus alexis writing in the american journal of economics and sociology by the fact that many negroes work as domestics and in restaurants and hotels where they get some of their meals free but this does not seem sufficient to account for all of the difference of the foods negroes do purchase they spend less for protein foods milk cheese vegetables and fruits than white families at the same income levels nor is it necessarily true as white farmers in the south sometimes say that a nigger and a mule can get along on next to nothing rather we may again trace the practice back to slavery and the southern plantation where negroes were conditioned to rely on the leftovers this gave rise to their taste for chitterlings pig feet pig snouts pig ears pig tails hog maws neckbones chicken feet chicken necks gizzards and greens many varieties of which they could pick growing wild in the fields and by the roadside besides food is consumed in the privacy of the home where others have no knowledge of it and so its status value is more deceptive there are however periodically planned dinners where some showingoff can be done also when company is present special meals typically including a surplus of meats are prepared in the pretense of eating better than is actually the case coming down to certain luxuries including personal care ointments hair pomade creams etc recreation and liquor most studies show negroes spending a greater proportion of their income than whites at the same income levels part of the devotion to personal care especially hair straighteners and the like has been said by observers to represent a desire to approximate white standards of beauty while this is sadly true to some degree we must again consider that while these practices may have been initiated for that reason they have now come to represent a cultural norm personal care also may have taken on special interest to negroes because in the days of slavery they were denied such commodities as storebought lotions for which they used grease scum from the dishpan hair preparations using instead grease fat or shortening and tooth powder for which they used ashes and baking soda contrary to popular fallacy however studies show negroes owning cars less frequently than whites but just because fewer negroes own cars does not mean that those who own them are not prejudiced in favor of the more expensive models also in the case of cars they must compete headon with whites who too have a fetish for fine cars in fact there is sometimes a kind of rivalry between the races many negroes have boasted of driving down south in a big car and watching the white folks eyes bulge the late prof e franklin frazier in black bourgeoisie found negro physicians who would not attend their supposedly scientific meetings because they did not have a cadillac or an expensive car certainly cars can be flaunted before others better than household furnishings and equipment which can be seen only by household visitors thus in some localities especially where there is a great tendency toward furnished apartments negroes spend slightly less on household furnishings this is not necessarily true of the upper classes however melvin tolson the poet has observed that jews will go into business and live in the back staying there for years while building up the business a negro too whenever he goes into business may live in the back but as soon as he makes a profit his wife is likely to lead him to throw up a big house filled with scandinavian modern aborigine furniture instead of a bigger business then he parks beside the house a car longer than the house is wide fraziers observations in black bourgeoisie would seem to bear out tolsons contention restrictions on negro recreation and his shorter time off from work might lead one to expect that he would spend less on recreation but this is not the case unless reading and educational endeavors are included in the calculations the answer i think lies in the fact that recreation is recuperation from the drudgery of work which besets negroes more stringently than whites just as negroes according to vance packard in the status seekers spend twice as much for liquor to lift their spirits they also resort to recreation for this motive frazier suggested that negroes also play a lot in the effort to get whites to take them seriously much of the negros expenditures on recreation in any case consist of money paid by the black bourgeoisie for social responsibilities we may conclude then that no single factor is responsible alone for the negros expenditures rather there are a combination of factors some more important than others they may be summarized as the desire for social status denied them in a white society the desire for social acceptance especially acceptance by whites and the negros special social circumstances let us take them up one by one and determine their relative impact because of the negros compensatory need to clamor for status advertisers who must be aware of such matters in order to be effective more frequently appeal to status when addressing negroes a pittsburgh courier survey of housewives found negroes highly brandconscious with a special preference for higherpriced brands the american journal of economics and sociology reports a predilection on the part of negroes for shopping at higher priced stores especially stores from which they were formerly excluded i have watched some negro women shoppers in the more exclusive downtown stores some were observed to duck in an exclusive store first to buy a shopping bag bearing the exclusive name then head straight for the cheap sales others sneak down to bargain basements and fill their bags with goods hopefully without being spotted by anyone of their acquaintance if caught there by friends they may pretend that they had meant to get off the elevator on the mezzanine or were in search of the restroom women in the upper class have been observed to place their coats on the backs of chairs in a way to exhibit expensive labels others in small gatherings pretend that their feet are hurting and kick their shoes partly off to reveal expensive brands still others will lie about where they bought their new furniture and their dime store jewelry a study of lowincome families in new york david caplovitz the consumer behavior of low income families found negroes twice as likely to buy high priced television sets three times as likely to buy phonographs costing or more and twice as likely to buy washing machines at or more than lowincome white families a new york times report also reveals the negros quest for status in his purchases there is evidence also that negroes in the effort to make their swift transition from the personal friendship of the rural community to the impersonal nature of the metropolis seek fellowship and social acceptance in their buying activities prof joseph t johnson of lincoln university missouri in the negro potential has observed that cosmetics used to improve personal appearance and identifying property such as clothing both of which negroes spend more on may be used to make oneself more socially acceptable white salesmen have discovered the use of mr and miss when addressing negroes particularly in the south to be especially effective as a gimmick other negroes are swayed by the fleeting approval of a white clerks superficial smile a study of low income families in new york found that negroes were three times as likely to buy from doortodoor peddlers that they cherish this facetoface contact as compensation for metropolitan impersonality is borne out by the fact that the likelihood of buying from peddlers lessened with length of residence in the city the same study showed whites doing slightly more creditbuying from large impersonal department stores and discount chains and negroes four times as likely as low income whites to buy on credit from neighborhood dealers a study reported by john harp in the american journal of economics and sociology found migrants less likely to buy from chains and more likely to patronize neighborhood stores than in the case of urban born residents negroes however show a greater tendency to buy outside their neighborhoods or generally in white neighborhoods one marketing research agency found them especially likely to buy in the suburbs where they cant live in doing so they are seeking escape and respite from their own areas and acceptance on an equal plane with whites one member of a secret society conventioning in detroit when asked whether he had met discrimination there replied that he was too busy spending money to be discriminated against such negroes feel that they can buy their way through the wall of segregation can purchase white acceptance they are bellbent on proving that they are just as good by god as whites or more pathetically that they are in fact not even different from whites since they have few occupations of prestige they concentrate on consumption as a symbol of status they are dedicated to the proposition that all money anyway is created equal the ability to pay money becomes the only proof to whites that they are not inferior upper class negro women try to outshine whites at integrated gatherings boasting later of having stolen the show by virtue of their attire others get mad when store clerks suggest a darker shade of face powder a red item of clothing or a larger shoe in this regard negro market experts have advised white advertisers to use an integrated approach one went so far as to recommend that advertising be worded in such a way that no reference is made to race as for negro customers an ebony magazine study during the early fifties of families asked negro customers the question some readers of ebony prefer negroes in the advertising picture others prefer whites in the advertising picture how do you feel about this less than half of the negroes preferred negroes the new york times recently reported that the use of negro models in ads repels some negroes just as many are repulsed by colored dolls for their children when a store in chicagos south side negro section put in colored mannequins business fell off further proof of the pursuit of white acceptance in buying is the fact that a house in a middle class white neighborhood carries more status than a house of the same quality in an uppermiddle class negro area similarly an apartment in an integrated building has more prestige than otherwise would be the case although such negroes will claim to be motivated merely by a desire to advance the race this is not alone the case many are angered and resentful when other negroes move in and friends left behind in allnegro buildings will predict and secretly hope that the whites in the newly integrated building will soon move out this does not mean however that all negro splurging is due to their special quest for status and acceptance many are newcomers to the city anxious to lose their rural identities but unskilled in meeting easycredit lures and overcharging lowincome negroes are more than twice as likely as whites at the same income level to buy on credit credit not only allows them to purchase the goods they want it also gives a stamp of approval to them as customers as migrants to the city and frequent movers within the city they are uprooted and have few other outlets for social approval their occupations generally put them in a low class position and having little prestige on the job they are led to compensate in other ways among which is spending also women in the negro family have a greater control over the purse strings by virtue of their employment and historical position see the frustrated masculinity of the negro male negro digest august this could help to skew negro spending in spite of all of the foregoing negroes are still too poor to be real spendthrifts as myrdal an american dilemma quickly realized in his studies negro income is barely more than half that of whites but this simply makes it all the more important that they spend wisely the money they do have the roots of racism virtually all analj yses of racial and re y p ligious hostilities are childishly naive and run away from the very problem to be solved by all sorts of vehement namecalling and outbursts of indignation accordingly any report of a lynching is told in terms of stark melodrama as simple and uncomplicated as a movie western the villains of the dramathe whites naturallyare the bad men the heroesthe innocent negro victimsare the good men lynchers then are just a bunch of hoodlums bums loafers and hooligans if only some way could be found to throw all these bad men in jail there wouldnt be any more lynchings the causes of the white mans cruelty to his negro fellow americans are various and manifold and it would require an analysis of all the complex historical sociological economic political and ethnic factors to understand a problem of such scope and immensity but however multitudinous and complex the psychological factors outweigh all the others combined the fundamental psychological cause of the white americans contempt for the negroes is his unconscious need to project his own inferiority and guilt upon another people unless this basic phenomenon is properly understood then the hundreds of books written about better interracial relations and the millions of words spoken by men of good will in lectures and sermons will continue to be of no avail when the psychological basis underlying the white mans cruelty to the negro is really comprehended then for the first time it will be seen that the men who participate in the mutilation and murder of their negro brethren are not necessarily all hoodlums and hooligans they are for the most part men like you and me and our neighbors differing from us principally in one respect you and i and our neighbors not subject to the same historical social and economic pressures as the southern lynchers have found less violent means of relieving the unbearable tensions of our feelings of inferiority and guilt very few persons in our society are so blessed or gifted or fortunate as to be free of feelings or inferiority and inadequacy unworthiness and guilt indeed so central is the torment of guilt in the western world that two ancient religious faiths judaism and catholicism have formally institutionalized the feeling of mans selfabasement the jews in yom kippur the high holy day of repentance for sins the catholics in confession the sacrament of penance and as if the consciousness of guilt and inferiority were not already sufficient to plague most people this sorely disturbing feeling is deepened with the passing of every day except for those rare paragons of beauty and grace who walk the earth in every generation the overwhelming mass of men and women spend their lives in quiet desperation regretting that their bodies and faces their talents and accomplishments their worth and achievements are so many millions of lightyears distant from their hearts desire how pitiably small a number of men can regard themselves in the words of the psalmist as a little lower than the angels and crowned with glory and honour and of the three thousand million inhabitants of this earth what an infinitesimally small fraction thereof would merit ophelias growing description of hamlet o what a noble mind is here the courtiers soldiers scholars eye tongue sword the expectancy and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form through the strange and diabolical workings of the dynamics of projection we unconsciously seek relief from tensions of inferiority and guilt by ascribing to others the ugly traits and base motives that persistently trouble us with our own sense of unworthiness for the more contemptible we imagine others to be the less contemptible we then appear to ourselves that is why no one is so ready to condemn others as the guilty and the greater their own sense of guilt the louder and more vehement their condemnation of others all that modem psychology has discovered about the readiness of the guilty to condemn their fellowmen was foreshadowed in the deeply moving episode of the eighth chapter of st john wherein the woman taken in adultery was brought before jesus the benign admonition of jesus to the womans captors men bristling with righteous indignation has resounded down the corridors of time through nineteen hundred years resounded alas for the most part to deaf ears he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her in the light of the eighth chapter of st john and in the light of everything that modern psychology has learned about the mechanism of projection there is much truth in the epigram righteous indignation is being mistaken at the top of your voice how few of us suspect that even in our moments of ease when we are enjoying certain types of alleged humor we are unconsciously relievingby means of projection own feelings of inferiority take a blackface comedian the stereotyped negro comic so familiar to radio television and vaudeville audiences sambo is a lowdown noaccount lazy shiftless goodfornothing nigger addicted besides to chickenstealing crapshooting wifebeating and drinking how the audience laughs shrieks and guffaws every time sambo opens his mouth and gives fresh evidence of his dumbness his shiftlessness his nogood laziness his dishonesty why does the spectacle of such inferiority in a fellowhuman being amuse the audience the audiences laughterthe audible evidence of their unconcious feeling of relief from the tensions of unworthiness and guilt arises from their ability to project all their inferiority upon the negro buffoon before them for the black comic is an exaggerated stereotype a magnified abstraction embodying many of the contemptible traits that make us squirm with a sense of our own degradation hardly a man or woman alive is free of some taint of laziness hardly a one of us but is sometimes assailed with selfdoubts and bad conscience because of our lapses from aggressiveness and drive ambition and farsightedness and thrift virtues so insistently inculcated and so highly prized by an acquisitive society and so cavalierly disregarded by the dirty lazy nogood sambo so we laugh at the black clown in his loud checked suit the seat of the pants conspicuously patched and as we go into hysterics at his dumb remarks we unconsciously puff up with a proud feeling of identification with all the forces of white dignity and respectability white aggressiveness and energy and probity and we cast out from ourselves and heap upon sambo all our own faults and sins so greatly magnified in him but in the southern states with their huge negro populations and where negroes consequently are always close at hand the whites have no need for the stage and television to remind them of the inferior blacks inasmuch as the need to project is in direct ratio to the intensity and oppressiveness of ones own feeling of inferiority it follows that hostility toward the negro attains its extreme among poor southern whites the abject poverty of these people the wretched shacks they call their homes lacking the barest minimum of sanitary requirements drinking water and slops of privies being in intimate proximity their ignorance and illiteracy their malnutrition their inability to afford the barest medical care their more or less chronic infection with hookworm trichinae and other parasitic disease organisms finally their utter rejection by the upperclass whites is it any wonder that these poor souls the white trash cringe with a sense of their boundless inferiority but no their inferiority is not boundless it hasglory be definite limits and clearly marked bounds a white man in the south can sink only so low and no lower his feet can never quite touch the miry bottom of the slough of despond long before he sinks down into the dank slime of the nethermost depths his feet rest safely atop the black woolly heads of the negroes the poor southern white no matter how depressed and dejected has only to look about him and seeing the lowly negro experience a sudden elevation to dizzy heights of superiority from which lofty eminence he can now with lordly disdain look down upon the dirty niggers opportunities for such heady flights of soulsatisfying superiority are not wanting in his daily environment he boards a streetcar and cannot fail but observe that the last several rowsthe jim crow sectionare reserved for negro passengers especially unctious to the white mans ego is the spectacle of negroes standing after all the jim crow seats are occupied even though there may be any number of unoccupied seats in the white section for only at the imminent risk to life and limb would a negro passenger dare take a seat in the sacrosanct white section the poor white now glows with a sense of high status an expansive and heartwarming feeling of identification with the great master race the ruling class the lords of the earth the freeborn native white americans the poor southern white experiences the same heartswelling pride when he is in a bus station or a railway depot as he notes the two separate waiting rooms one for whites and one for colored and four separate toilet rooms all clearlyand with what a world of significancemarked womenwhite womencolored menwhite mencolored if only the dynamics of relief ended with the white mans renewed sense of elation in being thus reminded of his superiority and his renewed feeling of identification with the master race there would then be nothing too especially harmful about his preening and strutting but always accompanying the elation of supposed superiority over the blacks is a renewed and intensified contempt for them the projection of all the white mans inferiority and guiltupon the negroes thus unconsciously making use of the dynamics of projection the whites project their body odors and smells upon the other race by calling them stinking niggers their indolence by calling them lazy goodfornothing coons their physical and mental uncleanliness by calling them dirty niggers their colossal ignorance by calling them dumb boogies the extreme in the dynamics of projection is attained in lynching a white woman has been found raped and murdered a young negro suspect has been apprehended and thrown into the county jail awaiting trial the whole countryside is seething in a ferment of fear anger vengeance whoever the murderer may beand hour by hour as the mass hysteria grows all are convinced without proof that the imprisoned negro is guilty becomes the common object of the peoples mass projection of guilt every man in the community sorely troubled with feelings of sexual guilt since first as a little boy he was discovered in the act of masturbation many of the men afflicted with bad consciences as they recall their countless fornications and adulteries some of their carnalities reeking with the taint of incest some of the men troubled with the memory of even more secret sinister and forbidden lusts how cleansing and purifying to cast out of their hearts all the accumulated filth and sins of a lifetime and hurl them down the dirty lowdown nigger murderer this spiritual cleansing and purification imbues the whites with a high sense of dedication to the protection of white american womanhood and the duty to guard their chastity and to avenge to the death their ravagers and despoilers mass hysteria convinces the lynchers of the precedence of the higher unwritten law over the poltroonish delays and legalistic technicalities of slow judicial process and the sacred right that sanctions any redblooded mans taking the law in his own hands a tidal wave of chivalric zeal and religious ecstasy engulfs the whole mass of men now inspired and exalted with a sense of high dedication to avenge outraged virtue the excitement and elation of their holy mission at last brings to an end talk and unmanly argument and the avengers are swept on an irrepressible floodtide of direct action the jail is stormed sheriff warden and jailers are all swept aside like straws in a windstorm the cell is broken open the negro dragged out into the night screaming under the blows of his captors and now before the curtain descends on the final act of the bloody tragedy while the dry faggots are being enkindled for the negros purification by fire one final opportunity presents itself to the white executioners to cast out from themselves yet one more gallmg inferiority and cast it upon their live human sacrifice their burntoffering many of these men have been sorely disturbeddisturbed since boyhood enviously and jealouslyby the oftrepeated and wideeyed accounts of the negroes fabulous endowment with the physical attributes of masculinity their herculean virility their prodigious sexual potencymore like a stallions than a mans and so for all the white mans contempt for the negroes there always remained one area of lifethe incomparably important area of sex in which the white man could never with any real show of conviction boast superiority over the blacks but on the contrary if all the stories and legends were true had to admit of a crushing and humiliating inferiority the roar of the flames the crackling of the drywood the terrorstricken shrieks of the negro youth mingled with the affrighted cries of the birds and animals of the woods the visceral sounds of retching and vomiting of bystanders sickened by the savage spectacle the yellow and orange and crimson flames casting their unholy glow over the ghastly scene the champions of virtue are now emboldened to yet one final act of bloody cruelty which only their dedication to a holy cause could give them the fortitude to carry through once more they seize the black boy and with a crude jackknife or a razor or whatever instrument is at hand they mutilate and castrate the negro expiating his sinand all their own sexual sinsby cutting off the offending penis as the hot flames sear the negros naked and bleeding body and now to the unholy sights and macabre sounds of the hellish nightmare is added the acrid smell of burning living flesh and hair the avengers experience a thrilling feeling of ultimate purification the heavy burden of all their sins mercifully lifted from them the unsupportable weight of all their transgressions blessedly lightened their exaltation springs from a new sense of superioritynow for the first time complete superiority over the negroes the score is now settled the galling disparity is evened the cruel wound to their masculine pride is healed as they now contemplate the dying negro youth castrated and emasculated wjohn conyers jr w was elected to last fall congress from detroits newly appor e r the statisticians had a field day not only did his election mark the first time since reconstruction that two negroes from one state would sit in the house of representatives but it marked the first time in history that two negroes from a single northern city would represent their state in the congress of the united states that detroit should be the city having this distinction seemed surprising to many observers who knowing that both chicago and new york have much larger negro populations expected eitheror bothof those cities to elect a second negro congressman long before detroit however for those familiar with the special historical circumstances of the development of the detroit negro community the historymaking election of conyers was taken in stride outside observers hastened to credit the united union litical negro motor cars presence of the giant automobile workers uawcio for astuteness of the the podetroit community making of course is the chief detroit and generaon the politics business of tions have been nurtured industrys prosperity and men like alex fuller horace sheffield and nelson jack edwards for instance are hi h in the councils of labor and their influence certainly reaches into city hall and the state house at lansing but the rise to eminence of young congressman conyers with due respect for the support provided by the strong labor faction in the city can scarcely be explained simply in terms of labor influence conyers as a matter of fact is only one of an astonishing array of bright young detroiters who have gone to washington in recent years to help run the nations affairs and while conyers and his older colleague charles c diggs made the journey by way of the ballot box the others went to the capitol as available resources in the governments draft of the best talent obtainable indeed detroit is represented by more able and experienced young negro men in responsible government positions than any other major city in the country and significantly not more than one or two of these young men has a direct labor union background although it is altogether possible that some of them may have toiled at times on the assembly lines in the generation of most of these men the auto plants replaced the pullman cars as the interim place of employment on the road to the university degree it is true that conyers father is a uaw international representative and that young conyers had the support of uaw executive board member nelson jack edwards but then conyers opponent also had powerful labor support in the name of uaw official horace sheffield and the the citys strategic position on the underground railroad made it a sanctuary for negroes early in the nineteenth century and many of the slaves who had set out for canada found permanent refuge on the michigan side of the detroit river still the presence of canada and unlimited freedom only a few moments away added to their sense of security even when slave agents arrived from the south scouring the area for runaways the community prospered achieved a remarkable degree of social and political integration and produced a number of distinguished business and professional men who in restrospect seem all but astounding when john brown came recruiting guerillas for his excursion at harpers ferry he found well organized support from negro communities on both sides of the river long before world war ii and the era of highly publicized negro firsts in public and private life negroes were integrated into the economic and political life of the city negro lawyers had offices in downtown buildings a negro served as manager of what is now the citys largest department store j l hudson and a negro handled the finances for the entire county area some of the citys wealthiest negroes have doctor or dentist forbears who served almost exclusively white clienteles and invested their money in property rented to immigrant families pouring into the city from germany poland and italy the negro families from the south found a stable proudeven prosperous negro community when they arrived to take jobs in the factories before during and after world war i the old community proved a good model and the new arrivals put to excellent use the aday henry ford was paying they bought homes sent their children to college and took active roles in community development by the time world war ii exploded detroit had the largest percentage of negro home owners of any city in the north and one of the most solidly based middle classes important number of home owners fact that these homes were not all concentrated into a single corner of the city detroit negroes lived a pattern of corruption did not become allpervasive as it is for example in chicago the independence of the detroit negro in politics is but a reflection of the spirit of confidence and determination which generally animates the citys negro community racial barriers exist in detroit and always have but the citys negroes have not been thwarted by them they have if anything become more unified and sophisticated because of them when for example local impresarios refused to bring negro musical artists to the city schoolmarm nellie watts sponsored their appearance herself the nellie watts concert series under whose auspices the great marian anderson first sang in the city is a detroit institution when the larger community refused or failed to promote significant operatic opportunities soprano celeste cole founded an interracial opera company which continues to discover and train operatic talent these are only examples the cotillion club a civic improvement organization of young business and professional men is only one of several community groups through which the citys leaders influence the life of the total community the cotillion club did much to overshadow the citys postworld war ii reputation for ostentatious society wingdings by instituting an annual cotillion during which the honored debutantes were young women of exceptional character and scholarship rather than the daughters of the socially prominent the club serves also as watchdog over the local government for decades men like the late fred hart williams scion of an old detroit family and a veteran civil servant urged young negroes to take an interest in their history and partly because of him detroit has one of the oldest and most active chapters of the association for the study of negro life and history the city also had for many years the largest branch of the national association for the advancement of colored people detroit negroes have race pride without the insidious sense of inferiority which often goes along with it and here again the citys development helps to explain that partly because of the unionsand negro strength in themracial segregation and favoritism have been far less frequent in the factories of detroit than those of any other city negroes and whites worked side by side and in many cases shared the same schools and neighborhoods and it was difficult under these circumstances for whites to assume superiority simeon booker chief of the washington bureau of the johnson publishing company says of the detroiters in washington that they are as a group the most selfassured and generally effective negroes in the nations capital they are absolutely comfortable around whites he says they have transplanted their political prowess gained from michigan and are using it to give negroes new muscle on the national scene and helping the civil_rights movement far more than their more talkative counterparts booker also says that in washington detroit negroes continue the easy relationships with their white colleagues and consequently gain support for their views and projects they think big he says they are not merely trying to enrich themselves they aim for policymaking levels and establish themselves they are obviously able to compete in the market place and they seldom squawk about local segregationnot because they accept it but because they are busy getting into a position to do something about it perhaps of the personable crop of detroiters now working in washington the one with the most extensive labor background is william b gould and his association with labor came primarily after his basic preparation for employment in that field at one of the youngest of the d c contingent and characterized by one observer as probably the most brilliant gould is attorney advisor to the national labor relations board a post to which he brings exceptional background and experience he is a law graduate from cornell university he did graduate study at the london england school of economics and formerly served as assistant general counsel to the uaw the backgrounds of most of the other detroiters with highlevel federal posts are equally impressive congressman charles c diggs jr a graduate of the university of michigan at ann arbor is a former state senator as was his father before winning election in as michigans first negro congressman he was also head of his familys huge mortuary and allied enterprises the largest complex of its kind in the state he brought with him to washington valuable administrative experience william t patrick jr the first and only negro member of the ninemember city council until his resignation in is possibly the only negro to serve the government as a layear executive on loan from private industry patrick a fine lawyer with an impeccable record of achievement and service in detroit reluctantly left the detroit common council whose members are elected at large thus minimizing the chances for a negro candidate to accept a post with the michigan bell telephone company as assistant general counsel his chore in washington was to assist r sargent shriver in planning the administrations antipoverty program leon m wallace who went to washington as assistant to the administrator of veterans affairs is now director of insurance service for the veterans administration a job in which he supervises more funds than major insurance firms in the nation a man known for both diligence and integrity he is preparing for even greater responsibilities by studying evenings at a washington university the detroit executive closest to the administration is hobart taylor jr who was associate white house counsel before taking the job as executive vice chairman of the presidents committee on equal employment opportunities a native texan and son of a veteran houston politician taylor is a graduate of the university of michigan law school with a distinguished record as a private and public attorney in detroit he was brought into the kennedy administration by then vice president johnson and moved up with his champion william sebrons job as the secretary of agricultures assistant for civil_rights coordination reportedly is one of the toughest and most thankless positions in government he went to washington from a job as deputy director of the michigan fair employment practices commission for years he served the city as one of the ablest urban league aides one of the handful of detroiters whose presence in washington predates the current administration edward sylvester jr is deputy administrator of the bureau of labor affairs for the department of labor he first went to washington in as a member of the national staff of senator stuart symington and the democratic national committee and was appointed assistant to assistant secretary of labor george l p weaver in a graduate engineer sylvester in pioneered in forming the first commercial lumber company in the interior of liberia the liberianamerican enterprises inc john w roxborough ii like edward sylvester jr was in washington prior to the johnson administration serving under the late john foster dulles as attorney advisor for the state department from to he now holds a similar post for the private enterprise section of the general council of the agency for international development aid in the interim roxborough held posts under the u s commission on civil_rights in detroit he was special assistant attorney general broadus n butler assistant to the u s commissioner of education took leave from his job as assistant to the dean of the wayne state university college of liberal arts for a year in washington an unstinting participant in community and educational improvement projects dr butler is a model example of the citizen as public servant he is a member of some civicoriented boards commissions and organizations and active in all of them and a prime mover in the efforts to interest detroiters in negro and african history he holds ma and phd degrees from the university of michigan mark battle acting assistant director for field operations of the department of labors neighborhood youth corps gained a reputation as a highly effective youth worker at detroits franklin settlement then went on to repeat his success at similar jobs in cleveland and chicago he served as a special consultant on youth employment before assuming his present post a key job in one of the largest programs of the antipoverty war charles j wartman is chief of the standardization branch of the office of assistant director of the civil defense plans and operations a former college instructor virginia state college he was a longtime executive editor of detroits foremost negro newspaper the michigan chronicle and a confidante to some of the states most influential labor and political leaders while certainly no bright young man mrs esther lamarr should be included in any rundown on youthful detroiters holding important jobs in washington a wellknown social and civic worker in the city she was called to her present job as special assistant to the veterans administration administrator from her city niche with the mayors commission on children and youth other distaff detroiters who should be cited are mrs ruth dailey brooks former assistant to michigans senator philip hart and now staff assistant for the senate subcommittee on refugees under mississippi senator james o eastlands judiciary committee and dorothy quarker longtime aide to representative charles c diggs and operator of a sort of unofficial communications center for the detroiters in washington one of the youngest of the detroiters in washington is ofield dukes able journalist who works as assistant director of information in charge of office operations for the presidents committee on equal employment opportunities a former newsman at the michigan chronicle and writer for the negroowned radio station wchb dukes also takes seriously his citizenship responsibilities frequently returns to detroit to speak to audiences about new opportunities for negroes and the need for education to take advantage of them there are of course other detroiters holding important jobs in washington such as charles smith member of a family prominent in county government and an employee of the defense department and kermit bailer assistant administrator for community programs in the housing and home finance agency some have since returned to the city like dr karl gregory who was an economist with the budget bureau but now teaches at wayne state university they all brought with them a sense of assurance and especially a sophistication relative to race relations whichin the words of simeon

sometimes when i looks at my house an my diamont ring i cant help but remember miss lucy she was a good woman and sometimes i believe if it wasnt for segregation she woulda been gooder there are times when i cant remember ever not being involved in civil_rights however i know that at one time i felt i could best help by living my own life quietly and showing others that sure enough equality was a state of mind or some unexplainable hypothesis i recall hearing of differences the need for minorities to be separate suppression the only answer and so forth i can even remember staring hard at peoples faces and watching their every move to try and discover this dramatic thing that adults would term different odd etc it wasnt until my teens that i discovered it wasnt so much a facial expression or movement or physical oddity but that it was color and even sometimes ideals or religion discovering what my elders had preached to be in conflict with what i believed i found the only recourse in active participation in civil_rights now i realize that i was almost totally ignorant of the meaning of civil_rights and the struggle being waged today in my midtwenties i find myself looking back and being ashamed at the surface structure of my thinking which allowed me to look pained whenever i heard the all too familiar why some of my best friends are negroes but it had always seemed so clear to me that all we had to do in order to win was to simply make whites realize how unamerican they were acting it wasnt until one afternoon in a civil_rights organizations office that part of the depth to which the last several hundred years has plunged this country was revealed to me several young negro members were standing around talking one of the men was saying why hell man even some of my friends are white shortly after this i attended a small dinner party in one of our predominately negro neighborhoods the hostess asked if somebody would walk to the store for a loaf of bread it was a warm night a slight breeze stirred the papers in the street and it was a good night for walking on leaving the store i noticed a pickup truck with four or five negro men in the back and two men and a woman in the front they started to follow right behind me finally one of the men threw a paper bag and shouted whitey get out of our neighborhood the rest of the men picked up his call and soon i felt something pass my head within a second there was stabbing pain in my legs as a wine bottle smashed sending slivers of glass deep into my skin the men kept shouting hey white girl get out before we show how good black men really are the woman leaned out and started screaming leave our men alone white trash one of the men threw another wine bottle and it smashed against the building splattering glass in all directions just as i reached the entrance to my friends home a man jumped out of the back of the truck and cornered me in the entrance way the rest is rather lost in vague hysterical half memories there was a great deal of confusion however i remember the husband of the girl we had come to see pushing my date back and telling him to stay out of it youre white and will only make it worse joan of arci used to play her well carrying the torch of freedom to the oppressed and how sick and confused when forced to accept the realization that the hundreds of years of degradation suppression and denial had left a very real very ugly very white reflecting scar i found that my banner was not always received with cheers but could and was subject to being spat on spat on because of color spat on because i was white many negroes have told me repeatedly that due to the fact i am white it is impossible for me to have a conception of the position of the negro in our country perhaps this in part is true but almost any civil_rights worker black or white has been subjected to job pressures has been asked to move when it was found out that he associated with were seen with or knew someone who was labeled undesirable families have disowned refused to tolerate even refused to talk to their children who find they have a need to fight for what they believe to be right one girl i know has had her mother walk past her downtown looking straight ahead with no sign of recognition at one time i withdrew from any active participation having my selfmade white joan of arc image shattered finding i was not immune to prejudices and injustices and finding the constant assumptions of whites and negroes almost intolerable by assumptions i mean the forever present filth that seems to exist in some peoples minds here is an example during a dinner break one evening following a lengthy meeting one of the negro leaders and i went out to eat he excused himself for a few minutes and while he was gone a white man came over to the table and after a rather uncomplimentary opening explained in emphatic terms why no selfrespecting white man would ever touch me the meeting was being held on the edge of the negro ghetto and on our way back we passed several negro men lounging against a building they started taunting my companion and myself asking prices and saying other insulting things one man grabbed my arm and asked what was wrong with him for a stud after all he was the right color for my tastes also ive been asked by both negroes and whites the question who meaning men is really the best after all you associate with both you should know my period of withdrawal lasted almost a year but i am again active in civil_rights however it seems that during the time i was away i was able to gain perspective and a true evaluation of my own beliefs and a deeper knowledge that it would take more than tauntsindeed more than learning that spite exists in all racesto ever make me give up again understandably the years of injustice are a reason for many negroes having learned to hate whites but it is frightening to know that too many of us are blind and feel that once we conquer the largest battle white oppression that everything will be american there is a deep sense of shame when i read or see or experience bigotry for it is a mirror through which many negroes judge and cast their own reflections and these reflections are just as hateful just as full of waste the white battlefield is by far the largest and the most important but this well of intolerance that has been built up in negroes cannot be forgotten we cannot turn away but must accept that two battlefields actually exist one white the other black for what will it have gained us at last when picket lines for human rights will no longer be needed if the negro brings with him to the equality so long overdue the ugly reflection of the whites will the negro bring compassion and understandingor hate and oppression and spite then too i am troubled by what seems like almost insurmountable apathy in some negroes for work in their own behalf today i am serving on two committees that have had active programs to get negroes to join several negroes have joined in the past but they either do not attend the meetings or else withdraw from the organization all together why the majority of the executive staff is negro but try as we will we cannot get negroes to stick with these two committees the committees are open consequently to charges of white power structure trying to take over etc the greatest lack seems to be negro women especially in the various northern organizations i have served with so few negro women seem to take an active daytoday part in the struggle picket lines are needed but there are the evercurrent charges of discrimination in housing and jobs that must be checked verified and documented before we hit the pavement without the participation of all races and all sexes we find ourselves handicapped and without the people who could help us to fight john does and jane does all over the country white and black have to learn to stand up under pressures from jobs families and communities they have to learn to live with the question marks and insecurity that active participation brings we all have to look to himself but it must be his choice to be the best the laziest or the worst that he chooses to make of himself but it must be his choice not the result of social pressures there are thousands of john does and jane does across the country who are working for equality there are thousands picketing petitioning using every available legal means at hand and even a few are dying both whites and blacks have died for this right of mens choice i hope for the day when negroes and all other minorities are born with their right to dignity the quality which separates the artist from the ordinary human being is the depth to which he is able to reach into his soul and thus give expression to those emotions bom of the human condition in this light odetta holmes felious gordon is an artist of the first rank and certainly the foremost folk singer in america with an evergrowing repertoire of songs she has enchanted audiences all over the united states canada africa and europe displaying a strong multicolored voice of an overwhelming intensity odettas forte lies with negro songs take this hammer john henry im going back to the red clay country but she is quite convincing interpreting other american folk tunes as well as those of other lands especially of british and irish origin a large woman whose closecropped hair styling and regal deportment is suggestive of an african princess her very presence on stage creates excitement and when she gives forth with her powerful contralto voice and rhythmic guitar she is a selftaught guitarist her listeners cant help but be captured by the honesty and depth of feeling in the moods she creates in fact there are few singers of any persuasion who can match odetta in this area she is a magnificent creator of moods who can at one moment drop an audience into the depths of sorrows dungeon and in the next instant elevate the audience to the heights of joy she can speak tenderly of love john riley then in her next number cry out in anguished protest of mans inhumanity to man he had a long chain on odetta was bom in birmingham alabama december but moved to los angeles at the age of where she was educated and where at a very tender age a musical interest was awakened in her this interest took her into the glee club in junior high school and upon graduating from belmont high school in she received the high school achievement award presented by the bank of america which enabled her to study at los angeles city college in preparation for a career in the classics in referring to this period of her artistic development she says if it wasnt classical i didnt want it however two years later after she had made her initial professional appearance as a member of the chorus of the west coast production of finiaris rainbow she discovered folk music while on tour in san francisco with finians rainbow jo mapes a folk singer and former high school classmate of odettas brought about her conversion in her own words i hadnt heard of folk singing until jo introduced me to it but i was sold on it when a group of her friends sang folk songs for three hours late one night i was converted this conversion gave birth to a dedicated artist who is constantly looking for new material and one who researches a song thoroughly before offering it to her public odetta goes deep into the background of a tune to get its feel and this is why when she sings for example the negro work song take this hammer she involves her listeners in a profound emotional experience it conjures up in ones mind a man breaking rocks on a chaingang and his utter disdain for that hammer those cold iron shackles and his overall contempt for the manner in which his situation has reduced his humanity when her stay with the company of finiaris rainbow ended odetta returned to los angeles where she worked for a while as a housekeeper after which she moved to san francisco accepting a job there at the tin angel it was at this point that she began to gain fame as an exponent of work songs blues ballads and spirituals a monthlong engagment at new yorks blue angel gained her a following on the east coast as well as the respect of such renowned folk artists as harry belafonte and pete seeger after her eastern exposure odetta returned to california to sing a moving version of the sea chantey santy anna in the film cinerama holiday she then appeared for two years at the turnabout theatre in los angeles before coming east again when she did return to the eastern part of the country it was to appear at the gate of horn in chicago at which time the fall of she acquired a personal manager a grossman owner of the club it was also during this period that she recorded her first album odetta sings ballads and blues included on this disc tradition tlp are such tunes as joshua easy rider shame and scandal and hound dog reviewers raved over her initial recording effort making special mention of her striking contralto voice and electrifying sincerity a second album odetta at the gate of horn tlp was received with the same enthusiasm as ballads and blues some of these selections were timber greensleeves and chilly winds on the strength of these two collections her fame increased and in april of she made a highly successful debut at town hall which drew the acclamation of the critics john s williams writing in the new york times of april had this to say a highly cultivated singer bringing to everything she sings the strong imprint of her warm positive and enormously skillful musical personality odetta has a large following among the college set and makes numerous appearances each year on the campuses of the country but whether performing before a gathering of in a college auditorium or a throng of as was the case when she sang at the march on washington in the summer of she can reach an audience like few have been able to do in the history of singing in this respect she belongs in the same class as billie holiday mario lanza marian anderson huddie ledbetter and ray charles on december odetta was exposed to a national television audience on tonight with harry belafonte a show in which her performance won a sylvania award it was belafonte who did the liner notes for her vanguard album vrs my eyes have seen released in stating that especially in negro folk song her distinctive touch has awakened her listeners to the deepest appreciation and most thorough insight into the very core of this music a review of this album by robert shelton in the new york times read in part the most glorious new voice in american folk music she has a voice so large and a physical presence so commanding recordings have yet to do her complete justice a few of the tunes here are ox driver song down on me ive been driving on bald mountain and waterboy odetta was presented in recital at carnegie hall may an appearance which caused the critics to heap more praise on her and which further entrenched her in the hearts and minds of folk music devotees and patrons of the arts in general in this performance as in her concerts and recording dates during this period she was assisted by a very splendid musician and composer bill lee whose driving string bass had become an integral part of her presentation the year was a very big one for odetta she recorded ballad for americans made famous by the great paul robeson in the s with symphony of the air and decormier chorale some of the other american ballads appearing on this vanguard album vrs are this land on top of old smoky dark as a dungeon and going home the philadelphia inquirer had this to say of this album one of the finest albums of the year done with beauty of voice and all of the rich resources of expression and sympathies embodied in her personality she was seen along with the baritone william warfield on the w n b c tv half hour special parable in the park her portrayal of the murderess nancy in the film version of william faulkners sanctuary showed her to be a very proficient actress odettas performance at the newport folk festival in june impressed one critic thus the focus of the first concert was on odetta whose mahoganyhued sonorous voice offered what this listener felt was the crowning performance of the weekend a typical odetta concert runs the emotional gamut she can make one cry laugh hate love in recent months her performances have been augmented by bruce langhorne a very sensitive guitarist and les grinage bassist there is no better measure of an artists worth than to view that artist in a program with others in her idiom in january odetta appeared on the television special dinner with the president which featured an impressive array of folk singers including the everpopular josh white even in this noble company she towered over her contemporaries as the mountain does the molehill i am not prejudiced although martin p luther king might think so i am as lib e ral thinking as any man if they dont bother me i dont bother them the thing that puzzles me is why the agitators dont let us work out our own problems now take my neighborhood for example we live only a few blocks from them and usually dont have any trouble at all just the other day i stopped and gave one a lift when his car stalled we talked for awhile and got along fine i explained to him how i had some of them working for me and that i treated them as well as the rest of us he was a rather quiet onei guess it was because he was worried about his car so i talked a lot i told him how my father had come to america about fifty years before and worked so hard to become a foreman at the stockyards he and mother still lived in the same house where we youngsters were born dad and mother would die rather than move everyone of us kids was born baptized and married within five blocks of our house dad said we should all be proud of the opportunities america gave immigrant folk to make good i told him how dad had explained to us about race it was beautiful the way he told us how birds and butterflies have wings but it didnt mean they were the same although god had made both of them the fellow must have been a sensitive one because he kind of choked up i couldnt be sure but he seemed to glow from down under his skin he probably had never heard it put so clearly before i was really proud of dad at that moment of course the guy didnt quite understand he mumbled something about what do birds and butterflies have to do with people then he said something that sounded like parallel evolution i wish dad had been along he could have explained to the fellow better than i did roy that was his name and i got along fine although he was kind of shy we stopped in the restaurant across from the gas station and had a cup of coffee while the tow truck went to bring his car roy emma shes the waitress and me had a good time teasing each other while we waited i called emma shanty irish and she called me a name and roy said he had to use the washroom when he got back i told this joke about how there were three kinds of irishmen shanty irish highclass irish and bicycle irish emma fell for it and we really laughed when i told her bicycle irish were the kind that made your ass tired well roy didnt laugh too much maybe he had heard it before some of those guys dont have a sense of humor dad says they would be better off if they learned to joke more instead of taking things so seriously we ate a couple of hamburgers and i took roy to the bar next door where we had a couple of beers the bartender is a swell guy he waited on roy right awayeven served him before me i didnt mind a bit but i wouldnt let roy pay the bill although he tried hard tom hes the bartender and he owns the place too stayed right near us all the time we were there and smiled a lot more than id ever seen him do before he made roy feel right at home its funny because tom had always impressed me as feeling rather strong about the race problem it just shows you cant go by what folks say they cant hold their liquor too well because roy started talking after awhile you know how they talk fast and use words that no one but them can understand he kept doing something with a piece of chalk said something about being a student mentioned interracial parties kept talking about hypocrisy and got all hot under the collar well tom got kind of excited but i was on roys side its funny how little things can show what a mans made of by the time we left i was the only man there who still liked that boy ill tell you why something happened and i remembered what dad had once told me the local punchboard had come switching into the bar to see if she could hook someone all of us had given her the eye to make her feel good roy just sat there i watched him like dad had said roy never let his eyes move from the lip of his beer glass the whole time the girl was in the bar the boy was all right no one noticed it but me thats why i was mad when later the guys started needling roy i told him lets leave these creeps besides it was getting dark and i didnt want him to get into trouble we got back to the station and he was about to drive off so i told him how id watched him real close when the girl was in the bar i reached to shake his hand he must not have seen my hand because he gave me this coin instead looked at me in a real strange way and drove off i guess he was stoned why would anybody color lincolns face white on a penny the idea had been growing in lukes mind so long until now it seemed to have been forming since the day he was born not the whole thing but bits and pieces which sometimes met and held or as was more often the case simply vague notions which danced through the brain leaving only bare traces of their handiwork but this morning as he looked up to see his old pal buddy york fresh out of the county farm walking toward him the shutter in his mind clicked for the final time and he knew he was going to do it he had to it was one of those things a man just had to do if he were to keep on calling himself a man they came together eyed one another for a long moment then broke into sudden laughter you home for good luke asked finally man i hope so buddy answered but i doubt it every time something happens they come and grab me i know luke agreed his massive head nodding sympathetically they used to pull that crap on me but i got em off my neck for good now you sure did but howd you do it buddy asked his voice filled with muted admiration im thinking bout hopping a freight maybe some other place i can make a new start luke laughed it was more of a squeal really without humor and raw with sarcasm you dont really believe that now do you man you like me you doomed from the day you born you just hafta learn t keep em off you as long as you can then when its time to go take as many along with you as you can take man theres lots of room in hell so take em all if you can he said giving that peculiar laugh again buddy gave him an odd look you sound like you know something he said finally i know a whole lotta stuff if you wanna know the truth luke said moving off and indicating by a nod that buddy should come along with him and i got a real big plan in mind he continued what i need now is a partner i can trust you interested yeah im interested buddy answered promptly if theres any dough in it at all my old lady just throwed the book at me this morning i gotta get a job she says she cant afford to support me and dave too dig that will ya where in hell im gonna git a job in this hole luke nodded a bland look on his broad face well you gotta look at it from miss matties side too i reckon dave aint gonna be no good for a long time now all that education he got is just gonna rust in his head man its too bad a smart one like him had to go marching against them fire hoses hed a been better off if theyd put th dogs on him man the way they smashed him up against that wall musta left a hole bigger than a watermelon the nogood bastards i betcha one thing youll never catch me marching and singing and being drenched and beat like a buncha cattle when i used to join them sitins i had a grenade in every pocket one of them mothers had hit me too hard and we all was going to glory hows old dave making out he inquired they were walking fast now heading out past the desolate shacks in crabtown hes still outta this world most of the time buddy began ma keeps on mumbling to th lord about what they done to her child and when is he going to be well again but if you ask me he aint ever gonna make it you cant dig a mans brains outtathe wall and stick em back in his head and expect him to be like he was thats what i know luke said coming to a stop before a small dollsize cabin i reckon miss matties about half crazy herself by now she had so much faith in old dave yeah buddy said slouching down on a big rock in front of the shack and you know shell never understand how it was him and not me got his brains busted out luke grinned you aint had any to start out with like i said you and me we doomed only thing we got to worry about is how many can we take along when we leave this glorious land of golden opportunity for everybody white he chuckled pleased as all get out with the impression he was making on the highly impressionable buddy then with a great flourish he poured some of the bootleg liquor hed brought out from under the steps into a paper cup and handed it to buddy who took one swallow and nearly choked his eyes quickly filling with tears man this stuff is strong he said its good though he added hastily white lightning luke said my special brew which i only serve to special folks man you being honored buddy nodded and took another sip much smaller this time they were far back on top of the hill with the entire town spread out before them the shacks of crab town came first like so many mangled toy houses each with its tiny outhouse which tinted the air with the perpetual odor of lime and human refuse then the main us highway swung through this disarray whanging the shacks off from an abandoned golf course where white men formerly played until the courts ordered it integrated beyond the course now overgrown with tall yellow weeds to the right were the small houses where people such as buddys mother and bushwacked brother lived poor folks they were but better off than the wretches who inhabited the shacks to the left a few blocks down another thoroughfare were a group of mediumsized wellkept houses where the welltodo negroes lived as a rule luke seldom thought much about these people who almost never thought about the likes of him at least not in charitable terms to say the least he viewed them with mixed emotions then far beyond this small island of black respectability and rising on a slight incline was the white mans world a world that luke was bom resisting and one that he had long yearned to destroy in the very center of this universe lodged the county courthouse which luke detested with such an unrelenting passion that it sometimes made him sick the business district spread around the courthouse in a haphazard desultory fashion like so many greedy fingers clutching a dying mans throat but the one building that always claimed lukes undivided attention was that which held the great southern national bank ten stories high and loaded with money it had always drawn his imagination like a supercharged magnet his eyes fastened on it now in total fascination what you staring at so hard buddy asked holding his cup out for a refill luke came back to his immediate surroundings a faint smile on his lips just enjoying the view man just enjoying the view he said pouring more of the clear liquid for buddy you sure got plenty of it buddy admitted tasting his drink with caution i aint been way back up here since i was a kid man you can see all over the damn place and things dont look so bad from up here not even that trap i live in luke shrugged howd you like to live in one o them shacks freeze your tail off in th winter time i reckon so buddy conceded then nodded his head back at the tiny house behind them you dont live there do you man i live everywhere luke bragged you know wherever my hat lands thats home the liquor began working on buddy now he felt loose talkative you know what everybody say about you luke hell man luke began i dont care what nobody say about me but what they say that im evil damn right im evil if i wasnt id never stayed alive in this rotten town for twentysix years buddy looked at him a curious mixture of doubt and admiration in his eyes what about that white boy that time luke what really happened a slow grin broke on lukes face as his mind moved back nearly fourteen years what th hell you think happened i drowned his ass thats what happened he was white wasnt he the sonofabitch you mean you did it just because he was white asked the astonished buddy can you think of a damn better reason luke asked calmly they lynched my old man because he was colored didnt they they butchered your brothers brains because he was black didnt they and didnt they kick manda johnsons belly out because she was colored and had the nerve to want to vote so what th hellte you talking about man dont start talking no mess to me you sound just like miss mattie buddy was silent for some moments well i guess if you look at it that way he said finally well what way you been looking at it luke asked harshly buddy squirmed i dunno man i mean i guess i tried not to think about it what good do thinking about it do no damn good luke admitted thats why they demonstrating and gitting their heads tore up but like i said me i got the best plan of all im gonna blow the whole goddamn town down buddy laughed man thats an idea now luke stared at buddy over his paper cup which still held most of his first drink he wasnt much of a drinking man long ago hed discovered the hard way that drinking and getting things done didn t go together too well he could tell buddy didnt believe what hed just said which was all right with him he wasnt sure he wanted buddy to know about his plan until he was ready to put it in action but he did want to sound old buddy out to see if miss mattie had washed all his brains out with all that waiting on the lord crap you think im talking crazy dont you man i dont know buddy began i mean i heard a lotta stuff bout you over th years but well you know how people are in a place like this they got nothing to do much but talk about each other and talk to the good lord luke added buddy grinned then my old lady says if you dont turn to god soon luke you gonna die a violent death all deaths violent luke shrugged and we all gonna die and the lord aint thinking about us black folks down here any moren them people up in washington are hes white just like the rest of them mothers and they all singing the same old tune go slow gradually man we been going so slow so long we aint even got one toe on the mothering bus he said making an obscene gesture with his hand then turned his cup up and drained it i been wondering luke buddy began howd it feel the time you drowned that fay cat i mean howd you do it anyway luke grinned his face glistening with perspiration man it felt good he exclaimed damn good believe me it was easy too the little bastard kept after me to teach him to swim dont you know but i couldnt be bothered then one day i was walking downtown and saw him with some of his friends and he acted like he didnt see me course that didnt bother me i was acting like i didnt see him either but later it got me to thinking about a lotta things i remembered them hooded mothers dragging my old man out in the middle of the night when i was four and i remembered a damn sight lotta other things too if you know what i mean and i know you do buddy nodded and held his cup out and luke filled both cups then went on with his story well would ya believe it the very next morning th little pecker comes around again begging me to show im some strokes is the way he put it barney was his name you remember maybe barney stokes i see his old man sometimes now he works over at the plant and he always give me this funny look he dont say nothing for it aint nothing he can say for at the time some old white cat was riding by on a horse and swore the whole thing was a accident and i was trying to save old barney luke gave out with that eerie laugh and slapped his thigh hard but how could you fool im luke i mean the man musta seen what you did didnt he well you see luke grinned then drained his cup a second time you know where we were over at that old swimming hole which the university bought up later he paused then his eyes roving way across town and lighting on the state university which sprawled like an octopus in all directions the souths seat of culture he mumbled making the obscene gesture again when i git through with that culture seat they wont need no army to integrate it theyll need a magician for it aint gonna be there and that precious hospital neither thats right next to it and that your ma thinks is so god almighty fine yet they wouldnt take her son in when his head was smashed like a rotten tomato he turned to stare at buddy then man where your ma git all them aunt jemima ideas of hers from buddy shrugged they all got em he said in philosophical resignation your ma had em too she damn sure did luke groaned till the day she died she swore i drowned old barney and it was gonna be with me the rest o my life he gurgled like a fat baby it damn sure is thank the good lord and for the longest kinda time it was the onlyst thing that kept me going now though he added giving buddy a sidelong look ive sent old barney a whole heap of company and pretty soon hes gonna be damn near crowded outta hell but to git back to that day i showed him a few strokes on land telling him id just had my tonsils out and couldnt get wet i swore the water was only two or three feet deep and that he could sorta wade in and practice the strokes id showed him he fell for that crap buddy asked i mean i thought everybody in town knowed that thing was deepern twelve feet all over luke grinned that dumb sonofabitch didnt know from nothing he stuck his foot out and went down like a bag of rocks i pretended i wasnt looking in case somebody else was and he stayed down so long i thought he wasnt coming up then up he comes like a wet rat grabbing air and trying to drink the whole damn thing dry i ran and hopped in and went straight to the bottom and then got over under old barney and took this one foot when he come down and kept him down there awhile then i moved away from him surfaced and made like i was trying to find him then i went under again but couldnt even find him i had to come up three times before i finally saw im all tangled up in some kinda mess inner tubes i think and i brought him up then thats when this white cat comes by and helped me pull old barney out man you shoulda seen him he turned my stomach but i was glad i was thinking this is one bastard what wont lynch nobodys father he damn sure wont buddy agreed then stood up dusting his pants off i gotta be gitting he said slowly its near twelve my old ladyll be home soon wondering why i aint done nothing round the house since i aint working aw sit down man luke said here give me your cup and lets finish this up theres plenty more where it come from buddy did as luke suggested his eyes filled with deep admiration for the larger man but you know what i dont git he began after luke handed him his drink is how could you carry grenades in your pockets and nobody not know it luke aw man luke began waving a long hairy arm youd be surprised what modern science can do and alreadys done you see all you little old fresh kids when you got throwed outta school the same as me all you could think about was having a good time now i went to the liberry and got some books and kept on learning i was always good in science class you remember that buddys eyes popped you mean you made them things hell no luke growled what i mean is by keeping up with whats happening in the world i know such things can be made so i got me somebody and had some made and a lotta other things too he gave buddy another sidelong look man ignorant folks dont know from nothing whats going on in this old world buddy sat very still hoping luke would go on but luke wasnt about to not yet anyway come on man he urged drink up we both gotta be gitting in a minute what about this partnership you talked about luke you still mean it sure i mean it man why you think i brought you up here just keep your mouth shut and your eyes open ill tell you more bout it later maybe tomorrow if things are going th way i expect then he saw the look on buddys face and realized what was on his mind he reached in his pocket and brought out three limp dollar bills here show this to yer ma and tell her you did some odd jobs for some folks out on the edge of town buddy pocketed the money eagerly thanks luke thisll keep her mouth shut for a coupla days when luke met buddy several days later buddy could tell by the grin on his face that things had been going well for him everythings just about in th bag man he said as they started off in the direction of lukes place but what i aint figured out yet is how we gonna git a car what we need a car for buddy asked surprised luke stopped and stared at him we need a car for ten good reasons he said finally how you think we gonna git the stuff set up hauling it on a bicycle look man you aint told me nothing bout your plans remember i dont know what stuff you even talking about yet luke gave that odd soft laugh thats right i forgot i been thinking bout this thing so long i guess i thought everybody knowed about it ill tell you all about it once we git up to my place but right now who you know got a car we can borrow or steal real easy i dont know man buddy began thoughtfully them people mama work for got a old rattle trap hes a intern at th hospital you know but when he come to see dave on thursdays he drives a new one he borrows from somebody at the hospital i reckon yeah luke got that calculating look on his face i didnt know old sawbones was still coming to see old dave buddy nodded the old lady would die if he didnt i dont see it doing no good though dave still just sits there and stares at the walls all day long thats a goddamned shame luke fumed young guy like him just outta college and as smart as a whip now all messed up for life most likely man thats what i been trying to tell you these crackers aint from shit theyll bust your brains out all over the place if they think you intending to use em that buck carson and his storm troopersll never git their hooks on me i betcha he stopped again and reached in his pocket you see these he asked bringing out two little colored objects about the size and shape of an easter egg buddys eyes bulged as he gaped at the sinisterlooking little balls yeah man whats them things them grenades you talked about th other day something like em luke grinned baby bombs old jake calls em you mean crazy old jake the pne who kept trying to integrate the university and they kept putting in the nut house till he cracked up luke stuck the eggs back in his pocket man crazy jake aint crazy hes got more sense than einstein ever had thats just an act he put on so theyd leave him alone and sos he could work at the plant and keep in touch with the latest scientific happenings buddy laughed man you let old jake goose you them things aint nothing but kids toys baby bombs he said laughing again yeah luke snorted they toys all right remember them two bastards what beat them colored girls up that time and how one day they just sorta disappeared in th thin air car and all luke asked bringing one of the little balls out again well one of these little toys sent them two mothers down to keep old barney company and i could tell you bout a lotta others keeping old barney company too that these little toys blasted to hell but im gonna let you see for yourself you dumb ass the look on lukes fa e and the tone of his voice sent chills through buddy he didnt really believe luke but still there was something about him evil his mother always said and people who tampered with luke usually ended up missing or dead but nobody could ever pin anything on him even old buck carson and his troopers didnt bother luke much man you could git in a heap of trouble with them things buddy said at last luke gave him a scorching look you mean to say after all these years you dont know you born in trouble if you black hell man dont say nothing more to me every day you sound more and more like miss mattie you wanna forget the partnership they stood on the corner staring at one another as the blazing july sun beat upon them then suddenly buddy turned pale and began trembling slightly and luke looked around to see buck carson and three of his boys pulling up to the curb beside them what you two doing buck drawled luke stared at the red puffy face and saw the mean glint in the small watery blue eyes and it was all he could do to keep his itching fingers from one of the little balls in his pockets we demonstrating he said finally verry verry funny buck said not the least bit amused howd you two like to make a coupla bucks tomorrow night luke pretended to think about that for a moment doing what he asked finally so look whos being particular buck snorted luke raised his hands slightly but kept them near his pockets we cant afford to be otherwise folks round here might git th wrong idea they see us doing business with you they figure you and your dogs and your fire hoses and lectric prods belong on one side and us on th other bucks face turned redder its my job to preserve law and order i do it any way i can he snapped luke shrugged we figure you aint too concerned bout law and order when th klan go marching in them bed sheets without a permit bucks head snapped back as if luke had struck him nobody tells me how to run my business you wait boy youll see then angrily he nodded toward the driver motioning him to drive off a terrible look transformed lukes face as he made the obscene gesture with his right hand no mother you wait and see im gonna git you befo this weeks out then he turned on buddy who had finally got his voice back and was about to say something shut th hell up luke snarled and come with me if you aint too goddamned chicken thursday morning buddy met luke at the appointed place an abandoned shack out near the plant where luke squatted near the steps between two soiled bulging laundry bags he gave buddy one of the bags and as they walked along heading for buddys house luke explained part of the plan to him buddy was astounded you mean we really gonna blow the whole town up his eyes popped his legs grew weak and he stopped walking and gingerly set his bag down suppose these things go off before we git em set up and suppose somebody sees us luke luke gave him a withering look man you ask more questions than a goddamned gallup poll i told you th other day if you too chickenhearted then git the hell outta my way i know what im doing and if you so scared of them white mothers you cant even take a leak for wondering if they gonna see you then go on bout your business they gonna hang your ass anyway man you know that but you too damn stupid to even fight back go on home and listen to your ma talk about waiting on the lord and see where that gits you go on he repeated and reached for buddys bag aw luke i was just wondering is all i mean i dont wanna back out now then come on and shut up luke muttered already it was getting hot and luke was still thinking about buck carson and how much he was going to enjoy blowing that fat bastard to bits and along with him the whole stinking town and wasnt it too damn bad he couldnt blow the whole state to hell especially the capital the goddamn mothering capital with that peaheaded rattlesnake of a governor who would make such good company for that mothering barney maybe if they got the car and things went well here maybe they could run up and pay old gov a visit the nogood mother he turned to buddy who walked beside him like a man in a deep trance what time you say old sawbones usually comes with th car about one or two buddy said then clamped his mouth shut to keep a whole bushel of questions from tumbling out luke nodded that gives us lots of time it aint even leven yet however when they rounded the corner where buddy lived they saw the car parked in front of the house and luke swore out loud buddy looked at him his eyes waiting for luke to blame him for this unexpected turn of events but lukes mind was working in other channels he suddenly realized that this was better yet the sooner they got the show on the road the sooner it would all be over come on he said to buddy lets stick this stuff in the back of the car and go on in the house remember what i told you now once you trip him on the steps leave the rest to me and if miss mattie comes down let me do th talking once they went into action buddys stage fright vanished completely and vaguely at first he began to perceive just what luke had been preaching the last several days then when dr pattersons big foot stepped within the circle of black rope and he pitched through the air as buddy yanked on it with an abrupt motion buddy nearly clapped his hands in ecstasy it was indeed good to hit back at last then while he was disposing of the rope luke disposed of the doctor buddy wasnt sure just how luke did it or exactly what he did but it was done so quickly that when miss mattie came hurrying down the steps the man was out cold and perhaps dead for all buddy knew miss mattie was horrified when she saw her employer sprawled on the floor but luke smoothly assured her that it was nothing really the doc just had a little fall and he and buddy were going to drive him back to the hospital and then the one thing they hadnt foreseen cropped up to haunt them miss mattie insisted on going with them and they had no alternative but to take her along she sat up front with luke her mouth pressed into a thin worried line and the doctor who now buddy well knew was quite dead was propped in a corner of the back seat with buddy when the car started the corpse lurched forward and frantically buddy grabbed it and held on as luke rounded the corner on two wheels miss mattie turned to look back her eyes bright with unshed tears that poor man looks just about dead she sighed luke she began her voice sagging with despair i know youve done something to him youre an evil man luke im just so glad your poor mother didnt live to see whats become of you boy her voice grated on lukes nerves especially since he hadnt really decided just what to do with her a man has to be evil to survive down here miss mattie he said wearily these white folks wouldve got me long ago if i wasnt it takes evil to deal with evil if you know what i mean she shook her head sadly her hands tightly clasped on top of the pocketbook in her lap you should love thy enemy luke besides all white people arent evil the way you think lukes odd laughter rumbled through the car and in the back buddy giggled as he hung onto the swaying corpse then luke glanced at her quickly i love them just as much as they love me miss mattie and they love me so much it hurts in fact i hurt all the time he said then let out a low whistle as buck carson and the three troopers shot by racing in the opposite direction and one of them noticed luke driving the doctors car oh my luke began up jumps the devil way head of time as usual he pressed down hard on the accelerator and the automobile leaped forward as the police car made a uturn and siren blasting took off after the speeding black sedan buddy was really enjoying himself now virtually jumping up and down in his seat as the movieland chase hit full stride how come they aint shooting at us he asked finally luke chuckled they know we got old sawbones in here and they dont wanna hit him white blood is precious buddy boy you ought to know that by now he said maliciously its all right to have black blood flowing in the gutters but not white blood black blood brown blood yellow blood any blood but white blood least that what th white folks think but theyd best wake up this the last of the th century all bloods precious now they dont know yet but they all th time wanting to be so high and mighty they gonna find they all alone we gonna gang up on their ass luke miss mattie exclaimed sharply shut up and stop this car this minute luke laughed and buddy giggled and then reported that buck and his boys were gaining on them i know luke replied thats what i want them to do now i wantcha to get one of them little eggs outta one of th bags and press that tip down hard and when we turn onto the bridge road take dead aim on old buck and let em have it man giggling like an intoxicated teenager buddy eagerly followed lukes directions get ready luke warned as he made the turn now he shouted as the two vehicles were at just the right angle buddy threw the green oblong object which had suddenly began to grow hot after he pressed the tip down man buddy yelped gleefully where they go aint nothing back there but a little old puff of smoke and no noise at all hardly where they go luke luke laughed shrilly they on their way to keep old barney company move over bastard here comes four more miss mattie who had been staring back looking for the vanished patrol car suddenly whirled on luke you devil she shrieked and vigorously started banging him over the head with her purse mama buddy screamed look what you doing you going to kill us all and he lunged forward trying to grab her flailing arms goddammit luke snarled then finally landed a solid right to miss matties jaw but it was too late now hed lost control of the vehicle it spinned crazily across the still damp road banged against the railing then careened over to the opposite side hit that railing and flipped up and over buddy screamed miss mattie screamed but luke laughed wildly okay barney you grinning bastard here i come with three more and im gonna work on you plenty when i git there mother and he still laughed as the car struck the water and disappeared with barely a sound only a yellow puff of smoke and then absolute silence a great poet has been living in our midst for decades and is almost totally unknown even by the literati even by poets can this be possible in the age of criticism and of publication unlimited it is not only possible but highly probable poetry today is an established institution which has many of the characteristics of a closed corporation one of the rules of the poetic establishment is that negroes are not admitted to the polite company of the anthology poetry as we know it remains the most lilywhite of the arts a novelist and pamphleteer like baldwin is world famous m b tolson easily the literary equal of any number of baldwins is less honored in his own country than the most obscure poetaster yet not all poets and critics are at fault tolson has been recognized by eminent men of letters for a long time and at the extremes of the literary spectrum allen tate paid homage to him in an introduction to libretto for the republic of liberia an essay which is more famous than the poem william carlos williams in the fourth book of paterson salutes him in this way and to tolson and to his ode and to liberia and to allen tate give him credit and to the south generally selah theodore roethke selden rodman robert frost john ciardi and stanley hyman have also tried to bring tolson to the general literary consciousness but with little success in a time when liberals are falling all over themselves to shake hands with negroes when a dusky maidenly model may even be hired for tv commercials when black skin is the literary rage poetry by gentleman of color continues to be ignored and it is ignored far out of proportion to the common indifference to the art it is one thing to accept an artist on the grounds of his art regardless of race and creed as long as the artist can adjust to the ruling grecojudaicchristian culture it is another thing to accept an artist who contravenes that culture tolson belongs to the second category he is in effect the enemy of the dominant culture of our time and place he is to use the term he prefers an afroamerican poet not an american negro poet accommodating himself to the tradition it is probably for this reason that the libretto despite its success destime failed to tickle the sensibilities of the literati and the professoriat the libretto pulls the rug out from under the poetry of the academy on the stylistic level outpounding pound it shocks the learned into a recognition of their own ignorance harlem gallery his new collection being published by twayne in march pulls the house down around their ears tolson writes in negro walter savage landor told thomas hardy almost a century ago that english was a dying language english poetry and angloamerican poetry continue to bear out the dismal prophecy the glorious shreds of english are in our century daintily stitched together by the campus muse while the new language undergoes all its multiple birth pangs england is the mother of our tongue but nobody knows who the fathers were or how many it is a somewhat chaucerian situation bawdry high learning grammarlessness history myth all crying out for a jongleur or a poet it is not enough to equate tolson as his best critics have done with eliot or hart crane the cantos or ana base to make him equal is to miss the point just as it would be to make him better than tolson writes and thinks in negro which is to say a possible american language he is therefore performing the primary poetic rite for our literature instead of purifying the tongue which is the business of the academy he is complicating it giving it the gift of tongues pound eliot and joyce did this but with pernicious nostalgia that all but killed the patient tolson does it naturally and to the manner born here it is irrelevant to argue a thesis but apropos to suggest common sense the history of the negro places him linguistically at the center of american culture as it does no other nationality or race negro survival has depended upon the mastery of the gradations of english the negro has in his possession a gradus ad parnassum of culture which no other minority or majority can conceivably encompass this is the significance of allen tates salute to tolsons libretto only a southern intellectual and poet would be in a position to welcome a tolson albeit at the white front door one can practically feel the beat of walt whitmans wings against the dome of the library of congress the harlem gallery will not make matters easier massive as it is it is only a beginning of a greater work a kind of odyssey of the american negro of which this is the prologue the gallery returns to the basic themes of the libretto one of these is the accusation of gertrude stein that the negro suffers from nothingness written in a style conforming to the ode form of the earlier poem it is in fact a narrative work so fantastically stylized that the mind balks at comparisons the milieu is harlem from the twenties on the dramatis personae comprise every symbolic character from the black bourgeois babbitt and the lenox avenue poet to the alienated negro professor and sage who sits in the bar and elaborates along with the curator and the zulu club wits a platonic dialogue the giveandtake ostensibly moves on a level of talk about the artsa floor which is constantly caving in and plunging the reader into the depths of metaphysical horror which journalists nowadays refer to as the race question but like so many great works of poetry it is a comic poem it is funny witty humoristic slapstick crude cruel bitter and hilarious the baroque surface of the poem modifies none of this the harlem gallery is as if improvised by one of the great architects of modern poetry it may be that this work like other works of its quality in the past will turn out to be not only an end in itself but the door to poetry that everyone has been looking for despite all the stumbling blocks professional jealousies and race hatred negroes have always managed to carve a special niche for themd selves in attaining worldwide fame and acclaim since many years back joe louis in boxing and other boxers before him ben barek in football louis armstrong in jazz josephine baker as a singer and dorothy dandridge lena horne and eartha kitt as more decorative members have been accepted public figures whose road to glory was not a cinch but they made it as did many others despite the odds their individual contributions have added to the overall splendor of the public professions although the above singled out personalities and scores upon scores of others have been household words throughout the world little known is the fact that negroes also have excelled in the death in the afternoon art the first negro who gambled his life in the bull ring for a chance at fame and fortune was a peruvian named angel valdes born in the tiny village of palpa back in by some unknown chemistry the youngster was scarcely six when he began to wave a cape before tired old cows and bulls and yearlings as usual everybody in the backwoods peruvian village laughed at the pretensions of the eldest valdes son he has no shoes on his feet scarcely a shirt on his back taunted children and chortling adults and yet he talks of being a great torero it is just too funny and we will die of laughter where will he ever get the opportunity no one ever comes to this godforsaken dustladen village but young angel supported the taunts and the many fights with youngsters his age when he could stand their goading no longer for the grimly determined angel there was no schooling but he never ceased his dogged practice with the hapless cows sometimes an aging bull would haphazardly and halfheartedly charge the boy then angel was in his glory showing off his footwork the ridicule of his neighbors did not daunt angel and their laughter had a hollow sound before long for by the determined angel made his first bull ring appearance in the town of acho even dressed in a creditable fashion for the period there was an element of luck in all this for a mexican one jose maria vazquez happened to pass through palpa looking for fiery bulls no longer a bullfighter because of frequent gorings vazquez took to the young colored lad decided to teach him the art of the matador angel was an eager pupil of course in his first appearance in the acho bull ring angel played second fiddle in the cuadrillas four man teams of local toreros but soon eminent bullfighters of that period in peru such as salamanquino gonzalo mora and pedro fernandez added young valdes to their staff the youth was not interested in being little more than a stable boy or one who disengaged the attention of the bull when the torero had completed his passes adopting the name of el maestro the master young angel turned matadora killer of bulls his style was none too distinguished and valdes relied chiefly under the name of the negro from havana actually he was a descendant of the incasas were most of the other peruvian negro bullfighters who fought in their native land and in spain the most outstanding of the colored bullfighterswith peru contributing the greatest numberwas rafael santa cruz rafael was an automobile mechanic who first donned the gold embroidered finery of the matador on march and he went on to the biggest success of all achieved not only in the lima bullring but in spain where he went in his accomplishment was the greater since he appeared with such idols of the ring as joselito alvarez pepe escudero brother of the beloved manolo and joselito torres of all the colored bullfighters santa cruz develooed a style and presence and a devilmaycare courage that appealed to the crowds but a few years back santa cruz decided he had earned more than enough to last him the rest of his days he is now retired and engaged in business in lima this brief and not exhaustive history of negro accomplishments in the bullring a little known phase of activity of colored men is interesting in that never once dating back to over a hundred years ago when angel valdes first paraded into the bull ring was there ever even a hint of racial prejudice the colored fighters were booed and hissed and sombreros were thrown into the ring a sign of great displeasure when the toreros work is mediocre however this was not because they were colored but because they displeased the audience by their performances as bullfighters finally the bullfight sport has remained impartial to all in recent years there have been oriental aspirants risking life for big money and possible immortality when sports writers wrote about colored bullfighters and their earnest dedicated if not always skillful efforts they always referred to them as these colored bullfighters with white souls whose courage never falters and of course to top it all off there has been an entire slew of white americans trying their luck in the ring also with most indifferent success about the only thing that does give a charge to mexican bullfight fans is the constant stream of american girls short on technique but long on curves revealed to best advantage in tight bullfight costumes for these the fans have a very special ole that somehow emulates that wellknown sign of appreciationthe wolf whistle in recent news reports the congolese have been pictured as savages and the belv gians as civilizers yet historical records show that king leopold of belgium while pretending to civilize the congo cut and mutilated people and separated wives from husbands if they refused to be his outright slaves historical records also reveal that the congolese had a civilization of their own which was quite well developed and needed least of all the european civilizers there were several large kingdoms in the area we now call the congo the kingdom of ansika was comprised of the people of the bateke and bayoka whose artistic talents were very remarkable near the center of the congo was the bakuba kingdom or bushongo noted for its unity the excellence of its administration its art its craftmanship and the beauty of its fabrics the encyclopaedia britannica attests to the fact that most congo people are exceptional craftsmen ironwork knives spears arrowheads bracelets attains an extraordinary variety outstanding carvings are known the bushong culture kept its records and transmitted them almost intact to modern research the bakubas are an ancient people whose power and influence once extended over most of the congotheir history can be traced to the fifth century at the top of the bakuba hierarchy was the royal court composed of six dignitaries responsible for cabinetlike matters such as military affairs justice and administration at one time there were in the royal entourage other functionaries including a master of the hunt a master storyteller and a keeper of oral tradition or historian in the sixteenth century the bakubas ruled over a great african empire the memory of their glorious past is recalled in the tribe with historical exactitude they can name the reigns of their kings for the past years the loyalty of the people to these rulers is expressed in a series of royal portraitstatues dating from the reign of shamba bolongongo the great and best known of the bakuba kings shamba bolongongo was a peaceful sovereign he prohibited the use of the shongo a throwing knife the traditional weapon of the bushong this wise african king used to say kill neither man woman nor child are they not the children of chembe god and have they not the right to live early in the twentieth century when the european writer emil torday was traveling through the congo collecting material for his book on the trail of the bushongo he found the bakuba elders still singing praises of shamba bolongongo much of the history and civiliza tion of central african and east african areas was revealed by the study made by the portuguese african explorer duarte lopez in his book history of the kingdom of the congo he went to the congo in and stayed for many years from his study and description of the congo we learn that the kingdom of the congo included the territory formerly known as the congo angola and parts of the cameroons according to lopez the kingdom of the congo at the time measured miles at the time of lopezs year stay in the country the kingdom of the congo was divided into six provinces the province of bamba was the military stronghold of the kingdom and was capable of putting well disciplined men in the field in henrique the portuguese name for the son of the king of the congo was sent to lisbon and to rome to study theology in pope leo appointed henrique bishop of utica and vicarapostolic of the congo this was more than years before leopold king of belgium came on his socalled mission to bring christianity to the congolese at first there was peaceful commercial and cultural trade between the people of the congo and the europeans but later the dutch and the portuguese began their slavehunting they stripped whole villages of people they stole the riches in the form of goods and art objects they plundered for wealth in whatever form they could get from no european source was there an outcry against these savage acts to the contrary the european scholars clergy kings and merchants proclaimed to all how wonderful it was that they were civilizing the savage congolese those who proclaimed this were called by the prestige title historians but now they are being revealed as mere scribblers surely the greed for quick wealth blinded the eye of the european to justice soon treachery robbery and executions compounded the chaos in the congo violence became the order of the day as various assortments of european mercenaries vied for control of this rich area of africa in the ensuing struggle many of the christian churches built by the portuguese were destroyed not only were the physical structures of christianity destroyed but so was the faith itself when the clergy were silent about the grievous wrongs done to the congolese people they were not successful then in winning the congolese because they were often mere agents of the europeans in their plunder for wealth the congolese wondered why the white clerics were silent in the face of all these wrongs and then turned away from them perhaps these historical aspects have lessons for todays current events then came king leopold of belgium on the scene he was a shrewd business man who had a love for money and the commodities that it could purchase he followed events of his day carefully and knew that europeans had gone to africa for quick riches the time was the middle and late s so accordingly leopold called an international geographic conference of scientists scholars and business men addressing this conference leopold posed as the great civilizer and said to open to civilization the only part of our globe where it has not penetrated to pierce the darkness which envelops whole populations is a crusade if i may say soa crusade worthy of this century of progress before the conference adjourned it set up the international association for the exploration and civilization of africa with this fine cloak as a missionary leopold sent his troops to the congo and took possession of it he then forced each village to pay taxes in the form of rubber and ivory those who refused to deliver their quota of rubber and ivory were tortured by leopolds troops who mutilated bodies cut off hands and separated wives and children from husbands and fathers thus did the great civilizer bring civilization to the congolese people reports of leopolds agents bringing baskets of amputated congolese hands are many during the decade of to the need for rubber increased and the belgian kings profits from this item alone were million dollars this figure does not include the profit made by the american congo company to which leopold had granted concessions the methods of this company to collect rubber were similar to those used by the belgians when todays headlines scream about savage congolese it is well to remember the true facts of history the truth is that the congolese had a fine civilization of their own much before the europeans came to the region the truth also is that the europeans did not bring civilization to the congo they brought savagery in their torture and mutilation of the congolese in conclusion one must certainly ask who were the civilized and who were the savages history that is true history makes the answer apparent in huge letters reflecting upon harvey wishs the negro since emancipation prentice hall i am struck with the fact that the title is quite misleading this is so because the book is not primarily concerned with the negro since emancipation but with the ideas of prominent negro spokesmen since emancipation i believe a more correct title would be the one mr wish uses as a subtitle in his introductionleadership strategy protestfor in the anthology which follows he presents selected works of negro leaders manifesting these elements at certain times in american history as mr wish states the controversial picture of the passive negro content to let the northern or southern whites decide his destiny and fight his battles simply is not true and is everywhere being challenged of late his selections are from those negro leaders and writers demonstrating this fact and also demonstrating the shadings and differences which existed and do exist among various leaders of the negro movement at any given time in geographically charting these differences mr wish makes something of a contribution to the growing mass of literature about the negro it is generally felt among historians that one has to arrive at historical detachment before one can present a valid history of a trend an era or a culture nowhere is the validity of this theory better proven than in mr wishs book dealing with men and their ideas of years ago mr wish is on very sound ground he presents sharp clear illustrative passages from the men in question clearly supporting the points of view with which history credits them the more contemporary negroes are not so easily handled time has not allowed us to form a perspective on these men and mr wish selects passages from their works which may or may not be truly representative of the thoughts and trends they represent i sympathize with the task which mr wish undertook perhaps his choice of men and ideas is as good as any available at this time it is by no means the final word nor do i think he intended it to be however what is rather unfortunate if not unforgiveable is certain errors which occur for example the march on washington is dated august when in fact it took place on august later in the book the statement appears that martin_luther_king jr found a madetoorder situation to test gandhian techniques this is of course not altogether true first the situation found king he did not seek the situation second there is much evidence to show that king at the time of the montgomery boycotts did not have a clear idea of what gandhian techniques if any he would employ despite my criticism of certain areas of mr wishs work i still feel that it is a very valuable handbook to aid in the pursuit of trends in negro leadership strategy and protest from frederick douglass to booker t washington to du bois and down to the present it is short enough to be read with ease and reliable enough regarding early history to make the effort worthwhilebrooks johnson the white race is your enemy those are pretty strong words arent they your words are mild but your eyes condemn me as something less than human a monster completely lacking in love for my fellow man your eyes condemn me and withdraw into themselves in pity and dismay loath to bear witness to this creature unable or unwilling to acknowledge their part in its creation how dare you judge me how dare you judge me once i was human once i had a dream once i was a trusting infant a giggling child an idealistic adolescent a hopeful parent i tell you this despite the fact that in your ignorance feigned or real you will misconstrue my explanation as a plea for sympathy assaulting once again my bruised pride and leaving me defenseless for though you and your army constantly rail against the remnants of my selfrespect i must not openly defend myself lest i be accused of hallucinating but theres no war you insist why then am i bleeding why am i being crushed in this vise of your whims of your indifference of your fears of your greed of your lies of your inadequacies of my inadequacies of my anger of my frustration of my distrust of the senselessness and insidiousness of this warless war once i giggled at amos and andy at the blackface and huge white lips of a jolson at buckwheat in the our gang comedies at the cartoon pickaninnies and all the aunt jemimas and beulahs i giggled not knowing that i was the pickaninnies not realizing that each delicious ripple of laughter lefan irreparable rent in the cloth of my self respect we laughed at the same things you and i but with opposite effects once i used words like blackhearted blacklist black as sin black mark blackball black sheep black market black friday black magic blackmail white mans burden little white lie pure as the driven snow not realizing that each phrase was a razors edge scraping at the raw flesh of my pride you used the same words but with opposite effect with a swelling of pride a satisfying reinforcement of your inflated sense of personal worth you called me nigger savage and ridiculed my blackness the fullness of my lips my heritage you stole my food and gave me crumbs you stole my clothes and gave me your leftovers you stole my home and gave me a slum but i forgave your thievery and i thanked you for your gifts not realizing that as you strengthened your foothold on life i moved toward limbo i walked through doors those you sanctionedoffice doors restaurant doors merchants doors bus doorsto be met with your stony stare your halfhidden snickers your insults and rudeness and i pretended insensibility and i forgave you for seeing only a mass of blackness where there actually stood a black person or what remained of a person and i thought look at me look at me why cant you see me but you turned your back and again i forgave you not knowing that we were on a battlefield with my pride as the victors prize there were no doors for you only open doorways and smiles and greetings and you lapped it up and your ego swelled and you looked at my people and said in disgust they have no pride i looked at my people and i looked in the mirror and i said in shame we have no pride then you smiled and you said im your friend im doing all i can to help you and you shook our hands and addressed us formally and made promises but we said show us and you regarded us with sad eyes hurt eyes and you said you are too suspicious i looked at my people and i looked in the mirror and i said we are too suspicious and i said again and again as time passed we are too suspicious then i asked are we too suspicious and i answered we are too trusting too blind too deaf too vulnerable too numb the living dead a living death or monstrosity that is our alternative i have chosen monstrosity as have the thousands of negroes who are demanding instead of requesting their rights as have the rebels whom your psychologists label antisocial you have forced the choice you have stood on the sidelines and thrown rocks and closed your eyes and forced the choice there is no happy medium i cannot accommodate you by setting the selfrespect regulator at happy medium too much to become a burden to you yet not enough to resent the role youve assigned me i must guard my selfrespect with all my strength or i will die as many of my people have died as many of our children are dying i must guard against your rocks they have no pride they dont want jobs they dont deserve theyre oversensitive theyre undereducated i must guard against your lefthanded compliments they were just as clean as anybody hes a helluva nice guy but newspaper headlineexperts find no proof of negro inferiority i refuse to keep a mental list of when where and how to speak to whom mr a at the office only mr b in the neighborhood only mrs c anywhere unless shes with friends mrs d a long friendly chat about her family at the office and a nod on the street mr e not at all unless he wants a favor i refuse to allow wellmeaning adults to teach my children to be intelligent swallow your pride and never show anger to have a sense of humor laugh when whites ridicule you to act better imitate whites to feel responsible for every misdeed committed by a negro to take credit for every accomplishment by a negro i must somehow teach them to walk the fine line between gullibility and cynicism though i myself have not yet learned the art i refuse to pleasantly allow anyone receptionist head waiter apartment manager to deny me anything on the basis of race on the grounds that i dont make the rules im just delivering the message they can also deliver my message i refuse to play the caste systemstatus game since i was automatically eliminated at birth as a possible winner and because one of the few advantages of being on the outside looking in is the clear view of the insiders backstabbing bowing and scraping and selling their souls to attain and keep something worthless i refuse to shout yea team and run the ball up and down the field unless i am welcome at the team banquet i refuse to become your yoyo allowing you to jerk me into and shove me out of your life at will i refuse to shoulder all of my responsibilities and have none of the privileges i refuse to believe that you can pinpoint nonacceptance by the family as one of the chief causes of antisocial behavior in the white individual and yet cannot extend this theory to cover a large number of people who are never allowed to forget that they are not really part of the world in which they live i also find it difficult to believe that you are completely unaware of the adverse cumulative effect of years of innocent allinfun ridicule i refuse to pretend that a few jobs a few integrated schools and a superabundance of beautiful words indicate any significant change in your attitude or in our condition i know that as long as my children are constantly infused with your insinuations and accusations of their inferiority they have no hope of gaining full benefit from jobs or education or life i see no possibility of even my grandchildren being allowed to live without stigma because of their race the jews still havent reached this goal i refuse to allow your accusations of oversensitiveness to ever again reduce me to vacillation and inaction i reject your

guilt at my feet and i refuse to forgive or understand you in psychological warfare as in a shooting war it is fatal to pause for philosophical reflection on the enemys plight once i had a dream you murdered it ive buried it collective bargaining the key to a decade ago two groups could be seen marching handinhand in the fight for full equal rights for the negrothe middle class white liberal and the negro civil_rights leader the famous segregated school case provided a microcosm of this community of intereststhe key lawyers were thurgood marshall and robert carter negro and jack greenberg white both black and white social scientists did the background research which helped convince the supreme court to issue its unanimous decision and yet some ten years later the two groups have splitthe negro civil_rights leader bitterly criticizes the middle class white liberal for his hesitance and caution the white liberal stands bewildered attacked by the negro activists the white conservatives and also by his own conscience this conflict stands at the center of much that is wrong with the civil_rights movement in america today for the tragedy is that both sides are right and that a congenial meeting ground has to be reached the main source of the conflict is quite simple the negro argues that he wants his full rights not tomorrow or next week but today since he should have received them yesterday moreover he does not want them as a result of the white mans benevolence but rather because as a human being he deserves them the courts have ruled that he should have them the congress has passed laws asserting these rights and the american conscience demands them the negro correctly questions the morality and the justice of the white community that has taken so long in giving him what should be his since they wont give these rights he will take them and where does the white liberal stand on this issue he too agrees that the negro should have all of the privileges of any other member of the society butand this is crucialthe white liberal in america is basically a pragmatist who believes in certain values and goals but usually feels they take time to be achieved he argues that there should be no poverty today and there is that there should be no threat of war and there is that there should be no prejudice in this world and there is the pragmatic white liberal consequently fights poverty war and prejudice but is under no illusion that these problems can be wiped out today or for that matter tomorrow he hopes to move steadily in the direction of justice but does not expect justice to arrive fully grown immediately and this is his dilemma in dealing with negro rights he does not question that the negro ought to have these rights today that he should have had them yesterday but claims that anyone who argues this way is unrealistic if not irresponsible what must be done is that steps and perhaps the size of the steps and their direction differentiates the white liberal from many white conservatives have to be taken in the direction of full equality but that is all that can be achieved democracy said a famous negro jurist is a state of becoming and to this assertion the white liberal would add his fervent amen and there they stand the two groups who should be working together instead see a widening chasm appearing between them the negro leader shouts bitter epithets and drives for immediate and complete goals the backlash of their drive affects the whites the problem is that both the negro activists and the white pragmatist are right but how to join both approaches is the key tactical issue in the civil_rights struggle one place wherein an answer may be found is in an analysis of amen can history professor howard zinn does this in his interesting article abolitionists and freedom riders the tactics of agitation which appeared in the summer issue of the columbia university forum he offers the abolitionists as a model for the freedom riders todayas a lesson to be learned from history without challenging zinns evaluation of the contribution the abolitionists made to bringing about the end of slavery the ultimate price paid was a civil war but what was purchased with blood was not even equal rights for the negro as the continuing struggle for civil_rights today indicates the blame for the civil war does not rest on the abolitionists but surely the methods used by both sides offer us no lesson that we can learn from the past except how not to resolve basic conflicts if civil_rights agitators today want to learn any lesson from history would suggest that they move from the chapter dealing with the abolitionists over to the one dealing with labor history and learn the tactics unions and management have developed to resolve what some observers once thought would be an irreconcilable conflict between two classes labor unions and workers had to suffer many of the same indignities both legal and ideologicalas the negro in the beginning of american history courts found a legal basis for granting unions no rightsarguing that the very fact that workers joined together to seek benefits made the unions a conspiracy and consequently illegal under the common law moreover society developed a rationale to explain why unions and their members were inferior and not to be accorded the same privileges others in society had first there was the economic rationale if workers joined together to seek higher wages they were violating a dismal law of economicsnamely that workers ought to be paid only enough to subsist if given more they would not really know what to do with it instead they would have more children which would create even greater pressure on a limited sum of money available and this would result in depressions and even worse conditions for the foolish workingmen who did not know their place if this law of economics were not enough darwin provided a biological rationale for fighting unions and for deeming workers inately inferior the socialdarwinists argued that in the struggle for the survival of the fittest obviously those who were at the bottom of the pilenamely workersdeserved to be there while those at the top also merited their exalted level to help the downtrodden either through social welfare assistance or through union activities was to violate a law taken from biology namely the poor who remained poor deserved to remain poor if law economics and biology were not enough to provide an explanation for opposing the rights of unions then religion was called upon judge george baer president of reading railroad in wrote in response to a request that he help end a strike that the rights and interests of the laboring men will be protected and cared fornot by the labor agitators but by the christian men to whom god in his infinite wisdom has given control of the property interests of this country and thus a large share of american society viewed workers and their unions as inferior beings who would receive benefits only as a result of the largesse of management who in a paternalistic fashion might help their workers these managers felt that they and their workers were a part of one big family with papa management knowing what is best for his boys and girls the workers they pictured the union as the villain or outside agitator who would lead their children from accepting their place in society down the unhappy road toward juvenile delinquency and toward becoming uppity once a union arrived these managers felt that unrest developed a peer group outside the home became more important to the children than the parents the fathers powers were challenged the child began to think his goals were not synonymous with those of the parents he even wanted his allowance raised and perhaps worst of all he wanted to have his voice heard in how the family was run but before the worker could have his voice heard through his unions society and management had to accept the role of labor organizations and this proved not easy rarely would a firms executives initiate the steps necessary for negotiating with their employees leaders instead workers had to lash out at management government and society as being part of a conspiracy to exploit the workers even the relatively conservative american federation of labor included in its preamble to its constitution written in these bitter words whereas a struggle is going on between the oppressors and the oppressed of all countries a struggle between the capitalist and the labor which grows in intensity from year to year unions would therefore adopt such measures and disseminate such principles among the mechanics and laborers of our countries as will permanently unite them but words quickly proved insufficient to turn pious platitudes about workingmens rights into realities and as a result laborers launched demonstrations and these strikes though often peaceful were frequently bitter and bloody the explosion at haymarket square the massed battle at homestead and the mob action against railroads in the pullman dispute are just a few instances of the violence that punctuated labor history as unions sought their rights in our society in doing this they often indiscriminately attacked all police all government all courts and all businessmen but fight they did and eventually win they did for by the mids partially as a result of the backlash caused by the great depression which turned liberals and others against management the people speaking through the wagner act came to accept the fact that unions had a right to exist and that the process they wished to use with management to resolve their disputesnamely collective bargaininghad a legal place in our society and should be protected but the passage of the law did not mean that all firms accepted this new condition for a few years following the passage of the wagner act unions still had to fight for the right to organize and the weapon they frequently used was the sitdown strike and mass demonstrations but unions finally assumed their rightful place in our society and most managers however ruefully came to accept this place as the process of collective bargaining has become increasingly institutionalized the bitter conflict once so common has become far less frequent now responsible union leaders negotiate with responsible management representatives and generally come to terms which both sides will accept conflict still erupts but it most commonly arises now under certain conditions when unionmanagement relations in an industry or area are at an early stage for insecurity breeds violence in industrial relations when unions are democratic and the workers can and do refuse to abide by their leaders recommendations when mistakes in strategy are made when no real collective bargaining takes place because one side or the other believes it knows truth and the other does not when either side is not really negotiating with the other but instead issues statements directed toward its own members or the public and when both sides have stronglyheld opposing philosophical commitments on any issue or issues but even with sources of conflict still present unions and management use a process by which despite its faults they can negotiate their differences problems still remain not all workers have their rights protected some of them have even been taken away by the organization structured to protect themthe unions not all workers receive an adequate income not all workers feel secure in their jobs not all workers have ceased to be degraded by the kind of work they do or by the treatment they receive but a process for resolving conflict for protecting rights for bringing about progress has been evolvednamely collective bargaining and what better alternative has there been offered for resolving civil_rights disputes arguments from analogy are full of perils perhaps their main value is that they provoke thought and surely there are many analogies between the fight by workers for their rights and those by negroes for theirs the workers had to face stern opponents who used legal economic biological religious and paternalistic arguments whose goal was to keep employees in their subservient place so has the negro the workers had to use strikes boycotts demonstrations and violence against those who also used similar tactics against them so has the negro the workers had to face complaints that outside influences were leading them astray so has the negro the workers had to learn to cooperate with nonworkingclass liberals in order to secure their rights so has and must the negro the workers had to reject the ideas of those within and outside the labor movement who tried to subvert the justifiable aspirations of the working class into an instrument for bringing about their own vision of a better worldbe it a return to an imagined better society that presumably existed prior to the industrial revolution or as a stepping stone to a marxist revolution so too must the negro reject the reactionary goals of the black muslims and the revolutionary goals of the various branches of marxism now active in the civil_rights groups the workers had to learn to fight and win prolabor legislation but not think it enough so has and must the negro the workers had also to learn that there is a difference between ultimate goals and immediate realities and that there is a process that permits a somewhat orderly progression by which the gap between goals and realities can be narrowed and that process is collective bargaining so must the negro learn this lesson and this is the most difficult lesson to ask him to study for it requires him to accept less than he merits and the difficulty is compounded by the fact that the lesson must also be learned by the white community for negotiating means that at least two sides have to be ready to sit down to talk and to act so far the whites have been much slower than negroes in their willingness to discuss their differences but regardless of what the white appears ready to do the negro has to differentiate between minimum and maximum goals to demand the latter and accept no less than the formerfor example in education all negroes ought to have the opportunity for a completely unsegregated education in fact society in order to compensate for the culturally deprived background of many of the negro children ought to be spending more money on their education than they are on the white children but how does one immediately end segregated education for example in new york city the answer is one cannot one can only move in that direction what does this entail on the part of the negro civil_rights groups since the white community has moved tragically slow when at all it means that the negro groups have to place pressure on the white leadership to sit down and negotiate steps that will lessen segregation as well as improve the educational level of those schools that are and will continue to be predominantly negro for some time to come this entails negotiations that result in an agreement a contract to use unionmanagement terminology that would last for a period so that the education of the children can proceed without the turmoil that has so far often hindered rather than helped the students by this i do not mean that the negro community should accept these terms as final but merely as a meaningful compromise until the next negotiation when increased demands must be made and a still better settlement achieved let us take another exampleemployment the negro unemployment rate is shockingly twice that of the white which also is too high how do we solve this immediately we cannot to say we can is unrealistic and ridiculous even if as a matter of policy firms decide to hire more negroes than whites to compensate for past ill treatment the unhappy fact is that the negro is still inadequately trained for the kinds of jobs that are available consequently instead of demanding that the pie in the sky should be eaten today negro civil_rights groups should pressure management and unions to agree to open doors for negroes for jobs that communities including schools unions firms and all levels of government develop training programs which will teach negroes specific job skills adaptable skills and job responsibility and that the negro community sponsor more of these programs on their own all of these demands require negotiation by responsible leaders capable of coming to decisions that will hold for a while and permit some progress to be made thus what is needed is some process by which groups can negotiate their differences and convince their followers that the compromises accepted are important worthwhile and steps in the proper direction what this means is that on all levels negro and white leadership must be able to sit down and communicate with each other and make some resolution of their differences that will be accepted by both sides for a given period this does not mean that the negro groups should stop talking about maximum demands in collective bargaining one does not start ones negotiations with the minimum one wants but the negro leaders have to be ready to accept less and sell this acceptance in their communities they may be called uncle toms as a result all union leaders at one time or another have been charged with selling out to management and some have but as long as these leaders feel that what they have gained is the best that can be achieved at that time and place and that they have made a major step forward then it is their responsibility to accept the epithets of their followers even though i doubt if they will receive as many as some fear at times these settlements will be rejected for good or bad reasons but this is true of all settlements the fact is that one of the major frustrations facing the negro masses is the lack of progress the lack of settlements the lack of real leadership white or negrowith some notable exceptions some orderly procedure resulting in progress is essential to lessen the justifiable distress within the negro community for rising expectations without any way of really knowing whether these expectations can ever be achieved or without learning what progress has actually been accomplished can only result in frustration that explodes into violence and the resulting insecurity also partially explains the backlash among the whites since they too do not know what is going on but are frightened by the fact that they wander between two worlds one dead the other powerless to be born but a procedure has to be evolved by which the old world that is dead can be buried and that a new world can become mature enough to be born and grow and to secure this negotiating procedure the civil_rights groups have to fight with all their might as this is the one issue concerning which there can be no compromise for it is both the minimum and the maximum the labor movement recognized a similar issue as basic and would not give in concerning it as a result unions fought hard resolutely and met violence with violence for the right to organize to form a union and why not to bring about a marxist society not to bring about land reform and cooperatives but so that their leaders could be recognized as their spokesman and speak collectively for them with management and the government and negotiate terms that would result in improvement of their lot they would accept no less management did not willingly give them this right labor had to fight for iton picket lines and in legislative halls and in this fight they generally had the support of the liberals this too is the main fight that the negro has to wage today he has to demand of the white leadership in every community on every school board in every firm in every union that it be ready to sit down with the negro leaders and negotiate conditions that will bring the negro closer to the full and equal citizenship that he demands and is justifiably his right and these negotiations should not be buried in the human relations committees springing up in numerous communities with power to do naught but advise because consent to the status quo is all they normally do the whites have to represent the white power structure the negro his power structure with some inevitable jurisdictional disputes it would be nice if there were no such differentiated structure but it is a fact that there is to argue for example that the white leaders at this time in history have the interests of all citizens at heart is as nonsensical as the statement that management has the interests of its workers at heart the latter is at best partially true in that many managers do concern themselves with their workers welfare but the executives main responsibility is with other problems and issues similarly the white leader may wish to help his fellow negro citizens but he too has other problems and other interest groups to which he feels responsible these interfere with his often seeing eyetoeye with negroes concerning how to resolve difficulties to argue further that such a collective bargaining structure would inevitably remain with us forever and consequently we will never be able to rid ourselves of the problem because each side will continue to make demands regardless of the need is like saying we ought not to have nations today because if sometime in the future we have world government and with it peace and understanding nations will not be necessaryin fact may provoke problems both arguments are at best utopian and at worst are rationalizations for inactivity moreover the history of collective bargaining indicates another alternativenamely that labor and managements goals and practices will become more and more alike as they have and that bargaining will not be an instrument of conflict but one of cooperation this too could be the final result of negrowhite bargaining until then however people with power have to negotiate with people with power people with responsibility and a willingness to take the lead the credit and the blame have to deal with people having similar characteristics both sides have to be willing to come to terms imperfect terms to be sure and sell these settlements to those whom they represent that sometimes they will fail in this task and conflict may result is inevitable and justifiable for such a procedure will in the long run not end disputes but rather reduce the number of intense conflicts after all for a while this will be a new process in which both sides will be insecure the masses may not agree with the settlement for good or bad reasons there will be mistakes in strategy one side or the other may really fail to bargain and each side may be bitterly and philosophically opposed to the position the other side takes but as we have already discussed this is still true in collective bargaining between labor and management today and yet the process of bargaining does result in major benefits to workers and is one method of institutionalizing and resolving disputes and as collective bargaining is only one course by which employees try to make advances and to settle their problems for example negotiations can only cushion the impact of technological change they cannot solve it so the civil_rights groups have to fight other battles elsewhere in legislative halls and in the courts as examples but collective bargaining between negro and white leadership would permit the stepbystep peaceful progress so necessary today if both groups are not to be so estranged that even if the negroes achieve all the rights they merit the chasm between the groups would be so great and the hatred so intense that progress will have poverty in intergroup relations as its handmaiden and from where will these negro leaders come in some instances the white community must seek them out in others they will arise themselves as they have in the past out of the already active civil_rights organizations the negro churches the labor unions the industrial firms the schools youth groups and the local communities the real problem has been that the negro leader has been unable to point to many concessions or improvements for which he could claim credit and thereby secure the support of the negro community one reason for reverend martin_luther_kings power among the negroes in the south has been that he could point to the role he and his organization have played in securing progress for he has indeed often bargained successfully one negro intellectual pointed to this dilemma when he charged that the riots ought to be part of the message to the white power structure the white power structure itself diminished the influence of the negro leaders by refusing to make the necessary concessions to them this is a must for negroes if they are to retain their influence otherwise the masses of negroes will rise up in disgust and frustration and follow those negro leaders among the black muslims and elsewhere who so accurately reflect this disgust and frustration and offer such simple answers to such complex problems to blame and hate all whites for ones inadequacies and problems is as simple an explanation as to blame and hate all negroes the answer we are proposing is less simple and less satisfying to ask the negro to fight for evolving rather than complete solutions for becoming rather than arriving is not easyparticularly when suggested by white liberals who do not have the problem to solve but the white liberal must strive along with or as a part of the negro civil_rights groups to force the white leaders to be ready to negotiate and to make worthwhile settlements he must do this otherwise the white liberals argument that complete justice will not come to the negro today or as a result or immediate or unrealistic demands becomes only an excuse for inaction an apology for delaythus to bring tomorrow closer to today requires the acceptance by whites and negroes of some procedure like collective bargaining by which differences can be settled and progress made otherwise the sun will stand still in the heaven while both sides struggle below tomorrow will take longer in coming and the price we will pay for this delay is obvious all around us listen know old dear i youve been working for whitey the liberal for five long years now and have only received one raise at the time of the fare hike last year but you mustnt be too discouraged and you did right to tell him go fly a kite with your stingy raise busterbehind his back of course because you couldnt very well refuse the damn thing unless you had some other better place to go to and besides that fare boost had sorta put a crimp in your budget remember but what im really wanting to say is this that here in our affluent society which has an antipoverty war going full blast on paper you simply cant afford to get too uppity because youve got to remember your place in fact being black and female youve got two places to remember one lower than the other if you can possibly get that far down which is why so many of yall walk around all bent over i guess youve been so low so long so you see when you hear the liberal and miss ann telling people why some of our best friends are colored and you know theyre talking about you you ought not to let it get your goat much yes i know youre one of the most overworked characters in history overworked and underpaid too and i know that every time you pick up a book magazine or playbill theres sure to be at least one little thing about the negro maid but really old dear you must learn to bear fame with grace then when the liberal is entertaining the press and he casually mentions his wife whos out cooking the dinner and you who are out bedding down the brats and his filipino man who is out fixing the drinks and then just to demonstrate his wry humor he tells a little story concerning the shoeshine boy who in real life is your yearold husband dont you look mad when you bring the er little darlings in to say good night you smile er i guess grinning is more in tradition that way you just might get one more of them pay raises and then too if you keep the liberal feeling good hes going to go easy on miss ann and she just might give you one more of them dresses of hers i mean they look real nice on you even if you do sorta hafta add a little piece in the side after all if you hold your arm just so nobody can ever tell the difference but to get back to my point and your two places here in our great society which have given rise to the theory that you meaning all yall should be a sort of spiritual sponge for your husband yes thats right they mean punching bag now what im trying to point out to you is this dont you pay that crap no attention when you come home at at night after being on your poor aching feet practically since that morning and racing round like crazy because miss ann imprisoned in her own place which is under the liberals big foot is most certainly going to keep you reminded that you are under her foot and she gets every pennys worth out of you every day you are ready to hit the sack so when you get home and there sits your husband who tells you hes hungry and if you dont hurry up and fix him something to eat hes gonna go up side your head him whos been warming a chair bottom all day only shining a shoe now and then except for that brief moment around noon when he hopped up there and cut them few steps when the liberal flipped him that quarter tip he is going to sit there while you make a hour day well listen old girl you just march on out there to that kitchen and fix yourself a big pot of steaming hot watery grits taking your own sweet time of course and when he comes out there to give you whatfor you let go with them grits and then start working out with that pot believe me old dear you wont hear no more about him going up side your head not ever again and oh yes should the opportunity ever present itself dump some of them grits on old youknowwho will you the loveliest day before i got to be such a sharp and wise fellow of about or i used to visit with my grandfather on his farm every summer we had some pretty good times together and i miss it all but most of all i miss an inner quality of myself thats gone forever but its nothing new its an old story out of a new time i dont know exactly why im telling it and i dont know why you may listen but ill tell it and i hope youll listen as we did every morning on this particular morning we were up before sunrise milking the cows and feeding the animals while my grandmother cooked breakfast when we finished with this work we went in and ate and all during breakfast i kept looking at the rifle that leaned in the corner and caught a straight line of sunlight on the dark blue barrel after breakfast we were going squirrel hunting we had planned it and talked about it as we cut the weeds out of the young cotton and during the two or three days we spent thinning the corn it was an event that we had looked forward to like having ice cream sometimes on sundays after dinner well boy we go see what you can do today he was looking at me smiling and i smiled back and waited with a deep anticipation he was a tall dark man with big shoulders and gray closely cropped hair something in his face was strong and stern but his brown eyes were soft and loving and i respected him and loved him after eating we put the saddle on his horse there was only one saddle i rode bareback my grandmother fixed us a lunch and put it in a flour sack which was hung over the saddle horn and in the cool earliness of the morning we rode off down the road about eight oclock the sun was getting hot but we rode in the shade of the trees that branched out over the road and so it wasnt so hot i looked back and could see our tracks fade out in the red dust behind us my grandfather rode in front and i watched his back and listened to the squeak of the saddle as we went along finally we turned off the road and went into the woods and high above the tall tree tops against a spot of blue sky i could see a strong black bird circling at a tremendous altitude when that passed there were only the green tree tops and the blue sky on the side of a hill that overlooked a misty river bottom we came upon a cluster of old trees that were mingled with large dead and live limbs there were about four or five squirrels playing on the branches we slid down from our horses and walked slowly and as quietly as we could up to the trees we took aim and fired at the same time two fell the others ran into the hollows and cracks in the trees now we had to wait for them to come out we sat with our backs against an old log without saying anything and there were only the sounds of the woods the singing of birds and locusts sounding out clear against the green hot quietness the time seemed to dream away and we waited but the squirrels didnt come out but still we waited and watched the trees and looked out over the river bottom that lay beneath us in a humid hot mist and a wide cluster of dark green tree tops the sun got higher and hotter then one came out we looked at each other and silently decided that i take him i put my sights on him and eased in on the trigger and watched him fall against the ground and then the wait began again after the sixth one it was decided that that was enough it was almost midafternoon and we started back home by another way when we came to a running stream just off the road we had a cool drink and ate our lunch the cold buttered biscuits with the scrambled eggs and ham tasted very good when we finished we just sat there saying very little and watching the water go by four white people drove down the road at first only one of them saw us then they all turned and looked i thought nothing about them they were gone from my mind as fast as the car was gone from my sight we skinned and cleaned the squirrels and rinsed them off in the stream and went on up the road to where it crossed the main highway there was a store there and the white man who ran it asked me if i was a pretty good shot i said i was and he offered to give me a bottle of soda water what kind do you wanta red and i said that was the kind i wanted because that was the kind i wanted at that moment and that was all that mattered to me outside my grandfather talked to some people that we knew and i sat on the running board of their old pickup truck with my old straw hat pushed back on my head and drank my soda water and watched the cars go down the highway i felt fine sitting there in the afternoon shade with a nice cool drink and hearing the voices of the old people as they talked it was a lovely day one of the loveliest ive ever had but as the years have gone by ive learned new things such as a red bottle of soda water is a joke that theres a difference between white people and black people other than the color i learned about lynchings and a lot of other things now theres a second thought about anything red when white people look at me suspiciously they hang in my mind long after they are gone sometimes and now i wonder about the importance of a lot of things that i didnt even bother about at first that arent even important and i know it but they worry me a little sometimes i told this to a modem and educated young man one day and he said ignorance is bliss i think not i said ignorance is hell i knew what he meant but he didnt know what i meant and i didnt want the essential part of a real but dreamlike day to be equated to ignorance what does is mean to be txt an egg what is it l w lik tthese are questions which i am never asked at cocktail parties or in polite company nice people simply do not just walk up to one and ask these questions they are burdened by the fear of offending they would be stigmatized by the wellknown dictum that to ask such questions immediately differentiates the egg from other people they really dont care because they themselves will never have to experience being an egg and in fact they do not wish such an experience to be aware of what its like might cause them to suffer the experience and might cause them to be notsonice people in addition in order to maintain the standards of todays cocktailparty sophistication it is essential to pretend under any circumstances that one already knows all about such things and has no need to ask questions finally i am never invited to cocktail parties if i am present it is not as a guest but as an entertainer and i am purchased not present socially who does ask these questions well some people dothe sociologists for example not all sociologists but only those specializing in the field they come around with pads of paper and pencils and ask a multitude of questions of a crosssection of eggs they then publish a crosssection of the answers in little scholarly journals which may be read by a crosssection of the sociologicallyoriented public but which are more usually read by a crosssection of fellow sociologists specializing in the same field my own uninformed opinion is that such studies do not quite serve the purpose of familiarizing the general public with the real lifestruggle which faces every egg from birth to death psychiatrists ask these questions at least my psychiatrist does he probably knows more about my life than i do because he knows how to interpret my overt thoughts and actions and to discover the subliminal truths which cause me to think and act as i do but then he is also an egg and whatever i communicate to himwhether consciously or unconsciouslyis a professional secret i have been asked such questions by noneggs who are interested in our cause but these are few and far between and they are always marginal noneggs who do not belong to polite society and cannot communicate their knowledge to any but other eggs and equally marginal noneggs then again except in very rare circumstances they also suffer from the fear of offending and differentiating the egg from themselves they are determined to prove that eggs and noneggs are basically the same there are i suppose others who would ask the questions but i have never encountered them so much for that i am avoiding the point of this paper which is to describe just what it does mean to be an egg well to begin with you are born you emerge from the womb and are exposed to life for a while you are coddledim sorry you are cradled and fondled and treated with love and affection by your mother but soon you have to make your own way and thats where the trouble starts you have to make a living somehow so you set out with great ambitions and dreams you have ideals you of all other eggs whove ever lived are going to become somebody you look around you and see your friends having the same ambitions and dreams and ideals surely such a mass of idealists will change the course of history and you will march forward unspoiled towards achievement what happens you have to make a choice you have to choose a way of living and the sad thing is that your choice is not free in spite of what the constitution says you cannot choose to become director of a large company or even plan on aiming someday to be director unless its your own company or one owned by another egg you cannot expect to become president of the country so you give up that dream you cannot really get anywhere in the nonegg world because noneggs represent the majority and you can be so easily crushed broken drained so you look around at whats left open to you you see other eggs going out and you see them regimented boxed sold beaten whipped fried scrambled boiled poached and powdered some achieve a certain distinction but always at the cost of their own personalities the majority are simply cookeddevoured by unthinking noneggs who couldnt care less find me the nonegg who pities or sympathizes with us other than those marginal noneggs previously mentioned and ill show you a saint noneggs do not mind killing us because for them we are not human what else can we do we can degrade ourselves by playing the fool and allowing ourselves to be ridiculously dressed as party favors and easter eggs we are never asked about our own religious preferences we can become the momentary attraction by being rolled roughly across lawns or carried on spoons but again the only outcome of these occupations is tragedy none of us has ever survived such an ordeal in one piece in the end we are a lost race there is not much more to be said we have tried to be patient we have endured torture and ridicule without protest some of us have avoided being broken by the noneggs but not many and of these who have done so most have in the end relinquished their dignity and become rotten adding their foul odor to the stench exuded by all hypocritical noneggs we must resist but we must do so proudly there resides within each and every one of us a rich untapped reservoir of strength the core of our salvation lies within each of us as an individual we can only help ourselves by developing that strength to its utmost by working and striving to become strong tough and rocklike we must take the line of most resistance not the compromising approach which leads to the degeneration and decay of ones internal spirit we must in the final analysis face up to the choice and decide just where and how we are going to overcome thus i urge every egg young and old alike to take up the rallying cry petrify not putrefy as the meek proper a young man who sud denly explodes into vi olent rage in leroi jones dutchman young robert currys performance was widely acclaimed as chicagos most spectacular in quite a spell but ive never thought of myself as an actor said the yearold bundle of nerves and ambition on a recent visit to his native chicago slight and bespectacled curry fidgeted as he confided his desire to be a successful director he discussed plans for directing off broadway productions and explains quite bluntly why he deserted chicago for the big city i dread the thought of new yorkits a dirty placebut it has money life and possibility of recognition he said chicago critic richard christiansen called curry a performer of truth in the review of dutchman he praised the young actors coming to the play with limited acting experience and performing with incredible honesty and stunning power currys affair with the arts dates back to his teens while attending chicagos morgan park high school he had two short stories published in science fiction periodicals at the citys wilson junior college he became president of the poetry club and gained his first acting and directing experience as a member of the schools reputable drama group after wilson it was on to roosevelt university where a musical scholarship brought him within nine hours of a ba in piano and composition his accomplishments also include writing the libretto for an opera as well as two plays basically i want to directi know i can says the confident virtuoso determined to be a director having outgrown ambitions of being a chemist astronomer and pianist curry discusses how some of his earlier interest in science led to directing science contributed logic he says a director must have a sense of casting an imagination he should be scientist artist musician and psychologist he believes the theatre has a new attitude towards the negro today that affords a great opportunity and he would love to direct in tv and write for movies someday but he shies away from all suggestions of acting in either medium nevertheless he is an actor asked if he identified with the character portrayed in dutchman currys personality was transformed yes i did identify and as he explained his expressive eyes and gesturing arms suggested passion not unlike that memorable scene from dutchman when the negro heros frustration and bitterness exuded from him as naturally as springs grass turning green though he will concentrate on directing he does not intend to forsake his writing he admits that reading chekhov inspired the two plays he wrote while in school you find yourself by writing other peoples playsyou copy people till your writing becomes you he adds now i am ready to write myself everybody tries to shatter and shock you these days he continued everybody is afraid to be human curry hopes to complete a book of short stories based largely on the weirdos who have been his neighbors in chicagos heterogeneous hyde park community how does he feel about those weirdos oh theyre beautiful people ultrahuman people i enjoy them a rather human young fellow himself this summer he was cited as one of chicagos best people by a local magazine with talent warmth and abounding spirit he now has invaded the big cityhoping it will be so kind chester himess satirical novel pinktoes grove press has finally made it across the atlantic europeans have enjoyed the civil_rightssex spoof for years but in this country infested with hypocritical ignorant selfrighteous unnecessary censors these delays have become commonplace by now they may be gimmicks used by overzealous ad men who know that you can withhold social philosophical moral or political books from the american reading public without arousing the slightest interest but tease them with a sex book and slavering readers will strain at their leashes to buy it anyway pinktoes is here its not really a novel but as times reviewer sniffed a dirty joke times dainty man neglected to consider that dirty jokes are one of the most ancient and entertaining products of the human imagination pinktoes flaw is not that it is a dirty joke but that as a dirty joke it lacks variety in proportion to its length and it lacks oomph at the punchline but it is funny its one of those books that make people laugh aloud page after page the heroine mamie mason a harlem society matron directs a pack of black and white sex hounds through a maze of bedroom encounters the caricatures of hungup black and white integrationists are shuffled well but unlike a deck of cards you really stop caring what suit they come in mamie herself is a soupedup aunt jemima substituting anatomy hers and her friends for pancakes and like her prototype shes a bit of a servant too letting her dignified lecherous whites act out their fantasies on andor through her negro men and white women work the same routineonly in reverse as it were thats pretty much the ball game of course there is a message all of these characters are debased to the extent that racism has played havoc with their sexual thus total psyches just as it does in real life unfortunately to disillusion those who think pinktoes tells it like it is civil_rights groups do not engage in wideopen integrated orgies as described by himes that would represent an advancement toward social sanity which our society cannot yet make you still have to cool it jackjohn woodford midnight cowboy simon and schuster is about one of that vast army of young american men whoin the years between say and wander free and mostly forlorn over the face of the nation ostensibly seeking thrills but really in search of the solidity of love and love almost always eludes them james leo herlihy the young actorwriter who tells the story of joe buck the midnight cowboy understands his characters lostness and he knows though he only suggests it in this book that the american dream has turned sour for joe buck just as it has for all that endless number of young men like him briefly the outline of joe bucks story is this born very possibly a bastard to a young woman in pursuit of an elusive dream of her own joe is brought up successively by a group of women then by a sexseeking woman named sally buck who joe thinks is his grandmother well brought up is the wrong phrase here joe is sort of left to make his own way provided with food and clothing and shelter and virtually nothing else he is not particularly bright a fact which might not be so unfortunate under the circumstances a bright joe buck might very well have ended up by taking his revenge on a neglectful society joe stumbles into sex and his natural inclination is to want to love the little nymphomaniac then when the yearold girl is taken off to a sanitarium joe briefly makes love to one of the fellows who has befriended him by this time joe has bloomed into one of those tall leanhipped young apollos out of the west and sofollowing a stint in the armyhe heads east from albuquerque by way of houston joes ambition is to service all those rich women around new york who have lots of money and only fairies as potential partners he fails of course he does get picked up by a blowsy dame in a penthouse off park avenue but he ends by giving her of his fastdwindling funds joe gets taken by a deformed little pickpocket named ratso rizzo but in losing his money joe finds someone he can care for he starts to look after the little crippled crook selling his favors for the cause with winter coming and new york already a bust joe decided to go to florida the new promised land taking ratso along ratsc by now is dying and he is gone before the greyhound bus reaches its destination joe buck is alone again but richer now he has cared he has lovedhwf there are a lot of people who feel that the fact that jews have suffered their own kind of suppression and subjugation automatically qualifies them to understand just how the african or the negro feels in a similar situation this is only true to a limited extentcertainly not to the extent that we are led to believe in reading froma sands my son africa sherbourne press in my son africa the author goes to some pains to prepare the reader to accept the fact that as a jewish woman the principal character can fully identify with and understand the rejection pain and special panic of the south african blacks she befriends in attempting to pull this off she relates experiences of her jewish parents and the nazis that there are similarities cannot realistically be denied but they are not exact parallels to the situation facing the black african in south africa in south africa the black african is the majority who is subjugated by a white minority on his own land the horrors that the jews have suffered over the years have been numerous all too numerous but the most heinous crimes have happened in countries to which they have migrated however the african is bullied by migrants to his lands there are perhaps arguments to demonstrate that this is a minor difference but it is a difference and coupled with other differences of degree it makes a rather strong case against part of the authors basic thesis in this book despite w hat controversy the basic tenets may bring on i think there will be less objection to the style of the author her story is rather easily and fastmovingly told in many respects the hand of a woman is very evident in the style but like most good women writers the author escapes the fatal fault of being too feminine in her handling of her effort the book has certain elements of sex violence racism and excitement that are very professionally mixed and strategically deployed to keep the reader interested and entertained the reader comes away with the feeling that he might have been the willing subject of a kind of literary shell game the crucial and central point is that the reader willingly participated and perhaps that is why recommend the book despite some basic uncertainties i still hold for it brooks johnson the one hundredth anniversary issue of the nation is a rich incomparable collection of essays by distinguished american writers and it is worth buying and treasuring for its breadth and depth of concern with those subjects and those problems which exercise the liberal conscience but if not for these reasons this handsome sleek page edition of the famous old weekly is worth buying because of the revelation it offers of the low point to which a great american negro writer can stoop in an effort to justify his posture of aloofness from the negro struggle ralph ellison one of the ablest writers in the world today wastes his enormous talent and energy on a silly apology for his not having spoken out in behalf of the black revolution in almost eight pages in a piece called tell it like it is baby mr ellison succeeds in saying only what he might have said more fruitfully and more simply in a paragraph his message is that the whole racial problem in this country is so complex that he being a sensible and cautious man lacks the audacity to attempt to state what he believes to be its essence thus he continues his subtle aboveitall warfare with those writerswhite and blackwho are engaged in the struggle against racist evil and mr ellisons ridiculous piece should be compared with the lucid human moving article by george w broadfield a different drum describing how this brilliant and highly talented man he designed the first domestic peace corps found his way back from a bitter alienation spawned by the very racism mr ellison pretends he cannot judge it is worth spending to read and compare the two articles but of course there is so much more the authors represented here include howard zinn dan wakefield harvey swados c vann woodward alfred kazin harold clurman and robert alan aurthur among some altogether sometime negro digest contributor john oliver killens black mans burden is represented by a provocative piece of filmland called hollywood in black and white for this special issue the regular editor carey mcwilliams turned over the chair to david boroff who died last may before the special issue was wrapped up the magazine stands as a fine memorial to mr boroffhwf the civil_rights issue is the most significant moral crisis in the history of our country it is a national problem in some respects more crucial to every american than the implications of the bomb in recent weeks the problem exploded in our faces the fact that congress has passed the civil_rights act is not enough each individual must pass his own bill within his heart we are all aware of this whether in a vague sense or with complete consciousness of it the recent outbursts of emotion even in the enlightened liberal north have made this woefully apparent still most americans look at the south and its people as the sole violators of human justice william faulkner was a southerner who happened to be a writer to imply the reverse would be erroneous because the mans writing became what it did because of his background and birthright not in spite of it his life was begun mostly spent and concluded in mississippi a part of the world that is no loneer so much a state of the union so much as it is an emotional idea a symbol of intolerance and social backwardness it is one of the last strongholds of southern resistance to a heterogeneous and assimilated society mississippis dilemma was faulkners dilemma and bill faulkner wrote with an honesty and penetration into his own mixed feelings that few contemporary novelists have equalled there are two critical approaches to such an authors work the social and moral implications contained within or the purely artistic the ageold question of whether or not the writer successfully achieved his object since faulkner was a moralist who felt a compelling need to resolve the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself we should perhaps concentrate on the former consideration in his entire literary career faulkner wrote novels and short stories the vast majority of his writing dealt with the problems of the south not just the racial problem but with the entire social structure that was and still is founded upon memories of precivil war agrarian days and was beginning to crumble in the face of a new increasingly urban and industrialized socioeconomic scheme he embodied the entire deep south within his wonderful and terrible yoknapatawpha county which he created out of his mind and experience and committed to paper his characters lived in yoknapatawpha county they never stepped outside its boundaries except to go to war or to nearby memphis for a big weekend yoknapatawpha is the deep south as faulkner knew it likely enough he knew it better than most as his work when conceived as a whole shows that he never stopped thinking about it the sound and the fury deals with the compson family and their moral destruction the dilemma is centered in jason who despises negroes yet allows himself to be directed by dilsey the housekeeper who has become a mainstay over a period of many years with the compsons jason wants desperately to restore the family to its original status but feels everyone is thwarting his efforts to achieve this goal them new york jews back east are responsible for his poor investments in the cotton market and his kitchen full of niggers forces him to work in a general store so that he can feed them jason does not recognize his own cruelty and depravity he is so smallminded that he is incapable of selfrecognition intruder in the dust contains faulkners strongest statement concerning the negroes and the southern position relating to them lucas beauchamp a thoroughly unlikable and highly admirable negro is about to be lynched for the shooting of a white man a crime that everyone knows he did not really commit despite the circumstantial evidence that exists lucas is an inflexible obstinate individual who refuses to be what his white neighbors want him to be he neither defies nor compromises his composure and dignity infuriate the white citizens of yoknapatawpha county every white man in that whole section of the country had been thinking about him for years we got to make him a nigger first hes got to admit hes a nigger then maybe we will accept him as he seems to intend to be accepted in essence lucass behavior does not in any way reenforce the stereotype on the contrary it contradicts it and fans the flames of guilt lucas is able to endure even in mississippi where he is not only an object of hatred but one of guilt faulkner shows immense admiration for the negros ability to endure and survive the injustices inflicted upon him so mercilessly he is also careful to emphasize the sense of guilt and shame that lies deeply buried in the white southern conscience this is a major part of the dilemma perhaps the essence of it as we see it recorded almost daily in the press the white southerner who deems himself a practicing american and yet does everything in his power to prevent the negroes in his community from exercising their rightsin short from being themselves practicing americansis another illustration of guilt it is a clearcut seemingly impossibletoresolve conflict between reality and dreamthe reality being that negroes as american citizens should vote and the dream of course is the fondly clenched myth of the negros inferiority a myth that proves to be just a little more so with each passing day it is this type of conflict that lucas represents to the white community pragmatic evidence clearly points out that he could not have murdered the man but it would be a relief to see him proven guilty and hanged as it would prove that the negro who refused to follow the stereotype who insisted upon his individuality as a human being was in essence a nigger the negro strength is a primary theme in faulkners writing and should not be overlooked at any time although the sound and the fury was written in faulkner added an appendix to the novel during the late s at the publishers request this addition introduces the members of the compson family from their beginnings in the eighteenth century to the year the reader sees a pattern of progressive deterioration within the family alcoholism insanity incest and crumbling moral strength reduces them to their woeful status at the beginning of the novel the last characters to be outlined are the negro servants luster a man aged who was not only capable of the complete care and security of an idiot twice his age and three times his size but could keep him entertained dilsey they endured the preceding comment makes faulkners respect fairly obvious it is interesting too that the appendix was written so many years after the body of the novel within the book dilsey is certainly the most forceful character the guiding force who keeps the compsons living from day to day in faulkners mind these negroes did endure the appendix is a monument to those negroes who years later were objects of his respect and admiration it is conceivable that he returned to his novel and discovered a striking parallel between dilsey and countless negroes in and around oxford the writers home the appendix then became an amen to his original observation of dilsey and the negroes of oxford mississippi the negro strength is portrayed even more vividly in intruder in the dust by lucas beauchamp who serves as a reminder and example to everyone especially the whites sambo will suffer it of course there are not enough of him yet to do anything else and he will endure it absorb it and survive it because he is sambo and has that capacity to endure and survive but he will not be thrown back decades and what he survives to may not be worth having because by that time divided we may have lost america faulkner shared the dilemma experienced by many southerners the attempt to defend the ideology and ritual of inequality and separation of the races which is rubbed raw by the conscience that knows this defense is inherently wrong the result is a deep sense of guilt shared by enough individual southerners to be considered collective psychologists argue that people conceal their guilt feelings through acts of compensation the most apparent compensation in the south is perhaps the almost blatant southern hospitality and the compulsive need to boast about it this is not a thorough psychological analysis but the concept is sufficient for an insight into faulkners writing william faulkner the writer constantly fought those tangled feelings within the heart of bill faulkner the mississippian like most southerners he gloried in the past the legends and myths of the old south meant a great deal to him the past was also his source of guilt slavery lynching and violence are all a part of the past that the southerner both longs after and tries to evade these factors constitute the southern dilemma that faulkner so desperately tried to portray in his writing it is because he was a southerner first and a writer second that he spoke so eloquently for his people even those who attacked him as a nigger lover he held a strong conviction that the south could and should solve her own problems concerning racial tensions thats why we must resist the north not just to preserve ourselves nor even the two of us as one to remain one nation because that will be the inescapable byproduct of what we will preserve which is the very thing that three generations ago we lost a bloody war in our own backyards so that it remain intact the postulate that sambo is a human being living in a free country and hence must be free thats what we are really defending the privilege of setting him free ourselves which we will have to do for the reason that nobody else can since going on a century agothe north tried it and failed so it will have to be us soon now this sort of thing the possibility that lucas beauchamp will be lynched wont even threaten anymore it shouldnt now it should never have this presents a lucid insight into the white southern position we can see that the southerner knows that his society is warped and functioning out of joint we can see that faulkner is brutally aware of the dilemma for he does share it with his fellow citizens like all southerners he was a product of his segregationoriented environment it would be a romantic falsehood to assume that bill faulkner did not have at least a particle of jason compson in himself how much we will never know and then a yankee will talk your head off about niggers getting ahead get them ahead what i say get them so far ahead you cant find one south of louisville with a blood hound because when i told him uncle job the negro handyman about how theyd pick up saturday night and carry off at least a thousand dollars out of the country he says dont begrudge um i can sho afford my two bits two bits hell i says that dont begin it how about the dime or fifteen cents youll spend for a damn two cent box of candy or something how about the time youre wasting right now listening to the band dats de troof he says well ef i lives twell night hits gwine to be two bits mo dey takin out of town dats sho then youre a fool i says well he says i dont spute dat neither ef dat was a crime all chain gangs wouldnt be black jason of course merely concludes that negroes are worthless and that northerners do not know the black man as intimately as southerners who by and large claim to know those people part of the vast defense mechanism built to support the whites behavior and actions faulkner is careful to inject his opinion in the ironic remark of uncle job there would indeed be plenty of whites breaking rock if being a fool were a crime faulkners inner belief in the equality of the negro never completely asserts itself he states his belief in equality but continuously resorts to white southern platitudes in an attempt to give valid reasons for the racial injustices that occur in mississippi his attempt to reconcile his attitudes is admirable however it is this very attempt that made him the artist that he was his effort to understand the negro as a human being was a lifelong struggle as an outsider he could only walk around the negro mind and catch an occasional glimpse into it we can detect this effort in the portrayal of lucas beauchamp who out of necessity has built a wall around his true feelings lucas is neither defiant nor obsequious he is not arrogant at all and not even scornful just intolerant inflexible and composed faulkner strove desperately to come to grips with his dilemma he knew that the negro was equally entitled to freedom and justice but william faulkner the writer was after all bill faulkner from mississippi the dilemma can be traced not only through history and contemporary events but through literature mark twain portrayed it vividly in huckleberry finn in this novel we see jim the runaway slave and huck as friends both of whom are running away from civilization yet huck cannot rid his mind of the idea that jims blackness marks him as inferior after playing a cruel trick on jim huck feels that as a friend he must apologize then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there without saying anything but that was enough it made me feel so mean i could almost kissed his foot to take it back it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humble myself to a niggerbut done it and warnt ever sorry for it afterwards neither both twain and faulkner knew that the idea of negroes being subservient was completely wrong although twains preoccupation with race was far less severe than that of the latter faulkner as far as can be told was aware that the negro was equal and should be treated as such the statements made in intruder in the dust would certainly indicate this however his characters are not able to reject the idea that negroes should know their place if he would just be a nigger first just for one second one little infinitesimal second these words are spoken by yearold chick mallison whom faulkner places in much the same position in which twain places huck both boys must struggle with their consciences both boys are violating the mores of their society in attempting to help a negro it is impossible to credit faulkner with a final solution to his dilemma he never arrived at one as a southerner he had a strong pride in his birthright an awesome feeling for the land the crops the woods the nearby delta region and the tense silence that the smalltown and rural southerner feels in a way that few other americans do he also felt the dark shameful side of his heritage that produces a builtin sense of inferiority in so many southerners as a writer he not only shared these feelings with his fellow mississippians but probably felt them even more intensely a recent article in time magazine which used faulkner for its cover stated his dilemma with wonderful clarity for him the crime of the south was chattel slavery and the white mans denial of the negros equal humanity was an ineradicable curse on the land and its people ever since faulkner argues the white southerner has been burdened by a crippling unacknowledged guilt as intimate and inescapable as if taken in with the milk of his motheror of the negro wet nurse intruder in the dust indicates that the negro is a living breathing reminder of the white mans guilt lucas beauchamp becomes the symbol of the guilt that all white men feel when they look upon him or any negro lucas beauchamp once the slave of any white man within range whose notice he happened to come now tyrant over the whole countrys white conscience no writer in our time knew the south and wrote about it as vividly and as searchingly as william faulkner he never solved his own conflict any more than the south has of now perhaps his insight and honesty can be summed up by another statement from the time magazine article he desperately urged his fellow southernersand himselfa change of heart he never on the evidence quite managed that change himself but if he left a message and a legacy it was to urge upon his fellow southerners and the nation the imperative necessity for that change william faulkner is no longer in this world in the physical sense of the meaning of life but his writing lives on and will no doubt survive as long as literature exists as a valuable part of mans cultural and emotional experience now perhaps more than ever before his novels and short stories take on their true meaning and stand apart from all others in their honesty and their urgency the man is dead the dilemma is still very much in the minds of men and for this reason above all others perhaps we should all read or reread william faulkners wordsand take them to heart the world of jazz has long been racially the most completely t integrated segment of american society the beat move ment taking its cue from the jazz world in this as in many e other respects is likewise racially integrated from the enc j aves of the sexual underground it is no exaggeration to refer to this influence as the negrification of american morals the american negro was for years or more proselytized by the christian churches particularly by the protestants in the south where the negro was in chattel slavery for all but the last years of that time the preachers performed the role assigned to them by the slaveholders to keep the negroes in a state of chattel slavery to convince them that this was the status allotted to them in holy scripture that the slaveholders were their divinely appointed masters and that any revolt or even secret grumbling was a sin against god and his dearly beloved son jesus christ along with these preachments went the whole bag and baggage of the judeochristian moral code and the negroes were warned on pain of eternal damnation to a hell of fire and brimstone and unending tortures to observe the moral code of christianity and forget their tribal sexways to this end families were broken up as a matter of calculated design and the result was a successful eradication of language and customs but ancestral lifeways are not so easily stamped out the negroes accepted the christian religion which had been forced upon them but they could not help imbuing their own version of it with characteristics which can to this day be traced to african sources they also put their own stamp on the ritual and liturgy of the church giving their worship an unmistakably erotic emphasis that is especially prominent in their music the negro spirituals gospel singing and the blues which followed became important elements in the growth of jazz these influenced white musicians everywhere in the country it strongly affected not only their music but their lifeways and sexways as well and always in the direction of a more natural expression of sexual needs and drives in the early fifties all these influences culminated in the renaissance of poetry and later in prose which was called the beat movement and is now simply referred to as the new writing the role that jazz plays in the sexways of the beat enclaves is crucial in early new orleans the name of the music is lost in the shrouds of mystery that still cover most of the negro history in america in the middle west and in other parts of the country among the white population jazz became very early a synonym for the sexual act jazz me blues is one title which suggests that the words jazz and the sex act were indeed synonymous in early usage the negroes under constant surveillance for anything that might be used against them by their plantation masters and afterwards by the klan and the police were accustomed to disguising their meanings in language even in their private conversation nevertheless the erotic element comes through not only in their blues songs but in their dance and their instrumental music the blues were couched in language that everyone white and black alike could easily translate into words of common usage when music is used as a way of breaking through inhibitions and releasing the life force of the libido it has the effect of a religious catharsis not unlike that of ritual drama this is one reason why the censors and religious bigots react to jazz with fear and fascination bigots are awkward and guiltladen their arms are knives their fingers all nails when they try to make love they hurt each other they torture themselves with shame and pride with time clocks and unattainable ambitions they drag themselves over miles of broken glass and stone themselves with false confessions their usual remedy is to throw themselves on the analytical couch or sneak away to peep shows and stag affairs and burlesque houses jazz presents them with too direct a challenge to face headon it entices them to muscular and sexual reactions they cannot admit even to themselves let alone display openly on a dance floor they prefer to think of it as below their cultural standards as sin and sexual depravity in their african origins the musical rhythms and the dance movements from which jazz originated in part were part of the sacred tribal dances as a sacrament it enjoyed the sanction of the group it had the force of religious magic and social consensus not in the eyes of missionaries and white overseers of course to the slave traders we may be sure it was nothing more than pagan superstition unworthy of serious study something to be stamped out as heresy in the eyes of every good christian jazz is still under a cloud in fundamentalist circles it is still confined for the most part to night clubs and theaters only its cleanedup forms in the hands of white musicians are fully accepted in american musical circles many negro musicians have crossed over and disowned the erotic origins of their music at least within hearing of their white agents white music critics and white audiences in many circles however white and black it still remains a secret music with an erotic mystique of its own in fiction the subterraneans by jack kerouac offers the best treatment of the effect of jazz and the liberating effect of negro morality on the american youth kerouacs description of the people in the beat underground of san francisco in the fifties is found on page one of the book julian alexander is the angel of the subterraneans the subterraneans is a name invented by adam moorad who is a poet and a friend of mine who said they are hip without being slick they are intelligent without being corny they are intellectual as hell and know all about pound without being pretentious or talking too much about it they are very quiet they are very christlike nowhere in america has negrowhite integration become more complete than in the subculture of the beat enclaves as the definitive solution of americas race problem the mattress solution as portrayed in the subterraneans and in all of the prose and poetry of the beat leaves little to be desired nowhere is the negrification of american morals portrayed with greater candor with all its heartaches and successes than in the work of the beat writers it reveals a world in which racial prejudice on every level is no longer a problem for white or black historically there has never been any successful solution of the problems of nationality race religion or color that was not sexual in character it is becoming clear that the us will be no exception jazz music was indeed the opening wedge toward the mattress solution in the us its enemies among the racial bigots north and south were perfectly right in fearing this would be the caseliberation from the antisexual judeochristian ethos may yet prove to be attributable as much as anything else to the influence of the negro in america this influence along with the retribalization of american society through the formation of enclaves of sexual and social experimentation may well be the decisive ones in the making of the new morality in his novel go john clellan holmes attempted a clinical diagnosis of the beat generation which was to become the nucleus of the beat enclave in his novel get home free holmes carries a similar story on into the sixties it is the story of dan verger and may delano who are trying to put off the whole armour of god and achieve orgastic potency in and out of bed by overcoming the character attitudes and the muscular straitjacket of sexual repression which still inhibits them and keeps them from experiencing the apocalyptic orgasm they expected always anticipating the gun salute and worried if it doesnt happen as rollo may describes it disappointed by the failure of their efforts each goes homedan to

millions who are too late for this world and too soon for the future a significant passage in get home free is the one in which paul hobbes a white disaffiliate from new york who has come to louisiana to find sexual liberation from a scrupulous christian upbringing encounters a yearold blind negro blues singer of whom he says to may im just studying with him in a waylike i used to study with irwin edman youre crazy i said with a laugh i hope was warm but dont you ever miss new york every time i go into brentanos i expect to see you hiding among the textbooks sometimes when it rains but he was staring at turtles glistening blonde pageboy and the carefully folded monogrammed handkerchief with which tp was surreptitiously wiping the perspiration from his forehead and at lawtells college ring and emmys charm bracelet but then orkie at which he snapped back with the old rather naive almost schoolboy eagerness in his eyes that had once made all of us unkindly call him the cheerleader but say what do you think of him though isnt he great hes just nineteenorchid small thats his given name you seeorchid yes actually so everyone calls him little orkieand hes got a strange touch with flowers tooi mean they seem to understand himhe tends someones garden for moneyyou probably know them i cant rememberbut i stick with him thats what im saying growing confused and pausing to gulp at his new bottle but what he was singing there its all all rightremember he says that all the time when you ask him when you talk about things no need to shake hobbesy he says and he means dont worry dont get nervous dont shiver that way laughing in the middle of it to hear how silly it sounded but thats what he believes i mean about everything so just go along waiting for him to show methis yearold nigra the word sounding curiously ugly because he had no drawl no but really im just studying with him in a way like i used to study with irwin edman he wiped his palm over his grizzled cheeks blinked sniffed and stared at me with a trace of his old embarrassment well get to the end of my mind these days and theres nothing else to do but sleep so you and dan didnt make it eh so pointed a change of subject that i felt called upon to explain in a few sentences well you know dan all those new england preoccupations he cant swing loose from them he cant stop caring i mean youll be drunk and happy and then hell say but can ail this lead to a new morality it just got pointless he came out of the bathroom shirt back on but unbuttoned an indefinable languor to the soft pad of his sneakers though he looked sick to his stomach and his hands shook as he lit a cigarette oh wellpahpah lets see no not working why it was surfeit i suppose i got surfeited he glanced at the sign over the bureauhis selfconscious motto his reminder of something he easily forgot do i know nature yet he murmured by rote do i know myselfno more words i bury the dead in my belly staring at the sign reflectively and my arm he added with a little wince and then looked at me with a gloomy smile rimbaud i was always taught to identify sources its the hardest habit of all to break the sign of a ghoulish civilization i mean ephesus and rotterdamseparated by twentyfive centuries and yet theyre both just unpiled stones when you think about it no but surfeit he repeated brushing the tangle of hair off his forehead thats the word i got surfeited with literature and surfeited with politics and surfeited withwell just words you know for six years i read four newspapers a day i kept up i cared i squandered my nerves shaking his head and sniffing the way you do when you remember the obsessive emotions of an old love affair its funny to think about it now i used to be positively melancholic because of the czechs or the bantus or someone honestly i mean it as if he were confessing to a folly of which even he could not quite believe he had ever been capable but you want to know something sometimes when im alone or very hung over or prescient from wearinessthe way you get sometimesi think were all going to wear ourselves out here in america just burn ourselves right up i have this vision of the nerves of america all the butchered ganglia the flayed tissue the teeth ground to powder in the night the cindery brains that are starting to run amok from the tension of life here now and i find myself thinking that well never make it in this century because weve lost touch with somethingsomething wild and natural call it bliss or reality a capacity for spontaneous love whateverbut its the only thing that can renew the consciousness when its exhausted by anxiety and i get scared real fleshfear my body telling me to stop something before i go too far rubbing his forearm painfully so i suppose what im really doing is searching for the natives for the lost america but like a schweitzerinreverse you see because i want them to help me because really only rebels and oddballs and outcasts can still feel freshly any more the ones the general and his crowd who are the deacons of the last american church social dont care aboutwho represent no power or influence and have no public interests and dont really give a damn about abstractionsthe one who are still free enough to perceive the wonder in whats left of the flower blinking selfconsciously at his own rhetoric and sniffing wella drunken sleep on the beach thats best followed by a sheepish smile see i never did get over quoting other mens truths i quote orkie the same way these days how could i describe it or the incalculable aura of careless anarchy and underground freedom of whim which pervaded it it was as if you had gotten beyond all eyes at last all restraints all codes all dreary necessities and reached that oasis of overripe green and sensuous shadow that exists somewhere in every deserteven a desert as limitless as our lockstep ageand had nothing but yourself and whatever was inside you all that rich mystery of individuality that the penitentiary of modem society is bent on narcotizing to rely on a strange excitement tinged with unease roused in me no mere wisecrack would arm me here let joy remain confined mumbled hobbes pedantic throaty voice from somewhere i couldnt see thats what the general would say if he could only speak cause joy smells of body odor and irresponsibility it stinks of the unreconstructed individual who wont play bingo and that could wreck the republic it could level topeka giggling to hear himself for dan and may the search ends in failure except for one thing they know now why they failed that the search for the new morality was too much for them that they are doomed to be among its casualties not its successes the erotic revolution offers no guarantee of success to anyone the search for the new morality claims its failures but it also rewards its successes it is the function of the writer to mirror both with fidelity and devotion to truth if the stories of failure are more numerous in contemporary fiction than the stories of success it is because most experiments are failures in sexual morality as in everything else for some as we have seen sexual experimentation is not as difficult as it is for others as the judeochristian ethos continues to lose its grip on our educational institutions on government police and the law as its vested interests fall into decay and its diehard defenders retire from their rearguard positions through defection or old age the new morality will show a higher and higher percentage of successful experiments until no one will think of them as experiments any longer and the vision of the new poets and mythmakers of today will finally be seen as a prophecy of the new lifeways and sexways of tomorrow mama george frederick whispered when we gonna stop and rest sweat was running in little rivulets between patches of hair down to his brow and she noticed he needed a hair cut wheres your hat georee frederick i dont know he shrugged his shoulders i couldnt find it when we were leaving libby frowned at him and swung the baby onto her shoulder carefully pulling the ragged flowered bonnet over his face to keep out the sun if he had a hat at least nobody could tell he needed a haircut she looked down at the children who clustered around her wishing she could hurry up and see the while peeling sign that said health clinic all she saw over the tops of the childrens heads was the fiat dusty road and the grayish red dirt that settled between the toes of her sneakers and made her childrens canvas sneakers stiff with grime mama im getting tired wicker caught hold of her hand and tried to slow her down were almost there now she said when we get up to the filling station well rest and dont any of you start begging me for a coke either we cant afford none the small group of children looked at her sadly cant we even split one wicker asked his mother patted the baby on the back and ignored him the little group walked along much slower than before and a few yards ahead libby could see the curb of the service station and the row of chinaberry trees that lined the turn oft stopping at the esso station always made her feel a little uneasy back when she was first married and hal was still going to school some he used to work there after classes still the station was a good halfway place to stop on the way to town and the kids liked to see the cars go up and down on the elevator she walked slowly changing the baby from arm to arm but before she could settle him comfortably on her shoulder they were at the station the children ran immediately to the trees and played under the dark green leaves that made a pleasant canopy of shade she sat on the curb far away from the main working area rocking the baby who had started to fret the baby was a solid lump in her lap and she was too hot even to care libby watched her children who now that they could rest were chasing each other around the chinaberry trees she was just sitting still staring down at the curb when she saw matts grinning face and waving hand pointing toward her in school matt and hal had been best friends when matt graduated from high school the white man mr sommers had kept him on at the station he had a good job and she used to go with him in elementary school last summer matt sent them an invitation to his wedding when he married that girl from chesterfield county but she couldnt go because they didnt have any extra money to buy presents she watched matt look around to see if any customers were coming and then he bypassed the gas pumps to the curb where she was sitting he stooped and peeped at the baby sure nice he takes after you as if he had spoken a magic word calvin smiled and his dark eyes followed the oily finger that matt swung over his head that boy of yours come back he asked suddenly becoming serious she shook her head no you know where he is again she shook her head that damn son but before he could finish libby pulled his arm and pointed to the children who had stopped playing to watch their mother i dont want them hearing none of that the children stood waiting until their mother shooed them away hasnt sent you any money either i bet matt squatted on the curb beside her if you need anything right now you jet me know and if you dont hear anything from hal soon you see those county people we dont need to be on no welfare she interrupted hell anybody can be in trouble for a while beside you got to feed those kids i got me a job working in town she tried to keep her voice from breaking your mamas not going to keep that baby forever shes getting too old to be picking up after little children thats not your business libby answered quickly nobody told you to get mixed up in my business all right all right matt stood and in the sunlight he appeared as a black shadow hovering over her and the baby but if you need anything promise me youll let me know libby sat on the curb not looking at him trying to keep her tears from falling on the baby shed promised herself she wouldnt be bothered thinking about hal and here she was crying like a fool baby while she sat still letting the heat dry her tears matt treated all four children to soft drinks he made meetrie bring one to her and then they were ready to start walking again f v the county clinic was on the second floor of the courthouse building as the children climbed the steps she tried to freshen them up sticking in wickers shirt tail and trying to keep hamlet still enough to brush the coca cola from his pants not until she passed a clear glass pane on an office door did she see her own reflection the shoulder of her cotton dress was wet where the baby had burped she herded the children together and let meetrie lead them up the stairs past the main waiting room into the cubby hole that served colored nine other people were in the waiting room ahead of her and there were only two seats left she took one chair and meetrie and wicker squeezed into the other seat libby reached over wicker who was leaning on the chairs arm and picked up a copy of the post the magazine was the same one she had read when wicker had hay fever maggie haliday one of the maids in this building told her once that the magazines were only put in here when the white people were finished she saw a life on the other side of the room but didnt feel like walking to get it or to start up one of the children all of whom had chosen this moment to be quiet she looked around at the other people waiting to see the doctor trying to decide if she knew any of them one of the women the one with the hair in little sausage curls reminded her of hals aunt but of course she wasnt hals aunt lived in bethel the woman looked up at her and smiled libby smiled back all these children yours the woman asked yes libby turned calvin around in her lap this one she said pointing to meetrie will be ready for school next year one more off your hands the lady began chuckling but i guess youll have enough on you anyhow the woman had a thyroid condition she said and whatever the doctor gave her didnt do any good last night shed had one of those attacks and the first thing this morning shed come to this place and look at her shed been here since eightthirty and already it was eleven minutes to ten while she talked a nurse came in and asked who was next a pregnant woman stood and shuffled toward the gate that separated the waitingroom from one of the inside offices when the woman was safely inside the office the nurse turned and pointed a finger toward libby you she said in an expressionless voice keep that child out of the ashtray libby turned in time to see george frederick digging in the sand of a tall cement ashtray she was too embarrassed to do anything but grab him and sit him down beside her the other children were becoming restless now and she knew that if the doctor didnt see them soon they would be a problem in such a cooped up space all your children sick the woman asked her libby sensed that she just wanted someone to talk with no theyre pretty healthy she said mr johnson said positively meetrie couldnt go to camp unless she had some kind of shot he said with the others running around outdoors all day they should get shots too guess the nurse will know what to give them she doesnt look old enough to be off from home by herself in response to the womans thoughtful stare meetrie began wiggling in her chair oh shes not going away from home shes just going to day camp mr johnson he works with the community fund got her a scholarship she said proudly white folks are always packing off peoples children to camp seems like they could think of something better to do with their money libby nodded and both women were silent your husband work around here no hes working up state how come he left you by yourself suddenly libby was tired of listening to the woman she certainly wasnt going to get a complete stranger mixed up in her life calvin here was too little to travel so i stayed with the children her words were curt but the woman paid the tone no attention guess you miss him but with all those children its a good thing hes up north working i bet he sends you more money than he brought home when he was working here libby did not say anything but shifted calvin to her other shoulder and picked up the old copy of post from her usual way of feeling time pass she guessed they had been sitting in the waiting room for over an hour a man with a swollen foot began smoking and since there was no ventilation unless the door stayed open cigarette smoke hung heavily in the air she wanted to ask the man to stop smoking because the baby was coughing but he was so much older than she that finally libby decided to walk up and down the hall to get some air she ordered george frederick and meetrie to watch out for the younger children and walked out the door she had just started down the hall a second time when the same somberfaced nurse stuck her head out the door immediately libby was conscious of some one sniffling your kids in here raising sand the nurse said we ask you people not to deposit your children in the waiting room when only ones sick why dont you leave the rest home meetrie started it she heard wicker say just as the nurse shut the door she saw meetrie lean over and kick george frederick then meetrie fell on top of the boy and began pounding him with her skinny fists meetrie libby screamed get off that floor she looked for some place to put calvin afraid to put him on the chair because he might roll off george frederick was still on the floor and she hated him for pretending to be hurt quickly she bent down to pull up both children and almost dropped calvin george fredericks yellow pants had splotches of dirt from where he had rolled on the floor she pushed the children together and made them sit in the chair the funny thing was that they hadnt disturbed anyone in the waiting room everybody sat quietly hoping to be called in to see the doctor libby felt the minutes ticking away wishing that some of the people in the crowded waiting room would leave and come back tomorrow if the nurse didnt call for them soon she knew theyd have to go home she hadnt thought to bring anything for a lunch and they couldnt afford to buy anything out of the cracker machine libby could hear feet moving around in the next room and each time the footsteps approached the waiting room she felt her muscles becoming tense the children were getting edgy and george frederick had started sucking his thumb the same hand that had scooted in and out of the sand she started to reach out and remove his thumb but decided that at least this way he was quiet she raised forward on the edge of her chair to relieve the strain on her back feeling the cloth of her dress stick to the plastic back of the chair calvin had fallen asleep but he seemed to be heavier when still libby knew he would be hungry when he awakened but there was nothing to feed him that she could afford she found herself offering a prayer to be next feeling that right now she would promise god anything if she could hurry up and leave this clinic it occurred to libby that thinking and dreading today so much probably made her nervous her mother was bound to ask if hal had sent her an anniversary card and all this week shed expected to hear something from him then this morning came and she stood ten minutes on the front porch waiting for the mailman who rode by without even leaving one of those advertising circulars she felt her stomach grumble and swallowed hard to stop the noise if she was hungry she knew the children soon would be begging for something to eat as a last resort she decided to think only of happy things but that too was impossible everything she thought about seemed to have happened after she was married and not before she looked down at the baby remembering when she had sat in this room pregnant with meetrie it was in the hospital that her mother seeing meetrie for the first time had slipped her own bent wedding ring onto libbys finger because hal had not yet bought her one she looked down at her finger seeing the narrow gold band dull after six years sometimes she felt that she had a wedding ring and that was all in the middle of her thoughts she was aware of someone pulling on her sleeve mama wicker whispered i gotta go to the bathroom get meetrie to go with you and unbutton your pants meetrie looked up at her mother i dont want to go in there all by myself libby didnt much blame her the lightbulb usually was out in the toilet and regardless of the disinfectant the room smelled awful mama i gotta go bad wicker was standing on one foot and then the other libby stood and grabbed him by the hand she couldnt take all the children with her or she would lose her place in line yet if she left them alone they were bound to start up something the toilet for negroes was all the way down in the basement and if she didnt get wicker there soon he was likely to wet right in the middle of the floor suddenly the woman she had talked with earlier was at her side you take him on downstairs she said picking up calvin and ill watch them up here and save your place libby smiled her thanks and hurried wicker from the room knowing that george frederick would have to go by the time she returned she pulled him along coming back upstairs libby walked so fast her legs ached when she reached the second floor she couldnt risk having the little boys see all those candy and snack machines maybe if they didnt see food they wouldnt be hungry the big clock over the main door read twelvefortyfivethey already had been waiting over three hours after the lady had been so nice to take calvin libby felt she ought to introduce herself im alma courts the woman answered and he was a real sweetheart she settled in her chair expecting libby to continue their conversation although talking to mrs courts helped time pass libby didnt want to be questioned too closely she found her place in the old magazine and began reading she had not finished the first column when the nurse popped her head inside the door you people go on home and come back monday she said huh a man said and a few people raised out of their seats cant come back on monday his voice was joined by a chorus of me neithers libby stared at the nurse as if the woman were crazy and she wanted to knock that silly starched cap from her head she coudnt come back on monday and bring all of them there was no telling when shed have another saturday off the nelsons hardly ever went away for the weekend the doctors are leaving early the nurse continued as if no one had interrupted her speech you come back on monday and theyll try to see you then she closed the swinging door and the people in the waitingroom heard a key turn in the lock well aint nothing we can do the man with the swollen ankle said cept come back i already lost three days off the job dont guess one more day will make no difference he stood and grimaced in pain shifting his weight to the foot that was not hurt libby stood and immediately the baby began hollering she felt his rubber pants and saw that they were heavy there was nothing to do but change him in the waitingroom mrs courts looked at her sympathetically and wiped calvins slobbering mouth with a slightly soiled kleenex sometimes i wonder why more of us aint dead i could of had an appendix going loose inside me and it wouldnt made no difference to them you know anybody going to fir town libby spoke loudly enough for everyone in the room to hear no mrs courts said dont kuovv nobody with a car going that way since no one else seemed to be paying her any attention she stationed herself by the door nobody was going even part of the way in her direction libby prodded george frederick forward and handed meetrie the diaper bag to carry down the steps the clock on the first floor said twothirty the wrong time of day for her to try and catch a ride nobody she knew who worked in town got off from work before four on saturdays she hustled the children out the door and headed toward the corner while they were walking meetrie pulled away from her side and started to run across the street libby gave the child a jerk that almost made her lose her balance meetrie stood still rubbing her arm and looking as if she might burst out crying libby knew that when one child started up the others also found something for which to yell she bent down and touched meetries head waiting anxiously to see if meetrie would stop sniffling for an instant libby thought about keeping straight up the main street and walking around the shopping center she hadnt been window shopping in ages but keeping up with her children wasnt worth the trouble of seeing new clothes besides it was way past time for them to eat and the sooner they passed somebodys peach tree the better she shifted the baby to the other arm caught hold of wicker who was walking slower than anyone else and started home ooden bridgelandmark it hoods the narrow stream poking out of the neck of the lake like an ear out of the past two boys and a little girl running down the road toward the crossinggiggling they stopped running hey yawl the bigger boy yelled better keep up else i run off and leave you on this side he zigzagged once in a while across the road rubbing his rolledup sunday school lesson along a dilapidated fence that ended abruptly when the road sloped downward you know what happen if we dont cross all three together he picked up a rock and threw at a bunch of blue jays squawking in the trees talkin bridge talk a spelt on you hey bubba the shorter boy whispered he was dressed in a faded pair of pants from his back pocket a broken slingshot dragged the ground every once in a while he picked up a stone examined it and added it to a bulge in his pocket he wore a dirty brown shirt with a worn collar and the brown of his skin blended with the shirt what asked bubba wait for me the little girl her thin blue dress splitting slightly at the waist seam skipped to keep up vaselineshiny braids hugged her scalp in neat lines she watched the birds more than the boys down the hill a mocking bird lit in the road just for a second then flew away across the water what you want hey look he said tucking in the slingshot and nodding toward the girl lets do somethin what lets he pointed toward the bridge lets throw essie in the water it was a quiet area the feeling one got was like the feeling that comes when one is standing beside a still pond staring at a school of hungry minnows here where the rotting planks stretched over the life in the green water distance broke through and for a while north and south and east and west filled the eye naw just for fun whats the matter w you jimmy croon the south end of the bridge gaped open like a mouth out of it the road leaped downward undulating into the low country like a tired tongue the heat of the louisiana summer pressed in upon the bridge buckling it and sometimes making it squeak ah you scared taunted jimmy naw i said then watch this you push my sister jimmy croon and ill whale your head lets scare her naw you must think

emmett till bubba was silent he fell in line beside essie touch me and bubba hit you back she said cocking her head away from jimmy who smirked and menaced her with an extended palm she skipped out in front of the boys the bow of her dress flopping loose with her bounce hey said jimmy throwing his arm around the shoulder of bubba who pushed it off lets see if this ole bridge talk a spell on essie when she go over bubba pushed him off the road jimmy sprang back elbowing bubba in the side they began to snicker jimmy broke away and ran toward the bridge saying say goodbye to your sister and pushed her off the road as bubba leaping after him shouted if catch you you dead stay off the bridge essie jimmy laughed loudly and scampered onto the wooden planks essie whimpered and locked her lips she halted a few feet away from the bridgethe thin noon shadow of an oak sliced the front of the metalbraced rails and cut the planks travelling at an angle until it fell off into the water below the old bridge rested on log beams many of which needed replacing several stumps slanted out of the water marking where floods had raged by leaving memories in the form of wreckage essie pouted near the edge now she watched jimmy then leaned over to peer into the water a water strider skated out of the way of a swarm of gnats and a mocking birds shadow glided across the hood of the bridge a green frog heaving its balloon sides from behind a clump of lake weeds darted a tongue out and a bronze fly disappeared from a leaf jimmy ran to the wooden rail leaned over turned and beckoned to essie as she began to back away from the bridge bubba leaped upon jimmy what you doin jimmy croon dont mess with me boy said jimmy ha who you didnt know did you well im the law ha you mean the lie okay sposin

of the hoods shadow a pebble lodged between the planks fell plop into the water she jerked nervously and squeezed her sunday school lesson bubba she whispered what he grunted still scuffling with jimmy im scared jimmy laughed eluding bubbas grasp for his neck bcause you little miss essie till she aint grunted bubba i aint you is she aint he succeeded in locking an arm around jimmys neck suddenly jimmy let out a long choking growl he was pinned to the rail then heaving his chest he lunged outside the railing bubbas leg came half way through with him essie hollered you give shouted bubba still holding jimmys neck hey screamed jimmy they were falling essie hollered again and suddenly they were pulling up together essie stood behind them at the other end of the rail and began watching the shadow of her little purse every time she swung it out over the rail the shadow formed like a dart a licking tongue on the rail and water below hey shouted bubba whos that down in the water you and jimmy was upon him again emmett bubba gagged they were falling again you give naw said bubba essie ran to them im gonna tell mama on yawl she looked at the shadows struggling on the

specially you nappyhead know who you talkin to said jimmy climbing to sit on the rail jimmy the coon laughed bubba look and they peered at their reflections in the water three blue jays flew overhead in a clearing across the bridge a mocking birds trill pierced the summer heat essie coming close to the boys began to chant ole jimmy croono nothin but a coono then suddenly she stopped she leaped up into the air her feet came down stomp on the planks as she yelled boo and skipped over the wood the boys flinching only a bit at her scare never looked away from the water bubba saying we quit essie

me in the water like they did before did he bubba bubba looked across the marshes at a flock of birds a mocking bird sans near by huh he didnt did he naw they all were quiet for a second moving away from the presences the sounds the memories bubba stopped listen he whispered that old bridge talkin listen feel sorry for anybody cross it now they listened a pebble plunked in the water a fish splashed somewhere perhaps the bridge squeaked faintly hush said bubba looking over their shoulders they stepped forward cautiously suddenly they giggled and broke into a fast fast run he was marias cousinshe begged me to giv her mothers sister child a job so i tof her to bring him alon and i would see what j could do for himwhich she promptly did the following day he was over six feet tall and well built belonging to the basuto tribe but bearing more resemblance to a zulu his teeth were white and perfectly shaped setting off the darkness of his face which was pleasant and shining with cleanliness while an abundance of wellgroomed woolly hair neatly clipped and telligent eyes met mine without a waver as he stood hatinhand in front of me so youre charlie i said smiling to put him at ease yes madam im marias mothers sisters child he answered in a deep voice and good english and where have you worked charlie in zeerust madam have you a pass charlie yes mam he said handing me his reference book i flipped the pages of this nocuous brown book that caused more sorrow and bitterness than anything else in the country his picture was on the front page also his thumb prints and all the necessary information about chief kraal date of birth and tribe i turned to the back to see the name of his last employer and was unable to decipher the name whats his name charlie i asked pointing to the scrawl coetzee madam but that man does not write so well now i write with great beauty madam and use to help this white baas fill in the other boys passes who worked for him but i could not do my own the police would have noticed i nodded understanding and what work did you do for this man charlie on the farm madam but i do not want to work on the farm there is no money and i am educated standard six madam i went to the mission school and i want to do other things and live in joburg madam he spoke well without a trace of nervousness which was rare in my experience of interviewing africans in need of a job knowing of the different laws that were applicable to the blacks yet not knowing quite how they affected individuals i asked him if he was allowed to work in johannesburg oh no madam he replied calmly and if im caught ill be sent to gaol then back to zeerust but charlie i exploded you know that i cannot hire you if your pass is not in order if i do we will both get into trouble you know it is against the law oh yes madam but maria tells me you can do many things to help us africans you can get me a new pass he said simply but i cant charlie you know how strict the police are soon as you try and register at the pass office theyll put the handcuffs on you and you will get three months in gaol and when your sentence is finished they will send you back to zeerust please let the madam try he pleaded i want so much to stay in joburg i want to learn typing in the night time i sighed i knew that it was rather hopeless for i had tried on a number of occasions to get permits for africans who lived outside of johannesburg to work in the factory and i had never been successful he stood eyeing me hopefully alright charlie ill try but if they arrest you its your own fault he beamed maybe madam can take me home with madam in madams car they wont arrest me he was right for the police rarely arrested an african in the company of a white assuming the african to be legally employed i smiled inwardly he was not lacking any answer that was certain maybe its better if madam phone first to the pass office what a shame i thought by the readiness of the boys answers here was someone that was bright and intelligent and because of the colour of his skin he was not permitted by law the choice of working where he wished he was kept back in some dorp to work as a menial or on a farm digging in the fields i telephoned the pass office and asked to speak to a senior person was it possible i asked sweetly in afrikaans to get a boy with the necessary qualifications that required for the factory a pass to work in johannesburg could see in my minds eye the man shaking his head as he answered in the negative if you have such a boy he said it is your duty to see that he goes back from where he came or call the police he also warned me that i was liable to fifty pounds fine if i employed him i gritted my teeth with frustration with charlie watching me closely a confident look on his face as if i were going to perform a miracle now continued the man if you live in a periurban area and you require someone to work on the land there might be a chance that you could get permission to keep him but then you must apply at the nearest pass office to your home i thanked him knowing that it actually was not his fault that charlie was unable to work at the factory however i suspected that he was in agreement with the village laws controlling the africans as most of the police and pass office personnel were supporters of the government i repeated to charlie what the man had told me he was undaunted by the news but madam lives in the periurban area i can work for madam in the house im a first class worker and i can wait at the table i have done this work plenty times i burst out laughing first of all charlie it is not certain that i could get this permission secondly charlie i have a houseboy who waits at table and i also have two who work in the garden so what am i going to do with you nonplussed he answered madam has a big house maria told me madam has nyasaland boy working maria tells me can show these boys many things they do not speak english too much they dont know too much like me the latter was true as far as the houseboy was concerned not that he was unintelligent but he knew very little english and most of my instructions were given in mime with a bit of fanagelo simple type of african dialect used mainly on the gold mines thrown in the houseboy incidentally had also been a straybrought by one of the garden boys as much as i wanted to help charlie i certainly did not require another servant in the house for i also had a cook a woman which made a total of four servants but i felt so sorry for him let me think of a plan charlie today is friday ill think over the weekend and if youre not arrested by monday i will let maria know if i can do something he smiled broadly thank you madam oh many thank yous madam god will bless you i could see that in his mind the whole problem was solved now charlie dont go setting your heart on staying im going to try and think of something maybe my friends need someone but maybe they dont and then you will have to return to zeerust we parted he with optimism and many thanks and me with something else to worry about we lived twelve miles from johannesburg in a large house in threeandahalf acres of ground it was summer which meant that the weeds which grew at a fantastic rate from the rains were in profusion the two garden boys had their jobs cut out in keeping them down that evening walked around the grounds eyeing the vegetable patches trying to find justification for hiring charlie if no one else wanted him i was lenient with the servants allowing them the responsibility of doing their jobs without constantly telling them what to do the head gardener lucien was a wonderful worker diligent and hardworking taking great pride in his domain c planting and sowing the various crops on his own merely telling me what seeds he required he supervised the second gardener who was younger and a more recent addition to the household and in fact another stray i knew that if i brought charlie into the garden picture there could only be one boss around and it would end up being charlie this i felt would be unfair to lucien it was early saturday morning and i was sitting in the garden having a cup of tea i glanced up the drive and who should be walking down with a sprightly air none other than charlie carrying a large suitcase the dogs rushed out barking furiously enough to scare anyone especially an african for they are extremely frightened of dogs more so if they are large ours were enormous but charlie just kept on walking as they rushed up to him he put his hand out and patted the largest animal the animals stopped their barking and walked next to him sniffing at his heels good morning madam he called out while still some distance from me youve a big house just like maria told me he turned his head taking in the expanse of the grounds and nodding approvingly good morning charlie answered quite amazed at his appearance and what have you come for i told you i would let maria know on monday if i had a plan and today is only saturday well madam thought i might be arrested by monday you know that they often raid the township over the weekend he answered putting his suitcase down this i knew only too well well he continued thought in your house i would be safe and if i were around you would not forget me and you would remember to think of a plan i chuckled dont worry charlie even without you around was remembering but if you were worrying about getting arrested why did you take a chance and walk in the streets and go on the train and the bus i wondered how he would account for this logic on my part without hesitating he replied i thought of that madam and decided if i was to be arrested it might as well be on the way to your house madam than in the township alright i said throwing up my hands its against the law but since you are here you might as well stay go and speak to julie the cook girl she will give you something to eat but remember charlie dont go making trouble with the other servants dont tell them that you have come to work for me and since you will have to sleep in simons room ask him if it is alright and also help him for this is the cooks weekend off oh thanks madam many thanks to you god will shine upon you and bless you he said his face wreathed in smiles picking up his suitcase he disappeared around the back of the house and soon i heard loud talking and laughing charlie was getting acquainted when simon the houseboy was on duty on the weekends that julie was off we usually had to make do for he knew little about cooking and i had to see to the meals but this weekend was different charlie took over an hour after his arrival he came outside sprucely dressed in one of i presumed simons white uniforms for it was about threeinches short in the arms and legs he wanted to know what we would be having for lunch i was somewhat taken aback can you also cook charlie oh yes madam i can do many things madam just tell me and madam will see for herself i told him what i had planned for lunch and he went off whistling confidently the lunch was a great success very well prepared and tastefully decorated simon instead of being upset beamed with pride at the obvious effects of charlies handiwork she too good boy medem said simon later as i entered the kitchen she i replied is a he simon and he does seem good oh yes medem she is a he she one good boy i gave up most africans call both sexes she arent you worried ill keep charlie and let you go back home simon i said laughingly a look of puzzlement passed over his face i asked charlie to explain to simon in his language what i had said as charlie translated simon laughed no medem medem not send simon back medem keep charlie to help simon more to myself i said aloud you just cant win a week passed and no plan matured with regard to charlie all my friends who might have been able to employ him since they lived in periurban area had enough staff meanwhile i knew that if the police came to the house and found charlie working without a pass i would be fined fifty pounds charlie settled down and never broached the subject of pass job or wages he simply took over the management of the other domestics lives with apparently no ill feeling on their parts when he had been with us about three weeks simon came to me one evening with a sad look on his face and a letter in his hand medem me go home my father she very sick i expressed my regrets and asked when he wanted to go me go two days time me come back after and work for medem alright simon when your fathers better you come back its lucky i added to make him feel better that we have charlie oh yes medem now i not waste time to train other boy two days later with fond farewells ringing in his ears from the household i took simon to johannesburg station to catch the train to nyasaland it would take him a week to get there and six months would no doubt lapse before his return now i would have to try and get charlie a pass i took the morning off from work and went to the pass office nearest to our home which was at alexander township the huge location where some nonwhites lived in one squaremile in utter squalor where crime was rife and the law abiding africans and nonwhites lived in fear of their lives a large number of africans were waiting to be attended to as i walked through a doorway marked european and i was immediately approached by a clerk i handed charlies pass book over he i had left in the car outside and stated my case telling the clerk what the man from the main pass office had told me theyre wrong said the clerk that law about being able to work in the periurban area was rescinded some six months ago youd think the joburg pass office would know this he scratched among some papers and found a form here it is in writing he said showing me the paper then what can i do i pleaded i do not have a servant and i need this man he is intelligent and a wonderful worker half laughingly he replied take a chance on being fined fifty quid pounds if they catch him you mean there is nothing i can do legally to keep him even though he wants desperately to work for me and i need him urgently im afraid not madam i know it is a shame when you can get someone good and you are not allowed by law to keep him he shrugged his shoulders but thats the law what will happen if he is arrested i asked he will be gaoled for three months i interrupted and when he is released he will on his way from the prison be rearrested and sentenced to a further three months and this can go on ad infinitum im afraid so said the clerk and what is more i should by law have this boy arrested now he looked me in the eye i dont know your name i dont know where you live in fact you have not been here i thanked him and departed quickly for fear the police would arrive i decided to take a chance and charlie worked as before except we arranged what his wage would be i told him that if he left the premises he was liable to be arrested and i would be fined it was a terrible way to live but he was very willing to work under such conditions three days later charlie came to me with the request that i buy him a red sash to wear across his shoulder like all the head waiters wore in the hotels he felt that our position and his capabilities warranted this these were not his words but he implied them with a lot of smooth talk he took over simons white uniforms and laundered and starched them to perfection he was rather impressive in this role of headwaiter and we began to feel very posh on the fourth night after seating ourselves at the dinner table i was handed a typewritten menu by charlie who stood on my right with a napkin draped across his arm i could not refrain from laughinghe looked so serious and professional did you type this charlie i asked looking at the neatly spaced lettersasterisks and dashes liberally decorating the top and the bottom the words were correctly spelled while a few a las gave it a french flavour yes madam i found the typewriter in the study and thought it was well for the master and madam to read what you were going to eat thats very nice charlie as long as you do not neglect your work you can use the typewriter i said oh thank you madam ill take good care of it he said with his usual warmth and flicked an imaginary crumb from the table that evening the meal was one of the most amusing we had ever had in our own home for we could hardly contain ourselves from laughing out aloud everytime charlie whipped the menu like a real professional before our eyes the menu had everything right down to cheese and biscuits something which we kept in the house but seldom had more than one to choose from charlie had discovered all my good imported cheese that i kept for occasions and at the end of the meal he proudly placed a cheese platter before us that would have been the envy of a toprate restaurant parsley sprigged and all on the menu was typed cheese various charlie was fascinated with the typewriter all his spare time was used in typing and think that he typed letters to every one of his acquaintances throughout africa for every morning he would give me at least two letters to post since he could not venture from the property months later we found out from the cook that the moment we left home in the morning charlie would sit down in the study and type most of the day after working for us for about three months he became enamoured of one of the girls close by and this was his downfall one evening he came running into the lounge breathless and fearful oh madam he cried the police have come with a girl to catch me this girl she say am father of her child she wants me to marry her i say no and now she come with her mother and a policeman my heart stopped for a moment then quickly i shouted to julie the cook tell lucien to go to char lies room and if the police want to come in say it is his room and julie if the police ask you about charlie say he left a week ago tell the others to say the same our front door bell ranggo upstairs charlie to my bedroom and stay there he bolted upstairs like a rabbit bereft of all his selfassurance i went to the door and opened it my own assurance wavering on the porch stood a white sergeant and an african policeman with two native women standing a few feet from them good evening madam we are sorry to trouble you but these two women the sergeant pointed toward the two who shuffled into the shadows have laid a complaint about your boy charlie and whats the complaint enquired acting surprised the young one says he is the father of her expected child i laughed with bravado first of all if she is in the family way it must only be a few weeks and its her word against the boys and secondly i took a deep breath charlie disappeared from here about a week ago and now know the reason i finished with a laugh the sergeant laughed with me and looking at the girl who was very thin said youre right madam there are no signs as yet and with such a prospective motherinlaw i dont blame the boy running away he directed the african policeman to tell the two women what had been said the women of course had a good idea of the discussion but it was duly translated to them the sergeant meanwhile apologized for bothering me stating that a complaint had been made and that this sort of thing was always happening and all he could do was to investigate i assured him that it had been no trouble wondering if the look of relief was visible on my face for the two women eyed me suspiciously then with some more bravado i said to the policeman you can question my other servants and search the quarters if you like oh no madam that wont be necessary he said and turned toward the two women in a harsh voice he told them they would have to find someone else to pin the blame on and for them to be off a whites word was always believed over that of a nonwhite and i felt ashamed and sorry for the two women but it was either them or charlie and in this instance the paternity case would not have meant a thing for the moment they found that he did not have a pass to johannesburg that would have been his biggest crime and no one would have gained a jot except the south african government the police left and i went upstairs to my room expecting to find charlie he was nowhere to be seen charlie i called and from beneath the bed came a muffled yes madam i laughed you can come out charlie they have gone he crawled from beneath the bed a sheepish look on his face but he soon regained his composure that girl madam shes alright its that mother all she wants is lobola and the girl is only fifteen years he clicked hau these days a man must be too smart smart i snorted you mean have a smart madam who is getting grey hair every time she sees a policeman and then lying to the police on top of it i clicked the way the africans do when annoyed if i go to prison charlie wholl get me out he laughed loudly and was very amused hau madams too clever to go to prison i hear madam talk to policeman i listen at the window only hide under bed when madam say police can search for charlie hau madam one clever one one week later poor charlie was arrested he had not been out for three months and then he went to see his cousin maria a gamble which failed to come off and there was nothing i could do since i had already broken the law twice our home was never quite the same without charlie we all missed him some three months elasped and charlie turned up to get all his belongings for when they arrested him he told them he had just arrived and thus did not give me away as having illegally employed him asked him what he was going to do for he had every chance of being arrested again and he told me that he was going to borrow some money and that if he could find such a one to lend him this money he knew of a plan that could keep him in johannesburg how much charlie i said knowing that i was going to be the lender his face lit up five pounds madam ill pay the madam back one day he twisted his hands nervously as he looked me in the eye not certain if had really agreed i could feel the tension for his plan could not be acted upon unless he had the money and five pounds represented a whole months wages to charlie had a faint inkling that the five pounds was to purchase a forged pass book for other africans had told me this was often done and was not often detected if obtained from the right source you want this money for a pass book charlie i asked haul he exclaimed shaking his head a very surprised look on his face madam know about getting pass books this way yes charlie just see that you get a good one he beamed oh thank you my madam oh thank you i pay you back one day he mopped his brow miraculously his nervousness had gone as i went inside to get him the money i heard him shouting out his glad tidings to the garden boys way down in the land that was the last i saw or heard of charlie not his fault im certain i just think that the forgery was not up to standard poor charlie his aspirations were high but the land where he was born only allow those with white skins to aspire the negro half a man in a white world during the harlem riots last summer a black boy with tears streaming down his face taunted the police shoot me shoot another nigger when they did not comply he moaned im not even man enough for them to kill what the hysterical youth was expressing was the psychological castration which faces the negro male every day of his life in which he is barred from attaining the traditional american ideal of manhood dorothy canfield fisher states that our society puts negro youth in the situation of the animal in the psychological laboratory in which a neurosis is caused by making it impossible for him to live up to our national ideals as others do those glorified ideals of manhood are providing security and protection for ones family fighting injustice striving towards success with honesty defending individual liberty ones honor and ones country but for the negro physical and psychological violence leaps at him from every side to restrict these manly pursuits historically the emasculation of the negro began with slavery negro families were not only separated forcibly when they were brought to this country but continually throughout slavery as they were sold on the trading blocks whitney young of the national urban league points out that the negro family is the only ethnic group in world history which a consistent and deliberate effort has tried to weaken and destroy even after slavery young says the negro male was consciously kept at a lowpaying level and humiliated daily to prevent him from getting out of place and attempting to affect change after the slave trade was abolished by congress in fear that the supply of slaves would become exhausted led to promiscuous breeding as an economic measure john hay lincolns biographer wrote that virginia was converted into a great menagerie where men were reared like oxen for the market and young negroes called stud men were treated as prize bulls in black odyssey roi ottley relates that these stud men were carefully fed exercised regularly and subject to as little brutality as possible one named joe who lived on fayette jacksons place was considered bout de breedingest nigger in virginia joe had no work to do he was allowed to stay in his quarters and sun himself until called for his duties nine months after one weekend in a suffolk nursery babies were born on the same day to women with whom he had been mated ottley also reveals that maryland enterprisingly brought out a fancy line of stockchildren of indentured white girls mated with stud men undoubtedly licentiousness among breeders played no small part in the mulatto production which incidentally gave maryland traders a jump on their competitors negro studs were treated like precious animals but not like men throughout the ages notes playwright leroi jones one race of mankind has enslaved another but the victim was still considered a man it was left to the christians of the new world to dehumanize the negro and read him entirely out of the human race this dehumanization was reinforced in by the constitution which labeled the negro three fifths of a man in the supreme court stated in the dred scott decision that negroes were so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect in a book published by the american book and bible house the negroa beast popular among churchgoing whites argued that the negro was not the son of ham or even the descendant of adam and eve but simply a beast without a soul if the negro studs were dehumanized the other slaves fared no better along family lines marriages were ignored if performed at all and paternity was not recognized children were traced through the mother the unity of the family was destroyed to facilitate the buying and selling of individual slaves only the most elementary motherchild unit with the father absent unknown or if present incapable of wielding any influence was allowed to survive unlike the negro male who had only utilitarian value the negro woman had more opportunity for emotional interaction with the whites for two reasons one was as negro mammy to white children and the other was as a sex object the plethora of laws prohibiting marriages between the races is eloquent testimony that the white man found the negro woman sexually attractive physical compulsion was often necessary to compel compliance of the woman and historical evidence is plentiful on this point j a tragic example is the love story of benjamin banneker astronomer and mathematician as told in his biography your most humble servant by shirley graham banneker constructed one of the first clocks made in america and assisted in the survey of washington d c born a free negro during slavery banneker fell in love with the beautiful slave girl anola and sought to buy her to make her his wife but when her master saw anola he wanted every sweet curving inch of her for himself anola outsmarted her master by drowning herself in consoling banneker an old slave woman told him she be free now son ole massa nevah make huh his slave dey stole huh body and dey lock huh up from you but she wan you to know dis one thing she free to die in proud shoes pauli murray relates the rape of her great grandmother harriet a slave married to reuben day a free negro when her owners son desired her harriet was brutally beaten and raped but before that reuben day was ambushed by the two white brothers who whipped him to ii deaths door and ran him off the plantation in other instances the mere prestige of the white race was sufficient to gain consent from negro women they felt such selfcontempt that a drop of white blood in their offspring raised them in the scale of humanity then too the white master was the protector as well as the oppressor and as such was an idealized as well as a hated figure often there were concrete advantages to be gained by a negro womans surrender in some cases it meant freedom from the drudgery of field labor and elevation to house slave and there was the hope that her mulatto children would enjoy added privileges from their white father and might even be emancipated this usefulness of the female as a concubine increased the white mans fear of her legitimate mate the negro male his fear of retaliation led to the fantastic exaggeration in his mind of the negro males sexual ability and the need to protect white women from him this guilt and anxiety necessitated even more repressive measures against the negro man during reconstruction peonage reduced the negro to nearbondage and the threat of sudden death kept him in his place western mobs preferred hanging and southern mobs delighted in burning in the memphis press printed a graphic description of the lynching of ed pierson fifteen thousand men women and children cheered as they poured the gasoline on the ax fiend and struck the match they fought and screamed and crowded to get a glimpse of him and the mob closed in as the flames flared high and the smoke rolled about their heads the negro lay in flames his hands crossed on his chest if he spoke no one heard him over the shouts of the crowd he died quickly though fifteen minutes later excitable persons still shouted that he lived when they saw the charred remains move as does meat on a hot frying pan a mob near valdosta georgia lynched three innocent negroes when they could not find the man they sought for murdering a plantation owner as told by langston hughes in the story of the naacp the pregnant wife of one of the three wailed at her husbands death so loudly that the mob seized her and burned her alive too as the flames enveloped mary turners body her unborn child fell to the ground and was trampled underfoot white parents held their children up to watch during the years from to the naacp records that men and women were lynched the negro man already treated by the white majority as less tnan a man is further depreciated by his women because of his uncertain employment more than per cent of the negro labor force is in the three lowest occupations as compared to per cent of white workers the unemployment rate for negro mens times greater than for whites onehalf or the negro families in america receive a week or less money income compared with a week for white families the negro womans chance for employment is better than the mans there is always a demand for domestic work and she has greater opportunity to complete her education the negro working class woman holds the purse strings she usually works until much longer than does her white counterpart this difference expresses the greater economic security of the white male negro women head the family in one out of five families as compared to one in eleven for whites the negro woman loses respect for her husband whose economic condition prevents him from acting according to the accepted white ideals she is frustrated in her feminine wishes to have a man stronger than she and often betrays these feelings in contempt for the man this contempt is reflected in sissie a novel by john a williams when her husband cant find work sissie wonders at what point had she become the man and he less the man he had seemed to be when sissie tells her husband that they will have to move to a cheaper flat with no furnace and shes going to take in washing at home he explodes im a f g man whats making it so that i cant be one because masculinity is closely tied to power in every form in our society the negro interprets his economic failure as a loss in masculinity his frantic efforts to maintain a dominant position in the family often end in failure and despondency leading to divorce or desertion accounting for the high number of broken families particularly in the lower classes and the negro father who abandons his family is himself likely to have been the product of a broken home or one damaged by a weak father image a youngsters strong identification with respected and loved parents enables him to control eventually his rebellious feelings but for many a negro child the father cannot be idealized as protector and provider for he is neither parents cannot help their children gain status and social and economic satisfaction for the parents themselves are members of a despised group their ideal is spoiled by the stigma of inferiority in a broken home situation the negro boy is often reared by his mother and grandmother in an atmosphere which does not exalt masculinity on the contrary these frustrated women often make disparaging remarks about the inadequacies of the negro male making it impossible for the boy to identify with a positive father image and derive self esteem from such identification often he is brutally informed that he is no good just like his father inner tensions accumulate and the home fails to be a protective environment the boy feels frustrated dependency and hostility rage however the certain knowledge that he will be punished if his hatred is discovered produces guilt for having such emotions in order to survive the negro suppresses his rage replacing it with submission or ingratiation while scraping and bowing may save his life they help to murder his manhood deeply frustrated by his ego deflating role and unable to express his hostility toward whites the lower class negro often unleashes his fury in violent attacks on other negroes to bolster his bruised ego he may dress flamboyantly straighten his kinky hair prove to himself that he is not invisible a magical aid to selfesteem is gambling where he has the chance of beating fate of being the favored one if just for a day or he may seek escape from his intolerable situation in alcohol narcotics and crime all negroes do not succumb to these problems those raised in stable homes are generally able to develop psychological resources to withstand these effects but discrimination and segregation create a type of family disorganization which causes many negroes to be especially vulnerable nor is the middle class negro exempt from a loss of masculinity he goes through the same cycle of suppressed rage guilt and self rejection because despite his wealth and education and conformity to middle class standards he is not accepted by white society e franklin frazier states in black bourgeoisie negro men are frustrated because they cannot assert themselves or exercise power as white men do the conservative and conventional middle class husband often sits at home alone impotent physically and socially and complains that his wife has gone crazy about poker and society and constantly demands money for gambling and expenditures which he cannot afford ignored by the dominant society they engage in an intense struggle for status reflected in their conspicuous consumption of material goods in an attempt to compensate for the contempt of the whites frazier also notes that in the south the middle class negro male is not only prevented from playing a masculine role but generally must let negro women assume leadership in any show of militancy this demoralizes his status in the home and further emasculates him dr abram kardiner and dr lionel ovesey psychiatrist and sociologist who pooled their resources while both were on the staff of columbia university to conduct a study on the personality of the negro observed there is not one personality trait of the negro the source of which cannot be traced to his difficult living condition there are no exceptions to this rule the final result is a wretched internal life negro self esteem cannot be retrieved nor negro selfhatred destroyed as long as the status is quo they can never be eradicated without removing the forces that create and perpetuate them what is needed by the negro is not education but reintegration it is the white man who requires the education although the negro has fought valiantly in every american war he has been discriminated against in every war and this has been a frustrating blow to his manhood last december a special committee reported to president johnson that discrimination still exists in overseas military bases and that the national guard segregates negroes ami not a soldier a man and a brother not if you are black america answered on the eve of world war ii a negro could die for his country but he had to do so in certain restricted menial jobs in the navy and coast guard in two infantry and one cavalry regiments in the army he was excluded from the army air corps the marine corps and from the tank signal engineer and artillery corps of the army in yancy williams a howard university student filed suit to compel the war department to consider him for the lilywhite army air corps the naacp was threatening lawsuits against local education boards which provided vocational defense training for whites but excluded negroes when pearl harbor was bombed the naacp issued a call to all negro citizens to support the war effort in the south where most of the negro troops were sent for their basic training a negro soldier who entered a white uso or service club might be arrested and court martialed southern police and civilians inflicted brutal treatment upon the negro gis who were ordered by their commanding officers not to retaliate they were beaten shot and murdered in southern railway station restaurants german prisoners of war were served promptly while the negroes guarding them often had to go hungry the negro soldier bitterly wondered who really was his enemy twenty six thousand white workers making bomber engines at a packard motor plant in detroit in went out on strike in protest against the employment of negroes a striker in front of the plant yelled id rather see hitler and hirohito win the war than work beside a nigger on the assembly line that summer a bitter race riot held up war production for two days overseas the situation between white and black troops bordered on armed warfare in guam a long series of attacks upon negro service units led to an investigation by the naacp stones and hand grenades were repeatedly hurled into the negro camp and a band of marines ran negroes out of agana when two drunken marines killed a negro soldier on christmas day in and later a machine gun loaded onto a jeep sprayed bullets into the negro camp the negro soldiers decided they had had enough they boarded a truck but were arrested before they reached agana charged with rioting attempted murder theft of government property and unlawful assembly they were court martialed and sentenced to prison the naacp took the case all the way to the white house before the verdict was finally reversed not until the battle of the bulge in december did white and black soldiers serve together but in separate platoons negro riflemen were moved into the white divisions of the first and seventh armies general patton and general eisenhower praised these colored troops all of whom had volunteered for combat duty and major general lathan told the riflemen i have never seen any soldiers who performed better in combat than you many of them lost their lives but when a movie spectacular recorded the heroic deeds of this invasion recently not one negro soldier was portrayed the red cross was also rigid in upholding jim crow it offered separate and inferior recreational facilities for negro troops and at first refused to accept blood from negro donors for its blood bank ironically the blood plasma project was originated by a negro dr charles drew later the red cross accepted negro blood but segregated it according to the wishes of congressman john rankin of mississippi who claimed that not to separate the plasma was a communist plot to mongrelize america at the wars end parades and brass bands welcomed the white war hero the familiar pattern of violence and intimidation greeted the negro isaac woodward jr discharged from the army only a few hours earlier was on his way home when he had his eyes gouged out in batesburg south carolina by the chief of police the atlanta daily world in georgia commented on november that some atlanta police are reported to be beating up discharged and disabled negro veterans at the slightest provocation and practicing a gettheminlinewiththepostwarattitude am l not a veteran a brother and a man the answer was still no the negro has a long list of grievances he complains of police brutality inequality before the law and complex social discrimination which closes to him doors of opportunities which are open to others poverty condemns him to inferior housing health and schools his lack of education confines him to the least desirable jobs his low status deprives him of political equality his lack of equality degrades him and confirms his separatedness from whites who gain in selfesteem if in no other way than through his debasement at every turn this vicious cycle stalks him standing between him and the cherished ideals of american manhood today the emergence of the african nations has helped rescue the color black from the outhouse giving the negro a new sense of dignity writers like james baldwin are telling the negro to find his own identity and tohellwithemulatingwhites in a recent look article he said white people seem to ask us if they ask us anything come into my nightmare with me be like me have abortions like me instead of illegitimate children but we dont want to be like you there is no reason whatever for negroes to want to enter white society nurtured on the disillusionment of their wartime parents todays generation is increasingly aware of its psychological handicaps and determined to grind to a halt the resultant chain reaction nonviolently or otherwise that is why the negro laughs with derision when wellintentioned but unthinking people tell him hes going too fast how can one go too fast to prevent even one little black boy from becoming half a man in a white world the negro woman exj ploited by white men t jl and women resented eereais and brutalized by her own men of color has marched down through the pages of history proud and unbowed by all the indignities heaped upon her by every segment of a truly hostile society in a nation that is largely antifemale and totally antinegro the negro woman has almost singlehandedly kept her family together mainly on coolie wages and in most instances has brought her children up to be hardworking lawabiding citizens but has she received any credit for her wellnigh impossible achievements certainly not if historically white america has either ignored or lynched the black male it has used and abused the black female with all the vigorous cruelty of an incredibly vicious people yet without exception this nation has blamed the delinquency of our black slum children on the working negro mother instead of placing the blame where it squarely belongs on its own bigoted shoulders and likewise these experts never blink an eyelash when its pointed out that there is as much delinquency among the middle and upperclass white youths whose mothers do not work and in reality there is more speaking in actual percentages but money and unorthodox police methods manage to hush much of it up but despite these concealments all honest observers are deeply concerned over the cancerous state of this so called affluent society and how ironical that this nation was so rapacious it could not forsee that to enslave murder rape maim and rob a whole race of people would surely one day cast its evil spell on the entire country corrupting its favored children and their children and their childrens children then too in this lilywhite society simply being black is reason enough for nabbing many of our negro males of all ages on suspicion and hauling them down to the precinct where an appalling number wind up with cracked heads compliments of the uniformed racist thugs who cruise this infected land north and south east and west night and day forever and ever and what have our black experts had to say about our courageous unsung heroine since slavery time our families have been mostly matriarchal many of them cry happily though in the new industrial class and expanding middleclass larger numbers of negro men are assuming dominant family roles these experts exult in the next breath neither economic necessity nor tradition has instilled in the negro woman the spirit of subordination to masculine authority the late e franklin frazier once wrote obviously none of our black male experts seem to realize that the concept of male supremacy is as reprehensible and obsolescent as is the concept of white supremacy which they have always so eloquently railed against indeed one of our most renown negro authors had one of his female characters exclaim more than once in his book im just another colored girl to these white people nowhere did he have any of his male characters say im just another colored man it is plain to see that this author doesnt realize the negro woman as do other human beings always thinks of herself as being just that a human being it is only to our illustrous black author and his bigoted white countrymen that she is thought of as being something other than a real person to be sure our social scientists aping their white colleagues who spend much of their time extolling the virtues of motherhood and female servitude to the male never miss an opportunity to throw brickbats at the negro woman one such authority complained bitterly that the negro woman doesnt want to be financially dependent on the male well why should she since she is neither child nor serf nor idiot because no matter how its dressed up and this nation has an astonishing ability when it comes to finding euphemisms for evil thus slavery has become the peculiar institution and murder if your victim is black is not murder but a deprivation of civil_rights being financially dependent on anyone is to be indentured to that person or group surely these experts must know that inasmuch as theyve largely been dependent on the white man for nearly four centuries and remain at the very bottom of the social and economic structure and are sinking lower if such can be imagined and these same bucolic authorities let out anguished cries of outrage when they note that many negro women have outstripped the black male in certain areas instead of giving credit to the female and encouragement to the male and female for goodness knows our people are far far behind in virtually all fields in this great society these th century theoreticians seek to elevate the black man by debasing the female of course as has often been pointed out no group is really desirous of other groups becoming its equal they are concerned with being superior however and this is especially true of the majority of negro men in america being secondclass citizens themselves they are hellbent on making sure the female remains subservient to the male and when the negro woman rejects this intolerable situation for there is no more unendurable hell on earth than that of being a doormats doormat she is called unwomanly castrative or masculine by our black and white experts and just as an overwhelming majority of white people become outraged whenever black people aspire to anything above the mop and bucket brigade so do all except an extremely small number of men become incensed when any female seeks to shun the shackles of the kitchen and make her way in the world at large and this is doubly true for the negro woman who remarkably has taken these obstacles in her stride and is even now demonstrating in ever increasing numbers that her brain is as good as anyone elses and that she intends to utilize it to the utmost labels and namecalling she realizes are for the frightened and the insecure to take refuge behind and like sticks and stones she knows they can neither break her spirit nor stop her march through history as one of our most enduring examples of courage for all time hazards of forming a single rights group night is turned to day in the glare of the bombs a mighty cannon roars and men and earth are replaced by a gaping holea giant period that marks an end to the statement of life sighs of the dying mingle with cries of the living but both are drowned out by the screaming shells a mans finger slowly squeezes the trigger and his rifle barks a question a ball of lead speeds toward its target seeking an answer it finds its mark in a human heart and the answer is death this is warhotwise words and pictures change mens ideologies and beliefs the intangible fingers of propaganda reach out and capture their minds an upheaval in politics gives birth to another revolution a little island miles off the florida shore is our enemy and another miles from the western coast is our friend democracy and communism vie in a contest to make leaders look east or west in this contest the soldiers are replaced by diplomats and the guns give way to words this too is warcoldwise that vacancy is filled insists the personnel manager and a man keeps walking come back tomorrow says the foreman and a man must move on there are no openings at present a negro college graduate is told in these ways are the long unemployment lines formed and the men who face deceit who stand in those lines and walk those streets are citizens of the richest nation in the world but they are denied entrance into the mainstream of the good life the doors close in their faces the employers turn them away and they must struggle to survive from day to day when all the tokens for the busses and subways are gone they walk the streets in despair searching for ways to earn their fare this is yet another warjobwise yet important as it is the latter war is only one phase of the negro revolution as we all are aware there exist numerous other phases such as education housing and use of public facilities now with so many prime fronts to be attacked does it not seem tactically feasible to have a number of groups prepared to assault those fronts for example consider the air force army and navy they are separate branches of the united states military establishment but during times of war they all coordinate their efforts to defeat the common enemy the fact that the negro revolution embraces different groups with unlike methods is certainly not a hindrance in itself conflict normally arises only when one group criticizes anothers philosophy or methods essentially the goal that they all seek to attain is the same on the contrary it is the methods and philosophies that vary yet as other wars and other revolutions have proven it takes a variety of efforts to obtain even a single victory history tells us that the roads were varied and many but they all led to rome though the sights and sounds on each were different they all ended at an identical place so may the various civil_rights groups lead us down different paths by different methods to the same destinationequality for every man and if each of us chooses to follow a separate group that should not detract from our progress after all as individuals we all differ and the sights and sounds of a particular road may attract one and repel another but let us not criticize those who go by a road other than the one we travel for we all shall meet in rome by and by now let us suppose that all negro revolutionists began traveling the same roador more aptly suppose that the civil_rights groups were to merge forces such an action would naturally raise many psychological and practical questionsquestions that should be answered long before the action is initiated it is certain that a merger would produce numerous organizational problems we need not concern ourselves with specific descriptions of those problems but only with their effect in zen buddhism there is a belief that small children always look at the finger which points rather than at the thing to which it points it is fact that most adults also become much more preoccupied by the pointer than by that to which it points if now the civil_rights groups were to merge would it not generate many complex organizational details like the people described in zen buddhism would the combined groups involvement with the finger of detail cause them to lose sight of the ultimate goal for the danger is that they might become so wrapped in the cloak of organizational complexity that they will devote more time to the finger than to the fight moreover as various demonstrations have shown emotions are the very substance of the negro revolution for our struggle involves a great deal of idealism and idealism is primarily based on emotions though tempered with a certain amount of objectivity emotionalism remains the moving force for instance consider the great march on washington though conceived and executed in an objective manner it still depended on emotionalism for its accomplishment only emotions could have bridged the gap between such a conglomeration of people and caused them to cooperate with so much success no doubt there are those among us who can remember when the corner grocery store was an intimate friendly place it was there that we stood and swapped stories and joked with the proprietor say mr jones then as the store grew larger we noticed that mr jones had no more time for jokes and began casting disapproving glances at those who came primarily to stand and talk and as the store became larger and larger our standing talking and joking were no longer tolerated even that simple example serves to show that the larger an organization grows the more objective it must become to operate effectively so may the merged civil_rights groups move to a higher plane of objectivity the question which arises is this would such a move cause a decline of emotions in their thinking and activities if so a great deal would indeed be lost also to be considered are those participants who have allied themselves with one particular group as stated previously the sights and sounds of a single road may attract one and repel another so a reason able assumption is that some individuals are not only committed to achieving the ultimate goal of the negro revolution but are also committed to certain leaders principles concepts methods and other facets of a specific group and in committing themselves to the latter they have probably established identities with their chosen group and have developed certain images regarding their role in the civil_rights battle since a merger would result in the groups being united indistinw f i guishably it is likely that such a union would precipitate an entirely new group image which would differ from any of those projected by the present organizations it is apparent then that a great many persons would have to realign themselves with the new union and would also have to create fresh images of their roles but when faced with the actual transition how many would or could willfully and completely cast off the old images and identificationshow many would or could attain and maintain the new ones and mainly how many would lose the old and reject or find unattainable the new finally how many would be left to flounder in the clutches of confusion and be left with nothing at all let us also briefly consider the leadership aspect if one of the present leaders were elected to head the group would the effectiveness of the remaining ones be somewhat impededwould their personalities be somewhat impaired as previously indicated some participants are especially allied with certain leaders and if those leaders were given seemingly lesser roles than they now have would their staunch supporters tend to resent that subordination would their resentment manifest itself in covert rebellion against the newly elected leader and in a general lessening of interest and effort regarding the combined activity it is probable that such manifestations would tend towards anarchy and would detract from the overall effectiveness of the group itself though this limited inquiry points toward the many questions and problems that would probably arise from a complete merger of the current civil_rights groups it is not meant to discourage or demean cooperation between those groups after all if the branches of the u s military can function effectively under a department of defense it seems feasible that the various rights groups could also operate properly under a similar authority for if the leaders of those groups would come together and form let us say a council of coordination many questions and problems in cooperation would no doubt be eliminated they could then coordinate their efforts and plan a common strategy which would determine what targets are to be assaulted and which group would be primarily responsible for the assault this strategy would evolve from the locale of the target the required number of participants the best method of attack and other pertinent factors on the basis of such plans it appears that they could attack each separate front without duplicating efforts and without coming into conflict with one another even though the negros struggle has spawned various groups could not the philosophies and methods of each be accepted and applied towards a successful end to our great venture for it is only fitting and proper that we use every legal and honorable means to succeed in our endeavor now is the time when we like shakespeares character should realize that there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their lives shall be bound in shallows and miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current as it serves or lose our ventures american history j abounds with success stories v they range from the fictional exploits of horatio alger to the very nonfictional success of andrew carnegie who rose from his start as a poor scottish immigrant to amass one of this countrys greatest fortunes we also have albert e watson im not equating watson with the legendary alger or the superaffluent carnegie but he does have his own cinderellalike success story its the story of how watson rose from a doortodoor sweetmeat salesman in the bayou country of louisiana to the owner of a successful meat processing plant in los angeles watsons success is also the story of what we at the small business administration are doing to help develop a strong stable negro middle class by helping negroes survive in the sharply competitive world of small business albert watsons new meat plant was tooled with the latest equipment in the trade his home is in baldwin hills suburban area which has its scattering of private swimming pools and boasts of a panoramic view of the city but for the year old watson it hasnt always been that way he started out as a small boy knocking on doors in houma louisiana selling unwanted byproductssuch as liver hearts and brainsfrom a nearby meat packing firm he combined his initiative skill salesmanship and assistance from the small business administration into his present operation with its employees at the age of he learned the trade of boning meats and for the next years he worked for a number of packing and processing firms learning more and more about the business while working he took care of his education by going to school at night his teachers started him in the seventh grade in and four years later he had received his high school diploma and had launched himself in college eventually he got a diploma from pepperdine college where he majored in business administration and american history in watson decided to bew come his own boss his first business venture was a single table cutting his own meats in six months his business expanded and he had to move to larger quarters after six months he moved again in he came to sb a to borrow to again expand his business he repaid the loan in full in and a little later again borrowed from sba this time the largest cash loan ever made by sba to a negro businessman this loan financed his new plant although it shows dramatically what can be done in business unfortunately albert watsons success is not typical of the negro small businessman the condition of these businessmen is shown by a single set of statistics negroes represent about per cent of the national population but they own less than two per cent of the nations million small businesses and the businesses that negroes do own have only about half the income of their white counterparts on top of this they have an extremely difficult time getting credit for expanding modernizing or starting a new business there is an urgent need to inject a massive economic stimulus into our negro population centers as a means of developing economic power among negroes this power isneeded not only to assure the survival of small businessmen but to provide the core of a healthy negro middle class which has been described as the stabilizer and social harmonizer since i became sba administrator in august we have been trying to break the ice that has long frozen the negro small businessman into an inadequately and ghettoized pattern of operation i think we have made considerable progress in this direction but we dont have the luxury of indefinite time to establish a viable negro small business class it is ironic that the civil_rights legislation which seeks to insure equal social and legal rights for our negro citizens also puts the pressure on the negro in the market place in enacting these safeguards of justice and equality the law weakens the wall which has long protected the negro businessman oriented toward the negro customer from white competition the negro small businessmans enterprise grew out of the segregation pattern and in its present form is almost entirely dependent upon it gradually as this pattern disappearsand it is in many areasthe negro small businessman must cut his racial ties and move out into the mainstream of commerce it is one of the major missions of our agency to assist in this process considerable progress has been made i believe that the reason we have progressed in this effort is because we view it not as simply a way of helping a business but also because we are seeking to help the individual behind the business and we are working to build a force for stability progress and creativity in a deprived community what specifically are we doing first we are providing credit on terms that emphasize a mans character rather than his collateral and at a reasonable rate of interest that will take him out of the grips of the loan sharks initially this took the form of what we call the by program loans up to for years it was started in philadelphia on a pilot basis in january the chief purpose was to make financial assistance available to the very very small businessman particularly the negro who found it virtually impossible to get credit from the traditional loan sources we also felt that many negro small businessmen who had the ingredients for success were unable to meet the more stringent requirements of sbas regular loan programs for example in the decade prior to setting up the by program only seven loans to negro businessmen had been made in philadelphia in just one year of operation of the special program such loans totaling were made in philadelphia to negro businessmen interestingly enough one of these philadelphia loans is probably the smallest federal loan made in this billiondollar era the loan for went to help two young women start a childrens day nursery for the working wives of the neighborhood in another case again in philadelphia a by loan made it possible for a year old father to go into business for himself the young man after going to school to study automobile transmission repair went to the bank to borrow money to take over his fathers auto repair garage because of debts he was turned down instead of being discouraged he went to work to pay off the debts and came to sba for a loan impressed by his ambition and the fact that he went out and earned the money to repaydebts we made a loan of for his business the by success story was repeated in several other large cities where the pilot program was set up to meet negro businessmens needs we were most gratified by the success of the program we were even more pleased when the by program became the basis of title iv of the economic opportunity actbetter known as the war on poverty legislation this section adopted the character principle of the by programbut on an expanded basis the legislation raised the loan limits to a maximum of for years again negroes were quick to respond to the broadened program and the first economic opportunity loan by sba went to a negro bakery cooperative in louisiana and one of the first community organizations set up to screen these loans for sba was established in harlem while we are pleased with the reception these programs have received we are not confining our assistance to negroes to special devicesas the watson loan shows and we are not seeking a strictly money answer to the problem of helping the small businessman in our efforts to provide a wide range of assistance and services to the negro business community we have established the office of special assistance for minority groups this post is held by randall l tyrus through his office sba makes a concerted and sustained effort to stay in personal contact with the negro leaders and organizations sharing our concern about the future of the negro business community and our desire to do something about it this liaison has resulted in substantial benefits in many areas and has led to direct cooperation between sba and negro leaders to set up active financial and management assistance programs for those needing such help recently i had the pleasure to appoint the first negro regional director for the small business administration james bruce llewellyn who has full charge of all sba activities in cities of eastern and southern new york including all of long island and staten island as regional director he will be in charge of employees including technicians his region has an estimated small businesses many of which look to sba for financial and other assistance we feel that we have made a sound beginning toward providing sustained effective assistance to negro small businessmen and by widening our horizons beyond this task we are seeking to make our agency a model of equal employment opportunities for the nations youth there is no certainty that our efforts will result in the story of albert watsons becoming typical but we are confident that we are on the road to making his story less unusual in hollywood released one of the most chilling movies of all time the invasion of the body snatchers grown men and women trembled even fainted as they watched giant podlike creatures from outer space duplicate individual humans and irresistibly insinuate themselves into the bodies of sleeping americans the transformation was undetectablethe victims looked sounded and moved as they had before but they were actually the spirits of the pods invested in human bodies and naturally in their dealings with earthlings their sole aim was to help a fellow creature become similarly incorporated until the whole earth became their home but the audienceonce out of the theater at leastrecognized this as a piece of fiction in however just two years later a former massachusetts candy bar businessman claimed that humanlike creatures called communists possessing neither consciences nor morals had taken over about per cent of america whether or not this man saw the horror movie is not determined but whatever his inspiration he asserted that any one of these communists can control or convert a hundred to a thousand completely misguided americans furthermore he continued it is almost impossible for the ordinary citizen to recognize these communists because they are too slippery for you to put your fingers on them in the ordinary way he doesnt wear any label he usually lives up to the appearance of excellent morals and you will usually find him in church on sunday morning maybe even a catholic church but as a member of the united states senate running for the presidency and smart enough to know the strong communist support behindthescenes which he will have to have to get nominated in such an amoral man can do a tremendous amount of ballcarrying on behalf of the communist aims here in the united states these are the words of robert welch founder of the john birch society a master of the halftruth and implicit smear welch directs suspicion fear and hatred against any group or individual opposed to the reactionary rightwing in the quoted passage for example welch does not make the propagandists mistake of naming anyone who fits the description of a catholic senator running for the presidential nomination yet his description fits only one man in the history of the world the late john f kennedy whose memory said a birch leader will be cherished with distaste of course the slain president is not the only one doused with the birchers red paint one learns from them that martin_luther_king jr dwight eisenhower john foster dulles albert einstein earl warren adlai stevenson humphrey bogart eleanor roosevelt and countless others with hardly anything in common are dedicated or manipulated agents of a communist conspiracy to subjugate the world through fallacies and falsehoods undetected by the untrained or muddled minds of their often wellmeaning followers birch leaders convince their gullible flock that communists are behind the civil_rights movement the un income tax fluoridation of water sex education the supreme court the clergy the press congressin short they are told that communists control the country how can so many americans believe the birch barking one reason is fear for fear is the child of ignorance and superstition and birch leaders preach to each member that more than half the people he sees may be suspected as members of a conspiracy to enslave him this fear begets hatred and intensifies the alltoohuman weakness of fearing hating and attacking ideas and people unfamiliar to or different from oneself a man who believes he is threatened by something he can neither see nor understand is a ready tool for the hands of demagogues and so upon learning that dag hammarskjold ralph bunche and former howard university president mordecai johnson have publicly advocated the doctrines of communism the confused young couples patriotic grandmothers zealous lawyers insecure immigrants tightfisted businessmen and hardbitten racists feel over whelmed and surrender their minds to powerhungry rightwingers sensitively aware that they are the butts of jokes and the victims of rash attacks birchers instinctively huddle together they enjoy thinking of themselves as an oppressed minority group of americanists but it is a mistake to ridicule or smear the birchers and a greater mistake moreover to ignore the fact that the dedicated core of leaders and organizers who plot and carry out the brainwashing of americans and sabotage of the constitution plan to inflict a repulsive tyrannical form of government on this country not only the fifth amendment but also the first freedom of speech religion press and assembly the sixth right to confront accusers in court fourteenth and fifteenth against voterdiscrimination graduated income tax article four the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states and many other constitutional provisions would be subverted by the birchers armed with catchy slogans and an expanded budget they play upon the insecurity of many americans who have recently gained middle class status they help these citizens decline the responsibilities of their status by occupying much of their time with reading matter and cunning projects like writing birch letters to liberal industrialists jamming the lines of phonein radio programs distributing stickers support your local police removing books they dislike from libraries erecting billboards and infiltrating the pta but their main strategy now is secretly to foment racial strife and thereby discredit liberal politicians who pass legislation designed to bring about a more democratic and just relationship between black and white with an increasing number of policemen falling under their spell birch leaders know that it is relatively easy for them to set the races against each other and spark a riot not only without police intervention but perhaps with police collaboration and then in the confusion and hysteria the rightwing will offer to the white majority a candidate who promises to smother civil_rights and other liberal protests once and for all too many americans believe that true conservatives like the birchers could hardly be involved in such a foul scheme but despite the patrioticreligious sounding names of their many front groups the birchers are definitely not conservatives they are made up to look that way but it is hard to teach an old bawd new tricks and ever so often the cosmetic facade of a birch group melts down its face exposing the flesh underneath not only do they cavort with outspoken racists like lester maddox the atlanta exrestaurateur but also with men more powerful and competent than maddox and who constitute what has been called the militaryindustrial complex this complex of active and retired rightwing military and businessmen is similar to the group which brought hitler to power these are the rich men who are not used to being questioned men who do not think of their fellow citizens as political social or moral equals and who resist the struggles of the oppressed many of these men are white supremacists it is significant that the klan was founded by an exconfederate general a negrotrader nathan bedford forrest whose methods of driving people into the klan corral were almost identical to welchs birch tactics said forrest in in each voting precinct there is a captain who is required to make out a list of names of men in his precinct giving all the radicals and all the democrats good guys who are positively known and showing also the doubtful on both sides and of both colors this list of names is forwarded to the grand commander of the state who is thus enabled to know who are our friends and who are not said welch in the john birch society will function almost entirely through small local chapters each will have a chapter leader appointed by headquarters another thing we should do and one badly needed would be to start shocking the american people into a dawning realization of how far and how completely communists and communist influences have crept right into communities institutions and activities where the general public does not have the slightest suspicion of such infiltration the best way to do this is by exposure which is why the communists just had to get rid of mccarthy the parallel is more meaningful when one notices that it is over racial problems the birchers most often trip sen james eastland mississippis bulwark is one of their experts on the american race problem and south carolinas strom thurmond is another birch booster the racist government of south africa is their prime example of a stable anticommunist regime and during the summer of welch urged birchers to contribute to the coordinating committee for fundamental american freedoms which spent half a million dollars fighting the civil_rights bill this committee pumped into a chicago polish newspaper alone thus by wooing policemen in big cities and by playing upon inferiority complexes of disadvantaged whites the birchers prove themselves adept at hitlerian tactics welch reveals his true nature in his a letter to the south on segregation addressing white people as he admits welch tells his followers that during the civil_rights movement a great many negroes are going to become very foolish indeed before this rising storm is over he tells his white readers that they form an elite and must meet the civil_rights advance with self control and constructive labor this is so far not rabid talk but a little further into the letter after implying that negroes use bathtubs less frequently than whites welch claims that the easygoing colored man of the south is being inflamed by communists the ordinary colored people of the south can easily be misled by clever agitators but truly in most cases they know not what they do he then argues that the phrase civil_rights is actually a communist slogan and informs his readers that those who approvingly use the phrase are attempting to put on pressures that will force you to armed resistance with the appearance in the minds of most people not close enough to be truly informed of right and justice on their side communists according to welch forced negroes to seek the supreme court desegregation decision even though school integration embarrassed negroes certain negroes like the ones who worked around his fathers north carolina farm but never tried to eat beside him in a restaurant are approved by welch he approves of the rev j l ward leader of the prince of peace goodwill movement in memphis he even put rev wards picture in a widely published birch society circular rev ward says welch has common sense despite his considerable difficulties with his plurals and his tenses welch printed the following statement of rev wards as typical of the negro with common sense we are asking the negroes of the south in the publishing of this literature let us remember that the lord brought us this way through the leadership of our southern white friends who knows us who helps us who has built our schools who has helped our churches who has given their monies and some have given their lives the birchers also approve of the rev uriah j fields in rev fields was a secretary of the montgomery improvement association unsatisfied with his role fields charged that rev martin_luther_king jr had misused funds collected to provide negroes with transportation during the bus boycott segregationists eagerly snapped up fields and he appeared as a witness for the prosecution before a grand jury which indicted king and other negroes when it became obvious that the charges would be proved false fields retracted his accusation and apologized to the innocent civil_rights workers he was not sued because king believes law suits are incompatible with the philosophy of nonviolence now fields lives in los angeles and is a member of the birch societys speakers bureau which sends him around the country exposing the communist plot behind the civil_rights movement he fields must be doing well now says a la newswoman hes driving a big new cadillac a negro woman mrs julia brown also of los angeles is another member of the societys speakers bureau denying that she is a member of the society mrs brown adds but i would consider it an honor birchers and their sympathizers enjoy mrs browns speeches in omaha neb she told them there are many communists working for negro voting rights because thats where the dirty work is so i can appreciate governor wallaces being tired of voting rights demonstrations martin_luther_king jr and james farmer are aiding the communist conspiracy the southern white man is the negros best friend mrs brown was once a paid informer for the fbi selling them information about alleged communists who were her former friends in the cleveland ohio i area other negroes whom the birchers have linked with themselves in the literature they pass out are the rev c fain kyle of richmond calif and his daughter gwendolyn rev kyle heads a group called discard dedicated independent society committee against racial demonstrations inc another group called the conservative christian churches of america and five other predominantly onemanshows miss kyle received the birchers first annual manning johnson scholarship award upon receiving it she told newsmen martin_luther_king is not what he appears to be to many people i think highly of the birch societyits doing a tremendous job telling the american people about the communist conspiracy in the civil_rights movement in america neither past present nor aspiring member of the society kyle says he has been used by birchers who figured that a negro conservative was a good drawing card kyle refused to become a member of the speakers bureau because people would say i was saying something because the society was paying me to say it kyle says he antagonized birchers by criticizing the antisemitism of some members and the fanaticism of others who he says get hooked on the organization most of them are fine people kyle believes but theyre over zealous because they look to a man as a leader and not to god but robert welch the man the birchers look to thinks of himself as part of some mighty purpose beyond our understanding by his present understanding this mighty purpose is to lead his followers in a fight against evil incarnated by people he calls communists he is a friend of the negro he says to the degree that the negro keeps out of the civil_rights movement for the civil_rights movement is part of a gigantic conspiracy to enslave mankind run by men who are utterly ruthless gangsters willing to use any means to achieve their end with sublime illogic welch says that these communists have no real dedication even to communism welch himself longs for that western europe of the nineteenth century when white men had the power and desire to bring civilized rule to the settled natives on all continents of the earth present day america according to welch is suffering from cancer and needs drastic surgery which can be provided only if birchtype americans become conspirators against established government hitler it should be remembered saw his mission as a historic revenge entrusted to us by the creator a revenge which involved regenerating germany from the disease of democrats marxists jews masons and other criminals and hitler as time has proved also believed in drastic surgery but the american radicalright does not have a leader with hitlers outspokennessyet today welch sounds more like the klans first grand wizard n b forrest sounded when he plotted against the abolitionists in i loved the old government in i loved the old constitution yet i am opposing only the radical revolutionaries who are trying to destroy it men who would hesitate at no crime and who have only one object in view to enrich themselves i want you to understand distinctly i am not an enemy to the negro we want him here among us he is the only laboring class we have smple and tragic the storyan old one jerry chatman and one robert shuler are young negroes under sentences of death for the rape of a white woman the letter came as attorney tobias simon with florida law students were completing a statewide investigation as part of the naacp legal defense funds campaign against the discriminatory application of the death penalty against negroes in rape cases the defense fund handles virtually all of the civil_rights litigation in the country the attorneys were in a difficult position the client wanted to give up the fouryear battle for his life he simply could not take it anymore yet the attorney knew it might be proven the state had no right to execute him fortunately it was resolved when he changed his mind and the federal judge in charge of the case took this into account and ordered the defense to continue the state had argued that chatmans letter gave them the right to execute him scope of the legal defense fund program besides chatman and shuler eight other negroes are on death row in florida for the rape of white women two others have asked the legal defense fund to defend them to protect the others the fund made a plea to the governor not to execute any of them until the chatman and shuler cases concerning the states right to execute are settled the governor agreed to withhold execution pending disposal of the issue the fund also represents twelve other negroes under death sentence for rape in six other southern states others may also be under death sentences who dont know help is available importance of the statistics the extraordinary thing about the chatman and shuler cases is that florida is the first and only state in the nation for which defense attorneys have gathered statistics that blanket an entire state and compare the conviction and death penalties for negro and white defendants records in each of counties had to be examined in addition to the records of three state agencies a complete factual picture is crucial for the supreme court of florida seven years ago turned down two defendants because the data they offered to prove discrimination was incomplete these defendants had presented the total number of executions but not the total number of convictions both were executed florida death penalty rate over the last years men have been sentenced to death for forcible rape six were white and were negroes this is against a background of an almost equal number of convictions between the two races white men convicted and negro men convicted of the six whites sentenced to death the supreme court of florida reversed the sentences of two and the pardon board the last hope of the defendant commuted the death sentences to life for three of the remaining four therefore only one white man has actually been executed for the crime of rape and this defendant raped an yearold white child and was about to commit sodomy on a young yearold boy who was also present this defendant joined an allstar cast of twosince only one other white man had been executed before of the negroes sentenced to death have already been executed and are now on death row six others had their death sentences reversed four by the supreme court of florida and two by the supreme court of the united states out of appeals by negro defendants the pardon board has granted mercy in only two cases the board evidently considers rape by a negro more serious than murder for it has granted commutations for per cent of the murderers sentenced to death who appealed to them who were the victims no white man has been sentenced to death for raping a negro woman although were convicted of the crime of the six whites originally sentenced to death four attacked white children and two jointly raped a white adult but the only one executed raped an yearold white child no white man has died for the rape of a white woman the rape of a negro woman is not considered serious even when the rapist is a negro for the rape of negro females by negro males only three men were sentenced to death and two of these were child rapes the conviction of the third was reversed by the florida supreme court thus to date no negro has died for the rape either of a negro adult or a negro child the picture shifts sharply as regards rapes of white females by negro men in convictions defendants or roughly per cent of those convicted have been sentenced to death only one of the involved a white child all the others involved white women the negroes executed were drawn from this group of defendants what will be argued in court the struggle with florida which may end in the supreme court of the united states could save negro defendants and ultimately white defendants if successful the fund will argue that the rape statute has been used solely to execute negroes while sparing whites charged with the same crime thus denying the equal protection of the laws that is guaranteed by the federal constitution it will also be argued that killing the defendant when he has not killed anyone is cruel and unusual punishment also barred by the federal constitution both arguments could if accepted protect the white defendant from death as well to take a whites life where he has not taken a life would likewise be unlawful cruelty further the state would naturally not be able to execute a white if the penalty could no longer be applied to negroes rape international and national the united states is only one of the five out of nations in the world that still demands capital punishment for a rape where no one was killed within the u s only southern or border states carried the penalty and two delaware west virginia have dropped it since negroes and whites have been executed surprisingly the federal government primarily for the military and the district of columbia still maintain the death penalty for rape fiftythree men race unknown and three negroes and two whites have been executed under federal law can a negro receive a fair trial the injustice of the death penalty is acute for widespread racial prejudice makes a fair trial unlikely juries are generally all white and may have been rigged that way judges are elected by the local community and white lawyers dont like handling unpopular negro defendants in the face of such massive hostility many negroes lack hope and feel powerless when confronted with official intimidation one negro family in folkston georgia came to the legal defense fund only two days before a relative was to be executed for rape fortunately he was saved by attorneys moving rapidly but the case is not atypical group punishment when a negro is tried for attacking a white person his whole racial group is really on trial it is his group who the authorities feel must be warned against like attacks by the swift harsh treatment applied to him naturally when one group tries another it becomes less important to have the actual perpetrator of the crime any representative from the minority group will do the laws of the south are quite concerned with prohibiting interracial sex states make voluntary sexual contacts or even marriage between negroes and whites a crime rape by a negro is the deepest cut of all the crime triggers hysteria and latent sexual fears and the personal route for thinking about the crime is there what if it had been my wife or my child delaware and west virginia are the only southern states that have abolished the death penalty for rape in the last thirty years because it has been a weapon used liberally against negroes five southern states alone have executed negroes for rape but not one white man since rape is the end horror official excesses aimed at getting the accused are tolerated the famous groveland florida case arising in the same county where chatman was convicted is an example there four young men were accused of raping a white woman one was killed by an armed posse which claimed he resisted arrest the other three were convicted in a community where the ku klux klan ravaged negro neighborhoods in revenge for the crime two of the defendantswalter irvin and samuel shepherdreceived death and the third charles greenlee a sixteen year old was sentenced to life imprisonment shepherd and irvin won new trials from the supreme court of the united states because the jury had been selected in a racially discriminatory manner sheriff willis mccall on bringing the two defendants back to the county for retrial shot both of hem he said they were trying to escape shepherd died instantly but miraculously irvin lived on his hospital bed and near death irvin said they had not tried to escape but that mccall had stopped the car mumbled something about niggers giving him a hard time and shot them at the time they were handcuffed to one another wrist and ankle irvin was tried and sentenced to death for a second time but later became one of the only two negroes in floridas history to have his sentence commuted the shuler and chatman convictions are being challenged on the grounds that falsified and suppressed evidence was used a statement by the victim to the prosecutor that shuler had not touched her was never divulged to the court two former county deputies supported by fbi agents are now willing to testify that two of the deputies faked the footprints that were supposed to have come from the victims yard the two deputies claim a right against selfincrimination under the florida constitution and have refused to testify possibility of error the chatman and shuler cases show that the innocent may be falsely convicted but apart from official obstruction of justice motivated by racial prejudice there are two other possibilities of error florida unlike many other states does not require that the womans claim of rape be supported by other testimony showing that it actually occurred this leaves a defendant negro or white greatly at the mercy of an unbalanced a mistaken or even a revengeful woman a negro may be afraid to tell about a secret affair with the accusing woman since southern juries may find that very notion more repulsive than an attack further doesnt the crime of rape itself particularly that of a child raise serious doubts about the sanity of a defendant in the face of the implacable and deadly hostility of the white community a negro who still attacks a white may very well be acting out of uncontrollable compulsion or derangement indeed it may be an attempt at suicide no state permits the insane to be executed yet the high rate of negro execution would indicate that whether the defendants were mentally disturbed has not been given sufficient attention where does it end the picture is a shocking and grizzly one southern regions which have kept negroes out of lowly hamburger stands have allowed them full and preferential access to the electric chair open and uncontrolled lynching has steadily fallen into disreputebut what can it matter if a racially bigoted community can use the judicial system to commit murder as surely as the mobs of yesteryear is not the whole of american justice menaced if onethird of our nation is permitted to continue with absolute racial carnage how many more jerry chatmans must there be wdjshen i was invited to write this book i did not have a favorable w i impression of ulysses s grant the school books of the days of my youth led me to associate his name with corruption and cigars intoxication and failure i know now that this picture is as accurate as the impression of the blind man who grasped an elephants tail and thought he was holding a rope the uses of history are varied but most important is the understanding of the present in terms of its being the product of the past history is primarily a human product in two senses men live it and men write it i have tried my best to give an honest picture of the man who led the victorious armies in the last year of the civil war and then became the president during whose administration we lost the peace if my picture differs somewhat from that which school histories have led you to expect it is possible that the men who wrote them were giving expression to their prejudices or accepting too uncritically the product of the prejudices of others to the extent that i have helped the reader to learn a great deal about a man and something about an era that have been dealt with unjustly by historians it may be that i have helped to meet some of the problems of today and tomorrow there can hardly be a time more important than the present for directing attention to the affirmative aspects of grants life and character as a son as a husband and as a father he was guided throughout his life by a morality that transcended a mere desire to please this same quality enabled him to show what his new england abolitionist contemporary thomas wentworth higginson called the moral insight to see that the mexican war was a contest in which his own country was wrong and to have the courage to say so this aspect of his character will also explain grants understanding of the difference between a peoples war and a mere contest of soldiers as colonel higginson wrote with the special insight into that difference that he himself gained in his leadership of an exslave regiment fighting for their peoples freedom grants dedication to a peoples government is shown by this citizensoldiers recognition of the subordination of the military to civilian rule so long as i hold a commission in the army i have no views of my own to carry out we are not often told of these aspects of grants military career nor are we told in learning of his political failures of the genuine aspirations for fair play and reconciliation that moved this man before and during his presidency let us have peace was his campaign slogan and his epitaph but he wantedand fought as well as he could forjustice as the only possible foundation for a peace that would be durable one skilled contemporary observer put it prophetically as we are now learning any postponement of justice is a postponement of peace these were the words of georges clemenceau a young political exile in who was reporting american reconstruction for le temps and who was to lead his own country half a century later in a war that brought no peace freedom is never wholly attained but always must be pursued so it is with justice and so too with the truth about our history if you learn from the life of the soldier who was a pacifist the failure who was a success the man of action whose last victory was as a man of letters that there is more much more to americas heritage than you thought i will have achieved my purpose in the book it is time that justice were done to the man vilified beyond his deserts by those embittered not by the mistakes he made but by his supreme achievement the ratification of the fifteenth amendment to our constitution it was that guaranty of the right of all men to vote however humble their origin that he called for in his inaugural message as an instrument of peace he hailed it when ratification was completed in words that have not been remembered from until say man where

educated lives all bunched together in the same black neighborhoods and hey man lets go get a beer crazy man american literature has been in the throes of decolonization since america first put pen to paper this literature began as a countrycousin literature of england we were beholden to england for culture and broke with that culture through politics for the great literature of this country until lately is political in fact it is the great political documents of america which have broken the back of cultural slavery all over the world the writings of jefferson the constitution the emancipation proclamation are the basic artifacts of american literature decolonization is born in these documents we are just beginning to feel the consequences we are still at the dawn of those fabulous political words three hundred years passed before the first words of cultural independence were set down three centuries of holding on to the old world the european mother we might have been a french country or a spanish country or english like canada but we turned out to be none of those one of the main reasons was that we had slaves we had negroes the presence of slaves forced the ideal of liberty to its conclusion when america decolonized itself from europe from england it opened the door to decolonization everywhere we pressed a button and opened the pandora box it is this country that gave france the example of revolution and even today we are the admiration and the horror of the old world we have not broken with those documents we were englands robert frost said we were colonials when we stopped being colonials all hell broke loose to be colonial means to live in a faraway place and to long for home american literature was this way until little more than a century agountil a few writers began to say like emerson europe is not home until thoreau pulled back even from the village of concord until whitman rewrote the constitution in poetry and sang the one great poe lincolnto be colonial means to hold onto the umbilicus of home and also to create the native america created two natives the indian and the negro the indian was banished to the unconscious mind of america what is left of the indian is a record of cultural shock which is phenomenal in modern history but the negro could not be banished he was an industrial army fuel to be burned and to be replenished of itself he was the american native richard wright called his first novel native son he understood native but we were still colonial when we began to write we would even send a negro slave girl to england as a poet in the eighteenth century i want to quote verbatim the biographical note from an old anthology of negro poetry edited by langston hughes and arna bontemps in this is colonialism in a nutshell phillis wheatley senegal west africa was captured and sold into slavery in early childhood and brought to boston in she became the property of john wheatley of boston whose wife and daughter soon noted the alert sensitivity of the young african girl and encouraged philliss efforts to acquire learning within a few years she was completely at home in the language and literature of her captors she began writing poetry and in at the age of seventeen published a poem by phillis a negro girl in boston on the death of the reverend george whitefield when her health began to fail phillis was advised by doctors to take a sea voyage this was arranged by the kindly mistress who also gave the girl her freedom before she sailed for england in london phillis was a success it was there that her only collected volume of verse was first issued under the title poems on various subjects religious and moral then one by one the patrons of this talented exslave girl died and she returned to boston her marriage was unhappy and she died as a servant in a cheap lodging house at the age of thirtyone the ironies of this footnote are staggering and would require a dostoevsky to handle them phillis wheatleys poetry is as bad as all colonial eighteenth century poetry though better than that say of the hartford wits which isnt saying much yet this experiment in colonial culture contains a message the message is negative all down the line slavegirl boston at the dawn of revolution guilt about rebellion from the old world neoclassical poetry the kindly mistress and so on in every case except ours a new culture is based on home country settler and native but in america nobody knows where the home country is for the settlers come from home countries all over the world and the natives are no more we have no natives and no common home country we have no peasantry we have only expatriates and exslaves this is a country of runaways and captives when the literature of america got under way it fascinated the world runaways and captives cops and robbers cowboys and indians palefaces and blackskins jews and goyim syndicate and chamber of commerce nobody wanted to be a nativethe natives were dead and done foreverybody wanted to be a settler those who would not settle went back to some old country of the mind eliot santayana pound hemingway henry james others mourned their rootlessnesswe have a whole literature of that the cultural history of our country is one of decolonization every element trying to sever itself from its origins we are something like the white australians who are not eager to trace their ancestry back more than three or four generations because that original ancestor will have been sent over in the hulks the convict ships which were sent from england to the farthest place england could think of every ffv in australia was a convict we are in the same boat we have only a paper aristocracy and our aristocrats were revolutionaries who fought for their lives in this sense the daughters of the american revolution are subversives only they have forgotten what their ancestors were subversive about our literature took a long time to decolonize from english literature and the process hasnt ended yet in the beginning we were anglosaxon about percent for the blacks were not counted in the population and the immigrants hadnt arrived excuse a few statements of facts which i think mean so much a generation after independence the germans and irish began to arrive in force before the civil war hordes of irish dutch danes swedes norwegians swiss and jews swarmed in toward the end of the century came larger waves of italians russians poles austrians bohemians and hungarians a smaller number of asiatics seeped in for this country is still antiasiatic we invented our first concentration camps of american citizens of japanese ancestry during the second world war in all this the english element was inundated and contaminated the language of the king was lost in the shuffle a language in itself is nothing a literature in itself is nothing a literature is the expression of a nations soul and a great literature leaves nothing outthat is its greatness but to leave nothing out means to go against the grain it means to dissent our modern literature is a literature of dissent monotonous and endless dissidence this dissidence gives modern literature its authenticity yet this literature of dissent is only in its infancy dissent is contagious and every day we find new areas of eruption everywhere in the world but dissent is also a drop in the bucket of literature a drop of pigment in the skin or in the blood american literature is unique it is the only literature i have ever heard about in which all elements have tried more or less simultaneously to decolonize themselves it is the only literature which practices cultural amnesia as a doctrine the two famous american writers henry james and t s eliot who refused to surrender the past who insisted on memory surrendered their nationality to the idea of european cultural supremacy they could maintain a continuity with europe only by becoming european again english literature is a dead literature in america a memory the english language is practically a memory only a few english professors in this country pretend that english and its great literature are continuous with ours a decolonized literature in an african country or in a free arab country or in israel is different from ours those nations have a culture to go back to they go back to where they began when history interrupted their life in israel the hebrew language was reinvented overnight after a sleep of two thousand years it seemed the most natural thing in the world for it was that language and its great book which held those people together who became the new israelites in india people fight in the streets to retain their ancient tongues the source of their culture in africa french and english will not long remain the medium of literature not in the european forms at least but in america we have only vestiges of culture to which we do not wish to return the first thing the american immigrant tried to do was to prevent his children from inheriting the old language the old culture in my case for instance yiddish was used as a private language of jokes and confidences which we third generation americans were not supposed to know i have found the same to be true with students of mine who are of czech descent or swedish or dutch or greek in a sense all cultural languages are banished from america a country settled by runaways and slaves did not carry much high culture with it and the tides of immigration engulfed what high culture there was the halfeducated american has long been a byword abroad in fact it is impossible for the american to be educated in the european sense we cannot be nor do we have to as ask my fellow teachers in what way am i to present say english poetry to the grandson of a latvian farmer from a ranch in western nebraska as the poetry of his culture in what way am i to present chaucer or t s eliot to my negro students is that their heritage is the great complex of european culture their heritage and do they have any such heritage at all even to me an english projessor and a writer of the english tongue all things english are foreign i gather from sartres recent writing about africa that european culture is no longer capable of influencing world culture europe is now the colony it is european culture which is thirsty for replenishment from outside american culture shows a similar thirst for replenishment but can slake this thirst from within the great theme of american literature is rootlessness and this fact also makes us unique many writers have even said that there is no relationship between the american and the land it is as if the spirit of place were hostile to us we become the greatest technicians and mechanics because we fight the spirit of place we are bent upon conquering place by force we have never made peace with the land but have taken it by storm d h lawrence felt about this as miller and faulkner have in their books the urban poets who have forgotten what a tree looks like substantiate it in their dusty poems the price our writers have had to pay for rootlessness for cutting ties with all the different pasts behind us is the neuroticism we know so well in our literature and yet we have no choice insofar as the american writer is true to his situation he is a neurotic ridden with the anxieties of separateness from the past freedom is one of the beneficent symptoms of this anxiety we are suddenly confronted with an alphabet of freedom ranging from civil_rights to freedom of the banned book and the spoken obscenity our literature is engaging in a socratic dialogue with all previous values we do this with increasing recklessness and frequently with cynicism for what is there to lose the fact is that there is no place to go back to we have nowhere to go but forward we cannot help ourselves that is our condition so long as america held onto the mother literature it was colonial this was the case until the twentieth century and even into it the criterion of the poem was the english poem of the novel the english novel the exceptions are few and can be counted on one hand it was only with the recognition of rootlessnes that a strong and massive american literature came into being this theme coincided with all the forms of radicalism which swept through the intelligentsia in the early years of the century anarchism various forms of marxism and more recently existentialism are all expressions of the rootless those peoples set adrift by history who have nevertheless become articulate the jewish writer was among the first to speak from this void the jew is the mythic wanderer but the american jew is the one who has forgotten where he wandered from the american jew has no longing for israel and possibly only an intellectual sympathy with it he has little or no cultural memory of the religion or of the tradition all he has is the invisible yellow badge which still shows up in certain lights this badge this psychology of selfconsciousness make the jew want to be absolutely visible he insists on his identification he is the opposite of ellisons invisible man if the jew does not stick out like a sore thumb he is very restless hence all these books by and about jews why does the irishman james joyce choose a poor uninteresting jew to be his main character in ulysses because leopold bloom not only has a faulty memory of his fabulous past as a hebrew but because he is lost bloom is a symbol of the modern bourgeois drifter he doesnt belong in ireland or anywhere else he is cultural ectoplasm in america we are all cultural ectoplasm and the jew can stick out his sore thumb look in a mirror and say like job whence cometh thou i dont want to give one more book review of the now famous and brilliant novel herzog but cant resist a sentence or two herzog the neurotic professor and intellectual is having a breakdown ostensibly because of a broken marriage but the marriage is secondary he is having a breakdown because he is herzog american jewish intellectual like leopold bloom he is discovering that he is adrift he has no place to go back to neither his home from which he has been locked out by his bitchy wife nor his world of ideas which has fallen all over the floor of his study and all he can do is write letters to the living and the dead trying to make a contact somewhere with all those broken wires it is almost a formula of the american novel what is the fascination for the jewish american writer today it is the fascination of the american for one of his own types the man who at last debates with himself the question what does it mean to be a jew an american a negro an american jew an american negro an afroamerican an american of jewish descent etc what it means of course is that the question has been raised the question was not raised in the nineteenth century except perhaps by walt whitman and the question refers art back to the political artifacts are those things real do they mean what i think and hope they mean the constitution of the united states has been backed into a corner by writers no constitution can answer all the questions we are asking it every time the constitution answers a question it asks a new one but americanjewish writing is already obsolete the jew qua jew is no longer a major premise in the creative equation the jewish writer can in effect sit back and chew his cud and watch the negro the jew has achieved decolonization in america not by himself it was going to happen somehow i lived through it and even had a hand in itmaybe i should explain that very early in life i decided upon being a poet i wont go into the motivations of being a poet which are very complex and also irrelevant here knew only one language english and so fell in love with english poetry falling in love with english poetry which is still my old flame meant living an imaginary english life living an imaginary english life meant living a phony life of the mind for i was not english in any sense of the word and living a phony life of the mind meant eventually becoming an english professor i have no rights to the title one day when had learned how to write poetry i had to make a decision about my name nobody in the oxford book of english verse was named shapiro in fact nobody was named shapiro except tailors and junk dealers what was to do change my name this was my first crisis as a poet in those days believe it or not it was impossible to get a poem published if you did not have an anglosaxon name but decided to stick to my name that decision made me jewish and since i had made the decision i wrote poems about jewishness my name itself had not content whatever most jews names are more recent than the last names of negroes that is most jews got names when napoleon broke the ghetto system in europe and the jews were either given the names of a german or polish town or made up one shapiro is named after a german town named speyer am told i hold on to vanderbilt or r j reynolds it was the foreignness of the word i hung onto that i wanted to know why my name was a kind of curse years later published a book called poems of a jew that was when i was finally decolonized when i printed that book i was already american was as rootless as a texas millionaire with negro and indian blood in his veins when our literature got under way it began like a census to list our cultural deaths there was the grand gesture of whitman like a captain on the bridge waving goodbye to the past there was captain ahab hunting down the great white blood consciousness and sinking the ship of white civilization along with it there was huck finn who lit out for the wilderness running for his life like his author from respectability there followed that long recital of the failure of the american hero the epitaphs of spoon river and winesburg ohio the brutal caricatures of the american bourgeois the salesman the evangelist the politician the corruption of pioneer and settler by the rootless materialism of the new world hemingway assaults the virility of the american male faulkners vast gallery of southerners portrays the decline and fall of a world under a cursehe calls it rightly the curse of slavery of the heroes of the american novel only the artist is left unscathed he is ishmael in the cultural desert it is the motif of rootlessness that gives our literature its greatness to the outside world whatever the value of literary prizes consider the names of americans who have been awarded the nobel prize for literature eugene oneill pearl buck hemingway faulkner and steinbeck eliot i take it is not american these writers deal mainly with modern man in the void if they are part of what is called the western tradition they lie at the very edge of it each phase of american literature marks a further step away from that tradition as each colonial group in america finds its literary voice we are moved deeper into the void huckleberry finn ahab joe christmas herzog it hardly matters who the hero is he leads us on the search for his authenticity it is the unauthentic american artist who reaches back to the tradition the martinique writer and psychiatrist frantz fanon who died four years ago says in his book the wretched of the earth that when the african native begins to pull on his moorings and to cause anxiety to the settler he is handed over to wellmeaning souls who in cultural congresses point out to him the specificity and wealth of western values and he adds but every time western values are mentioned they produce in the native a sort of stiffening or muscular lockjaw the cultural conference or congress is a twentieth century institution which has never been looked at squarely i myself make it a point to avoid those conferences but i have attended enough of them here and abroad to know that they represent a more or less official machine dedicated to the status quo they seek to hold the line for traditional values for this reason the culture conference is supported by governments by foundations and by writers and artists who have a stake in the tradition the culture conference is opposed to decolonization at least the decolonization of culture the hidden premise on which it operates is the superiority of european culture it must therefore work hard to reconvert the native and bring him back to a sense of cultural inferiority i attended once one of these conferences in tokyo where it was agreed beforehand that politics could not be discussed here were a multitude of writers from all the world among them some of the most famous and some of the most political who voluntarily emasculated all discussion at the outset instead they talked about the art of translation and had a similar experience last summer a group called the congress for cultural freedom was to meet in west berlin to honor poets from the new african nations i was invited to speak on the first day along with a negro poet whose language was french and a negro poet whose language was english that is they were colonials in the throes of decolonization evidently the berlin meetings were to restore the faith of the africans in european culture but why was i asked to open the meetings along with the african poets because i was an american jew supposedly assimilated into the american or as the conference perhaps thought western tradition intended to go having never been to germany or having met poets of africa immediately upon my acceptance however i received a letter from a french writer in charge of the affair who began to caution me what to say and what not to say that struck me as a bit odd coming from an official of an organization that used the word freedom in its name nor would he be specific in one letter he would flatter me by saying that he knew i was a great fighter or words to that effect and in the next he would indicate that the meetings must be kept friendly i was never more puzzled in my life nor more offended our correspondence went on all summer ending in a flurry of cablegrams in which i finally declined to come to berlin if were to be gagged and what was it the congress of cultural freedom which was entertaining poets from the new africa refused to have discussed the race question had i been a believer in the tradition and its values i might have served the congress well might have told how a jewish poet born in america made a rapproachement with the tradition but i have never made such a rapproachement they had invited the wrong man as tennyson said about the charge of the light brigade someone had blundered is negro literature possible a few years ago one could ask in all seriousness is a negro literature possible in america the question implied a negative i am among those who felt that the negro had nothing to gain by becoming literary that he had nothing to say according to the tradition of letters as we know that tradition he could only create a pseudoliterature the novel and poem according to uncle tom we had seen this happen with paul laurence dunbar and the early slave poets between a transliterated negro dialect itself a phony dialect and oxjord book english there seemed no choice if there were to be an authentic negro medium where would it come from obviously it could not come from the standard classics of american literature poetry or prose perhaps something could rise from the church spiritual a form of poetry which worked upon secret levels of meaning or more likely from the blues but almost nothing of the sort appeared to be happening a literature is not created in a vacuum it is created out of love for its medium could and should the negro love the angloamerican language or was it possible that he had his own version of it as the jewish writer had his version but a literature is more than a version of language a novel or poem is more than a work of art literature is an accurate transcription of the quality of thought and feeling of the writer and his people what audience would such a literature have if any was there a negro audience to read native son or invisible man or tolsons libretto one suspected there wasnt that such works would be for a small white or mixed audience the publication of native son was a great shock to the white reader not only because of what it said but because a negro had written it negroes didnt produce works of that calibre nor did they read them literature so the mythos went wus white mans business even the books by richard wright were in the white tradition his audience was the traditional audience as were the values implicit in the work ellisons invisible man which i wrote about elsewhere as the great american novel is a masterpiece but again in the white tradition ellison might even be called a white negro neither what he says or how he says it is without precedent in the general literary consciousness like wright he corroborates the white liberals worst fears like wright he illuminates the guilt of the settler visavis a native in fact it seems to me that there is more negritude if i may use the word in faulkner than in either wright or ellison faulkner is better able to present the sensibility of the negro albeit the mississippi negro because faulkners characters are not always at the point of dramatic crisis what wright and ellison proved was that the negro can write a novel as good as a white novel as good as anything in the tradition but this obviously was not enough especially as the tradition was beginning to come apart at the seams for a negro literature to come into being it had to start from the bottom not from the top all great poetry comes from the bottom homer dante chaucer whitman all went to the language of the street for their great poems a negro poetess could prove that she could win the pulitzer prize but nobody has been able to prove that the pulitzer prize is worth winning embracing the art of writing at some time in its career a people makes a decision to embrace the art of writing it has no obligation to at any time the jews produced virtually no literature after the old testament except commentaries the jews were in a state of cultural withdrawal all during the diaspora scholars will disagree but cannot convince me that the jews produced any literature or art or music worth mentioning until the great revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries freed the jew from cultural bondagelt is in our century that the jew has suddenly begun to sing and paint and write for this is the century of cultural liberation all over the world ours is one of the greatest periods of art in history and it is great insofar as we have broken with the tradition to break with the tradition does not mean to annihilate it it means to place new values upon it it means to pick up the pieces and maybe throw them down again malraux means this when he says about the greatness of modern art the fragment is king negro literature in america had to begin with the fragment not with the whole form having proved out of pride that it could handle the w hole form like wright or ellison or gwendolyn brooks or langston hughes it must then throw down the formsfrom the top of the empire state building i think that is what baldwin is doing critics say what a shame that baldwin should give up the novel for the polemic and the pamphlet i dont think that is any of our business what if the novel has proved unsatisfactory to him what if the poem has proved the same arent all the great examples of art and literature of our time antiart the greatness as well as the horror of the twentieth century is that it is a last judgment it is a time when every value is called into question everywhere and on every level of the human experience it is the genius of our age to question the racial revolutions of our age are more effects than causes they are the result of universal indignation over the failures of our culture one country famed for its music and its philosophers tried to destroy a whole nation in its midst by murder another country famed for poetry discovered that it held a large part of the world in virtual slavery another country famed for its sense of liberty and its adoration of the arts suddenly collapsed from internal weakness and corruption these were all european countries of great antiquity in the east rose a superpolice state with a paranoid belief in its historical destiny in america we assembled and exploded the ultimate weapon the generation that inherited these acts of the immediate past was catatonic people referred to them as the silent generation and they were ten years ago i went to the campus at berkeley california to teach one of the professors in my department cautioned me that it was hard to do any work there it was a lotus land and so it was not only the faculty but the students were somnambulists then a young man across the bay in san francisco published a poem which was heard round the world it was scream of anguish it was obscene and american and innocent aggressive and angry it was the first shot in the new revolution of the word and it was a signal for a general awakening of the consciousness of a new generation a generation got out of its convertibles and went on the picket line i dont think this an exaggeration about allen ginsbergs howl it was a poem that flatly refused to accept the premises about decorumliterary political racial cultural it was a poem of refusal and of absolute commitment a san francisco earthquake in the rhythm of leaves of grass the defenders of the tradition the cemeterykeepers hurried to defend their cemeteries they brought up their heavy artillery but it didnt matter almost simultaneously the civil_rights movement appeared on the horizon the two things are related one forbidden book after another some of the great classics of our age passed through the courts victoriously and so forth and so on up to the present free speech movement which is shaking educational institutions to their foundations for many years i have been trying to loosen the hold of the academic or colonial mind over poetry not only poetry but the entire literature of reference the kind that refers back in every case to prior commitments historical religious or philosophical in a sense it is a useless battle attacking the establishment only tends to strengthen it it would be better to ignore the existence of the literature of reference and to create whatever we think valid than to go on tilting at windmills this is what the beat writers did they were successful because they refused to take part in the academic dialogue if someone asked one of the usual deathly questions such as what is the role of the artist in the modern world they would be likely to answer something like fried shoes refusal to play the game kept them safe refusal to play the game won freedom for india and is winning freedom for the american south refusal to play the game will turn the dehumanized multiversity back into a place of learning the importance of the negro writer in the world today is far out of proportion to the number of books we have to go by but the significance of negro writing today is paramount because everywhere not simply in america the negro is in the position to ask the questions the hyphenated jewish writer is no more time has solved that problem the jewish writer is either assimilated into the modern bourgeois world with all its neuroses or he is a settler in the biblical land carrying on skirmishes against the philistines or the egyptians as in the days of old a few american jews try to keep alive the mystique of the diaspora but with little success most modern jews themselves reject the myth of the dispersion for our time they go to israel and have a look and then hurry back to detroit or omaha today the american negro faces the same dilemma richard wright baldwin tolson know that mother africa is not for them and the africans know it too everywhere decolonization is taking place we find the disappointment of the visitor who feels rejected from his dream but this is part of the awakening part of the process of freedom itself if the african looks down on the american negro he has earned that right if the afroamerican feels out of place in nigeria or even liberia he knows at last the limits of his dream we can witness at the moment three phases of decolonization in our culture nostalgia assimilation and negritude nostalgia is homesickness not for the good old days but for the bad old days assimilation means a cultural entente at the expense of any mystique negritude means assertion of the realities historical and mystical as well the early literature of america all of it is nostalgic for the worst it is as true of anne bradstreet as for phillis wheatley and in fact the masses of people at any time fear the heavy responsibilities of freedom and pine for the bad old days when all choices were made for them to not have to choose is a freedomthe freedom of the slave the negro poets who cultivated a slave dialect were in fact in accord with their condition they consented to the cultural authority of the whiteprosody as the white colonials acceded to the cultural authority of the old world the nostalgia of assimilation but assimilation too is nostalgic it was often said of german jews before hitler that they were more german than the germanswhich didnt stop hitler from rooting them out the nostalgia of the american jewish writer who is assimilated into american literature is curious i was talking with a famous american writer who had made jewishness the theme in his books speaking of the new jews the israelis he said but they arent jews anymore i agreed those new jews had lost their consciousness of the diaspora they had fought their way back into the mythical homeland and were lost to the old jewry but cultural assimilation of jews into american life was relatively easy and has all but been accomplished a jew has not the problem of the hindu the oriental or the negro the jew looks more or less american anywhere he goes even his name is not held against him as it once was but cultural assimilation alo means national oblivion for the nation assimilated one can only pretend to act like a jew the writer and artist can do this easily because that is his business the american jew of average sensibility on the other hand experiences the common cultural amnesia of americans of any extraction while the american jewish figure in fiction has a cultural nervous breakdown over american twentieth century values he longs for the bad old days when his father was a bootlegger or a peddler because he was suffering the crucifixion of the culturally underprivileged the father would do anything to keep his family jews to turn them into doctors and lawyers or rich merchants with economic freedom they could then be jews only it didnt work that way for jewishness meant suffering and an unsuffering jew was an anomaly an unsuffering jew is a goy hence the nostalgia of the assimilated the negro is luckier he can never disappear from his condition in the caucasian world any more than a hindu or a japanese there he is unassimilable and unnostalgic the biggest fact of life in the modern world the ideal of negritude j our century is very great because with us all the chickens have come to roost because great men of goodwill statesmen presidents leaders of men artists and young people have demanded the exaction of promises made to nations by visionaries and the spokesmen of freedom this is happening under our eyes we are all a party to it nostalgia is obsolete assimilation may well be neither is of vital importance i prefer the idea of negritude at least it is the first great idea or concept that can deal with the biggest fact of modern life without trying to water it down i will give three examples aime cesaire leopold senghor and m b tolson cesaire is a caribbean senghor is a senegalese and tolson was born in missouri the first two use french for poetry tolson uses english or american my designation of tolsons language is that he writes in negro or rather all three of these great poets write in negro that is what negritude means in literature it does not mean accommodation to the standards of the settler or to his nostalgia for the mother or father country it does not mean making peace through disappearance into the scene nor as senghor has shown so nobly in his political writings does it mean war it means insistence on the pride of selfhood without hatred no oppressed people in history has had less sense of revenge than the negro retribution is not negro negritude is simply decolonization under the positive aspect senghor has no grudge against the tradition as l do or against modern technology on the contrary he welcomes everything which will make possible the greater harmony among men this is the wisdom of the french in the decolonized man the daring of the french to push an idea into action as far as it will go there are i believe no african poets of the english language of his stature the english are still the heirs of apartheid cesaires discovery of negritudehe is pinned as the inventor of the nameis that of the disaffected assimilationist the parisian from the colonies who became a marxist and by nomination a surrealist even though surrealism is taboo among communists surrealism is a luxury of the white civilization a toy of people who can afford unconciousness it is also a desperate attempt to rejoin civilized brilliance with a raison detre surrealism is an adrenaline shot in the heart under superb cultural conditions it revives a culture which does not really want to live cesaire as i understand it did not rise to the bait when andre breton elected him to the surrealist school i am not criticizing surrealism which is of fundamental value in all modern arts i am pointing out the naivete of the french in enlisting colonials in esthetic causes which were far from the realities of the african or the american negro negritude in the famous poem cahier dun retour au pays natale memorandum on my martinique is one translationnegritude is the realization of pity for the modern world with its great inventions and its great alibis it shouts hurrah not for the steel blue speed of the modern but for those who have never invented anything hurrah for those who never invented anything hurrah for those who never explored anything hurrah for those who never conquered anything i know of only one american poet who in genius and experience even approaches the concept m b tolson and tolson knows that the concept is different with us in american culture according to the groundrules there can be no separatism even by race and color what then is there a long road of assimilation and miscegenation ahead can there be an american negritude tolson is an american who is also the poet laureate of liberia he lives in oklahoma in an allnegro town where he was once mayor he is sixtyfiveyears old in various capacities as editor i have published more poetry by him than anyone in america he has a superb reputation among poets and critics but is unknown to students and to the general reading public this is not because he is difficult to read which he is for difficulty of text is the stockintrade of the poetryteaching professiontolson is not read because he is a negro a blind spot in the white literary eye will not recognize a great negro poet the white professional mind thinks that poetry is written by englishmen or their descendants and imitators tate looks at tolson to complicate matters tolsons libretto for the republic of liberia commissioned by the first african republic has in its american publication an introduction by allen tate mr tate is a confederate of the old school who has no use for negroes but who will salute an exception to the race he sees tolson as an exception because for the first time a negro poet has assimilated completely the poetic language of his time and by implication the language of the angloamerican tradition mr tate invites mr tolson to join his country club tate is one of the canniest critics in the business the american t s eliot as it were but the crux of the matter is that tate says the distinguishing negro quality is not in the language but in the subjectmatter for subjectmatter can only deal with ones suffering and contaminate the beauty of poetry i have tried to correct this statement in my own introduction to tolsons recently published harlem gallery tate considers that the use of negro subjectmatter in poetry which he calls the tragic aggressiveness of the modern poet limits the negro poet to a provincial mediocrity i will not trouble you with my opinion of the modern classicism which mr tate represents have written more than one book about it except to point out that this powerful critic does not consider the theme of negro suffering good enough for the art of poetry just as though the theme of america was not a good enough theme for the poet hart crane but in trying to assert that tolson has been assimilated by the angloamerican tradition he puts tolson in quarantine and destroys the value of the poempossibly this critics conscious intention thus it took a southern intellectual and poet an antinegro poet to introduce tolsons libretto that was the only possible literary context for a great negro poet ten or fifteen years ago he must in that context be captured and returned to colonization to that tradition which had enslaved his ancestors and would continue to do so if it could manage it the refusal to see that tolsons significance lies in his language negro and that only that language can express the poetic sensibility of the negro at the door of freedom is a final desperate maneuver to contain the negro within the traditional culture and for that it is too late the tradition is already antebellum the falsification i speak of is that of trying to assimilate tolson into the tradition when he was doing the opposite the fact that tolsons libretto is unknown by white traditionalists gives the lie to the critics assertion that tolson has risen above negro experience to become an artist the facts are that tolson is a dedicated revolutionist who revolutionizes modern poetry in a language of american negritude the forms of the libretto and of harlem gallery far from being traditional are the negro satire upon the poetic tradition of the eliots and tates the tradition cannot stand being satirized and lampooned and so tries to kick an authetic poet upstairs into the oblivion of acceptance but the negro artist wont stay in the attic anymore than he stayed in the cellar i was less than enthusiastic about spending the summer back home in gravesville alabama after my perfectly marvelous freshman year at columbia u i felt that there was a great injustice here i had friends going to south america europe and god knows where all else and there i was in young healthy and alive with nowhere to go but gravesville maybe it was my boredom that led me to do what i did exactly when this crazy thought first entered my mind i cant really remember but i believe it started one evening in june about eight oclock i was glancing over the ladies home journal when a young woman about years old burst into the house and announced lord somebody done stole my husband like everyone else present thought she meant that the man had been purloined however she clarified the matter by adding that lowdown levi stole him in the left side my uncle who then immediately understood that her husband had been shot without being given a fair chance to defend himself proceeded to call a doctor as she related the tale to us and to half the neighborhood who had followed her in hungrily seeking details i stared at her she was only seven years older than i but she looked much older early marriage just ruins a woman then that neighborhood she lives in its just around the corner from us but there is a world of difference i asn sure you do you think i would be seen on the public streets in an old faded cotton dress like that and those dirty socks and rundown loafers sucre bleu charlie mae the young woman with the stolen husband was a high school graduate and typical of what kelley street colored high turned out that was my school too but i dont mind saying that i was the exception there rather than the rule i lay awake half the night that night and many nights that followed trying to decide what i could do to improve the socioeconomic status of the negroes of my hometown i ate breakfast that wednesday morning about seven oclock it was a very satisfying breakfast grandma could make pancakes that would make you love your motherinlaw i could hear the sound of leather striking human flesh and the scream mama i aint goin do it no mo from next door about the time that an elderly woman a friend of my grandmother came in in a dress that almost reached her ankles and a scarf or rather in the vernacular a head rag tied around her head miss arlethia walked slowly and with a limp it was not a bit unusual that she should just walk in this way everybody did the door stayed open until oclock at night when we all went to bed this is partially attributable to the fact that we owned the only telephone in the neighborhood and the entire community used it lord ha mercy this mus be the baby she acknowledged upon seeing me honey dont these chillun grow why i remember when this chile was bon the conversation continued along this vein as finished the dishes then went out on the front porch and sat in the front porch swing wonder what alex my sophisticated boy friend from chicago would think if he could see this place i laughed to myself at the notiona committee of unwashed juveniles approached me from the street is there any haints in that ol house on cooper street the spokesman wanted to know you mean are there any i started was going to give her a better sentence for the same question but i didnt know quite what to do with that word haints if i said supernatural beings i was certain she would not know what i meant there is no such thing as a haint stated yeah it is the one in the patched shorts protested my daddy says it is are you sure your daddy said this yeah he say one night a big green haint wid long purple fingernails come out of that house and chase him all the way home ooowee the others exclaimed they jumped off the side of the porch and ran off to a game of grandma gray can i go out to play which was just as well because there was no point in arguing with a testimonial like that segregation thats what caused all this segregation leads to inferior schools inferior schools lead to inferior education and inferior education invariably leads to ignorance and poverty besides just the year before the supreme court had ruled that there was no such thing as separate but equal why i bet these people never even heard of brown vs the topeka school board yes it was the handwriting on the wall gravesville alabama must be integrated if i could integrate gravesville it would be an example for the rest of the state alabama would then be an example for the south and i would be the liberator go down moses and tell ok pharaoh to let my people go now surely the town officials around here are not beyond reason after all they are supposed to be the most intelligent people in gravesville i went to the booker t washington branch of the library and requested that some books giving statistical data about gravesville be brought from the main library which citizens of color were not allowed to use i stayed up nights preparing information that no one could argue with showing that economically segregation was ruining the south integration was the only thing that could save us and gravesville would lead the way excitement bubbled in me during those days like hot custard on thanksgiving eve by independence day i had completed my report but i decided to save it until after the fourth i told no one they wouldnt understand besides these uncle toms didnt know what was good for them about the sixth of july i tried to get permission to see the mayor and got nowhere fast this was a great disappointment it ruined my entire plan but as my grandfather would say there are more ways to kill a cat than choking him to death on hot butter i placed the papers in a manila envelope and mailed them to the mayor who returned them within a week without so much as a comment what would moses have done if he had this sort of problem with of pharaoh i remembered that knew mrs ruby lee gibbs who was mayor dewberrys maid went over to try to persuade mrs gibbs to let me work in her place for one day in fact i begged desperately the speech i gave that woman would have made daniel webster sound like a prep school debator after making promises to her among them that i would let her have the money i made i talked her into it i donned the uniform which was too large and papers in hand went to work i fixed mr dewberrys breakfast and was pouring his second cup of coffee when he realized that i was not mrs gibbs wheres ruby lee he wanted to know she is ill i shall be executing her duties while she convalesces i said giving him the statement that i had prepared for the occasion oh he said and went back to his newspaper i decided to wait until he got home that evening as he evidently was not the most pleasant of men when he got up in the morning besides this would give me the time i needed to prepare the day passed quickly in the old antebellum mansion dewberry came in for dinner about five oclock he saw me pretty much as part of the furniture as i served the evening meal when i had cleaned the kitchen i came into the den and made a request i would like a few moments audience with you please i realize this was a little formal but for gods sake the white people around here already think were all semiilliterate what is it he asked really looking at me for the first time well i have some papers here hey you going to be working here regularly honey honey now i was really set aback what did this fat middleaged halfbald white man mean about the papers he said if youre in some kind of trouble sure i can do you a favor if youre willing to do me one i didnt like the implication here at all you dirty old man i screamed and with the papers still in my hand i ran out the door and all the way to the bus stop when i got on the bus i sat in the last seat this was contrary to my purpose but hell i was tired i could start fighting segregation again in the morning as i lay in my bed that night still shaking at the thought of that tobacco stained old clayeater i considered the possibility that i was going at this whole thing from the wrong angle this is still a democracy and the will of the people is still supreme while the population of gravesville is of course predominately white we have more than the usual percentage of negroes found in a small southern town if we demanded our rights we would be bound to be heard who knows it might be easier than one would imagine tomorrow i would go visiting after breakfast i kissed grandma on the cheek told her i had some business to take care of and hurried out the door before she could ask questions i would start with the people most affected by segregation and show them that there was something better to be had i would go to the pockets of degradation and poverty such neighborhoods are easily recognized for every woman you see will be pregnant carrying a baby or both the place i selected was called thirty row thirty row was an unpaved community of thirty cracker box houses most of the window panes had been shot out or rocked in saturday night brawls and were replaced by pieces of cardboard everything on thirty row the people included was filthy beyond description any and all vegetation had long since been trampled down by the herd of little tshirted barefoot black humanity which conducted a neverending stampede across what might have been lawns at the first house i was greeted by a crude but friendly woman who invited me in after i introduced myself the room where she bade me have a seat seemingly served as living room dining room kitchen and at night bedroom i would not have been entirely surprised to have seen a toilet over in the corner as i talked to her she finished her breakfast of cold margarine mashed into alaga syrup and sopped with bread i wanted to create a pleasant atmosphere how is your family i asked jesse thats my husband well jessie been laid off from his job but he been doing yard work for some white folks til they takes him on agin the chillun is all right my lilest he was all stove up wid a col las week but i grez him good wid vics salve and he a whole lot better now good i smiled and wondered what the people who so painstakingly labeled the product vics vaporub would think if they knew that in certain circles it was known as vics salve tell me what do you think of the idea of your children going to school with the white children i asked lawd no they don wont our chillun goin to school wid thim of course it will take a little time for them to get used to the idea i explained no we ain spose to be goin to no school together miz rosemary green thats the lady i works for she say if the chillun start goin to school together theres gonna be mixin of the races then after a while everybody would be colored and if god had wanted us all one color he woulda made us that way the reasoning here more than slightly astounded me however i found myself incapable of producing a successful rebuttal i keeps miz greens il girl for her she went on and miz green say she trus me wid lil alabam jus like she trus husef but she jus don blieve in no mixin of the races you mustnt be persuaded by what others think i argued but alas in vain i left there and tried another house with similar results after a third try proved unsuccessful i decided maybe i was working with the wrong income bracket the next day i visited a few members of the if youll pardon the expression black bourgeoisie typical of the reactions i got was i know how you feel child but i just cant afford to start any mess with these white people my husband would lose his job and wed have the ku klux klan breathing down our necks on top of it we have three little children and we just cant afford to get involved i meditated on the whole thing for about three days it was now beginning to irritate me like a rash something had to be done why i had never conceived of such complacency and apathy i was ready now to lay my all on the altar as much as i hated to do it it looked like a civil_rights march was the only alternative i needed help not necessarily intelligent people just warm bodies to carry picket signs the next day i managed to talk some of our less intelligent high school students into helping me they didnt understand what this was all about but they loved getting something and they didnt seem to be scared of the proverbial redheaded devil i made and distributed picket signs after i finally impressed upon them that the idea was to walk up and down with the signs we began our demonstration in front of city hall we were viewed curiously by passersby for about fifteen minutes when i observed a number of police cars stopping nearby when the policemen came out and approached me i was ready to announce that we would stand our ground it was then that i noticed that it was no longer we but the rest had fled at sight of the police cars i was arrested and taken to jail where i demanded a writ of habeas corpus after the chief asked habeas who i decided the notion was best abandoned my uncle came down and after some tall talking persuaded them to let me gohe drove me home and then raised whitehot hell just exactly what in the devil did you think you were doing i explained just exactly what in the devil i thought i was doing after a twohour lecture he told me that he had promised to be personally responsible for seeing that the incident was not repeated for the rest of the summer i had to give an account every time i left the house the month of august passed quietly i spent it reading and knitting occasionally people would come in and pump my grandmother for the details of my arrest i had the distinction of being the familys only criminal rumor has it that my greatgrandfather had a brother who was hanged for being a horse thief but i dont know i felt very relieved as i sat on the new yorkbound train and watched the world speed past in the opposite direction the summer was behind me and my sophomore year at columbia was ahead of me sophomorethat comes from two latin words sophos meaning wise and mows meaning fool well i dont know about the sophos part but have certainly proven myself to be as big a mows as ever drew breath looked up and there she was the great city of new york we reached the station i stepped off the train and back into my world i remember thinking that i had never seen such a poorly child as ella mae the first time i laid eyes on her jim paul thats my man brought her in the cabin one night and said pearlie mae joe stevens fell in his well and drownded ella sue she was joes woman must have tried to get him out cause she drownded too they aint nobody over there to care for this youngun so i fetched it home i guess well have to keep it until we find somebody to raise it jim paul i said how you expect me to care for this youngun our own minnie belle aint but three weeks old i cant do for two babies neither one of em crawlin yet all jim paul said was somebodys got to do for it and were the only folk anyways close around here besides thats joe stevens youngun and joe saved my life onct im going over and do whats to be done for joe and ella sue most likely some of ella sues people will come to take the youngun in a day or so anvhow then he left well ella maecourse that wasnt her name then we give that to her laterwas just eight or nine days old and like i said i aint never seen a sicklier lookin baby jim paul said it looked to him like joe and ella sue must of drowndd sometime the night before and the youngun hadnt been fed or cleaned up since then i cleaned ella mae up and when i put her in the water she let out such a whoop i knowed right off that other than bein hungry and scared nigh to death they wasnt nothin wrong with her it was just about time for me to feed minnie belle and she let the whole world know it well to tell the truth i felt kinda queer about feeding ella mae she bein such a funny looking thing but i put minnie belle to one tittiei know it maybe aint nice to say such things but i always have been plain spokenand ella mae to the other one i never did have no shortage of milk that ella mae like i said before her folks must have died sometime the night before and she hadnt been fed since she really went to town when she finished she give me such a smile that got all quivery inside well you can ask any woman and shell tell you it takes a plumb unnatural female not to love a youngun onct shes nursed it i knowed right then that if joes peoplerather ella sues people didnt come for her real soon she was going to be mighty hard to give up it was late when jim paul got back and even though he didnt say muchjim paul never was one for too much talki knowed he was i taking it real hard jim paul and joe had growed up together hunted and fished together and gone to the army together neither one of em talked much about it but somehow or other joe had saved jim pauls life over in korea and jim paul wasnt the kind to forget something like that finally jim paul came to bed he told me i took joe and ella sue down the mountain to percy browns undertaking parlor he said hed try to get in touch with ella sues people if he could you know this mountain aint goin to seem right without joe on it me and him been through a whole lot together why we growed up together havin joe moren made up for me not havin a brother of my own im sure gonna miss that boy i got up to look at the babies and what i saw made me call jim paul to look too they was layin there in the cradlejim pauls greatgreatgrandaddy had made it hisself an it was plenty big enough for the both of eman they looked so pretty an peaceful laying there just like two angels they looked standin there an lookin at em made me go warm and fluttery all over jim paul stood there lookin at em and he put his arm around me i looked up at his face and i could see tears shinin in his eves i aint never seen jim paul cry but he was mighty close to it then they was one other time i saw him close to cryin but they was different tears ill tell you about that when i come to it anyway jim paul was stand in there with his eyes all shiny and i could feel where he had his arm around me that he was all trembly i heard him say kinda to himself like joe i promise they buried joe and ella sue three days later we went i was holdin minnie belle and joe had ella mae it was real sad at the bury in ella sue an joe were so young an things was lookin so promisin for em it was sad but beautiful in a way im just an ignorant hill womani didnt have too much schoolinso i cant say in pretty words what i mean but if you could of seen jim paul standin there with ella mae in his arms and her just layin there so peaceful and safe youd know what mean by sayin it was beautiful too well they never did find any of ella sues people and all joes kinfolk had been dead for a long time didnt nobody even know where ella came from joe went off one timehe never did say where and when he come back ella sue was with him they kept pretty much to themselves except for us an of course wed never ask about anything they didnt mention themselfs ella mae was a real comfort to us and since the good lord didnt see fit to bless us with any more younguns she was company for minnie belle you know how lonesome it can be on a mountain minnie belle an ella mae was just like twins them bein just a week or so apart they was crazy about one another right from the start i mean it why if one of em was hurt both of em ud cry time went on and we was all doin fine we aint never gonna be richthe lands hard up here on the mountainbut we aint never been hungry neither everything was fine until one day a man come to the house a city man he was wantin to take ella mae away he said something about it bein for her own good i bolted i ran out in the field where jim paul was work in and told him i said it would be like losin my own flesh and blood if anybody took ella mae away i never will forget the way jim paul looked when i told him he gritted his teeth and stood there for a while not sayin anything then he spoke aint nobody goin take ella mae nor minnie belle away from us not while draw breath joe meant for this mountain to be home for ella mae and by god so do i besides promised joe id look after her jim paul talked real polite to the stranger when we got back to the house but could tell he had his stubborn up i guess the stranger could too jim paul stood there his eyes flashin and told him mister i reckon you mean well otherwise id run you off this land right now aint nobody takin ella mae nowhere this is her home if she wants to leave when she gets growed up thats her business but til then this is her home the man looked right funny like hed swallowed something that didnt want to go down but he left it didnt seem like no time at all before they was ready to start to school and that was the other time i saw jim paul almost cry it was just last week but it seems like it was a long time ago some of the folks down in the valley got talkin and they wanted to send ella mae to school in the next county well aint never seen jim paul that mad he turned plumb white and was tremblin like a leaf in a high wind we all got in the truck me and him and minnie belle and ella mae and drove down to the schoolhouse jim paul had throwed his rifle in the back of the truck when we started off and i dont mind tellin you was scared i knowed if he got mad enough jim paul would use that rifle and it aint often he misses what he shoots at we pulled up in front of the school and marched up the steps down the hall and in the principals office jim paul had left the rifle in the truck so i felt some easier we stood there in front of the principal all four of us and when jim paul got to talking i was so proud of him my heart like to busted he told that principal mr jones i hear theres talk of sendin ella mae to school somewhere else well i pay my taxes regular and in this county and us mayberrys been payin taxes in this county ever since they been havin em why my daddy helped build this school and both my girls are gonna go to this school or else aint nobody gonna go well that principal he hemmed and he hawed but jim paul he wouldnt budge finally the principal he seen it wasnt no use so he told us hed talk it over with the school board and let us know we went on

growin jim paul made em bury joe and ella sue up here on the mountain cause its so far to the colored buryin ground one of the wisest people i ever knew once said to me if you care at all about living in this world you must also re enough to help save it from its own wilderness get those words i shall never forspoken by my mother as we sat watching an oklahoma sunset more than thirty years ago it was just before i returned to college for my final year and it seemed to me that she was giving me my own special commencement address albeit a bit prematurely the words she used in bestowing her benediction on me reflected her own experience in the early days of oklahoma when as a teacher in the indian territory she had witnessed one of this nations last battles against a wilderness frontier although her language was evocative of the continuing american struggle to beat back the wilderness and to plant a civilization we both knew that she had something else in mind she was in fact talking of the responsibility of every human being to venture toward new wildernesses toward new frontiersand to help create there a new meaningful pattern of life this would in turn help solve some of the problems that perennially seemed to engulf the world the context in was the worldwide depression the darkening shadows of the barbarism of nazism and the ugly conduct of the american racists who had snatched a negro youth from our college campus the previous spring and lynched him the problems were old only the setting was new a generation has come and gone a great and tragic world war has been fought a score of new nations have emerged new wildernesses have been discovered and conquered we have entered an exciting frightening nuclearspace age the power of man either to destroy his world or to transform it into a material paradise has multiplied enormously one need not be ashamed to admit that it is a rare and wonderful privilege to be able to witness the marvels of this age even the least observant among us has seen a dozen miracles that would eclipse the ingenuity of a leonardo da vinci or strain the credulity of a jules verne the more naive among us can say with alexander the great that there are no more worlds to conquer or with frederick jackson turner that the frontier is indeed closed but the changes of the last generation however dramatic and worldshaking have neither eliminated all the frontiers nor saved the world from its own wildernesses the rivalry among the nuclear powers has created a new wilderness while the new means of automation have had in some quarters a chilling and depressing effect this is not to say that we have made no progress in the art of utilizing our resources in the fundamental task of creating a peaceful world this is not to say that we have not made a start toward creating a society in which the fundamentals of decency in human relations might be observed but the progress has been minimal and the frontiers beckoning our discovery and assiduous efforts are numerous as a people and as a nation we have been attracted through the years toward what can be called frontiers of freedom the earliest settlers sought religious and economic freedom the founding fathers fought for political freedom certain basic freedoms in the form of the bill of rights were early written into our constitution at times we sought to justify our expansionist policies on the rather shaky ground that we were seeking to extend the area of freedom now and then some americansall too frequently a courageous minority have spoken and worked for complete human freedom these stands for freedom going far back into our history suggest that as the peoples of the world seek a better order we in this country have some qualifications for taking the lead in seeking out new frontiers of freedom and doing battle against the wildernesses that surround them up to this point in our development however we can claim more credit for eloquence than for precision of concepts more credit for zeal than for its effective and purposeful use almost two centuries ago we declared that all men were created equal but the concept of equality did not extend to everyone from that day to this we have experienced the greatest difficulties conceivable in attempting to establish a society characterized by real equality and real freedom ttiis is because of that early faltering when we showed so little understanding of the meaning and dimensions of freedom it is remarkable how in the name of freedom we fought so valiantly for our political independence and at the same time renounced the one great opportunity to show that we were committed to human freedom it is worth noting that one of our most vigorous thrusts toward equality was jacksonian democracy but this great upsurge of the common man did not even address itself to the most vital challenge that democracy was facingthe challenge of slavery a generation later universal suffrage seemed to be at hand but new and ingenious devices were invented to exclude millions from that high privilege and so the opportunity for real equality and real freedom to become the central feature of american life and institutions got lost in a maze of racism that in turn created a veritable wilderness if that wilderness was to be won for freedom it would require courage and resourcefulness to say the least the curious thing is that as a people and as a nation we have taken pride in our advocacy of freedom even when our actions have betrayed an ambivalence that was as full of wonder as it was lacking in merit for centuries not a sufficient number appreciated the violence that this ambivalence was doing to the nature and character of our society to do anything about it instead with a pride that was somewhat vainglorious if not altogether false we began to proclaim to the world that our social order had achieved a perfection that commended itself to the entire world with a perfect society or one that was nearly perfect americans saw no reason why they should not share their blessings with others lacking the capacity to criticize the imperfections of their own society they became its evangels proclaiming freedom and democracy for all the peoples of the world thus in recent years we have been engaged in a gigantic task of extending what we call the area of freedom we have done this by providing billions of dollars worth of military technical and economic aid to many nations of the world in our moments of charity we call them the underdeveloped nations in our moments of reverie we call them the freedomloving peoples last week i returned from another visit to some of the nations that are the objects of our concern on the basis of my quite inconclusive observations and conversations i am not persuaded that they are either underdeveloped or freedomloving in the sense that we use those words to be sure many of them lack scientific and technical skills but their leaders are wise in the ways of the world and are as sophisticated and cunning as our most wily political masters their peoples may not be free in our sense of the term and they might even be freedomloving but their aspirations to freedom bear little if any relationship to our own as often as not they want to be free of any influence or domination including that of the united states they want to be free to make the critical decisionseven if they are wrong decisionsabout their own future they want no neatly wrapped packages proffered to them by us or someone else they want to be free to select the things that appeal to them and reject those that do not a few days ago the minister of education in a middle east country sought to explain this stance to me having spent some time in the united states he drew his illustration from american higher education we are like your undergraduate student when he begins to make out his program of courses the minister said he has some freedom of choice on the basis of his background tastes and interests he takes certain electives we must have at least that much freedom in making the choices before us the analogy is not very strained and on many an occasion we as a nation have watched with the greatest interest and anxiety as people like the ministermake their choices if they do not choose as we had hoped we are inclined to fret and to wonder if they really did have freedom of choice in our moment of pique we fail to ask ourselves such important questions as were we offering the kind of aid the kind of values the kind of institutions that had meaning and substance for the prospective recipients what kind of quid pro quo was involved in the offer if there was one did it involve demands that left little if any free choice we see then that in two vastly different areas of activity a great and resourceful country like ours has real difficulty in discovering those frontiers on which to carry on an effective battle for the freedom of mankind at home our early inconsistencies and our unwillingness to establish and maintain a concept of universal freedom did much to create a wilderness on that allimportant frontier of freedom in our dealings with other peoples our inability to see the ideal of freedom in their own frames of reference has created problems that remain unsolved despite our vigorous efforts to cope with them it is for these reasons that it seems to me we should seek new approaches new frontiers on which to establish and maintain not only the ideal but the practice of freedom it is by no means easy to seek out new frontiers and pursue them but we should care enough about our future and the future of our world to make the attempt it hardly seems necessary to observe that for several centuries our search for such frontiers has been negligible or halfhearted during those years we defined freedom in rather narrow terms two centuries ago religious freedom meant that the puritans could worship god as they pleased but not the quakers a century ago real human freedom was for whites but not for negroes privilege was for gentiles but not for jews the same has been true in our dealings with other peoples we have managed somehow to convince ourselves that other peoples become free when they accept our way of looking at things or even our leadership as well as our material aid we have convinced ourselves for example that extraterritorial agreements and status of forces legislation required of other countries by us do not challenge the integrity of the peoples whose freedom we supposedly champion and our soldiers technicians and advisers deployed all over the world and enjoying special privileges of every conceivable kind simply do not convince their hosts that they are there to act as equal partners in a common enterprise implicit in our attitudes is not merely failure to appreciate the concept of equality in a common cause it also smacks of an ethnocentrism that fails utterly to comprehend the fact that fresh invigorating concepts of freedom can indeed come from other societies it implies certain basic reservations on our part regarding the place of equality and freedom in the lives of the peoples that make up those societies it also indicates a smugness and a certainty with regard to our own position that are not all justified in the light of our experience frankly i do not know what the longrange impact of our contact with other people will be and i doubt that anyone knows the task of transplanting into a quite different social order our own notions of freedom and equality and justice however estimable is staggering to contemplate the forces of resistance in the societies themselves and by others with different concepts and programs are powerful indeed and our own blurred concept of what freedom is and how it can be universally applied merely compounds the difficulties what we really need to do is to clarify our own view of the nature of freedom and to identify the new frontiers on which it can be applied if freedom is anything at all it is the opportunity to seek complete personal fulfillment so long as it does not deprive others of the same opportunity in this context public restrictions are minimal and personal responsibilities are maximal public or private actions or conspiracies to reduce the freedom of any person or group are socially irresponsible actions conversely the use of ones own freedom to advance the freedom of others is on the face of it socially responsible the extension of the principles and practices of freedom acknowledges a universal character that is the very hallmark of freedom there can be no double standards for freedom freedom cannot possibly mean on the one hand every opportunity for the enjoyment of privilege on park avenue and on the other the deliberate creation and maintenance of blight and poverty in harlem it cannot mean the grafting of american values through the preponderant american presence on the developing countries and at the same time showing an utter insensitivity to the values and aspirations of the developing countries themselves the commitment to one standard of freedom for one people or one place and another standard for others is itself a clear denial of free dom what we need to doindeed what we must doas socially responsible people is to seek new frontiers of freedom not merely for the sake of others but for ourselves as well we can begin by extending and enlarging the areas of freedom in the harlems across this nation if we do not know what our impact can be on the faraway frontiers we can be certain of our impact on the frontiers close at hand people on these local frontiers already have the same values the same aspirations and indeed their notions of freedom are a part of the same culture as the rest of the country we know from experience that whenever we have assured complete freedom to people in our midst the very recognition of their right to be free and equal has had a salutary effect on the growth and development of our social order yet in the face of this rich and positive experience we have failed to complete the task of eliminating the privation discrimination and the denial of equality that stalks our land it can be arguedindeed it has been arguedthat a commendable beginning has been made and that is indeed true but a beginning is not enough there is no legitimate halfway station between slavery and freedom george orwell has suggested the absurdity of trying to make a valid distinction among wouldbe equals and there is the same absurdity if we should seek to make invidious distinctions among those who would be free we who have a sense of responsibility in the search for new frontiers of freedom must therefore become totally and unequivocally committed to total freedom and the best place to begin is here and now in this community if we accept this responsibility acknowledge the fact that any freedom worth cherishing must be universal and work diligently to destroy inequality discrimination and segregation in our own communities we shall be well on our way toward saving our communities from their own wildernesses only then will we have gained the experience and indeed the right to extend the areas of freedom beyond our own borders only then can we face the world and declare that by experience and by example we have proved that human beings can live in a world where there are no reservations in the right to enjoy total freedom i suspect that such a stance will itself provide new resources with which to extend the area of freedom you who go down from this place today have i believe not only a vital interest but a vital stake in the search for new ways to achieve freedom the wellbeing of this community depends in large measure on the manner in which you and others like you assume your responsibilities the peace of the world depends among other things on what all of us can do to carry forward the objective of freedom and dignity for all peoples and thus to save the world from its own wilderness this informal f np i article is an at ii f tempt to share some of the impressions and ideas which result from about six months residence in south carolina during this period i have been working as educational consultant in a coeducational liberal arts negro college with an enrollment of students the purpose of the assignment was improvement of academic standards my conclusions are drawn largely from experience with this educational institution although community relations are reflected in my judgments it should be remembered that i came not as a militant integrationist or as a crusader from the righteous north to a sinful south my mission was that of dealing with a limited aspect of the larger problem the objective was the academic improvement of a specified college any involvement in the total race problem is incidental or reached through necessary connection with higher education one of these necessary connections is that in this society the whole range of educational accomplishment especially at the secondary level in negro schools is shockingly low when one writes about the inadequacy of preparation for college work it appears to be merely a repetition of the nationwide lament of college officials but the degree of failure in our situation here is so great that the word inadequate has a different meaning imagine one half of the entering class unable to write an intelligible paragraph add to this the inability to construct a simple sentence so that aggregations of words without subject and with mismated verb forms must serve the vocabulary is extremely limited with frequent replacement of an intended word by one of somewhat similar sound an honor senior student trying to convey to me his lack of prejudice came out with i am trying to be just as objectionable as possible reading as the art of gaining ideas from a printed page is equally deficient the college with which i am associated does not use college entrance examination board scores in a similar institution the verbal average is below compare this with bates average of over on a scale with as top score the citing of these sad facts does not imply any endorsement of nonsense about an inferior race with low mental capacity the southern white student shows a similar though less extreme disparity when rated on a national scale undoubtedly the negro student had as good a mind at birth as the average child and there are only the usual variations nevertheless at the present moment so far as achievement in education or meeting competition in a free society is concerned the negro student is in practically the same situation as he would be if he were mentally deficient many doors are closed many elements of a curriculum cannot be used by him as a means of selfdevelopment and growth the allimportant difference is that something can be done about it so far as youth is concerned education is the key instrument a cultural deficiency can be overcome by any normal individual with ambition and energy provided the right institutions and methods are available and utilized we have every reason to believe that a considerable proportion of young negroes will emerge from a disadvantageous background with capacities developed for full and rewarding participation in american life the next long step toward such a goal is dependent chiefly upon negro colleges under competent negro leaders with the present and future overcrowding of highly selective white colleges possessing an established clientele and with high costs it is only the rare southern negro who will find his way into one of them the attempt of some northern universities to establish special programs for the inadequately prepared negro applicant is a generous gesture of good will but like so many of our futile efforts it is essentially one more random activity confusing and weakening our central purpose it is positively dangerous in its tendency toward perpetuating double standards at the very best these efforts can meet so small a part of the need that the direct result is negligible the negro college has been attempting to meet the problem of poor preparation in one of two ways the first is the establishment of adequate remedial courses with which the student by greater intensity of effort or by a longer time span is brought to the point of a legitimate bachelors degree the second method is the offering of a low grade curriciulum of inferior courses and a low standard of grading that demands little effort until the candidate is given a pseudo ab or bs the second type has been somewhat acceptable in the past when its graduates went back into a depressed group there they could exert to a certain extent the leadership expected from them now we are intent upon making nonexistent the depressed subgroup and if we are successful there will be no place for such graduates in a free society all must meet in open competition hence the second type of negro college or white has become useless and injurious it must be reformed or removed it is a positive block to genuine integration legislation and good will can open opportunity for the competent but no amount of either can open a magic path for the unprepared a considerable lifting of the level of the general negro group must occur before the potentially superior individual with qualities which our society rewards can emerge in significant numbers this elevation is the opportunity and duty of negro colleges sheer physical integration in residence area church or school is more consequence than cause we need to develop a concept of integration much more profound than mere abolition of segregation we idealists easily overestimate the readiness and eagerness of the great mass of negroes apart from intellectualists and activists to join in important aspects of a predominantly white culture at the operative level or in a spiritual and deeply personal way this genuine integration must be clearly distinguished from the superficial level with which most popular discussion is concerned some few negro students of college age can now feel comfortably at home in a white college but in the deep south their number is small the emotional and psychological factors are more clearly evident in a church situation why should a family leave a church whose ways are familiar in which friends of long standing are met each sunday in which there are tender memories of weddings and funerals in which leadership is exerted and offices held how can the loyalties thus engendered be replaced by affiliation with an organization in which the same conditions cannot exist for the present generation the more intimate and personal the relationship the more deeply rooted in sentimental and personal values the more difficult and prolonged is the process of genuine integration nearly every negro can appreciate the privilege of entrance into good stores though the economic realities prevent much buying i have heard a negro professional man relate repeatedly and with great gusto of his meeting with a mixed professional group in one of the finest and most expensive hotels and how he leaned back in those big stuffed leather chairs these superficial aspects of a surrounding culture from where there has been exclusion rank high in the minds of most men the slow effort of growing into the sentiments attitudes and skills required for their production recedes into the background the desire for economic equality with the successful members of the society is predominant and most of the privileges sought are steps to that end or indicators of its partial achievement personal prestige is so closely linked with economic status that the two cannot be separated in motivation the drive for personal prestige is immediate and powerful while it is in the center of thought little effective attention is given to the obligations required for being at home and competent in the new social complex the merging of a subculture with the dominant surrounding one demands a certain amount of mutual accommodation and modification neither culture will be precisely what it was before however one or the other will be predominant with its mores and values setting the general pattern may we not assume when integration is completed that our industrial technological scienceoriented urban civilization will persist and that all persons must adjust in varying degrees to its standards if this is true then the distinctive task of negro education is the development or inculcation of qualities and attitudes as well as skills required in such a society this should be accompanied by the personal enrichment that we believe to be the function of liberal arts and accomplished with the minimum destruction of desirable elements characteristic of the subculture but it must be accomplished whether we personally like or dislike this civilization is irrelevant it is folly to suppose that in any foreseeable future it will be replaced by a more easygoing one that makes less demands for individual and corporate selfdiscipline racial in tegration will not stem the prevailing trend my thesis is that the new society will be essentially as it is continuing in the same channel and developing in the same pattern those who are successfully to share in it and in its rewards as the negro wishes to must accommodate themselves to its demands this does not deny individual variations or modest changes initiated by gifted persons it grants the right of any individual who does not value its rewards to set up his own private domain and to live independently so far as is possible in a society upon which he is so largely dependent such quasiindependence is not the ambition of most negroes i find three ways in which the negro as i have seen him must be reconditioned educated if he is to become reasonably adequate in our society i hope the examples cited do not seem trivial it may be that any one standing alone is not sufficiently indicative but in the aggregate they show traits that are supremely important let it be clearly understood that there is no intention to impute blame but only to recognize significant facts of a present condition first perhaps underlying the others is a basic habit of living in a world of illusion a daydream world by which there may be relief from the unpleasant impact of stark reality in my experience this year so long as the usual appurtenances associated with the image of a college are present what lies beneath is largely ignored colleges have sororities fraternities and impressive athletic teams so we must have them very much in view considerable sums of money are spent on these features though the poverty of students is so great that tuition and academic fees are paid on the installment plan administrative offices are equipped with the latest intercommunication system for my own office a dictating machine was proposed although my secretary is not trained to transcribe from the device the catalog contains a large selection of courses which have not been given for years the most elaborate registration card i have ever seen is used in spite of the fact that very few students can master its complexity sufficiently to fill it out correctly honors are granted to certain graduates upon very easy grounds in short by surrounding ones self with the paraphernalia and procedures thought of as pertaining to a regular college it is forgotten that they do not constitute a college there is a feeling of satisfaction that the correct image is presented to the public and visitors are properly impressed the appearance becomes subjectively the reality windowdressing serves in place of a stock of educational goods if the southern association of colleges penetrates far enough to take a dim view and accreditation is imperiled there is recourse to the feeling that racial prejudice and discrimination are at work when for many generations a people has lived in a situation which denied participation in the good life so richly apparent on every side some compensatory defense mechanism must be built up religion so easily and so often distorted to serve such ends becomes a prime source of comfort prevented by the selfinterest of the dominant group from having application to the righting of social wrongs it finds expression among negroes in emotional perceptiondulling worship soulstirring escapes from trouble and miraculous transmutation of fortune reported in biblical tradition are embodied and relived in song poetry and sermon all the usual otherworldly aspects are exaggerated and emphasized when the present world has consistently presented harsh denial of universal human hopes the human spirit finds relief in the only realm easily available the world of imaginative illusion out of this habit of the elders the college is in all things most religious but without consequences in overt behavior it may be noted that the younger generation is becoming increasingly restive with this diet of husks its apparent irreligion may be useful until religion again becomes worthy of devotion such a realm of illusion is not compatible with the world into which the negro is now being introduced any successful career demands a careful analysis of facts faithful acceptance of them and rational conduct based upon actual relation of a present situation to the desired result in this respect integration is a oneway road the negro must be conditioned toward the facing of hard facts there will be disaster for those who fail to make the transition the plight of the unadaptable will be worse than in the past since the old protective walls of race solidarity will be gone most of the retraining will take place in the education of youth this creates the opportunity and obligation for negro colleges adequate leadership must be found many smaller colleges without alert leaders will remain unaware of the nature of the crisis until the tides of social change sweep them into oblivion these colleges for nearly a century have been accepting candidates utterly unprepared for college work giving them four years of undemanding curriculum and a purely gratuitous degree then the graduate most often has gone into teaching to continue the bad tradition such a college finds it hard to realize that the role it has been playing no longer serves any useful purpose the second set of attitudes which must be changed if wholesome and successful union is to be achieved integration at a far deeper level than mere ingestion of negroes into localities institutions and industries are those relating to ethical conduct we are here on very delicate ground and must avoid harsh judgments when people have been systematicallyover a long period deprived by a group with power over them then two things occur there is a strong feeling of justification for almost any means of defense which furthers the interest of the ingroup against the outgroup the concept of ethical obligation becomes inoperative toward the offenders it seems right to use any means to establish a better balance of advantages then practices justified for group advantage are transferred for the benefit of the individual as against other members within the group our whole society is so weak at this point that the analysis of any subgroup is indeed throwing stones from a glass house however my recent experience leads me to believe that there is a more than usually complacent acceptance of institutional practices based upon the fact that elementary ethical conduct is not to be expected when my office was furnished the pen was chained to its socket to prevent theft by student janitor or other raider before the first chapel service the amplifier system was stolen from the building a special police officer is on duty during reg istration when fees are being received in registration it is recognized that special precautions must be taken to prevent fraudulent change of schedule after approval by adviser indicative in another direction is the strict requirement for certification of freedom from venereal disease before admission regulations are more honored in the breach than in the observance procedures clearly stated in the catalog have not been observed for many years it is hard to draw the line separating laxity or inefficiency and actual dishonesty in some of these matters either is unacceptable in business and professional life today here is another oneway road in integration the third set of attitudes is indifference to time failure to regard engagements as important and habitual tardiness deadlines have no meaning procrastination is the order of the day consequently nothing gets done properly every action is a temporizing patchwork of emergency measures to meet the crisis induced by previous delay or neglect a request for a report from faculty members on a matter for the benefit of their respective departments met with a per cent response by the date set catalog material known a year in advance to be due at a certain date is in process of revision weeks after that date nearly per cent of the students were late in completing registration the penalty prescribed in the catalog was not imposed on anyone apparently the majority of the college community is sufficiently satisfied with conditions to prevent any urge for change perhaps we all would like to live in such a nevernever land and avoid the necessities of the modern timeoriented world the difficulty is that it cannot be both ways an orderly productive efficient society cannot be a disorganized chaotic drifting society the results of the latter will not be the results of the former for good or ill our social order is working toward the former and accepts it as an ideal once more there is a oneway road in conclusion and summary i confess again the limitations of my direct experience both in duration and extent however the sar npling observed has a considerable geographical distribution and represents a better status than the average among the mass of negroes in the deep south therefore there seems tc be justification for the conclusion reached that conclusion is based upon the premise that a subgroup incorporated into another group dominant in numbers resources and achievement must largely conform to and accept major standards of the dominant group dominant in this usage carries no evil implications the wish merely to participate in the benefits without sharing in the process is utterly futile the necessity of acceptance is not dependent upon the perfection of the ways of the dominant group nor upon whether we or others approve them these ways are stubbornly given the negro group of the deep south through its actions expresses three traits which are incompatible with the prevailing american outlook they are preoccupation with a world of illusion certain standards of ethical conduct and disregard for the importance of time and order the existence of many greatly admired negro individuals who do not show these traitsand of many individual whites who dodoes not negate the conclusion as applied to the major body of the group in the south the segregationalist assumes these traits are innate not capable of change so he rejects the possibility of successful integration this paper on the contrary is based upon the premise that they are the result of social conditioning hence modifiable by that further controlled social conditioning which we call education integration in any meaningful sense of the word can occur only when this reconditioning has happened upon a large scale for a long time the greater part of this education must be carried on by negro colleges to find leadership for these colleges is a most important step at this moment the finding of money for them is almost but not quite as urgent northern good will might be best expressed by affluent colleges that would deny themselves some contributions from philanthropists or foundations so that large grants can be given to the negro colleges that are aware of the role they must play last january as i was preparing to go to nigeria to do a television film thomas o echewa a nigerian published in negro digest an arafricans vs afromr echewa did not bond between us as much as he described how superior africans think themselves to negroes his article was an unjustifiable piece of misplaced snobbery it made me angry for you see there is nothing like a trip to africa to make an american negro realize just how american he isand i had spent four months there in and was returning within six months later on my trip i met malcolm_x in lagos he was just beginning to turn the corner to brotherhood i dont know if africa did that on my last journey i met and talked at length with james meredith who had started out to do two years in ibadan in nigeria he lasted months i dont know if africa did that many of my good friends went to africa disgusted at the way things were going here for negroes all have returned gladly did africa do that too one thing africa does make the most oppressed american black stop and think i was not able to answer mr echewas article when it came out but i want to do so now i am not an expert on africa i was in ten countries longest in nigeria but before i ever thought of going to africa i had worked as information director for the american committee on africa i was not therefore naive about africa i am not naive about anything i had known enough about africans and their politics not to look for any special favors because i was black i think this background gives me the credentials to answer mr echewa he chides us for assuming that we negroes mistakenly believe every african to be the son of a chief or village head that is not our fault that is the fault of the africans for spreading that hogwash among us believe it or not the first twelve africans i ever knew all claimed to be the sons of tribal chiefs one must understand the historical and almost psychopathic desire for status among africans to make allowance for the young men who announced themselves as the first sons of chiefs i understand it but i wont allow mr echewa to place the fault where it doesnt belong the day i arrived back in nigeria i called on my friend chinua achebe the novelist his first words almost were john whats this i keep hearing about negroes and africans disliking each other i was a little surprised but we are good enough friends not to throw curves at each other yes i said there is a lot of talk and i think to a great degree it is true but lets get it out in the open and have done with it get about the business of really creating a bond between us history shows us how white people have always fought like animals with each other and their bond was color very often we dont want to make that same mistake we cant afford to achebe agreed i think these words apply to mr echewa to every african and to every afroamerican we have to face it the negroafrican romance that began in when ghana became independent is over finished too many negroes have been to africa now via the peace corps usaid state department etc and they know despite what mr echewa says that africans by and large do not like american negroes much of this is history the african knows very little about our history of slave revolts of our total participation in all of americas wars they know only what they read and that is slanted poorly written and serves only to make the african feel superior because after all he is on that continent which is more or less politically independent the economic situation is something else when an american negro shows up in mr echewas home without ties to the us government he is a paradox how can a black american so poor so brutally treated at home so deprived afford to come to africa the obvious answer is that what the african reads today may not be valid tomorrow and one must remember too that the tradition of tribalism in africa is deeply historic and may even be powerful enough to destroy those nations that now have independence tribalism has caused nigeria a tremendous amount of trouble and europeans and white american policies have taken advantage of it the american black being without tribe or clan but being black all the same is considered a lost soul in the eyes of the african a man without a tribe is next to worthless a tribal society does create builtin superiority complexes i asked a highranking official about the closeknit families among the ibos of eastern nigeria the ibos are a gentle people and one senses a great depth in them the official said haughtily that the ibos were different from the rest of the nigerians he you see was a yoruba from the west with such an attitude it is quite clear that despite what mr echewa says he and most africans do mean to offend american blacks when they say they dont want to be referred to as negroes but i want to remind him that the europeans could not have drained africa of millions and millions of people to become slaves in the west if african leaders and chiefs had not helped them it is easy enough to blame the british french dutch portuguese and spanish but the africans have to share that blame as well tinubu square in the heart of lagos honors a woman who sold her own people into slavery contempt mr echewa should be deserved over the years ive noticed other ways in which the african communicates his contempt for american blacks he will have little to do with a negro unless he is told that the negro is suchandsuch and does soandso mostly the african will ignore the negro like a block of wood a few years ago i had a party in my apartment i believe it was when togo became independent many africans came i noticed as time wore on that there was a fellow who was flicking his cigarette ashes on the floor instead of in the ashtray finally he ground the cigarette underfoot and walked casually away incensed i followed him and told him in no uncertain terms that my apartment was not a grass hut and to take himself out of it i thought that was an isolated instance since then a host of people who have had africans in their homes as guests have noted the same thing this is not carelessness it is calculated contempt perhaps this contempt lies in the fact that so many african nations are now independent it would be unfair not to point out that many negroes felt a bit of jealousy when the african nations started down freedom road we wanted full citizenship first but we have gotten over that generally mr echewa africans do sympathize with our struggles but specifically they dont give a damn and i for one am a little tired of hearing africans rant and rave about climbing into boats and coming over here to rescue us what damned boats what damned armies when you free angola and mozambique and south africa when you finally put an end to the slavery that still flourishes when you either eliminate or ameliorate tribal differences then ill listen to you right now your mouth is moving but you arent saying much i agree with mr echewa that an unfriendly encounter between an african and a negro should not be the basis of a blanket opinion that africans are a pretty rotten lot let me set down the basis for my opin ions first i was there second i have many friends who were third i have nigerian friends and friends in other countries africans all who are there i think i have a lot of facts mr echewa i do not believe that the current attitudes of antagonism are the result of a single bad encounter on the part of a great many visiting negroes they are the result of many many bad encounters fifty times a day every day you are in africa a thumbnail sketch on nigeria since that is mr echewas home i arrived at kano at in the morning kano is ghastly hot and dry and the largest city in northern nigeria one of the customs officers tried to take my typewriter the other my camera i refused to let them and refused to pay them dash the old african bribe money that left a bad taste and to see africans who cry how free i am all the time uncle tomming white people all over africa sickened me no negro in a private capacity can expect to be served before a white man in africa it just isnt done enough no i have been to a good many places in the world and the most rascally cab drivers so far are nigerian paris cabbies dont even come near them new york city drivers would be completely wasted more in nigeria people who are poor seem to expect you to give them something just because you have it and they dont tribalism again but a great irritant in a country struggling to make good its independence it is nigerian tribalism that would keep mr echewa away from gangs of toughs unless he frequented such places as the kakadu or the caban bamboo in yaba a suburb of lagos where women are concerned class barriers fall with a resounding bang mr echewa seems really concerned about appearing to be white and being involved with white people so much let me be crass the upper echelon nigerian is more british than black just as the upper echelon senegalese is more french than black africans are not fools they woo the power structure in america and so far that has been white but since the american society from the s has been mostly concerned with social changes or progress it seems inevitable that before long power will be shared with black americans mr echewa you had better look to it in i took an extensive trip around the nation usa by car i stopped at many colleges and universities wherever i went except in the south i was asked why it was that the african students preferred the whites to american blacks the question was asked of me often enough to have validity especially since it was asked not by negroes but by whites themselves living in new york it has been my experience that africans will attend mixed gatherings but seldom will appear at an allnegro one this past spring an official from the mission of an east african nation agreed to speak before a group of negro women the man did not show up call to apologize or send a note fifty women all colored in new york city now have a very embittered view of africa and her people since most of the africans who live in new york tend to have diplomatic status they do not live in negro neighhoods occasionally they get waylaid and beaten up and they raise hell but they will have little to do with our civil_rights groups being diplomats they should not but if they believe that color is an important thing then their behavior in having as little to do with groups of this type is unforgivable ralph bunche never found it difficult i have heard a negro usia official tell an african to wear his robes when visiting america so he would not be mistaken for an american negro the state department people also handpick the negroes and negro organizations for the visiting african to see firsthand one african friend told me the average african visiting new york or chicago is more afraid of his own brothers than the white people who have caused both our conditions i think this is true negroes never will get to know africa better mr echewa unless africans become more willing to let them instead of avoiding them the truth is that a visiting african may give one impression but he knows very well that the africa he boasts about has a long way to go and it doesnt matter if he himself has three large houses and two mercedes with a house full of servants the average african still lives in a mud hut with a thatched or corrugated metal roof the mud houses are not a put down they are in fact quite cool and sturdy the average african coming to a large city like lagos still may have to sleep in the street next to an open sewer the poor american black on the other hand usually has what he needs to be a member of his society near at hand through some social agency africans tend to hide this disparity if you get to know them well you get to know this and they dont want you to many feel ill at ease if they have to take you to visit their relatives who still live in the huts and rather than do this many will drop you as a friend another nigerian friend of mine who almost singlehandedly wiped out corruption in lagos which is an augean task and who did it so well that he was sent packing up to kano introduced me to his family there were two wives and many many children the house was partly of mud and the lighting was provided by candles this man had no sense of shame as he should not have had i enjoyed his family and i think they enjoyed me i felt the richer for the pleasure of meeting them and it was only the second time i was ever invited into the home of mr average african the african like the negro deals with white values he should be ashamed he thinks and he is because his relatives live in a mud hut and a mud hut is a sign of savagery in white terms i think the african has just really started to gobble up white values negroes are further down the line they know them for what they are now mr echewa you know as well as i do that africans are as sophisticated and as crude as any other people probably cruder let me cite an example during my last trip to nigeria two people one british one american complained about africans going to parties drinking up all the whiskey that in itself was not bad but the fact that the africans seldom invited them to parties made the africans appear to be parasites they also complained that africans spoiled excellent cognac by mixing it with ginger alea most valid complaint to my mind both were going to buy cheap cognac so the africans could mix their gingerale with that now that doesnt sound like sophistication to me i have seen the sophisticated african at work and play and i am not impressed i have seen him suffer twenny hungry that is running through his civil service pay so quickly that he was hurting for the th of the month payday to come around again those africans who bear in mr echewas words the trade mark made in great britain or made in france are the beentosthe people who have been to england or france to school a takeoff on bantu a racial designation i have seen these fellows mr echewa with their briefcases filled with sandwiches pacing up and down the streets with a great deal of impatient sophistication nowadays the negro takes the fact of college education in stride he needs no labels to proclaim the fact that he is going or has gone and it seems to me that this is much closer to the sophistication mr echewa writes about the fact of hip that mr echewa discusses in his article is badly misunderstood hip always meant that a person was aware jomo kenyatta doesnt do the uncle willie or the monkey either but hes the hippest thing africa has turned out in recent years i confess that i was surprised at the way mr echewa employed the term negritude which as a doctrine is as racist as white supremacy most nigerians leave negritude to the french africans in case mr echewa doesnt know it yet the spokesman for negritude on the african continent leopold senghor is in the process of refining it he feels that the bantu peoplesand this includes people in the southern areas of nigeriaare inferior to the hamiticsemitic types such as the senegalese m senghor is the president of senegal my friend achebe believes that it is the white people who have caused and are still causing the gap between negroes and africans it is they after all who control and disseminate the word but now that we are aware of the fact of dissonances between us is there not something we can do first we can stop lying to each other in speeches african leaders say that they want their afroamerican brothers to return home that they are welcome realistically negroes would find little room in africa because there are not that many jobs available second because american education is rated tops in the world africans have a certain natural reluctance in competing with them two negro women both toplevel social workers in the states tried to get jobs in nigeria they were turned down cold not because of money they didnt want that muchbut because their educations were superior to the people with whom and for whom they would be working if african leaders truly want negroes it is within their means to invite them and devise programs in which they can make full use of their talents so lets stop lying about that on our side lets stop lying about flocking to africa in droves i met james farmer in nigeria in february and he had made a series of trips around africa and planned to organize some kind of program whereby negroes could go to africa i believe less and less that black americans have the desire they once had to quit the known for all its dubious qualities for the totally unknown so lets quit lying about that too another friend of mine a negro who once worked with the satellite tracking station near kano quit in order to work with the people they would have none of his engineering skills they made him live in a section of town reserved for those people who have no relatives the last i heard of this man he had moved down to lagos and was selling american chickens in a supermarket africans are going to have to stop speeding on the new jersey turnpike and spend more time with negroes they are going to have to show us one of these days mr average african not the glamorous africa with its new rivieratype houses or swanky and impossibly expensive hotels they are going to have to look at americas ne groes as realistically as white americans do and they are going to have to do that pretty quickly i do not think it is any accident that a major negro magazine failed to do well when it was published specifically for africa african leaders could not afford to let their people see just how well american blacks are doing in spite of racism in this land in addition to that perhaps africans just didnt care mr echewa saysand rightfully so that negroes have to expend more energy getting to know africans i think i may have pointed out already however that it is largely the african who is preventing us from doing just that furthermore africans dont know other africans that well most of the contact is made between africans of different countries from the top but not in the middle if there is such a thing and certainly not at the bottom i wrote a book on africa for children which is being used by three nigerian teachers in africa to instruct their pupils on the rest of the continent mr echewa is right once again when he suggests that we rid ourselves of the ignorance that lies between us he himself is woefully ignorant of just what does lie between us for example we are not as unprepared to rid ourselves of ignorance as he seems to think i would remind him that the currents of african independence began here not in africa at the first meeting of the panafricanism congress convened in london in by the late w e b dubois one historian noted that at the outset panafricanism was a simple manifestation of fraternal solidarity between negroes of african descent from the british antilles and the united states of america to put it bluntly not a single africans presence was recorded at that first meeting in fact not until at the fifth congress did they appear and among them were kwame nkrumah and jomo kenyatta i am glad mr echewa wrote his article otherwise i never would have written an answer to it many negroes who have been in africa refuse to let mr charlie know their true reactions to it and its people we have kept silent not so much for ourselves but because of our brothers back home but when the brothers play on the fact of our silences to put us down that is another thing finally i must note with cold objectivity that if africa produces such wisdom and sophistication and snobbery as mr echewa boasts why ever in the hell did he leave it to come to these united states the answer is obvious this racistridden land has something to offer even to mr echewa john a williams makes a very strong pointif his point is that nigerian social standards are not as high as those of the u s he goes into some unnecessarily painful detail in making his point such as it is however as an answer to the article i wrote last january and within the clearly defined context of that article his letter is an exemplary piece of unbridled irrelevance perhaps mr williams has an argument to win hence all this vehemence and invective unfortunately nobody can win this argument because for every experience that illustrates one point another can be cited to illustrate the opposite if my intention were to champion the african side of the dispute then like mr williams i could assemble a vast amount of unilateral evidence to make my point on the contrary my intention was and still is to indicate the attitudes and tendencies which lead to the misunderstanding between africans and negro americans not endorsing these attitudes in either party but just pointing them out accordingly my tone was quite tentative mr williams must not close his eyes to the fact that few negroes have had the privilege or the bitter and disillusioning experience as he would probably call it of visiting africa so the battle ground is here not in nigeria the problem i treated concerned primarily the odd africans who are in this country the type of africans that the average negro can meet and probably has met this type of african is young a student and probably aboveaverage in his own national context some africans falsely claim to be the sons of chiefs however the status is often foisted on the rest of us by people who think we must all be princes to deserve to come to this gods country the african student here deals with all classes of negroesoften with the lower class ones i mean the cats with tarred hair needlesharp shoes red socks and sun glasses day and night dig then check it i am sure that mr williams will agree that there is a social and intellectual disparity here to give him a chance to get even i will concede that the average african can be quite primitive but he is not the kind you are likely to meet on main street i wonder why the obsession with mud huts and poor relatives oh well it is true that some africans pretend to many lofty things personally i will go as far as who goes the farthest in condemning such pretence nigerian social amenities bear no comparison to those of the u s however u s affluence worsens rather than mitigates the negros situation for as mr williams surely knows the most likely way for the average negro to get into one of those towering skyscrapers is as a janitor as for me i would always rather be a nigerian andlive in a mud hut than be so deprived in the midst of plenty i have a feeling mr williams and i will disagree on the definition of the average negro i hesitate to define one but i know he is not a college graduate far from it it is not unusual for professionalclass negroes to apply everything said about the negro to themselves forgetting that they are a negligible percentage of the negro population funny but i think that many professionalclass negroes are more ashamed of their poor relatives than the africans mr williams cited in his letter besides the negroes tend to have a complex about it whereas africans accept the inescapable tribal or familial bond with their relatives no matter how poor they are since mr williams is plagued by a common american malady a temptation to reduce all values to dollars i will introduce him to two very important notions notions which contribute very strongly to the pride of the african the first is the personal concept i exist i have a right to be i esteem myself highly one of the saddest aspects of segregation in the united states is that many negroes seem to have accepted and made peace with the degradation and secondrateness which the white society has forced on them africans on their part do have some unspoken inferiority complexes but theirs are not nearly as numerous or intense as the negroes at least not any more in this era of african independence we are exerting ourselves fully and projecting the african personality everywhere so the african one meets here usually has a proud carriage we have a lot to be proud of mr williams he is assertive and does not ask anybodys permission to be equal he takes his equality for granted many negroes on the other hand are still trying to run away from themselves from their color from their past they dont accept themselves as they are it is not news to anyone that lighter colored negroes usually consider themselves a shade superior to the darker ones they usually marry other lighter colored negroes they perform plastic surgery on their features i have been told that a leading negro university in this country used to be a blue vein school frankly i dont have much patience with people who are trying to be white but cant quite make it the second concept is one of belonging i belongto my family to my village the name of my village is umuamadi which means the sons of amadi we are about strong and live together this is home to me no matter where else i may happen to be living i belong to my town clan tribe country time and time again i have tried to explain to some negro friends that the american concept of acceptance has no meaning in africa the tribal groups may not like one another but it is no groups prerogative to accept or reject the others tribalism is universal right here in america you have your wasps and wops and polaks and irish etc all sharing some sort of fellow feeling for members of their particular group and holding the rest in some sort of contempt elsewhere french canadians are fighting englishspeaking canadians flemishspeaking belgians are feuding with their frenchspeaking compatriots the english and the french hold one another in an unspoken mutual contempt these mr williams are examples of tribalism do you have a more civilized name for it in any case what has tribalism got to do with the friction between africans and negroes in the u s i daresay the accusation of wooing the power structure is a little incorrect as a foreigner the african often has to deal with the power structure as it is the word is deal not woo african governments cannot cater in detail to the interests of the negro because the racial problem here like the one in south africa is an internal problem it is useful to note anyway that prior to african independence the u s had no one to answer to for its atrocious racial policies where private individuals are concerned mr williams needs to be reminded that africans do not come here to be absorbed into the negro subculture this is the rude fact as julius nyerere once said we know our friends but it is not up to our friends to pick enemies for us for many negroes this division is often arbitrary and why should i a foreigner lose my head literally and figuratively in the civil_rights fight my calling is elsewhere weve got problems of our own let me just say that as a committee chairman in the notre dame civil_rights commission it was sometimes my onue to kindle some of your whats happening stalwarts africans do not consider themselves negroes in the american sense of the word in as much as the word means black then we are negro otherwise no for example in hattiesburg miss two years ago a certain gentleman usurped my seat as i stepped down from the bus to take pictures as i tried to reclaim the seat he thumbed me towards the back of the bus he quickly discovered i wasnt a negro now for my credentials i have been here four years i spent the better part of two summers touring the country using the greyhound seeamerica ticket days of unlimited travel on either occasion i have been in most of the states i have been a door to door salesman currently i work parttime as a bartender at smokes flamingo the best restaurant operated by a negro in south bend in conclusion i am forced to wonder what nigerian taxi drivers custom officers cheap cognac and ginger ale have to do with the point in question the argument begins to get ridiculous with such assertions as who started whom on the road to freedom on the overqualified sociologists it is likely they had nothing we could use nigeria does not have social problems comparable to the u s scale finally to what seems to be the climax of mr williams arguments namely the reason hell i am here why ever in the oh well i already anticipated that question in the january article the actual reason i am classified wise lets here for more than two centuries prior to the founding of the association for the study of negro life and history the american negro from the point of view of history lived in an era of inhumanity of culture the failure was due to many factors slavery ignorance total disinterest in fact disbelief in the negro as a human being historical distortions and grossly false myths until the th century there were no negro historians of note to avoid the negros total eclipse into inhumanity in there was born a negro boy in virginia carter g woodson son of slave parents he was unable to attend school regularly and was forced to teach himself while working later he attended high school and college parttime and worked parttime he however was possessed of a brilliant incisive analytical mind he earned his bachelors and masters degrees at the university of chicago and the coveted degree of doctor of philosophy at harvard in this man dr carter g woodson became americas greatest scholar and authority on the history of the american negro and the contributions of the negro to americas history and progress as well as an authority on the negros african heritage he was a scholar who truly enlarged human understanding dr woodson was a selfless man he devoted his whole life his energies and his material wealth to the lonely search for the truth about the people whom he loved so dearly he had a profound belief that what he found and what he was telling america during his all too short life could only be as effective as the accuracy of the glorious history revealed by him during his nearly years of painstaking research those scholars who have studied and reviewed more than a score of volumes of his history and his more than articles on the american negro and the negro of other lands will say that posterity is heavily indebted to dr woodson for the revelations of his impeccable personal research into years of negro history in september we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the association for the study of negro life and history the child of the efforts and the brain of this great historian and coincidentally the ninetieth year of his birth this event should be a challenge to every negro to know his own history better and indeed to make it irresistibly attractive and respectable as dr woodson has done we have for many years been involved in the fight against the bigotries and hatreds stirred up in a pluralistic society where the ethnic and religious minorities must fight for a firstclass citizenship which in democratic theory is theirs to the neglect of knowing our own history a fact which gives comfort to the bigots this mistake has been a great loss to us in the lack of knowledge of our race and pride of race we must redress the lack of pride of ancestry too long ignored and thus overcome the deceit of those who would deny us a place in history we must give to the millions of negro children who because of circumstances over which they had no control do not know the chance to emerge from the darkness of ignorance of their own ancestry we must give them the access to history as well as to life which is the heart and soul of the american dream our responsibility is to support in this fiftieth year of our struggle for culture with all our might and means this great association for the study of negro life and history to commemorate the name and memory of a great negro american carter g woodsonand to create a foundation to encourage other woodsons now in our schools or yet unborn to further study the life and history of one of the earliest races to inhabit the american continent the knowledge of the history ot the negro will tear away the many false faces and myths that have so long obscured the truth this the way it was fnr j done call thenwhat we guidance and counseling now down our way someone who saw something in you were a preacher or walked up and asked what you want to be and you told them if you were a girl that you wanted to be a teacher or a nurse if you boy you said a lawyer a a doctor after this you proceededjust proceeded with good fortune i harbored a boon that would insure my choice of vocation in addition to the question i had an older sister who was two grades ahead of me when i reached the fourth grade i began to welcome her intention to learn me the choice assignments that the teachers learned her for instance everyone in the school knew that miss daisy ill call her required the sixth graders to recite i sigh for the land of the cypress and the pine where the jessamine blooms and the gay woodbine instead of reciting a wise saying like good better best during morning devotions i lorded my prestige over the fourth graders by saying all of the cypress and the pine this pattern persisted when i was in the fifth grade my sister had to work the good and bad road problems in the seventh grade i worked them too when i was in the sixth she was in the eighth way on the other side of the track in high school thats when she began stuffing my head with home x she knew how to cream the butter how to make white icing stay on a cake and how to make shredded coconut stay on the white icing so i didnt bat an eye i had no cause to when my seventh grade teacher handed me my promotion card and asked the question i spoke right up and said i want to be a home x school teacher she smiled and patted me on the back being intelligent enough to know i thought that i was more than ready to proceed three months later one nevertobe forgotten september morning in i left my homeroom class for the home x building but they didnt have it spelled over the entrance arch the way my sister called it i didnt have time to write down what they had up there because the crowd shoved me along too fast before i could walk independently i was inside a spacious room with scores of sleeksurfaced oblong tables with chairs all around them i had never seen a schoolroom without desks in fact i had never seen a room like this one before we huddled in littlegirl clusters for security while the teacher waved her arms as if she lashed mosquitoes girls girls girls my my she held one side of her face as if she had the toothache sit down at the tables she whisked through the narrow passes between the tables dropping a neat stack of paper slips on each table last name first first name second middle name last we sat there like victims of battle fatigue not rallying at all to what she had just barked out for heavens sake im asking each of you to write your own name cant you do that she sat on the corner of the desk waiting how you want us to write it a girl asked listenno ill write on the board she wrote a name on the board is that your name another girl asked yes the teacher replied and now may i give you the requirements for this course yes maam someone answered she shook her head then told us what to expecta notebook being one of the more important demands she made a smile then read from a small notebook with checkered design food is any substance we sat with undivided attention girls please open your notebooks when i begin dictating again i want you to write it down let me begin again she said food is any substance which when taken into the body is capable of one or more of the following functions first building and repairing tissues i could scarcely hold my peace what was this woman up to i asked myself id wanted to learn more about making good cakes and she stood there all prim and cool and tall laughing with her medium brown eyes and passing her hand over her straightened slick bob never caring at all about creaming the butter thats what i wanted to do thats why i had chosen home x as my vocation building and repairing tissues she had said whod ever heard of food doing that when we ate at home we didnt eat to build or to repair anything we ate to fill our stomachs where had she been where had she come from not to know what food was really for a girl raised her hand breaking the spell what was the last thing that you said she frowned building building building her proud square nose was wrinkling as she spoke if im not mistakenline up come by the desk with an armpit set to meet my nostrils mum is the word they sell it you buy it you use it she sat down for the sniffing exercise never fear my heart whispered as it bumped sounding like raps on a big bass drum you cleaned your body with care and i had i had scrubbed carefully with warm water and octagon soap i had deodorized my armpits with arm and hammer baking soda to be sure i had sprinkled a little between my toes to keep my brown oxfords sanitary on the inside so there had been nothing else that i knew of that a yearold could have done to make herself dainty i marched along hearing my fathers voice and finding comfort in the sound et too brewtay he had told us that that was all a man could say when he found out that his best friend had helped to stab him to death this lady was the one to help me be what i wanted to be already she had become enemy number one there was nothing to say but et too brewtay as my father said when someone he liked pushed him to the wall no one she said after sniffing thirtyfour armpits maybe someone slipped out she counted the slips on the desk yes thirtyfive but dont get happy ill catch her if she stays in this class believe me in the name of health and sanitation i mean for you to look clean be clean and smell clean on and on the password was mum mum was the password as we took notes on food for three weeks as we worked three weeks on our kitchen outfits and as we went to the kitchen to learn to cook cooking was my hope for realizing the joys of home x the kitchen with its peculiarities caused me to wonder if i would succeed after our first briefing for one thing the stove cooked with gas before anyone could ask a question about what the teacher had said she looked at me and said sweetly you light the oven i turned the gas on scratched a match as she had done because the pilot wasnt working and applied it underneath i only lost my eyelashes my eyebrows a halfinch of hair from the line and a week from school to soothe my face from the blown heat with cocoa butter just before the end of the first nineweek period the teacher announced that we would make lemon meringue pies for the superintendent and members of the board of education who always dined in the department of home economics after the official annual meeting a crew of including the teacher turned out the day before the visit in whitestarched cooking aprons and headbands to make a dozen pies i looked around feeling pride even joy on being one of this group i stood there dreaming of the beautiful pies wed make get the lemon squeezer dont just stand there get the lemon squeezer i said i mean you jackson the teacher stood akimbo her dark skin darkening even more as i froze i guess you dont know where to find it all right its in the other room thirtyfive pairs of spotlights hit me as i turned to fetch that lemon squeezer once i reached the dining room i sensed relief because a ninthgrader was in there polishing the table wheres the lemon squeezer i asked her lemon squeezer she loudtalked me you tell me girl you dont know a lemon squeezer when you see one the teacher heard her and picked up on the cue ahhah you were going to fool me you dont know what a lemon squeezer is ahhah i cowered in the other room as another member of the cooking class got the lemon squeezer thank you dear she used her best speaking voice girls she continued you ought to pay attention to what your mothers teach you pay attention i had to pay attention and to adhere to my mothers teachings just as she had been taught to obey her mother there had been generations of obedience but neither of our mothers would have recognized a lemon squeezer had it been the size of one of the modern football bowls even though embarrassment stung me regularly because of a previous lack in homemaking knowledge and skills i took home economics for four years learning mostly what negro women on my side of the track couldnt know and though i knew that me and home x had parted company as lifelong mates the very minute i left the other room i have never stopped thinking of the teacher as the emancipator who helped us to become american women for lafayette porter life is essentially hapa painter his of the world is expressed in vivid colfrolicsome designs selforganizes his own life around his work his material needs are simple and they are satisfied through nontaxing work which pays the bills but allows him to reserve his emotional energy for painting working in tempera porter achieves a musically gay effect not unlike what some of the best of the current op art would be were it more seriously conceived and more diligently refined an excellent talent for simple drawing is one of the sounder bases of porters ultimate success a sense of the whimsical and the absurd animate his figures porter is an original artist who follows no school and is not consciously influenced by any other painter or style he terms his own approach to painting as progressive and leaves it at that progressive art moves forward in the expression of ideas is the extent of his explanation a native chicagoan porter has traveled in europe lived precariously in greenwich village and now lives and works in indiana thief drunkard brawler it was the lot of frangois villon fifteenth century french poet to write one of the loveliest evocations of the ubi sunt where are they theme in all poetry in the middle ages with their preoccupation with death this theme was especially frequent and wyndham lewis has called villons ballade of dead ladies one of the master songs of the world with the exquisite ache of its music caressing and soothing to dreams and its lovely refrain it has recently been translated again by richard wilbur and by galway kinnell but the most familiar version is by dante gabriel rossetti just as the ubi sunt theme was prevalent in the middle ages with their concern for mortality another theme which i may call the hie sum or here i am theme occurs again and again in american negro poetry oppressed ignored and deprecated the negro seeks identity and pride not by regretting or mourning past glories but by bringing them back to the present and identifying them with himself whether or not the poet is conscious of this theme and this tradition it is an understandable psychological reaction to a social situation one of the first and bestknown poems with the hie sum theme is langston hughes the negro speaks of rivers in which the negro invests himself with the dignity and depth of ancient rivers as long as the poets working this tradition bring to it something newminted and unique to themselves it will not become a mere formula like the imitations of villon birth love death are recurrent themes of poetry but the other day i was thumbing through old numbers of the crisis and found a poem using the hie sum theme that was full of cliches the poet called himself crispus attucks and harriet tubman and all the other stock figures clothed in stock language of negro history week the theme of hie sum with its search for identity and pride need not be confined to negro poets we find it in the poem hebrews by samuel oppenheim we discover the hie sum theme even in the work of the jaunty optimistic white american walt whitman but he inverts the material instead of identifying the past with himself he rejects it and claims the present pancho villa bandit and revolutionary successfully thumbed his nose at a punitive american force led by general john pershing is now subject of a campaign in mexico where he is made out to be more saint than sinner pancho villa is rising in mexico as a sort of mexican legendary robin hood dogooder who never shed blood for pleasure who stole from the rich and befriended the poor whether this version is true or false is something that cannot be verified most of villas contemporaries are dead and in the eyes of a younger generation he is a legendary figure who could have whipped the gringos had he received cooperation instead of persecution from fast tumbling regimes during the turbulent days of the mexican revolution and the legendary figure has a lilting name to go with his exploits pancho villa a name that was not his own for the unimportant doroteo arango raiding and running from the law almost six decades ago in the states of durango sonora and chihauhau was rebaptized by a puerto rican negro an adventurer and guerrilla who fought against the french when maximilian was emperor of mexico the negro francisco villa came into doroteo arangos life when the latter was a fugitive from justice he had killed the seducer of his oldest sister still little more than a child was jailed but managed to escape into the durango hills in the rugged durango fastnesses still inaccessible even in this day arango when not fleeing from the rurales kept himself going by being a cuatrero this is a slang expression of that day meaning nothing more than a cattle rustler the real francisco villa who was an adventurer and professional soldier wound up as a guerrilla fighter in a band captained by a woman the legendary apolinaria garcia dedicated and unyielding in battle against french forces and turncoat mexicans who acknowledged emperor maximilian in the territory of durango zacatecas and chihuahua mounted at the head of her guerrilla band apolinaria garcia distinguished herself for her courage and audacity in raids against the french she was not always successful but she was a disturbing influence harassing the french invaders in a skirmish at a site known as silita in the state of durango apolinaria garcia was killed and with her death the guerrilla band disbanded soon after with emperor maximilian executed and the mexican republic restored a peace of sorts came to northern mexico francisco villa tried to lead a life of peace tilling the soil but he was not cut out to be a farmer and hearing of the small marauding band of doroteo arango villa abandoned his plow for the gun once more legend has it that after one cattle raid with the bandits spending the fruits on tequila a slightly tipsy francisco villa said i dont like your name it has the ring of a schoolteacher or a respectable man to it you need a more fitting name than the dull even vulgar doroteo arango i know what i will give you my name from now on you are pancho villa and so it was the negro and the mexican related only by their mutual need for excitement and scorning of the law agreed that pancho villa was a name that had a warriors ring to it even if the warrior was nothing more than a bandit and cattle rustler shortly after this rebaptizing of doroteo arango the bandits were flushed out by rurales and in the running battle that followed the negro francisco villa was slain he never lived to see how the name he had given on a whim gained more and more stature in revolutiontorn mexico substantiating the renaming of arango as the second pancho villa is jose cruz cervantes a grandson of apolinaria garcia who never came to know her because he was a youngster and she was always on the march now living quietly in mexico city with his memories cervantes was one of villas highranking officers from until the bandit chieftain and revolutionary surrendered to provisional president adolfo de la huerta retired to life of a rancher only to meet death by assassination in a ambush according to cervantes pancho villa boisterously took on the name from his colored companion in banditry perhaps he had not meant to continue using the name but when the real pancho villa was slain somehow the joke of two pancho villas became a permanent one historians in trying to trace the name have delved into records and come up with fact that doroteo arango was born on june and they have also followed the theory that the mexican pancho villa got his name from stepfather agustin arango who was the bastard child of augustin villa all this fuss about making pancho respectable and all the bother about a name would have only irritated him said cervantes he was a lusty man and a heavy drinker and he formed a strong attachment to the real puerto rican francisco villa you know how men are in their cups the idea was suggested of a rebaptism and doroteo roared it was a good idea and when the puerto rican was killed he just naturally became pancho to his band somehow those days of fury and bloodshed and frenzied hatreds and barbarous actions seem far away today id like to forget about them but my woundsmy body shows the scars of seven bullet wounds and an equal number caused by knife slasheswont let me forget in the damp weather they act up give me no peace perhaps it is a punishment of sorts i do not know the old man shook his head reflectively why was i saved i was unimportant and fully of my family including father uncles and other relatives died in revolutionary combat now they say they want to erect statues for pancho villa to commemorate his name i do not know whether this is right or wrong as i do not know if what we did in the bloody years of revolt was right or wrong it was so long ago cervantes who is said all i want is peace i am an old man now and it all seems so unimportant today although then we thought we were very very important negro cowboys neg roes were pertinent in the old west they helped to open the west and they helped to build the west exploring the western plains and mountains the negroes dug for gold and silver and they trapped wild horses negroes found what is now los angeles they were with the lewis and clark expedition they were in the gold rush and they rode the pony express in the days of the old west negroes acquired the reputation of being outstanding bronco busters but some ranch owners found them too valuable to use in this capacity it was a time in our history says two ucla researchers when a texas rancher might assign a amonth white cowboy to ride a bucking outlaw horse with the danger of rupture mutilation or death rather than risk the investment he had in a negro cowboy negroes rode the plains from n v texas to montana and they were as popular in their day as the legendary figures in movies and television there were negro cowboys like james beckwith who associated with kit carson there was dan diamond who made headlines in the s by participating in a denver county jail break and there was bronco sam who made a bet with other cowboys that he could ride a horse up a flight of stairs these are the facts that were discovered by the ucla researchers philip durham and everett jones when they began gathering material for the negro cowboys dodd mead it was first durhams idea to write the negro cowboys and for a long time it was just an idea when are you going to write that manuscript on the negro cowboys jones would ask durham and after many months of hearing this question durham replied i will write it if you write it with me so together they began a long two years of research putting together scattered material on negro cowboys they discovered ben hodges a negro cowboy who was known as a competent forger and cattle thief he lived in dodge city during the days of wyatt earp and bat masterson and died there in once hodges was charged with stealing cattle from a dodge city dairyman and with no friends or lawyer he went to court pleading his own case what me he cried at one point the descendant of old grandees of spain the owner of a land grant in new mexico embracing millions of acres the owner of gold mines villages and towns situated on that grant of whom i am sole owner would steal a miserable miserly lot of old cows at another point he represented himself as a poor but honest cowboy being persecuted by personal enemies and there was deadwood dick who rode and lived in the black hills of south dakota while a reward was being offered for his apprehension deadwood dick rode a black horse he wore black clothing and like the equally improbable lone ranger he wore a black halfmask many negro cowboys wore the badge of the law and still others were prosperous bill pickett is the negro cowboy who invented steer wrestling and bob lemmons is still recognized as one of the nations most famous bronco busters bose ikard was a trusted cowhand of rancher charles goodnight when we were on the trail carrying money i gave it to ikard said goodnight a thief would never think of robbing himnever think of looking in a negros bed for money another negro cowboy george mcjunkin is remembered by historians of science for his discovery of ice age bison bones in the folsom new mexico mountain area during the s the negro cowboys is a well researched book written in a noveltext book style it regains an important part of american heritage but this is not a book pleading for the american negroes in this modern day when hollywood has ignored the negro as a western hero durham and jones have written a goethean calling for more light when the west became a myth or a game of lets pretend the negro became the invisible man or at best an uncle tom says durham and jones there was no place for him in these community theatricals he had been a real cowboy but he could not pretend to be a mythical cowboy very little information if any information at all can be found in history text books on negro cowboys and even those that do mention negro cowboys fail to mention the dollar value many ranchers had for these western riders they dont recognize the fact that ben hodges was a real cowboy more real than todays roy rogers and gene autry durham and jones who have written other books have taken on a new significance in telling of the brilliant life of cowboys in the old west it presents a stirring panorama of the old west and lets us live those days again the roman satirist juvenal once lamented who knows not o volusius of bythinia the sort of monsters egypt in her infatuation worships in its nearly centuries of existence ancient egypt bowed down to more than deities often hundreds at a time they ranged in all their horror from hawkheaded horus to the hippopotomusgod apet from sobek the crocodile to the fearsome liongoddess of memphis into this milieu ascended amenhotep iv a strange revolutionary young man who took the throne of pharaoh about bc in the th dynasty changing his name to akhnaten he condemned the worship of idols and introduced the first form of monotheism then known to the world in akhnaten the rebel pharaoh chilton author robert silverberg recreates the pharaohs years of power and ultimate tragic fall akhnatens god was aten symbolized in the sun but actually an archetype of the great abstract deities yet to comethe god of gautama moses jesus and mohammed thou art glittering beautiful strong thy love is great and mighty he has thus been called the first individual known to history but akhnatena physically weak and possibly unbalanced man lacked the true reformers sense of politics monkish fanatical he veered increasingly away from reality and became one of the great tragic kings of history and literature his first major blunder was the promptness with which he expelled amon then the official god of thebes he further alienated the priesthood by imperiously moving his court from the traditional capital to a new city named for him further north along the nile but akhnatens greatest folly was the unworldly indifference with which he watched the egyptian empire the work of three generations of his ancestors and the most extensive then known quickly slip away first the levant under the treacherous hittite ruler suppiluliumas availed itself of egypts internal life then nubia to the south in the end akhnatens godthat strange new god of light and mercydeserted him he became separated from his queen the fabled nefertiti and three years later met his death possibly at the hands of concerned patriots vengeful amonists destroyed his body his city his shrines but perhaps the saddest part of akhnatens story was the popular failure of his ideology a religion without mythology writes the author without images without personified gods with whom a man could identify was able to make no headway in the minds and hearts of egyptians the book is an often engrossing account of this anachronistic pharoah and of the great hamitic dynasty of which he was a part but available evidence concerning his motivations and even the major events of his reign is too sketchy and speculatory to provide convincing reading author silverberg further bogs the reader down in longish excerpts from royal scrolls and tediously detailed hypotheses concerning his downfall still for the layman in any way interested in this fascinating epoch in egypts historyand the history of civilized religionthe book will prove rewardinghamilton bims homas b morgan selfcreations impersonalities holt rinehart and winston is probably the best writer in the worldat what he does he writes short concise character studies of the subgreat mediocre and notorious in this book gary cooper roy cohn teddy kennedy sammy davis jr elia kazan nelson rockefeller blaze starr david susskind bennett cerf john wayne huntington hartford alf landon and various teenage idols these sketches are crystalsharp no word is out of place there is not a dull sentence in the book morgan knows hes good too otherwise he wouldnt have written a toolengthy introduction explaining how he shadows his subjects with an impersonal eye but it becomes apparent that he is not impersonal that he in fact writes with a cold and merciless irony throughout the book morgan adds little sections on the end of each article describing his own personal relationship with the subject once the subject has seen the usually painful sketch in print the upshot for the reader is a fascinating tale of broken friendships broken because having been seemingly befriended by morgan during the weeks of conversation the subject often feels betrayed when he reads the article and no wonder for morgan an intelligent perceptive man with selfprofessed liberal attitudes cuts the very people to whom one expects him to be kindly and is least disparaging to those whose ideas and deeds he holds in ridicule and contempt he justifies this behavior as sacrifices to his art but if this is art it is morally ambiguous he handles simpleminded right wingers like cooper and wayne easily is vague towards davis their friendship cracks and venomous towards susskind and kazan susskind gave morgan more time and cooperation than any of the others and i sympathize with him when he asks morgan why did you do it to me dont you see what it means youve made it possible for the finks to get me the finks in this case were those who make television a gutless banal dollarsubservient medium and susskind despite his weaknesses was trying to improve the situation susskind was engaged in a significant battle with reallife consequences but morgan was not moved that is the sort of thing that mr morgan a writers writer doesnt seem to understand john woodford 11211 100 s а v q e ףv 9 l c
