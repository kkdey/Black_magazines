why direct action must not cease
one of the least discussed of all the major recent events in the rv r freedom movement is the moratorium on demonstrations i i m and direct action for the period of the presidential campaign agreed to by major civil_rights organizations with core    dissenting shortly after the nomination of senator goldwater in san francisco it is curious that there has been little postelection speculation as to whether that decision to halt negro militancy for  days was in fact a wise course to have followed the major assumption which led to the decision to call a moratorium on all organized civil_rights protests was of course the feeling that such protests might tend to spread or deepen the white backlasheven to the point of altering the results of the presidential election prior to the election there was no method by which any certainty regarding the advisability of the moratorium could be secured and unfortunately no such postelection method has been discovered the deliberate delay of  days however cannot simply be written off as an event that has passed into history the moratorium on civil_rights demonstrations during the  presidential election may turn
out to be one of the major turning pointsfor better or for worseof the entire freedom movement without minimizing or maximizing the presumed effects of the moratorium it seems warranted to note at least the following conclusions or inferences which may be made regarding the unprecedented voluntary postponement for three months of civil_rights demonstrations  perhaps the most importanteousinference which may be drawn from the moratorium and the election is the conclusion that militant tactics by negro and civil_rights although possibly the most erron leaders in a preelection period will cause many white persons to vote against the negro cause whereas the absence of such tactics will result in a white vote not discemibly based on antinegro sentiment this conclusion appears to be widely accepted although one can argue that the white backlash would not have been significant in the vote in northern cities even if civil_rights demonstrations had in fact continued during the campaign the fact is that a feared white antinegro vote appears to have disappeared between labor day and election day  did the blackout on negro militancy cause the fadeout of the white backlash one can fear that the answer to that question by countless persons would be yes and that the  election may become in the popular imagination a symbol of the apparent truth however appalling and erroneous it may be that the presence of negro militancy during the period of an election campaign may elicit more antinegro than pronegro voters it must be remembered that this conclusion was the major assumption which led negro leaders to adopt the moratorium one may not therefore recoil from accepting its validation in the election results however repugnant and however open to question the validation may be it may well be that the leaders of core were correct when they refused to agree to the moratorium and when they argued that its adoption was a fundamental error but the ironic tragedy is that the moratorium on demonstrations presumably brought about within a few weeks a substantial diminution of antinegro feeling  a second conclusion which may have been silently reached by many individuals is the judgment that we should be gratified and grateful that any significant white backlash vote in northern cities was eliminated from the  presidential election this conclusion is premised on the assumption that the neutrality or apathy towards civil_rights by the white majority which is assertedly visible in the election results is better for the negro than a clearly antinegro vote would have been the fundamental premiseor mythwhich apparently leads to these conclusions is the concept that the negro needs friends in the white community and that the way to cultivate such friends is not to test their loyalty at the polls but to postpone negro demands during certain preelection periods those who rejoice at the absence of a notable white backlash vote in the election and who attribute its absence to the moratorium on demonstrations must also conclude that the loss of the friends for the freedom movement who would have been obtained if demonstrations had continued during the preelection period is clearly offset by the advantages to the negro people of an election where no northern communityunlike five southern statesexpressed its resentment against the negro by voting for a man who thought the civil_rights act of  unconstitutional it is conceivable that the judgment of these persons may turn out to be correct but it is clear that there are so many imponderable and unknowable factors that it is simply impossible to make any overall judgment at this timeand perhaps everon the wisdom and the advisability of the moratorium what is very clear however is the fact that during the present interim period before the freedom movement resumes its militancy there are dangers fallacies and fears both for whites and negroes which need constant and careful analysis let us address ourselves to some of these pitfalls the negro backlash  not many white persons have worried very much over any resentment and bitterness which may have understandably come into the hearts of negroes over the fact that their leaders felt impelled by the intensity of antinegro feeling among whites to suppress for  days the negros right to present his grievances it may be that the virtue of longsuffering so remarkably present in the negro soul lias been in strumental in softening whatever resentment may have come about as a result of the addition of  days to the  years during which the american negro has patiently waited for freedom and equality but what can we say about the effect of the moratorium on those countless negroes who are aware of the frightening fact that the presumed extent of antinegro feeling in northern cities may well have brought about irreparable harm and irreversible trends in public opinion as a result of the disappearance for three months of a program by civil_rights organizations and ever more importantly will many negroes bowing to antinegro feeling in the white community succumb to the temptation to continue to substitute caution for courage or even try to forget the unendurability of the negros condition in america  is it possible that the relative peace during the moratorium on civil_rights demonstrations could have had such an impact on both negroes and whites that most of the impetus of americas third revolution could disappear could a desire to have law and order be raised to a virtue above that of a hunger for justice could the mood of the northern white moderates dominate the orientation of the civil_rights movement could discretion be substituted for dynamism and prudence for progress as a result of the cessation of militancy for three months it is obvious that no one has the answers to these disturbing questions but what does emerge from the moratorium more clearly than ever before is the necessity of analyzing explaining and justifying the program of direct nonviolent action adopted by civil_rights leaders to bring justice and equality to the american negro relatively few white persons have apparently ever understood the mystique the purposes and the indispensability of a campaign of direct nonviolent action designed to eliminate the badges of slavery which still afflict the negro in america let us try therefore to probe deeply into the reasons why the negro feels that he can secure justice only by means of direct nonviolent action 
the reasons for direct nonviolent action in  reinhold neibuhr wrote prophetically about the negros plight in his book moral man and immoral society in these words if anyone disagrees substantially with dr neibuhrs conclusion that the white majority will not give justice to the negro if it is not forced to do so he has a difficult and perhaps an impossible task in collecting evidence to support his view the negro leaders in america decided many years ago that the white majority would not yield if it is not forced to do so it is this fundamental premise which makes the campaign of direct nonviolent action indispensably necessary if one doubts the judgment that progress for the negro has come about only by forcing the white majority to yield he should recall the following recent events in negro history if one agrees that history demonstrates that the white majority in america must be forced to give justice to the negro the real issue then centers on the best way to bring about the required force the freedom movement has adopted a program of direct nonviolent actiona concept which needs constant explanation and analysis this program does not in any way minimize the necessity for continued recourse to the courts and to the legislatures but direct nonviolent action assumes that the ordinary political processes and the normal legal institutions of america cannot completely solve the problems of the negro prejudice is so deep white supremacy is so taken for granted and the negro is so downtrodden and poor that the ordinary legal processes cannot be expected to bring about the elevation of the negros status to substantial equality with the majority of white citizens only direct actiondramatic and continuouscan sear the conscience of the white majority and thereby bring about an improvement in the negros position direct action involves a confrontation in a positive manner requesting or demanding equality and justice it is not opposed or inconsistent with carrying on the struggle for negro freedom in the courts but it insists that the struggle must also be carried on in the streets in the parks in the mass media direct action is designed to portray injustice vividly and thereby to arouse the indignation of those in the white majority who care direct action has many faces it can be a protest against slumlords by a rent strike an orderly march on city hall to demand better schools for negroes or demonstrations at construction sites to remind the world that the unions involved in the construction have systematically excluded negroes from their membership direct action is the result of a conviction by the negro that he simply cannot rely on the moral sense of the white majority direct action is therefore a way to force the white man to give justice direct action is a cry of anguish frustration and anger from the other america direct action as employed by the freedom movement has always had the added element of nonviolence when the negroes in the late s started to assert their rights in the south by sitins and similar demonstrations they anticipated and expected violence in return from the white power structure hence the negroes resolved to resist violence with nonviolencein the noblest tradition and spirit of thoreau gandhi and all of those minorities in history who have practiced civil disobedience to unjust laws nonviolence and civil disobedience have not meant the same thing in northern cities as they have in the south in the north the law grants equality to all but prejudiced people deny equality in housing employment and education to nonwhite groups as a result the term passive resistance is probably a more descriptive and more accurate name for the program of direct action carried on by civil_rights groups in the north but the spirit and purposes of direct action in the north are the same as in the south in both places direct action is a means to dramatize injustice to protest inequality and to force the white majority to yieldthere are many white moderates and even liberals who have never understood or sympathized with the direct action programs of negro organizations these individuals are quick to criticize one of the few extremists examples of demonstrationsprobably unauthorized by any civil_rights organizationand point out the adverse effects which this protest allegedly had on white citizens but the point that the white moderate who is quick to criticize demonstrations misses is the central and crucial truth that law and morality have not solved the negro problem and that as a result the negro has quite understandably come to the conclusion that direct action is the only way by which he can secure equality and justice if the white moderate wishes to repudiate direct action as ineffective and inopportune he must first either prove that law and morality will in fact bring equality to the negro or in the alternative the white moderate must offer the negro a substitute for direct action it seems clear that there is a widespread and profound misunderstanding of the purpose and the necessity for direct nonviolent action the most fundamental cause of this misunderstanding is the common fallacy endorsed by countless americans that the negro will find his rightful place in american society just as every other ethnic or immigrant group has done although the naivete and the basic falsity of this supposition should be clear to everyone this totally unrealistic view of the negro predicament in america continues to find adherents the fact is of course that the negro cannot be analogized to the immigrant or to any other ethnic group in america the negros problems and predicament are unique and have never been experienced or confronted by any other white minority in america the negro has disabilities beyond the obvious one of color the fundamental disability or infirmity which the negro must contend with is his status as the only culturally deprived minority in the whole history of america every other ethnic group in america can trace its origins to a particular nation race and religion the negro has no ties and indeed no knowledge of the nation or religion of his ancestors he has been deprived of his culture and exists in america almost as a person separated from the mainstream of american culture both negroes and whites can sense the nobodiness of the american negro because of this characteristic the negro has a feeling of inferiority and a tendency to selfsegregation the same characteristic causes the white majority to have an unconscious feeling of superiority and an inclination to think that the negro should exist apart from or outside the mainstream of white culture it is because of this apartness of the negro from the white in america that a program of direct action is necessary to bring about equality for the nations twenty million nonwhite citizens without direct action the white majority will try to forget the plight of the negro the campaign of direct action conducted by civil_rights groups for several months prior to the moratorium in the summer of  had educated and aroused the white majority more than at any other time in all of recent history in some places to be sure apathy turned into antagonism but in many other places apathy became acquiescence acceptance and even approval of the negros demands the dramatic progress of the negro in education and employment during the period from  to the summer of  is attributable in part to the fact that a sufficiently large number of citizens in the white community became aware of and angry about the injustices inflicted on negroes in america will that awareness and righteous anger fade away if a program of direct action is not resumed history suggests and indeed almost proves that the answer to that question is yes the white man in america will forget about the plight of the negrounless he is forced to remember direct action therefore cannot cease its necessity should shame the white man but its indispensability should never be forgotten by negro groups the immediate future will be a critically important period in the freedom movement negro organizations are understandably reluctant to reinitiate an extensive program of direct action while most whites do not have the insight or the courage to urge negroes to resume their militancy the vacuum which currently exists is a dangerous lulla period in fact when the northern counterpart of the southern white citizens council could be formed it is well to recall that the white citizens councils in the south were formed after a period of several months following the supreme courts famous desegregation mandate in may a period when a vacuum existed in southern leadership on civil_rights the white councils moved into this vacuum poisoned the atmosphere and formed a climate of opinion which has so successfully resisted the supreme courts mandate that in   per cent of the deep souths negro children were still in segregated schools could antinegro movements move into the vacuum now present in northern cities due to the moratorium and to a cessation or diminution of negro militancy frightening events seem to suggest that such an eventuality is possible the passage of proposition  in california by a  to  margin the massive resistance to the pairing of schools in new york city the fading enthusiasm of labor and industry for plans to train negro workersall of these are symptoms of the inveterate habit of the white majority to try to resolve the negro problem by attempting to deny its existence all persons therefore who are deeply interested in the future of the freedom movement must actively and articulately urge the resumption of a program of direct action by civil_rights groups the program may be modified in important ways because of the passage of the civil_rights act of  but it must nonetheless be militant continuous and systematic events involving direct action must moreover be connected at least in a general way with some stated objectives direct action programs must not give the impression that they are simply the outburst of hitherto suppressed anger and frustration it seems clear that the resumption of negro militancy may depend more on the encouragement of white leaders than upon the initiative of negro groups negroes will understandably hesitate to recommence a program of direct action if they feel that only a few white leaders of public opinion will endorse and support it white leaders therefore are more than they realize the intellectual advisers and professional counsellors of the negro freedom movement the white majority or the leaders of public opinion within it are now whether they realize it or not the architects of the moral and social structure of northern cities for the foreseeable future the attitude toward negro aspirations among northern whites is at present characterized by ambiguity and ambivalence the moratorium on demonstrations during the presidential campaign has brought even more confusion and misunderstanding into the minds of innumerable white citizens in the north it is a truism to note that catholics will continue to be among the most influential leaders of public opinion in northern cities with regard to the race problem catholics in public life and in positions of influence in public and private education will have a crucial and decisive role to play in the struggle of the negro for equality in housing education and employment that struggle cannot end in victory without the active collaboration and the closest cooperation of the white majority and particularly of white public officials the world which our childrens children will inherit may well be determined by the moral climate which is created in the generation from  to  that climate will depend to almost a frightening degree on the attitudes and feelings of catholics in northern communities it is time therefore for catholics and all white citizens to reassert the legacy of human equality which more than any one doctrine expresses the essence of the freedom movement and it is also time for everyone who desires the negro to have full equality in american life to confess publicly that this ideal cannot be attained unless the negroes aided by their white associates resume and continue a program of direct nonviolent action without such a program the white majority will soon forget the plight of the negro and will settle down complacently into a society where de facto white supremacy prevails but with a wellorganized program of direct action the negro in america mayhopefully within the foreseeable futuremove into a world where race is irrelevant and human dignity is a respected ideal 
the sun striking in between the pillars of the cayuga county courthouse in the upstate city of auburn new york glinted across two large bronze plaques on either side of the entrance one honored william h seward a familiar name in history books the other plaque honored harriet tubman an unknown name it read why was this plaque to a black slave woman given such a place of honor in a northern city  years ago if an important historical figure why have we not heard about her is it because she was a woman because she was a negro because she left no account of her deeds why although a fullblack unschooled slave harriet tubman was an active force in the civil war and she showed herself to be the worlds greatest heroine in the fight for personal freedom yet she has been almost forgotten harriet tubmans was not a life of service primarily devoted to the sick and suffering as was that of florence nightingale nor did she give her life in a single great burst of fanatical leadership as did joan of arc rather this runaway slave risked her life  runaway times in the cause of freedom and she gave a wars worth of devoted nursing care and spying service for her country during those frothyheaded days of a century ago harriet tubman awakened the prewar era and civil war days to masterful adventure and sacrifice not knowing how to write she kept no written records of her trips on the underground railroad it was better so without looking back at the fears and hardships of former trips her faith carried her onward she lived with face turned toward the future but the lack of such records makes it impossible to recount exact detailed descriptions of her various trips with their individual crises only by piecing together the stories she told and that others recorded can a typical trip be reconstructed by morning tired they bedded down in the woods for an uneasy rest each snapping twig startled them into wideeyed fear by nightfall they were glad to be up again and on their way now they took to the dusty road harriet who had been over it a dozen times before knew her destination by dawn they reached the home of a free negro upon her signal the door opened and the group filed into the little place so many moses only a few can get into the potato hole this was a hole dug in the center of the hardpacked earth floor of the cabin where potatoes were stored it was a fine place for hiding refugees out of the wind and the rain well put as many as we can in there and the rest under the haystack by daylight there was no sign of the visitors the sunshine striking through the early mist fell on not one of them that night when they were again on their way harriet suddenly stopped and listened quickly she scuttled her charges into a thicket a baby cried she gave it a dose of paragoric it quieted none too soon the pounding of the horses hooves grew louder and the patrollers galloped past stopping a short distance beyond the little group could hear one patroller say we might as well give up after the patrollers had gone back harriet and the others laughed as they scrambled out of the bushes they say were fools but were not fools enough to keep on the road when we hear them coming she said they skirted the highway tramping through the night at daybreak harriet hid them in a clump of brush near a mosquitoinfested swamp it was the best she could do i a whispering relay would inform the slaves that harriet was preparing for another trip north they waited expectantly for her muted singing call that indicated she was ready to start finally it came a low husky voice sang outside the cabins one saturday night in the middle s the singing rose and fell with the fickle wind as it carried its message through the slave quarters of a maryland plantation moses is here moses has come to take another load to freedom on waves of the wind the singing words spread from cabin to cabin plantation to plantation dark forms shadows of the night glided silently to the source of the whispering melody taking shape the shadows became dark outlines of people who wanted to be guided north who came to plead with their moses to take them to the promised land harriet tubman the moses of her people chose her followers carefully they had to prove their conviction their courage that they had the physical stamina needed to endure the hundreds of tortured miles to freedom yet a woman with a young child might be among the travelers for harriet knew that a mother would not turn back if it meant her babys freedom when the group was selected the chosen ones went back to their cabins to make last preparations and say their goodbyes meantime harriet went to visit a free negro nearby jake well be needing your help again remember follow the patrollers and tear down the reward signs and she was gone the travelers each with a bit of food and a few precious trifles tied in a bandana listened for her whippoorwills call this signalled that moses was ready to leave the group took off through the woods on this saturday night their masters would not miss them until monday by then if all went well they would be miles away it was a cloudy night progress was slow without the north star to guide them still being close to home they could pick their way along the familiar little trails that led northward through the woods harriet tubman their moses urged them on making the most of this first night out while her followers were fresh and filled with enthusiasm for the adventure stay here she warned tve got to get us food in the village ill be back as soon as i cantoward dark dont come out you wait until you hear me sing if i singhail oh hail ye happy spirits death no more shall make you fear everything is safe but if i sing moses go down in egypt tell ole pharo let me go then you stay hidden as darkness settled over the road that evening the low sound of harriets singing told them all was well they came out to meet her she passed out the rations they ate as they trudged northward harriet tried to keep their minds off themselves by telling them tales although she herself had had little rest that day now she told them of her first trip north alone and not knowing the way or who was friend or foe i wondered if i should try itif i should leave my family behind she began as i listened to the stories told around the cabin i wanted more and more to be free one day i decided to run away to freedom it was worth it youll see while i was waiting for the day to leave i met john she went on with a sigh he was free i married him that didnt make me free but it did give me a nametubman i wanted to be free like him i got me a lawyerman he told me that my mother was to be freed when her young mistress died they never told her for they wanted her to go on working that meant i was really free i was going to be free or die i talked it over with john he was a good man but he was already free why should he run away then one day i heard that i was sold and was going to be shipped south i crept into the woods that night and ran away to freedomalone during the day i hid in the thickets like i heard tell at night i followed the north star i waded through swamps to hide my tracks from bloodhounds some people were kind and helped me but generally i didnt trust any one because id heard how even free negroes sometimes returned slaves to get the reward steps were beginning to lag theres rest ahead well soon be stopping harriet soothed the tired ones as they dragged on and then there it was the form of a house in the darkness harriet went to the door and knocked three times as was her custom no answering squeak of a door swinging open finally a head a white mans head appeared at an upstair window is before she could go on the man shouted down no he isnt he was run out of town last month for helping fugitivesand im staying here to catch the rest the window slammed down now harriet worked fast she hurried her charges across the fields keeping them carefully in a tight little group so that their shadows would not stretch out like tall men could they get away before the white man sounded the alarm they came to a river it looked broad and deep we cross it she ordered the men shrank back the women watched the men no one made a move to start into the water harriet fearful now that the hounds might already be on their trail waded in the water came up to her knees her waist her armpits her neckand then it began to recede seeing this the others followed carrying a baby high over head they were all safely across but wet and cold still there were no baying hounds to be heard but harriet would not allow a fire to be built the smoke might tell them where we are she said so with chattering teeth they sloshed on leaving a telltale trail of water behind them now worn out to fainting one man declared he could not go another step he begged harriet to take them back its better to be slaves than go on like this he pleaded im wore out you know theres no turning back if you go back now youll go to the chaingang for sure theres only one way thats ahead still the man demurred i cant go on im done in harriet was ready when strong measures were needed drawing her gun she said dead niggers tell no tales you go onor die the man stumbled to his feet the little party continued plodding northward one tired foot dragging after the other resting by day and traveling by night they were a little farther north each morning one evening harriet exhausted fell asleep without warning this was a failing of hers since a blow on her head when she was in her teens they looked at her leaning up against a tree fast asleep this was a chance for the disheartened they could take the gun from her pocket they could leave go back but they were far from home now they could not find their way back alone and during these days and nights in which she had cared for them and had told them stories of her past and of other trips their trust in her had increased they waited in a short time harriet awoke looked around and took up the march and the story she was telling where she left off as if nothing had happened she went on to tell them about thomas garrett the good quaker who gave every fugitive that stopped at his house a pair of new shoes as they neared wilmington delaware harriet knew that this time her group was too big to go unchallenged she made them remain hidden while she went for help returning with two men she divided the party into three groups each went in a different direction for two days the groups remained hidden and apart finally they met they were glad to be reunited having come to feel secure together in the early morning several men in an empty wagon crossed the bridge from wilmington to the country as they passed the sentries at the bridge they hailed them and rattled on when they returned that evening their cart was loaded with hay the sentries recognizing the men who had crossed in the morning motioned them on talking and laughing  they clattered across the bridge into town under the hay the fugitives rode into the city after devious ruses the group finally reached the back door of thomas garretts shoe shop at dawn garrett led the fugitives up the back stairs at the head of the stairs was a wall lined with rows of shoe boxes the travelers looked at them greedily remembering harriets tale garrett pulled out one of the boxes but instead of opening it he tucked it under his arm then he said be very quiet for the store is right under here if you are quiet you will be quite safe he put his hand in the hole left by the empty box and the entire wall swung round gaping the group followed harriet as silently the wall swung back into place they were in a large windowless room lighted by a long skylight looking up they saw the blue sky looking around they saw a wash stand some clothing piled high on a chair and blankets neatly folded by the wall wrapping in the blankets they dropped to the floor and no longer worried about pursuers succumbed to their need of rest accustomed by now to awakening with the dusk they were up and had the blankets folded when mrs garrett brought in a huge tray of steaming food this was their first hot meal since leaving maryland as they ate she talked softly with harriet when they were finished she turned to the group try on the clothes she said and helped them find suitable outfits after garrett had closed up shop and the protection of darkness surrounded them he led them down stairs each one was fitted with a pair of new shoes refreshed reclothed and reshod they started out once more but this time it was not the disheartened little band it had been when it entered with new respectability they stepped forth from now on the way was smoother for here the abolitionists quakers and free negroes were ready to help stops were closer conditions were better and often wagon rides made the journey easier still they did not feel safe the fugitive slave law of  made it mandatory for anyone recognizing slaves to return them to reach pennsylvania was no longer enough it was necessary to reach canada before freedom was sure so on through new york to albany and across the state in syracuse they stopped at larin loguens house a free negro and former slave he kept them a few days to rest as he sent word on ahead that the party would be coming in rochester frederick douglass another  well known free negro took over their care finally they crossed the new niagara falls bridge they were free  this reconstructed trip composed of actual happenings gives some measure of the hardships harriet tubman and her followers endured all her trips were like this in two respects the traveling was always done at night and every trip was successful although each trip was unique varying according to circumstances each weighed hope against suffering naturally details and maneuvers changed according to need for each trip had its own emergencies but harriet was able to cope with all the mishaps unfailingly she reached the land of freedom with her little groups she was never caught with her contrabands sometimes if pursuers were hot after the group it might double back on its path taking a train going south no one would suspect southbound slaves of running away in later years harriet used another device even more daring she started out with the masters horse and surrey the fugitives hidden within anyone seeing a slave driving his masters horse would conclude that he was on an errand for his master harriet had many close escapes once she carried two live chickens to distract attention as she entered a village where she had lived suddenly she saw her old master round a corner and come her way quickly she let the chickens go they flew over a fence with the negro woman racing after them the man laughed unaware that he was watching his old slave so she succeeded in avoiding him another time in a railroad station she heard a man standing near her read a description of her to his friend unschooled she opened a book she had praying that she was holding it right one of the men seeing her said this cant be the one the runaway woman cant read harriets early trips took the fugitives to one of the northern states later trips terminated in canada she remained long enough to help them find quarters food and jobs then working until she had enough money saved for the next trip she left to lead another group north to freedom    vs m harriet tubman was born in eastern maryland around  by the time she was sixyearsold she knew the heartache of being separated from her family the backache of working beyond her years and the searing ache of the whip cutting into her flesh she understood the fear of being sold like an animal away from her family and she sensed the cringing hatred of many slaves toward their masters although she had never been inside a schoolroom by the time harriet was  she had learned much to prepare her for later life from old ben her father she learned what roots and berries were edible he showed her how to stalk silently through the woods like an indian and he taught her how to steer a course by the north star harriets weeknight education was gleaned from listening to the negroes gathered about the cabin they told of their african past and of their superstitions they told of remedies they concocted from roots and herbs to bring them back to health they talked of god who was very near to help them in their tribulations but always the talk turned night after night to slave uprisings turners rebellion and to runaway slaves reaching the north and freedom on the underground railroad they would say but nobody seemed to know just what or where this railroad was they mentioned it in reverent whispers as though when the time came god would show them how to find it and when the right time did comeharriet too followed the north star via the underground railroad to freedom she was about  at the time she waded through swamps and crossed streams to hide her trail from the longeared hounds when she learned her next stop from the conductor at each station finally crossing the line to the north which meant freedom harriet looked down at her hands theyre the same black hands but im as free as though they was white reaching philadelphia harriet found work and freedom but she did not find happiness im free but theres nobody to welcome me to freedom here im a stranger up here in this strange place my home and my friends they be in maryland still a plan to remedy this soon formed in her mind she was free others should be free with her and she made her dream come true
during the following years harriet used all her ingenuity her friends in both the north and the south and her money toward one end freeing more of her people over the years in her  trips south she led more than  slaves to the free north every trip was successful she gave counsel and directions to many groups that were responsible enough to start out without her and there is no counting those individuals who gained courage to flee to the north and freedom from hearing stories of her heroic successes each slave arriving in the north meant another crippling blow to slavery every freed slave added another worker to the abolitionist ranks as more and more of her people reached freedom in the north harriet tubman was no longer a stranger in a strange land as tales of her trips on the underground railroad became legend she became known as moses for she was the leader of the exodus of the slaves from the south she was the guide of a slave people to a land of freedom after succeeding magnificently in her efforts harriet was determined to take her parents north but they presented a problem now old they were unable to trek the long miles undaunted harriet went after them she made a makeshift wagon and started out with them reaching a railroad station she put them aboard for wilmington thomas garrett provided money for continuing them on their journey to canada by rail in  john brown wanted harriet general tubman as he called her to join his forces but overwork and exposure had finally caught up with her she was too ill to join him in his uprising at harpers ferry but he became one of her heroes to whom she referred as the emancipator of my people when the civil war broke out harriet offered her services doing any job given her she managed to help her own staying close to the line she directed negroes to security as they came through harriets description of one of the battles is vivid and then we saw the lightning and that was the guns and then we heard the thunder and that was the big guns and then we heard the rain falling and that was the drops of blood falling and when we came to get in the crops it was dead men that we reaped she worked with her people in war hospitals the conditions were terrible as she describes them id go to the hospital every morning id get a big chunk of ice and put it in a basin and fill it with water then id take a sponge and begin first man id come to id thrash away the flies and theyd rise like bees around a hive then id begin to bathe the wounds and by the time id bathed off three of four the fire and heat would have melted the ice and made the water warm and itd be as red as clear blood then id go and get some more ice and by the time i got to the next one the flies would be around the first ones black and thick as ever  after working in the hospital all day harriet spent part of the night baking pies and gingerbread and making a keg of root beer to sell in the camps in this way she provided for her meagre needs until  then colonel montgomery enlisted harriets services as a spy in the south as a negro woman she could wedge her way into places that a white man could not enter without suspicion her courage and cunning always brought her back safely following a plan resulting from one of her spying missions she went up the combachee river in south carolina with colonel montgomery and about  negro troops in three gunboats as they appeared the confederate troops withdrew from the shore putting off a few soldiers along the way they soon spread word that lincolns gunboats were coming to free the slaves the slaves came down to the river in droves hayforks still in their hands women carrying babies and food some leading animals their owners threats and whippings could not stop them the rowboats were soon loaded but by making several trips at each point all were taken aboard the gunboats on one of harriets missions the commonwealth a boston newspaper on july   says colonel montgomery and his gallant band of  black soldiers under the guidance of a black woman dashed into the enemys country    many and many times she has penetrated the enemys lines and discovered their situation and condition and escaped without injury but not without extreme hazard harriet was becoming a legend some said that she was a man who could see in the dark like a cat some said that she could fly over rivers and see into enemy territory like a bird some claimed that she had a way with animals so that no bloodhound would trace her nor any watchdog give warning of her presence 
when on january   lincoln proclaimed the negroes free the union had to assume responsibility for keeping order among them for supplying them with provisions for caring for them northern dogooders offered their services for rehabilitating the negroes although they knew very little about them harriet acted as liaison between these northern forces and the negroes suddenly bewildered by their freedom harriet tubman had been promised a soldiers wage the pay of negro soldiers had been cut in half but she decided to take hers and to return to her parents in the north for she was worried about them she found she was unable to collect her wages for serving as a war nurse harriet did however receive a halffare travel pass but when she used it the conductor cursing threw her into the baggage car in the doing he seriously wrenched her arm and shoulder tired and sick with aching arm the fearless fighter traveled north as baggage it was one of the inconsistencies of the war that after serving throughout the conflict without mishap that on her way home she should experience her only war injury and with it suffer an ordeal that proved to her that the negro was still not truly free      on this return trip harriet anticipated making a home for her aged parents in auburn new york where through the help of secretary of state seward she had acquired a little place she hoped once more to work outofdoors in a garden it was well that she enjoyed this kind of labor for soon her home became a stopping place for the distressed shortly she was raising food and money to care for the helpless and ill who remained with her for she would not turn a needy person away as fast as she got money she spent it on others she could see no purpose in saving when others needed what her money could buy as a result she was always in need influential friends appealed to the pension committee in washington on her behalf but even her friend seward could not get the committee to vote funds for this deserving heroine who had served her country so faithfully every time the matter came up it was shelved until it took on proportions of a government scandal in  john tubman harriets husband who could not go north with her who had taken another woman as his wife two months after harriet ran away was murdered so when nelson davis arrived at her home ill with tuberculosis she married him the better to care for him in  he died harriet was again alone but now as the wife of a war veteran she was pensioned at first her pension was eight dollars a month since she was by now well known newspaper articles took up the pension matter finally the government acceded to popular demand and harriet was granted  a month for the rest of her life in her later years she turned her attention to getting a hospitalhome for those of her race looking for a suitable location she attended an  auction for a plot of ground near her home in auburn she describes herself at that auction there i was like a blackberry in a pail of milk she finally managed to pay for this land and to build the hospitalhome she had dreamed of but a few years after her death it closed its doors her energy and enthusiasm alone had kept it running she willed the home to the ame zion church the house has been repaired and is now being used as a manse for the church but one room has been set aside as a memorial museum to the worlds greatest heroine of personal freedom  when harriet tubman died in auburn n y on march   she was tendered a military funeral now that she was gone the citizens of the city recognized that an unsung hero of the civil war and the moses of a people had been one of their neighbors as a memorial july   was set aside as harriet tubman day in auburn a memorial service was held a plaque was set up in her honor at the entrance to the court house and flags were lowered to halfmast for this black woman in a city of whites 
the great trees bloomed red saffron purple and gold as late fall lingered sad and splendid on old screamer mountain at clayton georgia and lillian smith anal yst artist and prophet of the south beheld the last bright blaze of the ebbing year restive in the benign embrace of old screamers gentle peaks miss smith peoplehungry in her hilltop isolation and illness nevertheless was ablaze too with work study ideas and her apparent triumph over her sixth cancer she talked with love solemn thought and a lot of bite of herself and her work of mankinds grand advance through the aeons of this piddling present person or that one  of southern sins and northern complacency of teensyweensy writing by deep narrow talents of mens hostility toward serious women andwith most faith and fascinationof this crucial time in the history of humans when we are so close together as thinking beings that our intellects push and polish each other into new brilliance to light gods destiny for mental man at sixtysix miss smithwhose strange fruit shocked north and south and was read around the world in  and ever since whose profound and audacious analysis of dixie killers of the dream became a classic and whose one hour was received indifferently because it was about decent upperclass cultivated southerners the northern critics dont know about and dont want to believe inwell now miss smith who never did want to write about race but just about people has decided she wont talk about civil_rights any more unless it is a matter of duty and housekeeping she explained that all her life as the middle daughter of a large welltodo highminded southern family has been shared between mary the creative one the artist and martha who tends the house and cleans up the mess often the two have merged in the demands of conscience and art and have fed one another so marthas chores helping her father after a depression business failure with a girls camp at their summer home in clayton speaking and writing for important causes nursing her mother in her last four years of illness ministering to this troubled brother sister or friendprovided experience and perception for mary miss smith considers perhaps  twenty per cent of her output of countless magazine stories pamphlets seven books innumerable lectures tv and radio discussions and talks with needful groupsto be martha work such is now is the time a simple and vivid little tract as she terms it calling on white southerners after  to meet the racial change with love and justice a book she feels was smothered by publishers subject to angry pressure her new book  pages of monologues accompanying photographs of the negro direct action movement our faces our words w w norton  written in dire illness after a precarious pneumonia may be called martha work she thinks but there is high artistry in miss smiths penetration of the aims sorrows and heroisms of black and white boys and girls pushing and enduring the movement and in her idiomatic and poetic expression of their feelings and thoughts this little book may be the truest picture of these nonviolent young revolutionaries to come out of the fearful spate of good and bad writing about the negro revolt miss smith talked fiercely and carefully and often laughing in the huge pine living room of her cabin house once a part of the girls camp laurel falls with its window wall open to the double mountain ridge and blue skya wildly gorgeous invasion of the spacious comfort and taste of the big room which a lesser woman might not sustain without draw draperies but miss smith slight and vivid in black pants and a figured shirt her strong fair face ravaged by pain and thought and crowned with a shimmering cloud of softly curling white hair her big dark eyes intense looked a valiant and vigorous match for old screamer mountain and his wild autumn she reminded me also that in her twelveyear war with cancer she always looks her luminous best under death sentence ill look lovely in my coffin she promised happily im somewhat naturally an optimist she mused thats not to say i dont see evil ive always seen evil since i was three years old and i continue to see it everywhere but ive always been positive in my feelings almost in my bloodstream that good is stronger my optimism about the world and human experience has not always been intellectually understood though i just felt it the book which has influenced me more than any other book on the face of the earth is tielhard de chardins the phenomenon of  man this great paleontologist a jesuit priest believed that we can think of man in no other way than in sweeping spans of time and when i read himhe is hard i grub away at himi knew why the cynics from beatsville to sartre and existentialism were wrong because they were thinking of mans experience in time spans of maybe a thousand years when it seemed to me one must think of man in times of  or half a million years chardin sees mans purpose the purpose of it allas achieving more and more complex forms of life and more quality this is what evolution is and since it is chardin believes that man was planned by the great creator finally man appeared and then a certain point was reached in this purposeful evolution when man began to think man began to participate in his own evolution man grows in his mind julian huxley is a great optimist and a stronger mind than aldous he says we must not look at one hundred years nor twenty thousand or fifty thousand years because the movement toward purpose is so slow miss smith paused and smiled relishing the huxley minds and then went on her whole person inclining persuasively with her talk her fine small hands cupping ideas and qualifications and her face smiling wondering and frowning dramatizing her sentences what has been done in the last one hundred years is the most critical point she pronounced in grave excitement change always comes in evolution the first time people get very close together and the human temperature has gone way up there is great heat in our proximity our crowding together and this is the heat that transforms us i wrote in the revived killers of the dream that man is evolving and participating in his own evolution now that he has a mind and that it is increasing rapidly in brilliance as it is pushed and polished by other minds this coming together acceleration and proliferation of thought this great change that is upon us is one reason for our tremendous anxiety today of course anxiety comes along with thought and great questions and enormous change it explains the goldwater people they realize we are at a critical point and they cant understand it so theyre using race and segregation as a dead end in which to crawl and stay out of the troubling future she talked of tired and troubled young personalities in the negro movement battered from the suffering and courage it demands in the resistant south some of whom come by to see me kids from the north and california and of more than one white southern activist whom miss lil and her friend paula snelling have entertained and mothered in the restoring haven of beautiful hills good food civilized comfort and searching talk this one poor little thing has more trouble than the movement another one has literary talent a lot of them political confusion and another one a firstrate mind real quality there are others former campers and proteges at camp laurel falls who come back for introspection talk and miss lils examination of their troubles until i sometimes think ill have to hang out a shingle and bill them for psychoanalysis miss smith made a face of distaste for the appraisal of her as that earnest little old lady up on the mountain who wants the negroes to have everything for the negroes and the witless tribe of readers and critics who stereotype her as a race writer and dont appreciate what she considers her best work she recalled her first awakening to the ugliness of color as a girl teaching music in china where white missionaries and british colonialists barred chinese from parks swimming pools and clubs she realized it was the same as the southern thing in china my brain woke up i knew the trouble was worldwide and ive never thought otherwise i never talk about civil_rights if i can help it thats housekeeping cleaning up the mess im interested in the whole thing the meaning of the whole thing that this massive defense of segregation of inhuman experience is a symptom of our dehumanization almost total dehumanization looking back on her work she made her own appraisals literary people dont like me very much she observed scientists philosophers painters people of the theater do like me in the last few years ive been so very ill with long hours of reflecting ive reread my books and evaluated them from my own point of view i would not change a word maybe in strange fruit my fumbling beginning and poorest novel  might add two or three more chapters in the center because i left out a southerner of subtlety and with a complex grasp of the south which no character in the book really had laura the artist and sister of the troubled boy could have represented this southerner but it was my flrst novel and i didnt have the technique to let her into it without becoming awkwardly philosophical then this great weakness keeps strange fruit from being great it is my most famous novel but one hour is my best i think strange fruit was the first book in the united states which treated negroes as human beings she remembers with satisfaction  the originality and distinction of south today which she and miss snelling published from clayton from  to  started as a journal strictly of literature and arts with no remote notion of discussing race at all the little magazine did however publish stories articles and poetry by southerners of both races range audaciously into race and politics and got up to a circulation of  despite troubles with a friendly but horrified printer whose conscience on one occasion would not let him print a race piece and some post office censorship in atlanta which was resolved in washington and i just couldnt take georgia that year she remembered shaking her shining white head to wake up every morning to insults in the newspapers friends falling away and people turning their faces when i passed then we really knew who our friends were and there were some great ones newspaper comments on the author of strange fruit included one atlanta columnists description of the novel as an orgasm and anothers appraisal of the novelist as a sexobsessed old woman who he suggested could not attract white men and settled for negro men and in the curious southern way while miss smith was and is a favorite and favored citizen of the little town of clayton she has had three vigilante fires on her mountaintop and some property and uncounted letters manuscripts and book notes have disappeared while friends fell away and newspapers and preachers tore to pieces my reputation as a woman welltodo parents of laurel falls campers rallied handsomely only four parents withdrew their daughters and forty others applied for the vacancies and no one tried officially to ban the novel or killers of the dream in the south they just squeezed them out or smothered them at any rate she lived between brooklyn and clayton for six years of celebrity travel work and friendship with some of the top minds in the country she objects to readers calling killers of the dream a freudian interpretation of the south im a great admirer of freud a great mind the greatest of all in his field who opened the gate and explored the heart she said some of his disciples could go beyond him because he made the great beginning he failed i think on the collective unconscious and jung did things freud never got to freud was an intellectual as against jung who was more of an artist intuitively grasping truths that were lost on freud freud used reason i dont genuflect easily but i do here so that i hate to point out the gaps in his great accomplishment killers of the dream is my knowledge and understanding and interpretation of the south the way i lived and studied and experienced and know the south to be if it happened to coincide with some of freuds theories well so it did miss smith mused over current letters now and then in smiling joy and here and there in fierce distaste or weary disapproval criticism today is at a very low point everybody agrees to that no critics today actually love books rather they want to fight writers and peopleto praise or damn them personally we have a disease called faulknerism there is no future in faulkners books he never wrote about his equals he has created no decent women he loathes females and it shows in his work camus is great i dont think sartre is except in his plays and melodramas i dont like anybody really who leaves the future out of his writing were stepping into an enormous future and any great writer must have a vision of that future i dont know a single negro writer who can write about white people they dont understand them neither hate nor fear gives understanding only love does but white people have written truly of negroes because they loved them respected them and believed in them as persons thats the greatest trouble the negro artist has today his feelings against white people make it impossible to create a white character real and whole thirty years ago white writers had the same trouble and wrote of negroes only in stereotypes any valid literary creation takes love i always loved truman capote he always writes with love imagination and delicacy carson mccullers is a beautiful small talent just beautiful nobody writes better of certain aspects of life in perfectly pure memory of childhood i really dont enjoy any american literary writers very much our literary world is not very intellectual oh they have all done nice things you can relish i like european writersthev have an intellectual content we and some of the europens too are still talking about the things dostoevski talked about in  were a brainless lot im not still talking in  though not still one hundred years behind in thinking and perhaps that is why my writing is more recognized by scientists and intellectual people than by literary people miss smith sternly dissents from the current liberal notion that in race prejudice and negro disadvantage the north and the south are the same the difference in the north and south is the difference between a neurosis and a psychosis she said were sick people racism has made us sick at every level of our culture we kill and they dont in the north its a matter of blindness prejudice and indifference you can be merely prejudiced with out killing people but in the south we kill them then in the south not one of us has escaped in the north millions have you can live there all your life and never see harlem it wont hurt you youre not responsible for it any more than you are for china but we cant get away from it in the south many of us have tried to but every time you walk out your door there are the signs the walls the inhuman dehumanizing separation to manipulate you i could cry when i think how white children have suffered from this the north has a tremendous urban problem complicated by race but we sent the negroes up north we drove them up there the north didnt write letters of invitation asking for them now our people whom we drove away are metamorphosed into victims of the ghetto poverty crime  and enough problems to beat us all to death where the north was disturbed in its own psychic organization showed in yankee willingness to be foreign missionaries to us instead of home missionaries to their own black ghettos blaming the south shaking off their own responsibility on the south this maimed the personalities of most northeners with false moral complacency regarding southern community after community desegregating for peace for profit for law and order for business as usual miss smith still thinks the south may lead the way for the nation to racial justice and amity but first she declared solemnly we must humbly confess our sins and ask forgiveness we must suffer more than we havenot because were the southbut to deny old ways and come to right and wisdom how each individual must do it newspapers must acknowledge and espouse the brave truth preachers must preach it in church teachers must teach it in school now were not doing that at all were just sweeping the truth under the rug and not acknowledging our brutal sins and asking forgiveness and our sins are terrible we must face them were moving beautifully she said with a quick bright smile lighting up her face like a girls of course in atlanta you open up everything and never think about why you closed up everything in the first place you must confess your sins and ask forgiveness well never move out of our trouble without this moral act she protested that dangerous writer ayn rand who has the strongest following of any writer in the united states with the dictum anybody who says he can live his own life and be responsible to nobody else is a wicked fool we dont have to be dependent nor can we be independent we must be lovingly and respectfully interdependent the very elegance of the human race is in the love and concern which every member of it always felt for someone else if we do not have this then we have lost our minds and have become evil theres always much talk about the south thats because its a state of mind of white supremacy but my dear always remember that theres a male and female south which are two different entities then theres a black south and a white south which are two more cleavages that makes four souths the south has usually meant the male white south it does not need to mean that any more and indeed it doesnt it is clear that miss smith knows we shall overcome from mccomb mississippi to harlem and stanleyville and shanghai and it is clear that we means gods good thinking human beings 
under some peculiar quota system it seems that the american public can entertain or lionize only one negro writer at a time thus the price we pay for the justifiable audience granted james baldwin is the unwarranted neglect of richard wright this is a pity because though they have much in common there is much that holds them apart for one thing as evidenced by his recent novel and play baldwin is not at his artistic best when trying in fictional form to make those objective quasiinstructional statements which his social awareness impels him to make he writes directly from his emotions and their expression is the key to what is best in his writing whereas in wright perhaps more than in any other writer of our time except george orwell the combination of involvement and detachment is exactly right to seek out meaning without the tone either of facile preaching or of jeremiad and rather than burdening their fiction it was with both wright and orwell just this seeking that gave life and drama to their novels in any case baldwin and wright are in no way interchangeable a fact that would be too obvious to mention if they were not negroes and therefore to a great part of the public mind indistinguishable aside from their talents they have mainly in common their anger but again they are negroes and writers and this is not an exceptional quality for either american literature has had after all a long train of angry writersone has only to name dreiser or farrell or fast and the negro has just gotten on the end of the train it has taken him a long time to get on board and he has done so at a time when so many of the formerly angry seem to have assuaged their wrath and to have departed for the suburbs where adultery has become the only irritant to their artistic sensibilities it is very important to relate richard wright to this american tradition of angry literature for it is this allegiance that prevents him from being just another negro writer after wright it is probably no longer possible to be just a negro writer he was an american writer it is this distinction that makes wright so important and this that creates such bias in assessing him though he could not avoid an intensely racial awareness he had escaped from the parochial viewpoint it is only a few decades from the major jewish migrations to ludwig lewisohn it is eighty years from the irish migrations to james t farrell but it is over two centuries from the great slave importations to richard wright three centuries from phyllis wheatley the cultured boston slave girl writing dainty english lyrics to the first writer whose consciousness was acutely negro and acutely american if richard wright had written only uncle toms children those four novellas with which he first attracted critical attention his place would have been clear and assured he would have been the outstanding negro writer of his time avidly read by a wide negro audience sympathetically read by those white americans who could be touched by the plight of their negro fellow citizens who could at least respond humanly to pathos as wright confessed he had written stories to make an audience even bankers daughters  cry the image he had evoked had as his title indicated been handed down from uncle toms cabin and was the image of the negro maintained by every writer black or white from douglass to fast intent upon creating a favorable impression negroes were goodhearted generous wellmeaning people pathetically suppressed by southern bigotry wrights triumph as an artist was his singleminded determination to get at the truth behind this stereotype as clearly as any other this image was no more complete than the bigots stereotype was in fact compatible with it for if the good darkies were still just that after decades of persecution if they thrived on it wasnt it after all the way to handle them and behind both stereotypes lay the truth that centuries of the souths peculiar institution did more than suppress a people it corrupted them and that corruption was an irresponsible rampant dangerous thing that could destroy corrupted and corrupter alike so wright said of his first novel native son that he was writing a book so hard and deep that they would have to face it without the consolation of tears the hero bigger is a youthful criminal with no ambition except a wistful desire to be an airline pilot and no respect for home family church law or life either black or white perhaps not even his own he accidentally kills the first white woman who has ever treated him humanly but he had already been contemplating raping her he then mutilates and burns the body and tries to collect ransom from the girls father his kindly employer finally he kills his girl friend when the murder is discovered to prevent her giving him away bigger was a bitter draught for those whom uncle toms children had made lachrymose it is doubtful that any white person has ever been moved to pity bigger it is almost impossible to condescend to him that way nor did bigger sit well with those negroes who preferred white america to think black america was still content with offhanded paternalism and willing to go slow toward equality wasnt wright giving fuel to those who said the negro must be kept in his place and those to whom go slow meant at least a millenium had they read native son would not have been able to neglect bigger either they would have found him too like the demon which their paternalistic code  of casual cruelty of brutal kindness of genial despotism had tried to appease and subjugate for them to read with any satisfaction wrights indictment of them for having created by that code a subnation of  million biggers within the borders of the united states it was one of the constant ironies of richard wrights career that having created what must certainly be the least likeable negro protagonist in our literature he was thereafter continually assailed with charges of negro chauvinism and racial bitterness that were never raised against his first book certainly there is bitterness but it seems called for and firmly grounded in the artistic frame of the novel the charge of chauvinism seems dubious there are in all of wrights novels white men of genuine goodwill whom wright does not belittle for their inability to effect a solution what was offensive was simply the truth it had taken three centuries for someone to look in both directions across that boundary line between races and tell the truth about what he saw and the negro was as hesitant to acknowledge what wright said as was the white man because he had given away the negros most guarded secret the secret he kept because he was afraid of reprisal and which the whites would never try to uncover because their total rationalization of the negros place in american society was constructed to deny it that the black man could hate his white neighbor could envy him and was capable of wishingperhaps carrying outhis destruction multiply bigger thomas twelve million times    and you have the psychology of the negro people    let us not concern ourselves with the part of bigger thomas confession that says he murdered accidentally    who knows when another accident involving millions of men will happen an accident that will be the dreadful day of our doom asks biggers white lawyer and the authors mouthpiece out of his anger wright was always raising this cry this warning which those who did not want to hear dismissed as a biased threat bigger is within each and every negro thus his last book before his death was titled white man listenhis last strident warning which those who preferred obsequiousness to truth took for a threat not to white america alone but to the white race to avoid tragic blindness in dealing with the new nonwhite powers of africa and asia  after native son over a decade passed before richard wright published his second novel the outsider by this time wright had been living in paris for a few years and to the criticisms of the earlier novel was added the charge that he was out of touch with america actually the reviews of the outsider in the liberal white press show merely how out of touch white america was how stubbornly the import of what wright had been shouting was being ignored the outsider is not a good book although with all his fiction it shares that excitement that electrifying realism of sensation and violence which is his trademark as surely at it is dashiell hammetts to whom wright has acknowledged a debt the plot is far from simple cross damon its hero is a postal employee with a tiresome wife and a pregnant mistress through mistaken identification with a body in a subway crash he is thought dead takes another identity kills a former buddy when he is about to be discovered joins the communist party and manipulates its leaders for his own ends finally killing two of its leaders out of disgust and is ultimately trapped by a brilliant detective who is like cross an outsider it is melodramatic and strung on a series of implausible coincidences it is his one book where the intellectual rhetoric existential does not cohere to the action but these serious technical flaws aside the reviewers also found its protagonist unmotivated by  they were sophisticated enough to understand bigger a poor abused slum negro a stunted brute who hardly knew what he was doing but cross damon is a highly intelligent and educated man a reader of innumerable books a man who has been to a university why should he walk out on everything live by violence disavow all moral rules a man today who believes that he cannot live by the articles of faith of his society is a criminal    damon declares it is not necessary to follow the trappings of existentialist dogma that wright invokes fo realize that the negro is by this definition a criminal he has only to realize and accept it to be an outsider clearly because cross is a negro even the reviewers saw that the rules did not apply that is why they cannot see the motivation for dissatisfaction in this brilliant man with his post office job government security and potential retirement in thirty years what more could a negro want there is an implied and subtle barrier to equality of opportunity for cross which is as impenetrable and unavoidable as that in wrights autobiographical account of being forced out of a job because he expressed interest in learning an operation which was white mans work the articles of faith of his society do not necessarily apply to him this has of course been the fate in variable degree of every persecuted minority group in america but the negro has more than any other group been defenseless to its stigma unlike the other major groups only the negro has had no distinctive subcultural values toward which he could proudly turn and snub the larger society coming as captured individuals moved about as chattel having frequently no common language but that of the slavemaster no common religion but that of the slavemaster having no communal existence that was not subject to the slavemaster the negro could not possibly either have imported or created a distinctive subculture he could only adopt the forms he saw about him negro culture is a shadow of the total culture as no other american subculture is and being such its major distinction is its inferiority negro culture is a poor substitute for a fully integrated culture of black and white and exists because by its own standards its members are inferior thus the negro who cannot live by the articles of faith in the larger society must reject also his racial society and exist as an unrelated individual a criminal an outsider the district attorney who traps damon is an intellectual and a hunchback a freak in a manner analogous to that in which the ne gro is a freak in american society and he is therefore quicker to sense damons individuality damon is not able as he has been before to conceal himself behind the negro stereotype to become invisible as a person his disgust and hatred of the society that excludes him are in the open when in white man listen wright tells of the negro who accused him of giving away racial secrets by discussing negro and african psychological attitudes with a white man he is again revealing that selfsame secret that covert hatred it is what the reviewers found unmotivated about cross damon wright gives in his autobiography a terrifying account of a real variant of this type in the person of the elevator operator who short of money refused to take a white passenger to his floor until he paid a quarter for which the white man could have the privilege of kicking him he is a criminal as much as cross though he has foregone his pride to objectify his position in society and as clearly as cross out of his masochism he is making the white man pay for the punishment he inflicts the long dream was wrights last full length novel and like its predecessor it was held up as evidence of his estrangement from the american scene and yet in this chronicle of a negro boy growing up in the american south wright had written the finest and fullest exposition of the corruption of sec ond class citizenship since his autobiography useless to say as of bigger that he was only one brutalized individual caught in an hostile environment useless to exclude cross damon as a faulty abstraction in a world of coincidences the world of fishbelly the hero of the long dream is very real and fishbelly is very normal and his southern society is very real and very normal and very familiar only that reality is corrupt and that corruption is so normal to it that almost no one can consider changing it it is a society where a black mans respectability must be founded on illegal enterprise because legal enterprise would bring him into forbidden competition with whites it is a society where the local government accepts rakeoffs from the illegal enterprise and still can demand servility from the owner because he is black it is a world corrupt enough to reduce any man of goodwill to bewilderment or to cynicism thus the one white man of authority who is sincerely concerned with justice without prejudice is totally baffled and repulsed by the corrupt complex of black and white by the seemingly innate suspicion and dissembling of the negro victims he is trying to help through fear and habit they cannot escape assuming the traditional postures of stereotypes in which they can conceal their defiant hatred at the end of this novel fishbelly now a grown man is in the  path of his creator on a plane bound for france wrights conclusion is clear and unequivocal it is not possible for a negro to live as a citizen in this country in the year  there was still visibly andmore terribly imbedded in the heartinvisibly the poisonous blight of second class citizenship criminals or exiles this was the choice wright offered the american negro a lot had happened to america and to the negro in particular in the two decades during which wright published the three novels his autobiography and five other books four of them concerned with the black mans burden and yet so little of it is really mirrored in the successive novels it appears only by innuendo bigger is a slum negro with little education cross a lowermiddle class renegade intellectual and fishbelly totally middleclass in outlook for the first two there is no escape no exit except death fishbelly looks forward to a pleasant exile it is progress but it is not very much progress and yet the long dream was published in  four years after the supreme court had handed down the school desegregation decision two years after the montgomery bus boycott a year after u s troops had enforced the enrollment of negro students in little rocks central high school nowhere does wright show a cognizance of this march of events the increasing legal economic and moral pressure for equality was wright out of touch after all no wright never lost touch with the one crucial truth that continued to concern him the truth which to him is central to an understanding of the racial dialogue and which the white man must heed at whatever cost to his selfimage which the negro must confess at whatever cost to his the existence of bigger for as wright said there are more biggers than i could count and more than you suspect wright had already stated in  million black voices the aspirations of the american negro as tersely as they could possibly be stated we want what others have the right to share in the upward march of american life the only life we remember or have ever known    men are moving and we shall be with them    bigger said wright was trying to react to and answer the call of the dominant civilization    he was an american because he was a native son but he was also a negro nationalist in a vague sense because he was not allowed to live as an american bigger then is not just the hero of wrights first novel but his spirit animates the protagonists of the other two and is the subject of the shorter fiction and the nonfiction dealing with whitenonwhite relations bigger is that quality which will not be at rest until the term negro american is no more selfcontradictory no more expressive of inner conflict and tension than englishamerican irishamerican or at the very least jewishamerican and for bigger this country has indeed shown very small progress legal equality the equality of a black man to a white man in their confrontations with private or public institutions which is now dragging fitfully toward some degree of general implementation has been implicitly resident in the constitution since the end of the civil war legal resources however cannot legislate first class citizenship the news pictures of huddled small groups of negro children separated from their white classmates by more than mere distance in tokenintegrated schools tells the story all too clearly first class citizenship is fully integrated citizenship is social equality is social integration this is the call to which bigger and cross and fishbelly respond it is the call to which wright urges the white man to listen for if the negro is beyond the pale of american society if he cannot become equal in the eyes of his fellow man its laws can never serve him equally if he can never be wholly american he must find a new nationality a black nationality and the rising world stature of asia and africa in the eyes of the west has encouraged such identification certainly with the pacifist social movements popularly associated with the name of martin_luther_king jr american negroes had at last passed not as criminal  individuals but as a conscious moral group outside of american society finding in gandhian nonviolence a frame of reference to which they could commit themselves without accepting implicit inferiority and yet they had as their goal nothing more than becoming more fully american in white man listen wright ponders why the american negro is so little rebellious and concludes that he is too committed to american values even to rebel that he has to his country a negative loyalty that is a loyalty that works against him but it must be or should be becoming increasingly clear that every rejection in the attempt to move toward full american citizenship is a thrust toward negro nationalism one of the most remarkable features of the negro revolution is the rate at which the center of the movement is becoming alienated from the traditional american modes thus the naacps roy wilkins has yielded the center to rev king who five years ago was regarded by most as an ultraextremist and due in part to the emergence of the black muslims and in particular the militant followers of malcolm_x the center has now moved toward james farmer of core where the tone of protest has sharpened from prayerful remonstrance to a form of aggressively nonviolent terrorism if these are met by further frustrations there seems only two remaining positions neither of them really tenable the first is violent terrorism which practiced by a minority and one comparatively unarmed could only call forth painful repression the other is total nationalism the solution of malcolm_x and the fact that its proposal is totally unacceptable to white america is the ultimate irony of americas racial history for malcolm_x has urged not integration but segregation on a separate but equal basis what has frightened the country in this proposal then is simply that they realize he is as sincerely determined about the equality as about the separation and this includes the equal right to vote to bear arms and to defend oneself what is frightening about this is not that malcolm_x is a reckless or irresponsible man despite an unpleasant candor in expressing his hatred he has neither done nor threatened any specific acts of hostility and has refused to condemn those of others only as a way of saying that given the circumstances the outbreaks were to be expectedbut that given the proposition that a negro will defend his rights with arms if provoked the use of those arms becomes inevitable for this reason because there are fewer and fewer valid positions left for the negro revolution to take it is beginning to takeas in the core rupture with the national organization which took place this spring in new york nonviolent terrorist actions on an increasingly broad range and under less inspired or responsible leadership like the elevator operator the movement will accept suffering not necessarily directed toward any more specific ends than those of critically discomforting white america this was the meaning of the abortive threat of a worlds fair stallin last year and of course it is the meaning of the riots in the northern ghettos which are not so much against overt police brutality as against the covert white brutality that has created this ironic confrontation that is that the only white man with whom these people have any continuous direct encounters at all is the policeman the riots were not deliberately fomented by black nationalists but had there been no philosophy of black nationalism at hand it would have been generated on the spot because during the riots there was only one way the rioters could regard themselves as a subject nation fighting an oppressor they were no longer americans america did not include them it merely ruled them this is why no matter how conservative his politics the negro continues to show a mischievous satisfaction at the intransigence of countries such as red china egypt and cuba or for that matter at the intransigence of an adam clayton powell who aside from the resentment he engenders in his white political colleagues has little to recommend him to his constituency the cynicismand it is not innocencewith which powell is continually returned to congress is the cynicism of despair of those who have no hope of redress from the government and with this as wright noted in the negros admiration of imperial japan before the war comes the desire of bigger to see the white man particularly the american white man embarrassed and humbled before the dark people of the world this is the legacy of slavery carefully preserved by decades of second class citizenship the voice of bigger then is a voice which must be stilled and must if america is to honor its moral commitments be stilled by the undercutting of its justification for this voice of nationalism is a voice of desperation a voice calling to color because the cry to countrymen has fallen on deaf ears if it is not stilled it must seek exile either the private exile of fishbelly or for those who cannot follow him the exile of a nation in sullen and restless bondageblack nation of malcom x
it is not a new argument the debate over  the role of the writer  iin relation to society dbm and his art has raged for generations and there is no indication that it soon will abate certainly in troubled and dangerous times such as ours there will be disagreement over the role of the writer there are those who hold that it is the writers duty to confine his energies to the creation of a work of art for only through such a creation can he justify his existence and also enlarge the worlds vision and there are those who while agreeing essentially with this view of the writers task see the writer as being uniquely suited to illuminate for his time those values which give dignity and depth to human life and which constantly must be defended against assault in this era of the negro revolt certain negro writers have been criticized for their silence on the other hand many critics and some negro writers have made terrible charges against other negro writers accusing them of riding to fame and fortune on the wings of militance writers like frank yerby a resident of spain have been cited as examples of one position and james baldwin who returned from french exile to add violent fuel to the bursting fires of negro discontent is held up as a brilliant example of the opposite viewpoint the argument goes on increasing in its intensity to help the readerand young writerto understand both sides of the controversy negro digest invited some  writers famous and relatively unknown black and white to state what they feel is the task of the negro writer as artist on the following pages the writers speak
lerone bennett jr
an artist in the situation of a negro ie a situation of oppression and injustice in a segregated society which questions the humanity of all negroes whether they peel potatoes or write poems has special responsibilities and special tasks his first task i believe is to break through to authenticity as a man to hack his way through the dense undergrowth of myths which hide him from himself what is involved here is a perilous search for identity which is not by any means the same for negro artists and white artists in order for a negro artist to reach authenticity he must place himself on trial before the whole of western civilization which he is in but not of to undergo this trial in anguish and in joy to go to the end of himself in order to find the beginning of himself to go to the frontiers of man and to become a new frontier as a man and as an artist to make a new beginning and to project new endings to transcend the lies of power and to judge men by human and not by white standards to come to terms with himself and his history to accept himself to accept the color of his skin and the ambiguity and tension of his experience to see with his own eyes and to hear with his own ears and to find new language and new forms to express what he sees and hears to see negro experience within a wider context to relate that experience to the great human themes of liberation and oppression struggle and growth victory and defeat to express himself directly openly honestly and if necessary brutally without a prior check with the white other to emancipate himself from the limitations of the white culture structure and the subtle tyranny of white audiences to stand face to face with life as a man black and comely these i believe are the tasks of the negro artist beyond all that i believe it is incumbent on negro artists to involve themselves in the struggle for the liberation of man artists who inhabit a heaven called art high above harlem and white plains are deceiving themselves by their silences which echo as loudly as their words they are playing a social role serving despite themselves the interests and needs of their oppressors in sum i believe negro artists should cling to the french literary concept of engagementfor the simple fact is that the negro is born engaged and he lies as an artist and as a man if he believes he can disengage himself by adding the word artist to the word negro 
arna bontemps
though writers are traditionally at loggerheads with their society they seldom escape its pressures and this becomes doubly apparent in the case of the negro writer in the united states as long as the society itself remains segregated in any significant areas the inner world of the writer whether negro or white for that matteris likely to reflect this condition and the selfexpression of the negro is likely to seem somewhat different however i do not think we need to worry about such difference i dont think it will necessarily be bad it may sometimes be a blessing nothing in the creative process is more important than being ones self 
john henrik clarke
the negro writer and his people are now standing at the crossroads of history this is the negro writers special vantage point and this is what makes the task and the mission of the negro writer distinctly different from that of the white writer the negro writer concerned with creating a work of art in a segregated society has a double task first he has to explain the society to himself and create his art while opposing it second he cannot be honest to himself or his people without lending his support at least verbally to the making of a new society that respects the dignity of men the negro writer must realize that his people are now entering the last phase of a transitional period between slavery and freedom it is time for the negro writer to draw upon the universal values in the negros experience just as sean ocasey and sholem aleichem drew upon the universal values in the experiences of the irish and the jews in the next phase of negro writing a literature of celebration must be creatednot a celebration of oppressionbut a celebration of survival in spite of it
nathan hare 
the negro writer should be i think a bit more of a rebel since he and his race have  more at stake he ought to tackle the very foundations of the society that tramples him and set fire to the false notions that bind in one way or another both negroes and whites some negro writers seek safety in an artforartssake approach they have got the idea from whites that protest is not art and that a negro writer who is a negro first last and always whether he wants to admit it or not should be a writer first and a negro second part of the negro writers job then is to help shape the thinking of negroes themselves to goad them to keener indignation all of this however should reach beyond the bounds of narrow protest against discrimination and aim toward a general revamping of a morally decadent society
zack gilbert
the negro writer should maintain his individuality his honesty and above all develop his craft and artistic skills without art i i the protest is lost the message unimportant if the message can be put over without surrendering the art good gwendolyn brooks has many times so beautifully accomplished this in her poetry as baldwin has done with the essay and killens with the novel therefore it is up to the young negro writer to voice these things of substance with the highest literary skills possible the white writer however is not exempted because of his broader liberties he has the same obligations to deliver a work of depth and purpose to a sick and controversial society
conrad kent rivers
the negro writer is his worst enemy we have seen one or two survive the anger of their prose his task is to stomach his individual experience and personal history no matter how much it hurts inside if he can manage this feat then there is nothing left for him to do except to master his craft and to tell the story according to the character of his personal history this is a deathgiving universe time is short i think it takes a full life to weave a full story any writer white or black must be read on more than one level i do not believe that life has a special meaning for any particular sect a good writer spends his words but he cannot squander the good things of life
harvey swados
i must preface any comment on the task of the negro writer by observing that particularly at this point in american historyit would be presumptuous for any white writer to offer gratuitous advice to any negro writer however once i am asked i should observe that the first task of any literary artist is to write honestly and well regardless of who might be hindered or helped by his work in this sense the task of the negro writer cannot be said to differ from that of his white colleague the main danger for an artist working in a segregated society however is that he may permit rage to degenerate into hate rage has informed some of the greatest masterworks of the ages but hate h as poisonous and selfdefeating in art as it is in politics
howard n meyer
the special task of the negro writer is to communicate with the submerged masses of his people only a fraction of whom have responded to the challenge of the epochto tell them whatever the form of his art the truth about their condition in its new affirmative sense that the hope of reconstruction of society can now be a reality if they will but awaken howard n meyer a new york attorney is a parttime historian and writer he wrote the introduction to the collier s edition of col wentworth higginsons classic army life in a black regiment and contributes articles to various literary and quarterly magazines his biography of gen ulysses s grant let us have peace is set for fall publication
dudley randall
in the nineteen thirties richard wright published a blueprint for negro writers perhaps it guided him to his achievement but it may only have misled another writer as each has his own unique temperament education experience beliefs and vision he is not an interchangeable part to be inserted into a blueprint or a machine the commissar of culture no matter what name he masquerades under is avid to seize and manipulate power and is greedy to use the writer in his power game first he flatters and then muzzles the writer we have seen this happen in russia this creature can be recognized by his practice of dictating to others what he believes they should think or write because of this danger the writer cannot be subservient to leaders politicians critics the public or even to his race but must serve only the truth as he sees it and often the truth may be unpalatable to one or all of these in his search for truth the writer may explore the racial struggle or purely personal themes or both since he feels both external and internal pressures whatever his themes his allegiance is not to politicians popularity or power but solely to truth as he sees it by his rendering of truth he will live or die if american negro writers need examples they can study writers of other oppressed peoples since distance gives objectivity to see how they created art which works are living and meaningful or ephemeral and spurious and why
william demby
american negro writers are suddenly free free from the need to make propaganda free from the need to protest free from the need to dramatize sociological theses these are being acted out in realityin the sitins in the freedom marches in the demonstrations and strikes of protest now american negro writers can explore the uncharted depths of art can weave an identity for themselves and for their brothers exploring the mysteries of identity can be dangerous the rewards for the artistand the society from which he has been spawnedcan be great william demby recently returned to the u s from italy where he had lived and worked for many years author of the little known underrated novel beetlecreek he bids for fresh attention this spring with a new novel the catacombs to be released by pantheon in june
gwendolyn brooks
the task of the negro writer in any sort of society is the task of every writer to clarify his interior and to deliver thoroughly and only the messages urged by that clarity
gwendolyn brooks winner of a pulitzer prize for poetry is author of five volumes of poetry annie allen a street in bronzeville the bean eaters bronzeville boys and girls for children and selected poems plus a novel maud martha she conducts a seminar in poetry at chicagos columbia college 
ossie davis the task of the negro writer is revolutionary by definitionbeginning inward he must take his consciousness of himself as a negro the specific joy or terror of what being a negro means in a segregated society and he must expand that consciousness exploding outwardhe must make of himself a hammer and against the racially restricted walls of that society he must strike and strike and strike again until something is destroyedeither himselfor the prison walls that stifle him ossie davis a veteran broadway and screen actor is author of the hit play purlie victorious which was filmed under the title gone are the days he is also author of tv scripts and of a new play tailored especially for his actress wife ruby dee his latest movie is the hill
kristin hunter
beyond saying that the negro writer should try to be as good a writer as he can i can hardly presume to dictate his role he may choose not to be a negro writerthat is a writer about negoesat all i think the freedom to make this choice is ultimately one of the freedoms negroes are presently fighting for but if he chooses to deal with negro materialor to put it more accurately if that is the material that chooses himhe will need every bit of his skill and a thick skin as well for he is bound to be criticizedby white liberals who think he should be more noble by black nationalists who think he should be more angry or by dear genteel aunt jenny who teaches school and thinks lowclass colored people are literally too vulgar for words if in spite of these deterrents the negro writer chooses to express the splendid negro culture of which he is a part let him not neglect the great tradition of white western culture of which he is also a part his task will be to mediate between these two cultures which have been misunderstanding and mis
bill gunn
his the negro writers task is to be true to whatever it is that compels him to write be it race problems love or the romance of buttoncollecting it should not differ selfconsciously because of race in or out of a segregated society it will differ from those of other writers because his experience is different i should think that anything which distracts him away from his own creative flow like paying too much attention to the publics expectations or a lack of personal discipline could be destructive to the artists individual genius bill gunns first novel all the rest have died was published last winter he is an actor of note a winner of the  new york critics award and author of the plays marcus in the high grass produced in  and the celebration and the ghinko trees new plays he is writing his second novel
nat hentoff
the basic task of any writer is to find and be himselfas deeply and wholly as possible for some that finding and growing involves commitment to some kind of social action either directly or through the use of his art as a means of awakening exacerbating or otherwise forcing others to find fzemselves in the context of the society they live in are compressed by or are accomplices of for others finding oneself may mean a retreat in one way or another from that society in aestheticism or nihilism or just plain disgust and of course there is an infinite variety of choiceswhen they are choicesin between but no matter what the choice the man making the choice is inescapably shaped by who he is where he is and the kind of society he is in therefore a negro writer in a segregated societyand obviously american society is still segregatedwill find his search to discover and be himself qualitatively different in its complications and emotional layerswithinlayers from that of a wasp or a jew or let us say from any white who has made a deliberate choice to be an outsider or from a white who has deliberately tried to see the society from below what i am trying to say is that the negro writers task is fundamentally no different from that of any other writer but his means of coping with that task almost inevitably involve perspectives with regard to his society and the ways it has operated and tried to operate on him that may lead to a much more penetrating knowledge of himself in relationship to his society than most white writers in america are likely to achieve from being forced into the role of the outsider he can see more of the whole than can the white writer because he is part of that whole at the same time that he has been exiled from his center what specific role he then takes depends on his particular background capacities temperament and diligence at selfexploration
c eric lincoln
the fundamental prerequisites of a work of art are two  it must be a rendition of what is true  it must be beautiful its truth need not be mimetical it need not be a slavish reproduction of some existing quantity but to be art it must interpret accurately some tenor of emotion or some quality of existence its beauty derives from its consistency of form and the relatedness of its parts to each other and to the whole in a segregated society the task of the negro creative writer is no different from that of the writer who lives in utopia an artist he he paints the world he sees the creative artist brings to his work a history of experience through which he sees the world his art is an expression of what he has seen what he reasons and what he imagines if it is good art it will be true and beautiful even when it wrenches the heart and tears at the soul 
ernest i gaines
the writer regardless of his race must write about human nature he must write about mans feelings no man sings all the time or weeps all the time or hates or loves or dances all the time his lifewhether he is a peasant of the society or a member of that societys aristocracyis a combination of all these things the task of the negro writer as well as that of any other writer is to see man and write about him as clearly and as honestly as he possibly can
alex haley
i see as the negro writers task today the wielding of his artist influences to recast the predominantly distorted universal images of the negro we negro writers certainly are betterequipped than white writers to portray our own race we vastly better knowand were immeasurably more privy to the subject of ourselves plus these where white writers at best can only appropriate negro material the negro writer has a mandatebecause theres no nation or race today considered oppressed or inferior whose pens have created a corpus of great literature since this is the goal of every societys writers id say that essentially anyway our task isnt different from white writers but i think that we negro writers do have today an exexhilarating greater personal motivational challenge than white writers have its the challenge to do justice by all of this formidable wealth of negro material that we sit on top of its subject matter thats practically virginal by comparison with the most of white ethnic material which by now has been pretty thoroughly combed
lennox raphael
if the writer is honest he can perform his function as an artist and as a human being by facing up to his personal vision the negro writer however has a particular job his trumpet is his imagination and judgment as is the trumpet of any serious writer rather than his skin or the easy quotient of oppression which like a smart whore has mislaid so many negro writers if one is an artist and if one accepts this role as a vocation that is above all a gift then there is no excuse for mediocrity the writer must first of all be writer craftsman and lord of his imagination it is only from this premise that the eccentricities of his skin can be branched out as an advertisement for himself skin whether one is black or white and primarily when one is black must be regarded simply as an advertisement a publicity gimmick ones walking phallus but skin is not ones thinking and one cannot depend on skin if one intends to do battle with every foe in the literary arena the negro writer must understand that society has lent him the role of bullfighter and that in the hands of this danger he must create a thing of beauty which will lend distinction to the struggle of his people in his society there are many bulls and many aficionados but the ring must never be allowed to grow larger than ones talent for this regardless of ones skin can only mean the end of ones strivings the negro writer must learn his craft for it is craft that gives vision beauty subtlety and unhistrionic anger to ones work it is easy to be angry but it is much harder to shape this anger into something that will endure and at the same time impart an aura of humanness to ones life and work 
william m kelley
the task of the negro writer should differ from that of the white writer in that among other things he should be addressing himself to the negro unfortunately the negro is the last person to whom the negro writer speaks so that now both the white and the negro writer address themselves to the white man the negro writer believes that he must tell the white man where its at as if the white man has oppressed the negro for the last  years without really being aware of it the negro writer has turned himself into a reverse court jester he comes before the king and on cue tells the king how cruel how evil the king is when the jester is finished the king feels wonderful he is certain that any country with a king so fairminded as to permit his jester to speak to him in such a way is must be a country of justice and equality the negro writer must use his art and art it must be not propaganda to help the negro to find those things that were robbed from him on the shores of africa to help repair the damage done to the soul of the negro in the past three centuries thomas paine did not address himself to the british he spoke rather to the american colonists if he had done otherwise america today might still be a colony
ronald l fair
when it became apparent to my friends some years ago that i was determined to have my say as a writer those close enough to me to offer advicebeing concerned about the possibility of my having some small degree of successcautioned me not to waste my energies writing about negroes they said richard wright was the only writer who had successfully written about the negro and since i was not richard wright there was no chance of my ever being heard this of course was before the great james baldwin had been heard from well for some reason i listened to them i began a novel about white people i was half way through the novel before i realized that i had sold out myself and my people i had a long discussion with myself on paper of course and concluded that there were enough white writers distorting reality and showing the world a kind of makebelieve totally white america that never really acknowledged the existence of the negro when it dawned on me that if i had not stopped when i did i would have ended as just another tom i was furious i tore the manuscript into little pieces page by page i lit a match to it and watched it bum with all the ceremoniai intensity of an early christian witnessing the last supper i was free for the first time in my life i really knew that i was proud to be a negro and not afraid to shout it i had succeeded in convincing myself that the old belief that negroes could not do what they wanted to do unless they first had the approval of the man was a myth there was just too much that had to be said that couldnt be said by white writers for me to turn my back on it i didnt know what the future held for me as a negro writer writing about negroes but i didnt care because i was free i doubted that i would ever make any money as a writer of this kind of fiction but this didnt matter either because i  would be telling it like it is i decided that i should continue on my job and write at night and that i would never be afraid to look a white man in the eye and tell him that he had acted like a barbarian i remember thinking that there must be white people in the world who would like to know the truth about what it is like to be a negro about how the negro feels with someone standing on his head and i was determined to tell them no more polite lies no more biting of the tongue or twisting of truths richard wrights death would mean something because i would keep him in mind and swing away i cannot speak for other writers we are as different from one another as we are from the society that tortures us so however i can speak for myself as a negro writer i realize that mine is only one faint voice among thousands but i must remain idealistic enough to think that my voice will be heard because it speaks the truth i must continually recharge myself with the sorrow and frustration of my people although it is painful as hell because the white man has lied for four hundred years and if he could have his way he would go on indefinitely denying that we exist i am a voice for my people and if i dont speak out they may never be heard
by louie robinson 
a c o b freeman j y looked out across his  barren  the winding road and the four men coming up it and he let out a heavy sigh first there had been the long dry spell and what it had done to his crops then the store in town where he could get the most credit had gone busted and now this jacob allowed as how it was the lords right to test him but he just hoped the lord knew what he was doing straining his eyes a little jacob tried to make out just who the four men were there was first of all sheriff john holman that figured then there was ben thompson toad thompson called him and the was more or less accurateand his halfbrother will that figured too there wasnt a worse town rumor had it that either one was scared without the other which didnt make much difference since they were always together and to gether they were a terror then there was mr frank dawson that was a surprise mr dawson was the head of the bank not that this meant too much in itself banks didnt let colored people have any money but everybody else in town probably owed mr dawson which meant that he could have something to say about who could get credit where and who couldnt jacob decided that maybe this thing was even worse that he had feared at first every element of the county was against him the four men came up through the front gate and right on to the porch without calling out a greeting and jacob took this to be a bad sign in itself good mornin sheri good momin mr dawson mr ben mr will jacob called out with hopeful friendliness jacob we come out to have a little talk with you the sheriff said his voice was stern matteroffact dashing jacobs hopes well yall come up on the porch and sit down jacob said lamely waving to a couple of dilapidated chairs and the roughhewn railing on the weatherbeaten front porch we didnt come to sit toad thompson said shortly well what did yall come to talk about jacob asked hoping that he sounded properly ignorant you know clanged good and well what we come to talk about toad thompson said loudly its about that daughter of s yourn tryin to go to the state university the sheriff said she aint tryin goddang it shes there toad thompson cut in well shes gonna have to get out the sheriff said we dont intend to have any darkies from buck county startin trouble over there why i aint seen mary lou in six months jacob protested wringing his black workworn hands she didnt tell me nothin about goin to school shes been workin over at andersonville and didnt say nothin to me about goin to school i didnt know nothin about this until yesterday when somebody in town told me it was all in the papers that my mary lou had gone up there and got herself in the white folks college they said it was on the tv and everything but i didnt know nothin about it she didnt tell me she was goin to school jacob was almost pleading when he stopped talking then banker dawson spoke for the first time youve always been a pretty good boy jacob he said softly you never got into any trouble you work out here on this farm of yours and you mind your own business you never get out of your place we like colored people like that it shows those northern agitators that we can live in peace down here but you can understand how a thing like thisyour very own daughter going up there to the state universitymeans trouble jacob bad trouble now you dont want any trouble do you jacob no sir i dont want any trouble jacob answered feeling that truer words he had never spoken well then banker dawson went on what you need to do is get mary lou down here and straighten her out maybe if you get her out of that school and keep her quiet folks around town will accept that as your apology for all this fuss and wont think hard of you i think we ought to let him know whats going to happen if he dont git her out of there toad thompson said menacingly i think he may have to find out that we know what to do with uppity niggers jacob wondered why the thompson brothers were getting so riled up they and none of their kin had ever been to any kind of school so he couldnt see what difference it made to them who was up at that college i think a talkinto is good enough for now sheriff holman said but you aint got much time jacob you aint got much time at all toad thompson added as the four men turned to go will thompson hadnt said a word the whole time they had been there jacob realized but then he figured that wasnt too surprising because he hardly ever said anything usually just nodding his head and grinning while his halfbroth er talked some said that was because will didnt have half his brains some said it was because will had no brains at all but jacob freeman did not have time to dwell upon the content of will thompsons head he turned from the porch and with a feeling of deep emptiness in the pit of his stomach walked inside the old house in the kitchen fussing around the wood stove was his wife sarah at the table sat his oldest son luther who was seventeen and his youngest son simon fourteen well what are yall lookin at me for jacob said defensively yall heard em they said i got to git mary lou out from up there at the white folks school they blamin me for whats happened me and i didnt even know she was goin what are you going to do about it jacob his wife asked eyeing him carefully what am i goint to do about it jacob hollered are you crazy woman the white folks say i got to git mary lou out of there thats exactly what im gonna do no you aint sarah hissed with such sudden quiet force that it seemed that every sound and movement on earth stopped jacob was shocked he had been a bachelor for thirty of his years on gods green earth and in the twentytwo years that he had been married to sarah since then she had never once disputed him now when it meant his very neck she had decided to oppose him jacob looked hard at the small thin pecancolored woman who he had taken from a farmers cotton patch when she was sixteen and made his wife she had been quiet and obedient as a child yet her willowy enticing figure had held a womans fullblown passions and he had loved her in ways that he had never found words to tell her but nownow she stood defying him her eyes hot coals of anger her mouth set in grim determination you must didnt hear me good woman he roared i said damn you jacob freeman dont you shout at me sarah cried as tears tried unsuccessfully to escape her eyes you a big man inside this old rundown house aint you here theres just me and the children to raise your voice to but i didnt hear you out there shoutin at them white folks i didnt hear you tellin them what you was gonna do and what you was not gonna do jacob did not mean to sit down so suddenly in the chair it was just that he was so thunderstruck that he all at once lost control of his legs and had gone plop when he found his voice it did not seem familiar to his own ears have you lost your senses sarah the white folks may i havent lost my senses ive come to my senses jacob and quit tellin me what white folks say i say its time for you to stand up and be a man in front of your sons here why is it always the negro woman who has to advance the race from harriet tubman to mary bethune it has been the negro woman who has had to do it all and in this family it seems like its me and mary lou so jacob realized it had all been her doing behind his back she had been putting these integration ideas into mary lous head and even now simon and luther were sitting there looking at him with what he could only call contempt this is all your fault jacob said sternly youre the cause of all this fuss i am not the cause of it sarah said it is the fault of all the colored men since the beginning of time colored men in africa who shouldnt have sold their people into slavery colored men who shouldnt have let themselves be made slaves colored men who have been lettin themselves and their women and their children be slaves ever since you been readin that stuff in that ebony magazine about where colored folks come from jacob accused i been doin a lot of things sarah told him and one of them is thinkin and ive decided that if the man i was married to was too dumb to see that his children had too much brains to work farms and clean kitchens and wash other folks clothes then it was up to me to do what had to be done do you know what this means jacob asked slowly yes i do sarah answered it means we goin to stand up with our heads high and be able to look our children in the face as long as we live even if that aint too long i told you i was goin and git mary lou jacob said trying to get back his authority then you aint going to eat another meal in my kitchen or sleep another night in my bed sarah said jacob felt a hundred years old it took all of his strength to get up from the chair and walk out of the kitchen he had lived with white folks a long time and he had always done what he was told to do he had gotten along that way but having them down on himmaybe even trying to hurt himwas one thing and having sarah against him was something else barred for life from her table and bed jacob was an old man it was true but he wasnt so old that he didnt appreciate the fact that sarah at thirtyeight was still much of the same female he had married when she was sixteen not the little girl part but that redblooded woman part and for the first time in all of his fiftytwo years jacob considered the possibility that there were some things in this world more important than white folks jacob walked out to the woodshed in back and took down the three shotguns that belonged to him and luther and simon he got some oil and rags and things and walked back to the rear steps and sat down and carefully began cleaning the guns every now and then he glanced back through the kitchen window at sarah and then skyward toward the lord he sure hoped they knew what they were doing
autobiographers are presumptuous and adventurous they serve themselves all trussed up for the reading publics appetite and have no way of knowing how theyll be digested still the demands of this literary form can give the autobiographer some guiding for autobiography requires the reporters devotion to facts the novelists sense of narration the historians grasp of the meaningful past and the stripteasers ability to exhibit private matters with taste and art considering the flavoring of autobiographical hors doeuvres dick gregorys nigger dutton  is seasoned with too much narration verging towards fantasy and exhibitionism verging towards vulgarity and not enough of the other ingredients to be blunt the book is an emetic and any value in it must be derived from its medicinal rather than enriching qualities you dont digest this book you react to it you react mainly to gregorys conception of his hero himself gregory belongs to what might be called the little golden book school of biography little golden books are syrupy biographies of the childhoods of famous americans in which distorted and invented experiences of the hero as a child are slanted to explain the achievements of the hero as a man these books are geared for the minds of grade school children it is questionable however whether it is proper for an adult to write such a book for an adult audience and about himself with supreme tastelessness and unabashed puerility gregory describes his impoverished boyhood as if he were ordained by godwith whom he professes to have been on speaking termsto become a great and famous man we hear of wrinkled old ladies kindly witches in this tale who see stars on his brow symbolizing success or have visions of him carrying an expensive brown briefcase in an airplane terminal and gregory tells us about a mysterious superhuman force which he affectionately dubs the monster that seeps through him when he appears before a crowd this monster heaved up its head from the morass of squalor humiliation and shame which marred gregorys childhood environment and strengthened the young gregory as he escaped his background by becoming a big man in the public eye whether he is running track politicking in high school telling jokes or fighting for negro rights gregory describes his insatiable need for public acclaim as a result of this monsters influence but gregory is not critical enough of his monster many men including saints have attributed their actions to a forces which transcends them but is gregorys cause a holy one can one equate the monster that compels one to devote himself to a moral cause with a monster that forces one to run his guts out on the track field or to one which justifies hypocrisy in high school class presidency elections or makes one deprive his friends of needed cash so he can rent a night club gregory cant distinguish between monsters he thinks that the monstrous mon ster the child of hunger and shame which makes him a performer first and a man second is the same one which inspires him to expose himself to southern assassins and sacrifice his career as a comic on the altar of negro rights gregory in short confuses the monster of the devil with the monster of the spirit the compulsion to perform with the necessity to lead one hopes that the motivation which girds gregory when he fights for civil_rights is not so ambivalent as nigger leads one to believe during the first two thirds of nigger the reader is bludgeoned with fairy tale morality and insufferable conceit egotism overrides ethics and it is not until gregorys wallet is fattened that he begins to show some awareness of the feeling of others but even the rich dick gregory doesnt seem to be entirely aware of why he does things this is a stiff charge but doesnt come by way of character assassination the pattern of gregorys actions from child to man reveals him adapting whatever talents he has or manipulating any situation to play a role that will please those he feels to be his superiors but often hurts those he considers at least his equal the role itself hardly seems to matter it can range from a farinabuckwheat role to that of a social hero but it is always a performers role which avoids exposure of the real human being that is why gregorys childhood is shrouded in fiction that is why gregory explains his rise from rags to riches as if some mystical force animated him that is why he refuses to make clear connections between the degradation of his boyhood and his awkward scramble for money fame and at this time power and that is why i suppose he couldnt wait for a little golden book biographer to cononize him in the candy store of american  fe noses of many negro children are roughly pressed against the outer pane it hurts some more than others it ennobles some and rots others some get in and some dont dick gregory got in and the fact that he seeks to change the stores interior makes him loom larger than the common contented man is his stature the result of selfinflation bigness of characteror both john woodford
