now that we in america face a new world indeed on the whole a receptive world and now that we are developing a sense of history long delayed what shall be the purpose of the negro from nowinto the future should we not call for a summit meeting of all the acknowledged leaders of the civil_rights movement to a round table conference in an endeavor to formalize a joint program of action for those basic human rights still denied the negro in the social political economic and educational area of life these leaders in the order of their standing both in america and abroad and in my own estimation of their contribution to the cause of the negro are  dr martin_luther_king southern christian leadership conference sclc  roy wilkins national association for the advancement of colored people naacp  whitney young the national urban league  james farmer congress of racial equality core  john lewis student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc there are no longer any fundamental doctrinal issues that separate these groups or their leaders isnt there in fact too much fragmentation with the danger of even greater stratification and division between the groups that have been accepted as spokesmen for the american negro citizenry is not the drain on the treasury of each of these groups admittedly dangerous because of the excessive costs of operating on such a great national scale i refuse to believe that anyone of these leaders would deny the urgent need to meet to discuss these issues i am likewise convinced that each leader of each group would upon  an urgent national call from the ranks of the negro people of america reply with a resounding yes who shall sound the call to these leaders these men in whose hands lie the plans for the virtual destiny of millions of their fellowmen these men who by their program will put america to the continuing litmus paper test of its humanism and its equal treatment of the negro i personally call upon the negro church the great religious leaders of the masses of the negro people too long under eclipse and too long surrendering their traditional roles as spokesmen for their  million enrolled church members i also call upon the restless negro and white students in colleges north and south young men and women of energy and imagination the visionaries who give such impetus and life to these movements to urge these leaders to cease their bureaucratic differences and sit down at the conference table work out a common bargaining ground a concensus and elect a leader then merge their forces and formalize in a joint statement a series of resolutions of demands in every area of human rights and bring these demands to the attention of the president of the united states the attorney general and the leaders of both houses of congress such a demand for human rights based upon a strong legal and moral foundation will be unassailable and will be heralded and praised throughout america and the world and finally i ask those of you who will make this call to our leaders to urge the distinguished dr martin_luther_king who was recently honored with the bestowal of the  nobel peace prize to become chairman and spokesman for the group i am certain the white churches and synagogues of america the great protestant catholic and jewish leaders will do as they did in their march to selma alabama give this proclamation their united support this group action in essence is what dr_king referred to when speaking of the needless waste of assets in the various drives for equality of the negro in the weeks following the assassination of malcolm_x when it appeared that a bitter and costly feuding between his followers and his former muslim group would erupt in bloodshed dr_king offered to mediate the differences between the two groups these two instances are but straws in the wind of what could happen in the area of agreement between the civil_rights groups if a clarion call for such a summit meeting were made and from the sources above suggested great miracles have often been wrought out of the commitment to a cause by a few people a word on the danger to the american negro and his present crusade for equal rights and participation in the american society by such movements as the black muslims the negro no longer lives as he did  years ago in an isolated community what he does in harlem philadelphia cleveland detroit chicago and particularly in the south is broadcast throughout america and the world various interpretations are given to whatever may be reported about him or pictured about him depending upon the attitude of the news media or the place of coverage the death of malcolm_x for example was reported in the foreign press as the result of a giant conspiracy of white antinegro groups to kill negro civil_rights leaders this completely false picture was spread throughout europe asia africa and the communist world resulting in violent demonstrations in many of the african countries under the theory that malcolm_x was an american lumumba i point to the above as a warning note to the great and growing body of young negroes in the schools and colleges of america upon whom the destiny of the entire negro race depends that a renewed sense of purpose and a clarification of the objectives of the american negro is a prime necessity first and foremost it is imperative that we support every effort on the part of our local state and national governments for widespread and total education of the negro masses especially those in densely populated ghettos and pockets of poverty in the deep south and their counterparts in the metropolitan cities of the north there is a heavy responsibility on the part of the professional upperclass the better circumstanced and welltodo negro to sacrifice much of his time to help his brother at the lower level and particularly to give liberally of his money to those causes and there are many working to this end he must be willing to speak up and be heard in public meetings before the various boards of education not only for integrated education but for high quality education by the best and most qualified teachers he must assert that the negro taxpayer will support an increase in the tax rate however high it may be when funds are needed to build better schools and provide higher salaries for better quality education the poor of all races are the beneficiaries and our poor percentagewise unfortunately is the greater and he should be the first to support and insist upon a program of preschool education at the age of two and onehalf years and a longer school day and a shorter vacation period there is an urgent need for guidance values of negro children in their early years of life i have referred above to what history has done to them and their families for more than two centuries america  is paying the cost of thisand we are the victims of that benighted history next of importance are the need of guidance values and a new awareness for the negro youth early in life beginning at preschool age and continuing through the primary and high school years with concentration on the need for total perfection and discipline a hierarchy of values and culture is an absolute necessity nothing has been a greater contributing factor to the negros lack of readiness for full participation in american opportunity today than the grave losses sustained by the negro because of the traditional treatment of the negro masses in our schools both north and south historically he was segregated by law in the south and provided with a minimum of education given by poorly trained and poorly equipped teachers in totally inadequate buildings worse the term of the school year was substantially less than that for white children in the north he found himself in ghetto schools for the most part defacto segregated confronted with a teaching staff with little interest or motivation it becomes necessary therefore for the negro to approach the necessity for mass education with a sense of tragedy that if we fail in thisall else fails we must inquire in the secondary or high school courses to find those unusual minds of excellence or those with unusual skills in the various sciences physical chemical and biological in the manual and creative arts the performing arts of music drama acting and expressionall to the end that the american negro heirs of a rich and vaunted african heritage of many centuries with a history of gigantic accomplishments in these and many other fields which leading world authorities now fully recognize may rise again to a place long denied the negro as one of the truly great races of the world we must give up our lives to this test of excellence and supremacy in this struggle for a place among the great races of the world which in its accomplishment will carry our native america to an even higher place among the nations of the world 
i speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy i urge members of both partiesamericans of all religions » and c°l°rsfrom every sectionto join me in that cause  at times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in mans unending search for freedom so it was at lexington and concord so it was a century ago at appomattox so it was last week in selma ala there longsuffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as americans many were brutally assaulted one good mana man of godwas killed
there is no cause for pride in what happened in selma there is no cause for selfsatisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of americans but there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight for the cries of pain the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of the government of the greatest nation on earth our mission is at once the oldest and most basic of this country to right wrong to do justice to serve man in our time we have come to live with moments of great crisis our lives have been marked with debate about great issuesissues of war and peace of prosperity and depression but rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of america itself rarely are we met with a challenge not to our growth or abundance our welfare or security but to the values and purpose and meaning of our nation the issue of equal rights for american negroes is such an issue and should we defeat every enemy double our wealth conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue then we will have failed as a people and a nation for with a country as with a person what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul there is no negro problem there is no southern problem or northern problem there is only an american problem and we are met here tonight as americans not as democrats and republicans to solve that problem this was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose the great phrases of that purpose still sound in every american heart north and south all men are created equalgovernment by consent of the governed give me liberty or give me death those are not just clever words those are not just empty theories in their name americans have fought and died for two centuries and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty risking their lives those words are promised to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man this dignity cannot be found in mans possessions it cannot be found in his power it rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others it says that he shall share in freedom choose his leaders educate his children provide for his family according to his ability and merits as a human being to apply any other testto deny a man his hopes because of his color or race his religion or the place of his birthis not only to do injustice it is to deny america and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for freedom our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish it must be rooted in democracy the most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders the history of this country is in large measure the history of the expansion of that right to all our people many of the issues of civil_rights are complex and difficult but about this there can be no argument every american citizen must have an equal right to vote there is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right there is no duty which weighs more heavily on us to ensure that right yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting because they are negroes every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right the negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong the hour is late or the official in charge is absent if he persists and manages to present himself to the registrar he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application if he manages to fill out an application he is given a test the registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test he may be asked to recite the entire constitution or explain the most complex provision of state law even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read or write for the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination no law that we now have on the books and i have helped to put three of them there can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it in such a case our duty must be clear to all of us the constitution says no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color we have all sworn an oath before god to support and defend that constitution we must now act in obedience to that oath wednesday i will send to congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote the broad principles of that will be in the hands of democratic and republican leaders tomorrow after they have reviewed it it will come here formally as a bill i am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends to give them my views and to visit with my former colleagues i have prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which i had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which i will submit to the clerks tonight but i want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposals of this legislation this bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all electionsfederal state and localwhich have been used to deny negroes the right to vote it will establish a simple uniform standard which cannot be used however ingenious the effort to flout our constitution it will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the united states government if state officials refuse to cooperate it will eliminate tedious unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote finally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting i will welcome suggestions from all the members of congressi have no doubt i will get someon ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective but experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the constitution to those who seek to avoid action by their national government in their communitieswho seek to maintain purely local control over electionsthe answer is simple open your polling places to all your people allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin extend the rights of citizens to every citizen there is no constitutional issue here the command of the constitution is plain there is no moral issue it is wrong to deny any american the right to vote there is no issue of states rights or national rights there is only the struggle for human rights i have no doubt what will be your answer last time a president sent a civil_rights bill to congress it contained a provision to protect voting rights that bill was passed after eight long months of debate and when that bill came to my desk for signature the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated this time on this issue there must be no delay no hesitation no compromise with our purpose we cannot we must not refuse to protect the right of every american to vote in every election he may desire to participate in and we ought not and we cannot and we must not wait another eight months before we get a bill we have already waited  years and more and the time for waiting is gone so i ask you to join me in working long hours nights and weekends if necessary to pass this bill and i dont make that request lightly for from the window where i sat with the problems of our country i recognize that outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of the nation the grave concern of many nationsand the harsh judgment of history on our acts but even if we pass this bill the battle will not be over what happened in selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of america it is the effort of american negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of american life their cause must be our cause too it is not just negroes but all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice and we shall overcome as a man whose roots go deeply into southern soil i know how agonizing racial feelings are i know how difficult it is to reshape attitudes and the structure of society but a century has passed more than  years since the negro was freed and he is not fully freed tonight it was more than  years ago that abraham lincoln a great president of another party signed the emancipation proclamation but emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact a century has passed more than  years since the equality was promised and yet the negro is not equal the time of justice has now come no force can hold it back if it is right in the eyes of man and god that it should come and when it does that day will brighten the lives of every american for negroes are not the only victims how many white children have gone uneducated how many white families have lived in poverty how many white lives have been scarred by fear because we have wasted our energy and substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror those who ask you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future this great rich restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to allblack and white north and south sharecropper and city dweller these are the enemiespoverty and ignoranceand not our fellow man and these too shall be overcome let no one in any section look with prideful righteousness on the troubles of his neighbors there is no part of america where the promise of equality has been fully kept in buffalo as well as birmingham in philadelphia as well as selma americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom this is one nation what happens in selma or in cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every citizen but let each of us look within our own communities and our own hearts and root out injustice there tonight men from the south as well as the north men from the east as well as from the west are all americans all fighting together in viet nam men from every region fought for us across the world  years ago in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the south made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region of the great republic i have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this countryfrom the great lakes down to the gulf of mexico from the golden gate to the harbors along the atlanticwill rally now together in this cause to vindicate the freedom of us all for all of us owe this duty all of us will respond to it the real hero of this struggle is the american negro his actions and protestshis courage to risk safety and even lifehave awaked the conscience of the nation his demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice to provoke change and stir reform he has called upon us to make good the promise of america and who among us can say we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery and his faith in american democracy for at the heart of battle for equality is a belief in the democratic process equality depends not on the force of arms but the force of moral rightnot on recourse to violence but on respect for law and there have been many pressures upon your president and there will be others as the days come and go but i pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be foughtin the courts and in the congress and in the hearts of men we must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly but the right of free speech does not carry with it as has been said the right to holler fire in a crowded theater we must preserve the right of free assembly but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares we do have a right to protestand a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors i intend to protect all those rights as long as i am permitted to serve in this office we will guard against violence knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons with which we seek progressobedience to law and belief in american values in selma as elsewhere we seek peace we seek order we seek unity but we will not accept the peace of stifled rights the order imposed by fear the unity that stifles protest for peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty in selma as in every city we are working for just and peaceful settlement we must remember that after this speechafter the police and the marshals have goneafter this bill is passed the people of selma must still live and work together when the attention of the nation has gone elsewhere they must try to heal the wounds and build a new community this cannot easily be done on a battleground of violence as the history of the south itself shows it is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such impressive responsibility in recent days the bill i am presenting will be known as a civil_rights bill but in a larger sense most of the program i am recommending is a civil_rights program its object is to open the city of hope to all our people all americans must have the right to vote and we are going to give them that right all americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race and they are going to have those privileges but to exercise that privilege takes more than legal right it requires a trained mind and a healthy body it requires a decent home and the chance to find a job and the opportunity to escape from poverty of course people cannot contribute to the nation if they are never taught to read or write if their bodies are stunted from hunger if their sickness goes untended if their life is spent in hopeless poverty we want to open the gates to opportunity but we are also going to give all our peopleblack and whitethe help they need to walk through those gates my first job after college was as a teacher in a small mexicanamerican school my students were poor and often hungry and they knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice they didnt understand why people disliked them but they knew it was so you could see it in their eyes i often walked home after classes wishing there was more i could do but all i knew was to teach them the little i knew hoping it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a child but now i do have that chance and ill let you in on a secreti mean to use it and i hope that you will use it with me this is the richest and most powerful country which ever occupied the globe the might of past empires is little compared to ours but i do not want to be the president who built empires or sought grandeur or extended dominion i want to be the president who educated young children to the wonders of their world i want to be the president who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be taxpayers instead of taxeaters i want to be the president who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election i want to be the president who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties i want to be the president who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth and so at the request of your beloved speaker and the senator from montana the majority leader and the senator from illinois the minority leader mr mcculloch rep william m mcculloch rohio and other members of both parties i came here tonight not as president roosevelt came down one time in person to veto a bonus bill not as president truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill but i came down here to ask you to share this task with me and to share it with the people we both work for i want this to be the congress republicans and democrats alike which did all these things for all these people beyond this great chamber out yonder in  states are the people we serve who cannot tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen we all can guess from our own lives how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness how many problems each little family faces they look most of all to themselves for their futures but i think they also look to each of us above the pyramid of the great seal of the united states it says in latin god has favored our undertaking god will not favor everything that we do it is rather our duty to divine his will but i cannot help believing that he truly understands and that he really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight
the struggle for ra v rial justice and brother i hood the time has jj  come and is overdue  £ for objectivity perspective calmness and reason dramatic heroism has served a useful function but oversimplification name calling and demagoguery are not the proper tools with which to resolve complex issues white and black men are offended and even angered when one attempts to evaluate racial problems without prejudice and misguided emotion nevertheless i shall now make such an attempt of course i realize that all men have prejudices and are only deceiving themselves when they claim to have no prejudices i too may unwittingly be indulging in that popular pastime which confuses thinking with a mere rearrangement of ones prejudices if so i ask your indulgence for my weakness and lack of insight although it is scarcely helpful to have prejudice in anyone who is trying to rectify what he considers to be prejudices in others that the white race has as a whole grossly mistreated colored races especially the negro race is a fact on which i assume we can all agree i also take for granted that many white people are thoroughly ashamed of the way white men have exploited black men and that we all sincerely want to atone personally for the past present and future racial sins of ourselves and other white men moreover i am aware that john steinbeck spoke rather accurately when he said i am constantly amazed at the qualities we expect in negroes no race has ever offered another such high regard we expect negroes to be wiser than we are more tolerant than we are braver more dignified than we more selfcontrolled and selfdisciplined we expect them to obey rules of conduct we flout to be more courteous more gallant more proud more steadfast nevertheless it is time that some white liberal points out to negroes how some whites who believe in equality for all people feel about negro prejudices which are damaging to both races the white man is not the only one who must answer whether he is his brothers keeper of course i know that many negroes understand this and act accordingly there is no such thing as a typical negro just as there is no such thing as a typical white mannot even a typical southern white man what i am saying is directed primarily at those negroes who generalize from particulars and hate or distrust all white men failing to give credit where it is due and willing to believe the worst about a white mans motives for his words and actions the  fall issue of columbia college today quotes several negro college students whom i believe would understand what i am trying to say george sneed jr said the important thing to me is to be considered as an individual  refuse to be thought of as a part of a mass problem and i dont feel any gratitude toward campus groups who treat me this way for negroes to be treated as individuals the key thing is to have more association between the races its hard to hate people you really know mr sneed was referring i am sure to an association on the basis of full equality and respect henry white said most people in harlem and i suspect other negroes feel very discouraged and are full of resentment against whitestoo much so i think negroes have to stop feeling so sorry for themselves    my parents have taught me not to expect to have things handed to me but to work hard and get what i wanted my teachers have encouraged me in the same way but maybe if i had different parents and teacher i would feel trapped and bitter too i hope and trust that mr white realizes however that presentday american social and economic forces especially where negroes are concerned make it extremely difficult for some people to rise above their environment no matter how hard they work james alexander said when i first came to columbia i felt insecure every time i saw a negro face i automatically introduced myself now i have a lot of friends at the college and many of my white friends are as close as the negro ones r   these young negro men and others like them represent the hope for the negro race and indeed for the entire human race while perhaps more fortunate in environment and opportunities than most other negroes or whites they nevertheless demonstrate that they have been able to keep intact their per sonalities and selfesteem in spite of white injustice and discrimination as charles eliot silberman a white economist and journalist points out in the same columbia magazine the negro will be unable to compete on equal terms until he stops despising himself and his fellows and purges from his mind all sense of black inferiority until he really believes with all his being that he is a free man and acts accordingly what i am saying is applicable not only to american negroes but to negro people everywhere when in december the united nations security council was debating the congo rescue action there was demonstrated among some of the african and asian nations an antiwhite bias which was both unbecoming and damaging adlai stevenson is a man of considerable patience understanding and concern for negro people therefore his words were not taken lightly when he spoke with indignation and sorrow i have served in the united nations from the day of its inception off and on for seven years but never before have i heard such irrational irresponsible insulting and repugnant language in these chambers language used if you please contemptuously to impugn and slander a gallant and successful effort to save human lives of many nationalities and colours  i say that racial hatred racial strife has cursed the world for too long i make no defense of the sins of the white race in this respect but the antidote for white racism is not black racism racism of any form by anybody is an offense to the conscience of mankind and to the charter of the united nations racial problems are so numerous and complex and so interrelated with other problems that no wise person can expect easy answers in one master plan the back cover of negro digest wisely states that knowledge is the key to a better tomorrow i should like to add that so is trust better laws and social planning are necessary to help resolve racial problems but in the long run nothing will take the place of the permanent and solid way of daybyday relationships in numerous ordinary ways until people cease to think in terms of black and white as making any difference except color it is difficult now for negroes and whites to be natural around each other even men of good will in both races are just a little too enthusiastic to members of the opposite race white writers for negro magazines are often almost fawning in their attempts to assure negroes that while other white men may be prejudiced they themselves are not i should think any selfrespecting negro while appreciating the effort would cringe with embarrassment negroes in positive as well as negative ways must help white people break down the barriers of strangeness that help perpetuate segregation and all the evils that go with it it is true that communists both openly and subtly have exploited race prejudices and legitimate negro aspirations for their own purposes i dont believe however that many negro people anywhere in the world have long been deceived by communists if anything negro people have as a result become more cynical about white motives thus a negro comedian can jokingly but nonetheless bitterly condemn liberals who rent a negro to prove how liberal they are this comedian has a valid point to make but white people who are really trying to break down barriers between races are also treated with suspicion concerning their motives but here we must have help and understanding from negroes if we are to be in a position to help them in a sense our white children are underprivileged we talk about brotherhood but our children dont know any negro children to learn to take for granted as being just like white children negro people if they are really serious about brotherhood rather than merely seeking a reversal of injustice have an obligation to help white people rear their children without the blight of prejudice certainly i know that one runs the risk of being offended or having ones children hurt by a prejudiced remark made by a white child recently my five year old daughter reflecting certain community attitudes was heard by our older children using disparaging language concerning negroes the spanking we gave her will help her get her values straighter in the future but the job would be easier for white parents who are trying to rear their children without racial prejudice if negroes would be more understanding and helpful i am told that once when a negro visitor came into our church a white visitor walked out i can only say that if this happened and if it happened because of race prejudice that the visitor was not typical of our congregation in fact we do not have any members like that and we do not want members who have such attitudes it is somewhat ironic that the church of which i am the minister regularly loses some prospective white members because we are integrated and because of our ideas in racial matters yet negro people make a fetish of trying to integrate churches where they are obviously not wanted while ignoring a church that obviously does want them on a genuinely integrated basis and not merely as a token of integration but even without the risk of offense it is difficult to go where at least temporarily one stands out as different also one does not like to leave his friends at other churches nevertheless i am convinced that some negroes must be willing to make these sacrifices in order to help us all mature and get used to each other our family and mem bers of our congregation do visit negro churches in support of this ideal i remember that i used to dance with negro girls when i was a student at yale divinity school and i really didnt think i was prejudiced until one day in my hometown in georgia a white girl i was with sat down by a negro on a bus a white man then exclaimed that she was not any better than the negro a remark which made me extremely angry you see my prejudice was still showing it was years later before i could preach yes i would want my daughter to marry a negro negro digest july  and mean it negroes and whites have to associate with each other on equal terms until the strangeness and prejudices wear off v» equality friendship and brotherhood imply a free give and take negro and white people of good will must learn to speak frankly to each other without suspecting prejudices and inferior motivation negroes are not treated as equals as long as they are handled with kid gloves by whites afraid that feelings will be hurt or that they themselves will be misunderstood nor can negroes continue to have one face for negroes and another for whites neither negro nor white people can mature so long as white liberals pretend that negroes can do no wrong and are not subject to rules of decency and morality this is true no matter how immoral and vicious other white people are or how lax white people of good will are in protecting negro people against unjust white people uncontrolled and lawless negro gangs are just as vicious and wrong as their counterparts in the ku klux klan as a white man i can work to counter white prejudice but negro prejudice is something about which i as a white man can do little in the october   issue of look jim brown a cleveland browns negro football star spoke of how he was being lionized by a crowd one day until confronted with a little white girl who wanted to hug him mr brown spoke of friendly looks becoming frozen he did not let the little white girl express her admiration for him he seemed to be mad at the entire white race for this prejudice but i should like to point out to jim brown that he himself is contributing to continued prejudice he should have let the little girl hug him even if smiles did become frozen does mr brown believe that courage is only demonstrated on the football field or in picket lines or in defiant attitudes if looks ever are to become unfrozen the jim browns are going to have to risk rejection and prejudice it seems to me that in a way that crowd was overcoming its prejudice more than jim brown was his when white people make an effort please my negro brother do not rebuff them because other white men have hurt you please forgive our past ignorance and callousness if we are now trying to atone forgiveness is essential if life is to be based on reality give credit for growth dont reject friendship even if there are still prejudices to be overcome and even if many white people fumble awkwardly and ineffectively in our attempts to be brotherly and righteous of course it goes without saying that negroes also have to be accepted with their prejudices by white people indeed negroes in order to be tolerant and just have to be more understanding and tolerant than white people there is so infinitely much more to understand and forgive but i am pleading with negroes for their own sakes and the cause of civilization everywhere that they try to rid themselves of the poison of hatred many negroes have done so wonderfully well and i am not speaking of the mask put on by socalled buffoons or uncle toms here again however it is easy for negroes to criticize the constructive permanent methods of fair and realistic negro leaders while being swept off their emotional feet by demagoguery as woodrow wilson ironically said the man on horseback is always a hero  the apostles of hate of all colors may yet win the day if so in the  long run it will not matter whether there is black or white supremacy the world will not be a fit place for anybody soapbox oratory is not going to bring brotherhood the future belongs to countless unsung negro and white people who are determined to love to forgive and to understand in order to find permanently satisfactory solutions to their problems segregation is on the way out future generations will read about us in their history books and wonder how we could have been so blindly prejudiced the time will come when races will have merged because the taboo of color will no longer separate people in marriage or in any other meaningful human relationship within a year after the civil war ended a negro entered a fashionable richmond virginia church and knelt at the altar while communion was being served emotions ran high until a distinguished layman arose in his pew stepped forward to the altar and knelt beside his negro brother the layman was general robert e lee moved by his example the whole congregation came forward and knelt at the altar today there is increasingly real hope that when courageous forgiving seeking negroes kneel at the altars of white churches they will be permanently joined by repentant whites as we all pray let us break bread together on our knees when im on my knees with my face to the rising sun o lord have mercy on me
the american consumer is a trusting soul  and because of this he has become fairgame for hucksters and unscrupulous businessmen using deceit and insincerity the baitvertiser fools his victims so completely that most times they dont have the slightest idea that theyve been tricked and dont think that you are immune from getting hooked by a bait ad more than once youll see what appears to be a tremendous bargain rush to the store or invite the firms sales representative for a free home demonstration youll soon discover that the bait advertiser isnt very eager to sell you the product he advertised it will be temporarily out of stock or youll be told it really isnt for you because it is an inferior product gradually the sales pitch will start to upsell you to a product that sells for a lot more than the one advertised the bait advertiser spends big sums for direct mail newspaper radio and tvall designed to offer something which he has little or no intention to sell but in reality to get you on the hook did you ever see an ad for a  vacuum cleaner with a picture of an upright upon which you can read the name hoover do you really think that you are being given a chance to purchase a rebuilt hoover vacuum cleaner for just  ok you take the bait and invite the salesman to your home how wrong can you go for  for even a used cleaner the salesman will arrive at your home and place a few sprinkles of baking soda on your living room rug the machine will wheeze in agony and the powder will stay put on the carpet a pretty poor machine id say the salesman says these old rebuilt machines never seem to work right i cant offer you any guarantee of any sort so why do you want to buy such a piece of junk it isnt by accident that the salesman just happens to have a new machine in his automobile trunk he brings it into the house and it works perfectly this ought to do  the trick and the price is only  but im going to let you have it for only  you can readily see that the  ad was just a comeon in fact the  price mentioned is not the regular price of the machine he demonstrated its regular price is only  but a reputable store would be a better source because it will stand in back of its written guarantee the bait advertiser could not compete on equal terms with a reputable dealer one reason for him to misuse the name of a good firm like hoover the second hand house you may have bought will have an old heating system youve been dickering with a neighborhood firm to install a new gas furnace but before you sign the contract you notice an ad for a much lower price than that which was quoted to you by the first firm beware an actual case in the records of the better business bureau of cleveland tells the story of a home owner who bought a bargain installation the bill was for more than  above the newspaper advertised price and when she remonstrated she was told that the ad said  btus hardly large enough to heat her home and the ad had a small notation saying that installation was extra does your home need asbestos siding home owners throughout the east have been plagued by a firm which advertised to cover an average  x  home for only  if you take note of these measurements youll realize that the average home spoken of will almost fit into your living room those who signed contracts for this installation received bills from two to four times the advertised price want to save money now and not refurnish your own apartment ok lets make your old furniture do there are ads offering to reupholster a sofa and a chair in decorators fabrics for only  the salesman for this firm wasnt even subtle lady he said to one housewife you couldnt possibly redo two pieces of furniture for only  and get nice fabrics the ad is only a comeon so that i can show you samples of better grade fabrics you may think that you can cut corners on the family budget by buying a sewing machine and making some clothes at home dont be hooked by the ad offering a genuine rebuilt singer sewing machine for only  there is no such thing the machine is rebuilt all right with japanese parts or with inferior bootleg parts try as you might the salesman wont even let you buy the machine hell pitch for you to buy a more expensive model and dont even apologize for the unauthorized use of the singer name want to save on your fuel bills radio advertising will blare forth the tremendous bargain of a combination storm and screen offered to home owners for just  installed free of charge just try to buy one the storekeeper will all but hit you over the head trying to convince you why you should buy his regular special at a price several times the amount of the advertised special many states have had so many complaints filed with the attorney generals office that consumer frauds bureaus were established in quite a few the authorities are attempting to protect the consumer from the merchants who trick and deceive by bait advertising and from merchants who use other devious methods to cheat the public in practice bait ads are damaging to the entire community these ads give business to the advertiser who stoops to trickery taking away business from the honest merchant yet how do you spot a bait ad many reputable firms run ads which feature what is known in the trade as loss leaders they offer merchandise at rock bottom prices to entice you to come to the store and possibly make other purchases in fact the bait advertiser is right when he tells you that the higher priced product will give you better service and might very well cost less in the long run but the fact remains that if you are going to spend more for a product than the bargain price advertised youd be better off not dealing with the bait advertiser after all anyone whod trick you to make a sale wont hesitate to give ou poor service sell shoddy products and fail to back up the products guarantee most businessmen try to offer top quality merchandise at fair prices this is how they grow in reputation and in sales however the rotten minority can hurt you in your pocketbook here are some ways in which you can protect yourself against the baitvertiser  remember that you cant get something for nothing shy away from amazing or fantastic bargains the stores you know and trust seldom use such terms  talk to your friends and neighbors about the reputation of any firm you plan to do business with a good reputation is the result of fair play and stores with such a reputation dont have to resort to bait ads  shop around and obtain comparative prices on merchandise or services you plan to buy to make sure you are on the trail of a good product at a fair price before you expose yourself to a firm of unknown reputation a price far below that quoted by a reputable firm is a danger signal ado not buy from anyone unless he can show you the product he advertises and is willing to sell it without knocking it a reputable firm does not handle products which it considers inferior  never sign any paper of any kind until you have read it and are sure you understand it a firm interested in its reputation wants you to know exactly what you are getting before you commit yourself  remember that bait advertising the alluring but insincere offer to sell something is going to trick a lot of people out of a lot of money today and every day dont let it trick you  suspicious that you are the planned victim of a bait advertiser call your local office of the better business bureau or your local chamber of commerce and ask if the firm has a clean record  did you fall victim to a baitvertiser swallow your pride and bring the facts to the attention of the consumer frauds bureau of your state 
president johnson designated may  as senior citizens month in the hope that all citizensof will participate  in helping make life beyond  a better life for senior citizens of our land why suddenly a special month designated for considering the problems of old folks perhaps some statistics from the presidents council on aging will help to focus the light of information on this largeand growing american minority fred panzer director of public information for the council provides the following data every  seconds one american turns  thats  an hour     a day   million a year today nearly  million men and women in the united states are over  by the year  the number will be more than  million adds mr panzer a numerous aged population is a uniquely modern achievement and challenge three powerful social forces are responsibleindustrialization urbanization and medical progress together they create the conditions that generate an aged population and its problems these problems confront americans of all ages    indirectly through our parents and grandparents directly as we ourselves grow older these problems have to do with a usually diminishing income a scarcity of jobs declining health and high medical costs inadequate or unavailable housing and special living requirements mr panzer describes the problems as follows income our old people are quite frequently our poor people as the economic mainstream has risen from scarcity to affluence it has left millions of our aged stranded in the backwaters of poverty there are  elderly families with less than  a year nearly  elderly individuals live on less than  a year jobs in most respects the aged have the same problems as the rest of the populationonly more so this is certainly true about employment age bias begins at  and  age alone is too often the excuse for arbitrarily removins men and women from active participation in life health the hardships of hospitalization in later years are commonplace only one out of ten senior citizens will escape at least one lengthy costly stay in a hospital older persons need three times more hospital care than the rest of the population yet their average income is only half as high housing the important field  of housing for older americans commands attention one out of each five dwelling units occupied by persons over  is substandard housing for our aged is complex and neglected social needs modern living shatters traditional family life and relations between children parents and grandparents the gap between the generations widens it is being partly filled by social service agencies public and private they try to provide the care that too many families can no longer provide for themselves and what of the negro aged the minority within this special minoritythe manpower report to president johnson in march  had the following observations the difficulties which beset the older worker in the job market are multiplied manyfold for the older negro not only is he hurt by discriminatory employment practices because of race but the factors which are a disadvantage to older workers generally  inadequate education and employment in less skilled occupations  are even more pronounced among the older negroes among men  to  years of age in  the median number of years of school completed by nonwhites nearly all negroes and hereafter so referred to was only about six years compared with nine years for whites in this age group only about  per cent of the negro men in these ages in  were employed in clerical professional and other types of whitecollar jobs  as against about  per cent of the white men nearly half of all the older negroes were either laborers or service workers and thus subject to frequent and extended periods of joblessness and to meager incomes the rate of unemployment for negro men workers aged  and over was  per cent in march  two and onehalf times as high as that for older white workers moreover among those  to  about one and onethird times as high a proportion of negro as white men were not in the labor force presumably many of them had decided there was little or no possibility of finding employment consequently the average income of older negro men is only about half that of older white men an even greater income disparity than exists between negroes and whites in the younger age groups although differences in education and other qualifications partly explain the income gap between white and negro workers there is ample evidence of unequal renumeration for equally qualified workers older negro workers have considerably lower average earnings than white workers with the same years of education in the same occupation the older negro professional men as a group earned less than the overall average for older white men in all occupations including laborers   the housing and home finance agency released a report on the aging nonwhite negro and his housing which further pointed up the disparity between the white and black aged and the conditions under which they live for example of the  negroes of  or over reported in the  census some  per cent or live inside cities most in substandard dwellings more than threefifths had  income of less than  while only one of eight had an income of  or more and aged negroes lived in generally more overcrowded homes than whites fortunately something is now being done to help the aged both black and white and to bring the gap between financial resources and general living conditions available to the two racial groups in the annual report to president johnson from the council on aging health education and welfare secretary anthony j celebrezze said that the federal government spent more than  billion during  to assist the aged in the fields of income payments housing employment health and welfare there are a total of  federal programs for older americans hospital insurance through social security was arranged last november the presidents council on aging founded in may  assists the president in meeting the problems of the aged it keeps up a continuing study of the governments responsibilities to these problems and makes recommendations regarding policies and programs council members include heads of cabinet departments and independent agencies that administer the major federal programs in aging mr celebrezze is chairman and warren t roudebush is staff director other members of the council are c douglas dillon secretary of the treasury orville l freeman secretary of agriculture john t connor secretary of commerce w willard wirtz secretary of labor robert c weaver administrator housing and home finance agency john w macy jr chairman civil service commission and william j driver administrator of veterans affairs
o often one hears the accusation that the negro has made few if any significant contributions to the culture of america even the eminent university of chicago physiologist dr dwight j ingle has said as much in his statement that there is historical evidence to assert that the white race has made greater contribution than the negro race in terms of discovery and social evolution dr ingle does try to be objective in his studies on these matters presenting an apparent contradiction or refutation perhaps of each negative theory that he presents yet few persons have not heard these accusations and often their refutations seem weak somehow thus many persons including the negro himself are often puzzled about this subculture creature called the american negro who has been accused of being at best only a secondrate imitator who like the horrid barnacle has clung to the bottom of society which never wanted him anyway giving little or nothing to that society as a candid observation of the american language will show however the negro has made a contribution but like so many of his efforts as a member of a minority this too has gone largely ignored henry l mencken often spoke of the distinct quality of american english for taking any word or phrase and utilizing it to its own advantage even if it took liberties linguists note that a word which is slang dialectal provincial or otherwise substandard today may tomorrow change its course a looksee into any good etymological dictionary will show that this has certainly happened to two standard words namely silly and nice to recall only twoand this happened before these words reached american shores there is simply no end to the words and expressions deliberate creations of the american negro often used by those who have no idea of their origin who can say which among these will not defy time itself and emerge one day at the pinnacle of linguistic esteem language grows out of a mutual  agreement between one or more people that one must communicate that one must make himself understood that one must give thus something of the history of the negros struggle for identity and often utter salvation is to be found in his unique capacity to communicate with a pungency that is purely his own what depth of meaning is conveyed in the negros classification of his god as a waymaker or of his overbearing neighbor as seditty no known spelling by the way or highpolluted a much more accurate metaphor than highfalutin of whih it is a corruption and who can use sugared terms with such casual endearment words like baby sugar or honey how many irksome situations those epithets have soothed moreover no one uses the word us as the negro does in embracing all of his people friends and enemies alike so long as they are negroes whites tend to use them especially in considering their foes and take the word signify no race uses that word with such insinuation and innuendo literally the merriamwebster dictionaries say that the word denotes to show by sign to communicate by words signals and the like to make known to mean denote import to have meaning to matter often used impersonally the oxford dictionary indicates that the word has carried such meanings since the fifteenth century but in my childhood i heard my neighbors use that word with weighty significance to signify meant something tantamount to cardinal sin hes always signifyin on me was an expression to cause consternation to all hearers no one could speculate on what might result to the guilty fellow proof that the negro is a keen observer of mankind is to be found in such words as busthead for an intellectual negro hammerman for the person of authority alligator now shortened to the jive word gate for a dude a sporty swaggering welldressed hep cat the sophisticated fellow who did not have to prove his manliness by fighting alligators or indians the very use of mister before any term object or concept in order to personify it verbs and nouns are rich in onomatopoeia in negro speech consider the following to have ones glasses on meaning to be haughty or formal to igg to ignore a cruncher a road or street conkbuster cheap liquor headlight a lightskinned negro hanging out not up to par as a descriptive adjective or to be rained on to be disappointed or tricked some words are actually of pure african origin among these are cuffee goober and pinder cuffee is an african word for negro goober is from the bantu word nuguba and pinder comes from a nigerian word the latter two words meaning peanut are deliberately derogatory usages which reflect disdain for efforts of the negro toward the culture of the language yet strongly refute the claim that the negro has made no contribution thereto both the plant and the word were transported bodily from africa it is perfectly natural for peoples to corrupt pronunciations of perfectly good words when those words change environs whites not knowing the literary accuracy of goober and pinder laughed these words to the derision of illiteracy who knows how many other words long since lost have followed this same course another fine linguistic contribution to the colloquy is bill bojangles robinsons copacetic no dictionary gives bill robinson this credit some claim the word comes from the yiddish with an original kspelling nevertheless it still remains that bill robinson gave the word its special flavor of meaning for fine all right or ok one hears a close onomatopoetic association with the latin word copia from which comes copious with the meaning of spatial abundance hence a state of allrightness the examples could be multiplied by research the negros use of the american language reflects strongly his battlesemotional psychological sociological economic and spiritualas he has journeyed from slavery toward freedom in a recent article alan rich writing in the new york herald tribune has said the following negro singers almost without exception as many writers have pointed out have a special gift for making the language beautiful and natural few caucasians can come within miles of this with the possible exception of the welsh and the english from the north of their country it may be a matter of dialect or it may be something physical if one reviews the many years the negro has lived in america there can be little doubt that this gift of tongues is a combination of many factors none of which can be ignored in evaluating the negros place in the american colloquy
someone said he didnt care who made the laws of a people as long as he could write their songs in songs ones words become part of the speech and thought of a people and influence their ideas and attitudes some of the words of our poets have attained this influence at least to the extent of being used as titles of books john howard griffin took the title of his book black like me about a white man who darkens his skin and travels through the south to find out what it is like to be a negro from langston hughes dream variations just to mention the spirituals reminds us of how deep an impress they have made on our language and through it on our minds titles taken from the spirituals rush to the memory baldwins go tell it on the mountain alan lomaxs the rainbow sign mary whitt ovingtons the walls came tumbling down howard thurmans deep river albert luthulis and henrietta buckmasters let my people go anna arnold hedgemans the trumpet sounds eugene oneills all gods chillum got wings ama bontemps golden slippers frederic ramseys been here and gone has a title taken from those other black and unknown bards the folk singers who left us our legacy of ballads blues work songs hollers and other folk songs if all the roads the buildings the dams the artifacts that negroes have built in their three hundred years in this country were to vanish suddenly yet their monuments would still remain in the lines and phrases which the poets known and unknown have left in the songs and in the daily speech of men
in his declining years sam clemens may have been critical of the bible but as a journalist most of his life he had learned one of its lessons this lesson was to be his key for unlocking the meaning of his stories know you the truth    and the truth shall make you free clemens as mark twain used truth as a weapon in his lifelong fight against mans inhumanity to man as manifested in slavery and more subtly in bigotry because he was the only southern writer to write the truth about life in the south he was called by william dean howels the most desouthernized southerner i know and the lincoln of our literature most of us have read huckleberry finn and pondered over the section where huck struggles with his conscience this wasnt just a morality lesson this was huck speaking in the language and logic of the southland trying to understand the irrational it was twains way of putting the south under the searing light of truth he wanted them to realize their attitudes and actions toward the negro were unfair unreasonable cruel and hypocritical in the light of their christian upbringing it appears he hoped too optimistically that the southerner would understand and seek to mend his ways but after all the truth hurts and these truths were not the sort to be admitted especially when the myth of magnolia blossoms romance and genteel living were the image the south tried to put forward the hypocrisy of the churches in the matter did not escape in an essay about the decay of lying twain bemoaned the fact that lying in its noble formstorytelling about jumping frogs and the like had been replaced by the vicious and degrading practice of preachers who stand in pulpits and rationalize slavery ministers today who have been chastised for failing to take a stand on the greatest moral issue of our time can look back and see how long they have been procrastinating even mark twain was concerned about it most readers then did not take him seriously on these matters because his outcries were just an abolitionists opinion and worse the opinion of a man who deserted the confederate army after being drafted into it or maybe they just called him names to cloak their guilty consciences the most shocking truth twain was to explore was of course miscegenation in puddnhead wilson some were critical because it glorified the atheist some hooted at its using fingerprints but they all steered clear of the horrible truth that the footprints of two children revealed he was no joel chandler harris when he wrote that tale of a young white raised thinking he was a negro and a young negro raised as a white no it was mark twain using truth who told how they found out who they were at  he left the reader the problem of deciding what kind of life the pair would then face because after all the reader had helped make the world they lived in it was here that the indignities forced upon negro women by white men were told of with a cas f  ualness that misled the southern reader they were so used to the practice and safe in the knowledge that reprisals never followed that they failed to realize that twain was the only writer who dared to mention this degrading and sorry element of life among the magnoliablossomcovered southern aristocracy no gone with the wind will ever wipe out the truth that twain told it was after all the sort of things one doesnt talk about but he did he not only talked about it he built his book around it when after all the fingerprint theory could have been examined in hundreds of other plots most southern writers painted a picture of the negro that kept the bigot happy saying there see what they are like or see how happy they always are twain knew the happy negro was a myth because he had learned young in his autobiography he told of the young slave boy who was always cutting up laughing and shouting to the point of annoying young sam clemens then on one of his midnight walks around the aunts plantation where the slave boy lived sam came upon the boys cabin he listened and heard a gentle sobbing the sobbing continued all night and so it was every night that sam visited the place it was then that he learned the slave boys parents were in maryland where the boy would never see them again so the happy slave boy cried himself to sleep every night  but his oh so human pride would not let him reveal that deep sorrow to any whitesthe myth would have been punctured twains comment was that boy showed more courage than any man i ever met so when jim moans over his familys being so far away we see this childhood episode being replayed when huck shows the love and understanding that the southern white always has for the negro and says why he misses his folks as much as white folks do    it dont seem natural but he does we see this isnt just an ignorant boy muttering this is mark twain again damning the south and quietly asking man to let the truth set all men free truth was used in so many ways although some was more theory at the time at the top of a page in puddnhead wilsons calendar was the inscription training is everything the peach was once a bitter almond cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education here was the great humorist putting forth the idea that environment made the man and so in the book about puddrihead valet de chambre although really white southern aristocrat was at  illiterate able to use only the basest dialect was vulgar and uncouth could not feel at home in a drawing room but was at ease in a kitchen but nothing could change him now that he learned he was white rich and free he could wear fine clothes move in the best circles but he could not endure these new terrors he was now a caricature a pathetic and sorry humanthe stereotyped negro of southern writers but if he was terrified what about tom actually a negro but he had lived as a dandy attending yale and coming home as a sort of conquering hero he also could not face his new life and roxy the slave whose son by her white master had been raised as a white through her switching babies in their cribs was called by twain heir of two centuries of unatoned insult and outrage there was nothing subtle about that remark it was twain using the truth again although twain left the confederacy and its army behind because he was bitterly antiwar the absurdity and cruelty of the southern system and cause made it easy for him he looked at that southern system and gave descriptions of masters a fairly humane man toward slaves and other animals but lest that phrase mislead you the same master was called a thief because he was the man who daily robbed him the slave of an inestimable treasuryhis liberty langston hughes has called twain as modern as faulkner for his handling of the puddnhead story this seems to fit for both twain and faulkner loved their southland but their writings about them were as acid as any goya etching painting people as they were in the hopes that men would see themselves as others do and so become the men they should be the book roughing it contains many examples of twains desouthernization at least in attitude he occasionally gave in and deleted something a chapter in life on the mississippi was taken out but a story was left in that was a cozy tale of the southern ideas of delicacy refinement religion and womanhood and he illustrated them with nice examples of southern gentlemen shooting and stabbing others this also explains twains distaste for sir walter scott to him scott was an early perpetrator of the sort of roses and magnolia legend of the prewar south the sentimentality of scott romances were just false to twain who had grown up in such a place some said that twain deleted that rarely read chapter from life on the mississippi because it would have offended his friends in the southland those who say that must not have read huck for hucks straight reporting of the scene in the south at that time is an indictment of a nation a region a people and certainly a tradition the lowlife pap who promises not to vote as long as a free negro is allowed to vote is real just like the cotton aristocracyhotheads like jefferson davis who made the civil war twain the journalist had long ago learned that the truth is better than any exaggeration and usually more flamboyant so huck reports calmly and coolly seeing brutality cowardice chicanery loyalty and courage in all the people he met and it wasnt just rednecks such as pap the bustling old mrs phelps wanted huck to explain why he had been delayed in getting where he didnt know he was heading it warnt the groundingthat didnt keep us back but a little we blowed out a cylinder head good gracious anybody hurt no mam killed a nigger well its lucky because sometimes people do get hurt now if the phelps were not at the top of the social ladder then colonel sherburn was and the good colonel shot down the drunken boggs in cold blood because he had promised to kill him if boggs insulted him again so when old boggs staggers up and insults the colonel again well the colonel as any gentleman should keeps his promise and shoots him dead the fact that he was killing a helpless man is apparently immaterial if an aristocrats honor is at stake    when jim says he will steal his wife and child if he cant earn the money to buy them huck is shocked that he was plannin to steal his child from a man he didnt even know and who had never done him no harm but very soon after that huck lies to the men searching for runaways and saves jims life he then ponders why he feels so good after having done something wrong twain made gentle suggestions too in innocents abroad he recommended the system he found in certain lands of freeing slaves who showed an aptitude for some useful trade here he was asking the south if the myth that the negro showed no ambition couldnt be tested by giving a slave some reason to have ambition certainly he must have reasoned who would be ambitious when life offered only utter despair in those extraordinary twins he showed wales mccormick making jesting advances to aments mulato girl and the girls mother made almost no objection it was the privilege of the dominant race to exercise the droit du seigneur if it chose there again was utter despair in an essay he wrote that the happy songs the negro sings all seem to be about life after death and dying mark twain told truths as a journalist and he asked questions he asked why the southerner does not trust the shiftless negro and yet trusts mammies to raise their young children when the offspring are at their most impressionable ages when asked twain said the noblest trait a man can have is to love his fellow man but the rarest trait he does have is love for his enemy that man was called old and sick when he wrote an essay the united states of lyncherdom no longer subtle he came out ripping and tearing into lynching and said justice must be equitable the same for all he asked he wrote an essay to foreigners so they might understand the missionaries we send in to a person sitting in darkness he asked shall we go on conferring our civilization on those sitting in darkness    when we as a nation set people free only to put them back in chains and kill to take a mans land he was also upset about the treatment of the indian when he attacked ministers who rationalized slavery twain was not aiming at religion itself he was attacking men for their lack of responsibility he was displeased because they had not achieved what he felt they were capable of achieving so in picturing the south twain painted a picture of dorian gray a looking into the soul a sinister soul whose crime of constant crime of indignity to humans wason earth at leastunpunished so twains negroes lived in a hell on earth as did their real brothers but he didnt make them mute they spoke outrealistically of courseto each other and to the huck finns who represented the wisdom of youth that hant been taught to hate yet their simple pleas for the basic comforts and dignity ring out as did martin_luther_kings plea for his dream jim just wanted his wife and child with him the sobbing slave boy just wanted his parents when roxy switched babies she just wanted the best of life for her son as would any mother they spoke from no soapboxes they spoke from their hearts and most important they spoke truth through the pen of mark twain truth is accuracy and when he had mrs phelps make her callous and stupid remark about the negro killed by the cylinder head he was being accurate it was not out of place it was in some ways the sort of thing we dont talk about but the reporter twain didnt think offtherecord comments belonged offtherecord when they told a real truth of sickness of a people yet van wyck brooks criticized twain for writing for the masses and not for the intellectual elite the masses of twains day were not used to reading anything much less the truth about miscegenation and other quaint practices of the southland they didnt even talk about such things twains observations about what white mans civilization had meant to the sandwich isles leave no doubt as to his belief that other races deserve a chance to build a better world because his own race had sure botched things up but he rarely shouted out about these outrages oh near the time when haleys comet was to come take him away he said some very bitter things about man god and everything in between but it was more just rehashing what he had been saying all along in his life with the pen he had gone from the gentle lessons of huckleberry finn to the discussing of the peculiar institutions peculiar institution was his name for slavery most vile evil in puddn head wilson in the latter he let two lives be ruined not by roxys switch but by a system that was and is ugly but we often miss his message with indifference similar to that of  new yorkers who watched a woman stabbed to death we have read this panorama of mans inhumanity to man on a far larger and more revolting scale and then remembered only the laughs mark twain had not thought it necessary to say here it is i am telling you all about whats wrong  down there like the girl who was stabbed he thought just a simple sight of what was happeningof the truthwas enough so unlike the weather which they talk about but do nothing about here was a problem that they didnt even talk about but mark twain did and today some talk about it and some do something about it sam clemens was born and reared in the south but before the hate was drilled into his head he heard another boy sobbing in the night this was truth this was injustice so when he told stories about other such injustices he thought others would see he couldnt know that parents would hurry up the hateteaching process so that whole legislatures would reel in terror at the thought of three or four small children going to a school his truth of mrs phelps was just as real as the whitesheeted maniac who sneered about the four children who died in the birmingham bomb blast he called a master a thief for stealing anothers liberty and that truth is still with us in certain senators and congressmen but mark twain apparently thought man could and would learn he knew the truth he wrote the truth so men could read the truth he wanted them to know

the american society of african culture amsac held a threeday student news editors conference at hampton institute toward the end of last march and several african and american student editors had the opportunity of getting to know each other under amsac auspices there is no certainty that the two groups established any concrete bridges of mutual understanding however during one explosive session there occurred an exchange of bareboned viewpoints which should have established a basis for an ultimate meeting of minds a young man from howard university taking the floor after amsac director calvin h raullerson had observed that american students had not participated in the sessions to the extent of the africans lit the torch to the inflammable situation he was weary he said in effect of ceaseless complaining from the africans who in their own countries offered no better examples of the institutions and customs they criticized in america in response a young man from kenya seized the spotlight and elo quently explained why the africans complained their complaints he insisted was a matter of defense we were told that america had the ideal form of government that there was a democracy in the united states and that we should aspire to that form of government he declared but  was shocked when i came here to find that there is no democracy here i have been here four years now and i am still shocked we were told by the americans that we should emulate this form of government but now we know that we must defend our own customs and our own idea of government that is why we complain the kenyan was followed to the microphone by a young man from southern rhodesia who while affirming the sentiments of his colleague from kenya added that he complained because of the way his brothers in america were treated under the american government in the burst of spontaneous applause the dangerous heat subsided core chief james farmer flew in from the southern wars to address the open session of the conference resource people who participated were saunders redding hampton professor then serving as writerinresidence at duke university abctv newsman mai goode editor john mccormally of the hutchinson kansas news and negro digest editor hoyt w fuller
it was a literary luncheon for bert and katya gilden the coauthors of that huge bestseller hurry sundown that we met roy newquist book editor of chicagos american only the day before we had sent mr newquist tearsheets of our review of his book counterpoint april counterpoint is a big book also a collection of some  interviews of writers rangingas we noted in the reviewfrom irwin shaw to basil rathbone we found it impossible to resist asking mr newquist how he had managed in collecting  interviews of writers to bypass all the negro writers in the world seeing as how he had traveled some  miles to interview the writers the question of course threw mr newquist off his poise especially since it was asked in the presence of all those literary people and he turned appropriately ruddy and fumbled with words his first coherent response was that many of the writers in his book had mentioned negroes and the negro problem and we said well of course how could they avoid doing so since negroes and the problem constitute the most pressing concern in the country today we repeated how did you manage to ignore negro writers mr newquist recovered adequately enough to explain that he had indeed interviewed james baldwin but that mr baldwin didnt come off so well we smiled indulgently at that knowing james baldwin as we do and then having met mr newquist we had our own ideas as to who didnt come off so well in that interview mr newquist had no answer as to how he had missed all the negro writers in organizing his book and then when we learned that mr newquist was flying off presently to russia a dark suspicion arose in our mind why we asked was he going to russia well the good mr newquist blushed again and gave weight to our suspicions he was going behind the iron curtain to interview writers however he hastened to explain that his next book counterpoint ii would contain interviews of negro writers bully we told mr newquist it was very white of him we thought
perhaps this threeday session was a natural outgrowth of last augusts fiveday talkfest out on the monterey peninsula under the auspices of the university of california at berkeley that beseiged institution on the bay indeed the april  conference had many things the california conference lacked including james baldwin it also had all of new york city outside the new school auditorium a less cozy atmosphere and some extremely rude people masquerading as militants the new school auditorium as it turned out wasnt big enough to accommodate all the people willing to pay to hear the speakers sermonize argue harangue and occasionally enlighten and delight the star of the conference might well have been richard gilman drama critic for newsweek magazine who in effect told negro playwrights they were incapable of creating art incredibly only le roi jones even bothered to respond to him on this particular point and playwright jones who has all but ceased trying to communicate with white people mostly shrugged mr gilman away mr gilmans precise words are unavailable but their essence was this the creation of a mature artistic play demands a playwright who is free to consider the nature of being for it is in such exploration that good plays emerge negro playwrights are engaged in seeking to establish their being therefore until negro playwrights reach the point where they have no need to establish their being rather than to explore its nature they cannot create good plays consensus among many at the conference was that the ladies provided the most moving panel discussion the everlovely abbey lincoln was a joy playwright alice childress always on track rode to the heart of the matter and poet sarah wright was profound but it was paule marshall the able novelistshort story writer who most stirred the audience hers was a complex lucid presentation that put the negro woman in american literature in ripe perspective sterling brown too long submerged in the clouds of academia illustrated the kind of wit and erudition howard university english students have been exposed to all these years the crowds that roared to his sallies never missed the point at one session mr brown read a passage from robert penn warren of  years ago that would put that southern poetnovelist to shame today mr warren has just published a book on negroes not merely getting into the act but even upstaging the actors a poet and folklorist of no mean accomplishments mr brown enlivened the panel on image of the afroamerican in literature how does one describe calvin hernton  no not physically  thats easy enough he is tall slender even angular betterlooking than he knows with eyes perenially hidden behind dark glassesbut the way he comes on that boy shook up the conference arriving extremely late for the panel on poetry and polemics  he led off his assault with a quite original explanation for the souths predicament in language which was to say the very least earthy this is a family magazine so mr hernton might forgive our presuming to paraphrase him he strongly suggested that the southerners lack of access to satisfying sex was the source of all his maladjustments well now    mr baldwin delivered the keynote address on the negro writers vision for america which was the theme of the conference for those who have heard mr baldwin on other occasions and have read his work there was nothing startlingly new from himwhich is no criticism what he has to say cannot be repeated and emphasized too often although the white publicas actorplaywright douglas turner observed seems to be deaf the white public however is not alone in seeming to be deaf as black questioners from the floor found it expedient to demonstrate there was the inevitable young man who found that he had no ties with africans other than a sameness of color and there was the prim young lady who wondered why mr baldwin particularly dwelt on the less noble characters out of the ghetto sylvester leaks a writer who breathes fire told the young man he had been brainwashed and directed him to the schomburg collection in the harlem branch library and mr baldwin assured the young lady that though he patterned his writing on whores junkies and jazz musicians he too was reared by one of those longsuffering negro maids perhaps the conferences most exotic panelist was a colored lady named myrna baines who works for yes this is correct the national review she called james baldwin an extremely talented literary prostitute but not alas to mr baldwins face miss baines proved a provocative antidote to the noisy delegates from peking john o killens sparkplug of the conference told his audience that the black american is the white americans hope black writers must save america if it is to be saved he said james baldwin said that the liberation of this country    depends on whether or not we are able to make a real confrontation with our history the authors

bll rogers and aaron craig were rising writers each had published two novels a collection of essays and an occasional article each was considered a serious artist concerned with the fate of mankind they often expressed this concern on lively television programs where they discussed race problems rogers was black and craig was white once they accepted invitations to speak at a seminar at goatwater college in iowa the theme of the seminar was is there a difference between the negro and the white writer by coincidence each decided to drive to iowa bill from new york and aaron from san francisco aarons trip was uneventful he drove leisurely to vegas where he lost   at roulette and picked up a girl the next day he pushed on to denver and the day after to omaha stopping at good motels and restaurants along the way he arrived at goatwater college greatly refreshed bursting with liberal goodwill looking forward to meet ing his pal bill whom he hadnt seen since the march on washington bills trouble started before he left new york state at fishkill he stopped at a diner and asked for a hamburger the waitress told him she didnt serve niggers he laughed suavely and said he didnt want any niggers just a hamburger but she didnt have any sense of humor her cold blue eyes stared at him with such unrelenting hatred that he shrugged and left after two similar experiences he was a desperately hungry man and drove as fast as the hertz car would take him to cleveland where he ate enough for three men and packed in enough sandwiches to last him until he reached iowa on the highway again he became sleepy and began to look for a nice motel for the night but whenever bill asked for a room it seemed there werent any vacancies no matter what the neon signs outside proclaimed finally bill pulled off the highway and fell into an exhausted sleep only to be awakened a few minutes later by a state trooper whatchu doin here boy bill rogers whose books had been translated into eight languages including japanese who had appeared on cbstv and nbctv countless times protested that he was no damn boy but a man so the cop beat him on various parts of his head and took him to jail where after two days he was found guilty of assaulting an officer of the law and fined  finally bruised and battered he arrived at goatwater college just as the seminar was about to begin after a long flattering introduction he hobbled painfully to the microphone is there a difference between the black writer and the white writer youre goddamned right there is that was the last time bill was invited to goatwater college
naturally all writn v ers attempting to crei ate works of art have s problems in common whether they live in saskatchewan uzbek or hattiesburg mississippi but having affirmed this i must insist that the black writer lives in an entirely different world from his white counterpart and therefore their works are bound to reflect different realities it would be foolish to say that one writes better than the otherthats a matter of individual talentbut it does seem to me that the black writer has the advantage as far as material is concerned for his is the one story that has never been told his is the story which in every form tragedy farce comedy epic etc cries out to be heard the black writer however hard he may try cannot escape the unique experience of his people which has no parallel in modern history for  years a continent was depopulated to furnish the labour supply for another continent which has become the richest in the world those were  years of hell out of which a great literature ought to be produced the task of the black writer is to illuminate as fully as possible all the tragedy and pathos all the humor vigor and excitement which those centuries of oppression have generated he must avoid the stereotyped formula and never subscribe to dogma but he must care very much about his worknever mind what anyone else thinks never mind what the current fashion may be he above all must care so deeply that nothing can persuade him to cheapen his work this is what is meant by integrity and commitment those writers who dont care enough those who are not committed seldom finish anything worthwhile simply because they dont know where they stand finally and most important the black writer must be aware of the fact that a fierce revolution is raging in the world today nearly everywhere the little guy is trying to get the man off his back it is class against class slave against master nationalist against imperialist in the united states it is a racial war where the confines of a humans life from cradle to grave are determined by whether his ancestors came from europe or africa it has been possible for thousands of white writers to ignore this central fact of american life to the black writer it is an inescapable matter of life or death but it also offers him his richest material 
james washburn stepped out of his little house of brown wood among the other little houses of brown wood and he walked down the sidewalk into another world he shuffled over the cracked and crumbling concrete and stood on the sewer cover to wait for the bus that would take him to work and into another world people moved around him passing from one world into another and as they passed through his world many would nod and say a word and he responded in kind and then they would be gone into another world with james left in his awaiting the bus and a passerby for the worlds are overlaid on this planet like a stack of photograph negatives separate but parts of the whole and difficult to identify like holding more than one negative up to light and being unable to determine how much of the picture is in the first negative and how much belongs to the one immediately behind the people unaware that they were changing worlds would speak to james and he would respond with the youthful enthusiasm possessed by many of the elderly which was his most remarkable trait the bus came and he boarded it dropping his  cents into the glass box where the handle turned beside the driver and made a cling cling cling sound like a cash register and then he walked haltingly down the aisle while the bus pulled away from the curb with its engine straining and james took a seat at the back as was his custom in his hand he clutched the brown paper sack from the brown wooden house and in it was his lunch two sandwiches an apple a piece of chewing gum the bus trundled on and somewhere along the line he left it with a blue piece of paper that was a transfer and he boarded another bus showing the paper that vouched for his fare and he rode to work watching the buildings go by the back of the bus he left the second bus and shuffled over the neat wide squares of concrete to the building of white granite and he pushed open the large glass door rimmed with aluminum and he shuffled down the marble tile floor of the hall morning james the voice said morning mistah harris james replied lovely day yassuh what do you say we skip out and go fishing harris laughed cant do that keep up the record harris approved james had not missed a day of work in  years but he had not parried the offer to keep up the record it had been to remain content in the worlds of overlaid negatives where all things are black or white and the voice had been white and it would have required sustaining two worlds at once which could not be done  he shuffled on down the hall and the other voices acknowledged his passing and he replied with exuberant yassuhs like the machine going cling cling cling but it was yassuh it was never nawsuh james washburn was a good nigger it was not a matter of knowing his place and wanting no trouble because he had avoided an awareness of the issues it was that he expected little and was satisfied there was a tale that james had been with the company longer than anyone but the boss whothe tale wenthad won james in a poker game often he served at parties given by the boss and other executives not only for extra money but as a favor to his company friends james shuffled to the end of the hall and turned into the room where the sign on the door had said maintenance cleotis haynes big and stupid and turner phillips young and cynical awaited him they were aides to the maintenance chief james washburn the ride to the building had been made in the morning sunblaze that is early summer and the twoblock walk and the dampness not yet baked out of the atmosphere made the air of the maintenance room steamy and sticky and james began to sweat beneath the veil of perspiration he was alternately hot and cold and he pulled a large handkerchief from his pocket and wiped it against his face  hot enough for you boys he asked sho nuff cleotis said shwhew james said stuffing the sack into a locker wonder when theyll aircondition this place he had not put forth the words as a question but simply as a statement a few words thrown out in gesture to stir the air around and make the room more bearable to indicate the hope that a god unseen might bring the pleasures of modernity even to a maintenance room but turner had supplied an answer when they hire white janitors the sudden silent conflict created nervous static in the humid air james turned and saw the open door of the maintenance elevator and soas he always did first thing in the morninghe stepped into the elevator and rode to the second floor seeking a cup of coffee in the cafeteria a breath of cool air and the uncalamitous peace of a world his own james sipped the coffee and pondered what had been said minutes before but it was a passing recollection which slid away when the coffee warmed his belly he was one of the company men in the cafeteria for a morning cup of coffee in his own world in the kitchen with the younger men of higher rank in the dining room each in their separate worlds abutting architecturally then he stood and the worlds began to slide apart and he made his way down the hall again into the unmarked room separate from the hall and the other rooms and he stepped into the elevator and pushed the button as he descended he considered turner phillips james did not like what he saw and he sensed upheaval confusion and disregard for the status quo and the wonderful abutment of worlds turner and ceotis waited in the maintenance room the privilege of the morning cup of coffee in the company cafeteria necessarily denied to them not by james but by the great overlaid system of worlds where all things are black and white but the white worlds allow the good nigger to come close though he cannot enter and he can linger there on the fringe of the white world like a hapless soul standing and staring before the show window at the fine goods beyond it the rebel rejects his world as unsane and treads between worlds without his own forever in the outskirts of the system the white world reflects the man who lives in it the rebels world is rejected and it is the good nigger who reflects his worldrather than his world reflecting him cleotis james said bring the ladder lets check the lights turner go to the basement and bring up some bulbs the long kind cleotis gathered up the ladder clumsily and james led him from the room turner rode the elevator into the cool dark depths of the basement where supplies were stored and there his tension eased for he was alone where the darkness demanded no action and the coolness no penance turner languished in the peace and solitude a world temporarily his own inviolable but there remained in him the emptiness that is fear the hollowness of frailty and the fear was cold and clung like a ball of ice in his inner being for today was the day all the tomorrows were held in abeyance of the action prepared by all the yesterdays and the action would be today turner probed in the darkness and found the light switch flipped it gathered up the fluorescent bulbs turned out the light and resumed his duties at midmorning when the chores had been accomplished for the hour turner in the unobligated minutes asked james did you ever think that maybe you could be president of the company it was a question that surprised james although it had been coming since early in the morning when turner had said that the maintenance department might be physically better if white janitors were employed james turned it in his mind for it had been thoughtfully offered and then he said never seriously would you like to have been turner asked  theres no way to say james said turning away but you never had a chance did you aint you full of questions not a chance in the world turner said maybe not a chance in the world the words hung in the heavy air like a requiem a cannon heard from afar the last clear word uttered at graveside the word that goes with you always and even when it is lost in the confusion of the conscious the feeling of it still is there fresh and strong maybe youll be president james chuckled i want the chance turner said james turned further away and took a step i want a chance james i cant do nothing for you boy you can help me turner said theres nothing i can do i just work here i dont own it you can help me turner argued james touched the elevator door you know what the ceo is turner said the committee for equal opportunity they send you here james demanded i told them to leave me alone theyre working for all of us turner said they need help they cant do anything if we dont help them trouble makers james said angrily i want no part of them we got to help turner said we need you james we need everybody people will listen if we stand together you one of them why didnt you tell me before now theyre educated men turner said its all been thought out its the only sensible way we just want whats right whats right whats right james exploded how you know whats right youre just a pup you dont know nothing all that booking and studies dont tell you whats right help us get away from me youre making trouble i dont want no part of it why wont you help us turner demanded because you like washing toilets you like sweeping floors youre too scared youd rather turn your own kind in and get patted on the head and sent back to the maintenance room youre too scared i got no quarrel with nobody no reason to be afraid how much will you get a twenty cent raise get out for the last time get out youre scared turner said scornfully too scared to save yourself you wont ever be free to sit where you want to or eat where you want to because thats where the white man is i dont want to eat with the white man youll never have the chance i dont want it im black im not ashamed of it i am what i am and nothings wrong with that turner whirled from the conflict hurrying to the door and as he grasped the knob he turned back with muscles stretching angrily over his high cheekbones and his mind uncoiled the word and he spat it out through clenched teeth and with disgust nigger and he was gone james sank down on the bench overcome with the violence of the argument turner plunged out of the building and onto the large neat squares of concrete under the white sky of midmorning in early summer the air was now warm and dry and everywhere was the sunglare the heat the straight silver light and his subsiding anger left him breathing deeply and perspiring under the sun and his mind snatched up flashes of the conflict and he wondered why did james refuse but james had no motive conviction bound him and it was earnest serious sincere he felt uncausably insulted when turner challenged his reasons immutabilities do not stand on reasons the lines of thought and knowledge that crisscrossed his brain were the etchings of tradition and his mind could not suddenly transform itself into a new and fresh organism vital in its origin and undestined by habit he had not fathomed the truth of his defense it had been instinct tradition speaking for itself when he had exploded and shouted turner down i am what i am and nothing wrong with that but out in the street in the hard dry heat turner stood before a show window staring at the fine goods beyond and decided that today was still the day in the building the noon hour came and employees poured into the halls with the elevator shuttling them to the second floor where the cafeteria smelled of steaming food and there was the noise of plates utensils talk the scraping and scooting of chairs on the floor and the sound of laughter there was turner phillips standing in the doorway with a sign this company cafeteria unfair to employees behind him were other signbearers out of their worlds treading between worlds about to launch a drive to enter this new world turner sensed a retaliatory mood like bees about to swarm an alien or ants deploying to drive out an invader but he entered carrying the sign awkwardly and the others followed him taking seats the press had been dutifully notified cameras whirred and popped in the sudden stillness recording the oversystem of worlds in another moment the boss appeared in the doorway a big man  with a leathery face from which business success had not erased the look of country toughness his glare was chilling stern firm he moved out of the doorway and out of sight again james protested mightily that he knew nothing of the sitin and his mind boiled furiously over what had transpired in the room little more than an hour ago you worked for me a long time nigger but i wont put up with this the boss warned he stormed out of the maintenance room for the heat intensified his anger and he returned to the cafeteria where all was quiet again he surveyed the room and asked whos in charge i am turner said standing you work for me the boss said i might have known a flashbulb popped hows the restaurant unfair colored workers cant eat here turner said well the boss said breathing slowly theres two ways we can solve that problem no three ways we can close it up is that what you want no sir well then we can get along without colored workers is that what youd like no sir yes sir the boss fingered his thick chin a moment with a rough hand and he stared at turner and he measured the situation suppose we try it today and maybe we can work something out we appreciate that turner said but what we want is the right to eat here anytime like everybody else not just today what if we throw you out i guess youll just come back turner did not answer you better have money the boss said turner took a tray leaning his sign against the wall and he took a plate and utensils and went along the rail to where the food was displayed and the cameras were whirring again ham please he said the girl behind the glass looked beyond him to the boss ham please turner repeated and the word floated into the stillness but she looked at the boss well damn it girl what did i hire you for its okay she said meekly i guess so the boss said what about the others turner asked them too the boss said and headed for the doorway the silence broke into quiet talk and released breath and turner relished the slap of the meat on the plate james washburn opened the brown paper sack and reached inside for the sandwiches he had made in the morning the air was oppressive his hunger faded the boss rode down on the elevator reconsidering his decision which he had not enjoyed making he had not given it serious thought but he had known that it had to come there would be a reaction and some discontent of course but he wouldnt plan for that either sometimes spot judgments were the best he made he paused by the door to the maintenance room thinking maybe he should apologize to old james no he would understand james was not like this new breed james would understand he was a good nigger 
i am the white mother of a negro child this fact has brought me some problems and some heartaches but it has also brought me many joys my problems began before my daughter was born when a member of my immediate family found that i was pregnant she strongly urged me to obtain an abortion when i would not even consider it i was then advised to give the baby to its father to raise since we were separated this i refused to consider also i loved my baby even before she was born just like any mother then too i believe that while every child should have two parents to love and care for him if that is impossible a child feels more secure with the mother if she is at all conscientious no matter the difference in color i have no desire to make life easier for myself at the expense of my child since i insisted on bearing my child and rearing her i was the recipient of one more bit of advice from this same family member tell everyone that she is adopted when she is eight or so you can tell her the truth and tell her to let it be your secret people will think more of you that way this last gem of wisdom i absolutely refused to follow i am proud of my daughter not ashamed of her i see no reason to keep her a secret i want the whole world to know that she is my child whether people think less of me nr or more of me is not important only my childs happiness should be of concern by the age of eight the formative years are largely passed to lead her to believe that she is adopted and then for her to discover that her own mother lied to her to hide their true relationship could do her irreparable emotional damage since much of our true happiness in life depends on our own estimate of our worth to hide her identity would lead her to believe that there is something disgraceful about being a negro this belief set me on a road of thought which led me to a philosophy by which i hoped to raise my daughter since she is at the age of eight a happy well adjusted child in love with life perhaps the tenets by which i have raised her have some value firstly i have from the beginning not hidden from her the fact that there is prejudice in the world living in an allwhite neighborhood where she is the most popular child in the block and with the only relatives that she knows white her fathers relatives live in france it would be easy to hide this fact of life from her for the time being however since i cannot protect her forever i believe if she is prepared in advance for what she will probably have to face some day she will be better armored to meet it more importantly i want her to learn early that there are constructive ways to battle prejudice her first test of how well she is prepared to meet this contingency came in her seventh year one of the local swimming pools sought to bar my daughter on racial grounds we quickly solved that problem nonviolently by appealing to one of the race relation groups in our city the favorable outcome of this problem in prejudice gave me the opportunity to demonstrate to my child in a practical way the value of fighting back in a constructive manner if she learns this valuable lesson future experiences of this nature can not crush her spirit but can only serve to strengthen her awareness of her true worth as a human being above all i hope that she never becomes steeped in deep personal vindictiveness against persons with whom she comes in contact who personify racial prejudice that type of hate is selfdestructive it can destroy the one who hates as a reasoning human being and leave untouched the hated i have also sought to instill in my daughter a sense of solidarity of identification with the negro race two of the most bitterly unhappy people i know are women who with a background similar to my childs have sought to deny their race i believe that she will gain far greater happiness by being proud of her heritage by loving instead of hating the race with which she is identified by the people with whom she comes in contact but most of all when she is mature i think that she will know great happiness if she seeks the advancement of this race rather than trying to run away from a priceless heritage if she can achieve this sense of identification she may never experience a sense of being lost between two worlds forever a stranger to both secondly i have sought to instill selfconfidence in this little being for if she believes in herself if she realizes that she is a worthwhile person no one can make her feel inferior to this end i have put a great deal of emphasis on education we do a great deal of talking about the desirability of good grades scholarship and college i have also encouraged any natural talent that she might have artistically a deep appreciation of the creative process can give an individual a strength of spirit and mind which can help to weather many an emotional storm lastly i have sought to instill in my daughter an appreciation of the cultural things of life she has been to the theatre to art galleries museums heard music and read good literature whenever possible i have called her attention to the glories of natureto the vast peace of a starry sky to the moon in all of its phases to the soulfilling awe of a sunset i want her to realize that although there is ugliness and hate in the world there is also great beauty and this alone makes life worth living
if the magnitude of a problem is to be measured in terms of the contradictions and paradoxes it embraces then the silent explosion by philip appleman  beacon press makes a very strong case for the uncontrolled growth of the worlds population as the most critical problem facing the world the simple fact is that too many people are being born too fast another way of stating the problem is that in more than half of the countries of the world the birth rate is higher than the food production rate the results are too apparent hunger is the rule around the world and filling the void in the stomach with food is more pressing to the masses of the world than filling their heads with political theories and philosophies there are many who recognize the threat of the population explosion and the dangers it carries with it the central point at issue is what to do about the problem the obvious answer is to reduce the birth rate  contraceptives come immediately to mind and with it comes one of the strange paradoxes of the problem it seems that the two major forces against some sort of universal birth control device are the catholic church and communism each has its own reason for opposing contraception the catholic church bases its opposition to a great extent on the morality issue but dr appleman very convincingly refutes the grounds for such an argument his feeling is that overpopulation brings about overcrowded and congested conditions which naturally breed conditions directly related to immorality the communists base their opposition to contraception as being an imperialist capitalist doctrine but many of the very top officials in russia quietly practice birth control to further explore the contradictions it would be well to note that poland both a catholic and communist country has officially accepted contraception as a valid means for coping with her population problems
dr appleman is very skillful and effective in his utilization of irony paradox and contradiction to bring a point home for example he points out that it is the colored nations of the world precursors of the modern wellfed civilizations that now are the most hardpressed in the claws of hunger he further demonstrates that good deeds alone are not the answer for instance the fact that certain fatal diseases have been substantially controlled in some countries by american aid merely adds to the problem because we now have more mouths to feed than before in countries that couldnt feed their people in the first place the questions ultimately revolve around catholicism communism contraception contradiction and colored peoples until this riddle of alliteration can effectively be solved we cannot possibly hope for world peace how long can we expect twothirds of the world to go to bed hungry each night when the remaining onethird consumes twothirds of the food of the world how long can we expect empty bellies to blithely overlook the fact that americans consume  per cent more food than they need to survive is it rational to think that people will love us when they know that we store more food in a year just to keep farm prices up than they produce for their starving people is it intelligent to expect people to believe us when we say were their friends and spend billions to explore the barrenness of the moon with virtually nothing for the scientific prevention of overpopulation and starvation dr applemans book offers a very strong and penetrating analysis of the problem its readable enlightening and frightening its a must for anyone interested in the world situation humanity or the horrible facts of life in many parts of the worldbrooks johnson
national home visit day is gaining ground across the country and there is reason to expect that soon like brotherhood week it will be a national institution last year we understand there were some  cities in  states and washington dc with home visit day exchanges for the benefit of those readers not yet initiated as to the meaning of this program here is a brief resume under the auspices of local groups interested in interracial goodwill visits are arranged among a selected number of whites and negroes over tea and coffee these people sit in the living rooms of their hosts and make an effort to overcome the tensions and strains which so many americans bring to even minimal contacts with people of races different from their own the aim is to discuss problems of race which existor might arisein their communities to speak openly and honestly and make an effort to come to an understanding in human terms when one thinks of it it is plainly astonishing how few negroes and whites have had this experience it is extremely rare in this country where the two races have lived together for nearly  years to find negroes and whites who visit each others homes as friends and neighbors and only that that is what national home visit day is all about and who can argue with itwell we didnt want to argue with it in truth we were perfectly willing simply to leave it alone after all these years out here on the battle lines the inclination is to be a little cynical about all these advertised gestures at friendship and goodwill we dont go around knocking them but we dont give them much encouragement either were inclined to think that the best way for people to get along is to leave each other alone dont erect any barriers and dont do any forcing thats the way people of the same color get along and thats the way people of varying colors can get along as we said we were willing to leave national home visit day alone and then an old and good friend phoned she and another lady were driving up to the north shore to visit in a home there and wouldnt i come along no pretty please no and then she put it another way the year before the negro groups had been embarrassed because there were so few negro men taking part this year only one or two men had volunteered only negro women seemed to be carrying the ball well this is a dilemma older than national home visit day and we were moved we steadfastly refuse to add to the burdens on the backs of negro women we went the north shore suburb that we visited is one of the most exclusive among that string of restricted municipalities and we were surprised to find the home of our hostess so humble humble that is by comparison with most of the other abodes in the community the house originally a onefamily structure we surmised hadlike topsyjust growed with the owner a partiallydeaf but marvellous little lady occupying the top floor of what now was a twofamily flat the humbleness of the home was deceptive on another point as well the owner a maiden lady bore the name of one of the richest and most illustrious of americas mercantile families we were the first negroes to arrive and we were ushered into the salon where three ladies of progressive middle years and one gentleman waited they were all quite sweet as we had expected they would be and the conversation daintily touched on the weather the drive from chicago  and the welcome spring as we knew it would the civility and goodwill were all but paralyzing we were tempted several times to abandon breeding and to plunge brutally to the heart of the matter with some statement on the ridiculousness of the occasion but we refrained sadism alas is beyond us and then the other guests began arriving my friend and her entouragea group of negro ladies ranging in age from about  to very mature credited their lateness to mistaken directions and perhaps they were indeed blameless the new white guests included a couple from texas the lady one of a type to whom subtlety ordinarily seems alien but who managed to appear subdued through the early part of the afternoon the rest of the white guests were all local residents some of them we learned quite prominent in the civic and business life of chicago as well as of the suburb settled over tea and coffee and assorted sandwiches and cakes the dialogue began and abruptly our attitude changed the suburbanites drew out newspapers and petitions and related documents and described their quiet campaign to persuade their neighbors to open the community to negroes through advertisements in the local paper endorsed by dozens of their friends and acquaintances and sympathizers they had sought to illustrate that more than morality and charity were involved in welcoming negroes to live among them in the world of today and tomorrow they had argued it is imperative that people of all races and creeds learn to accept each other these people had gone from door to door broached the subject at parties and at their clubs risked alienating friends of long standing by daring to suggest that negroes be invited into the suburb they had put gentle pressure on real estate agents extracting promises that these usually solid partisans of negro exclusion would consider negro home shoppers as they considered any others the result had been astonishingly favorable for them and for us it was all but unbelievable we sat next to a thin whitehaired lady a grandmother many times over who was interested in the theater as we are and there was much to discuss she mentioned her own children of whom she was very proud and remarked that her grandchildren were being properly brought up my children grew up understanding the evil of any kind of hatred and they are passing this understanding on to their children she said they will at least get a fair start toward being equipped to live in the world we had announced upon arrival that we had to leave early and when the time came we reluctantly departed later we talked with the friend who had asked us to participate in the national home visit day ceremonies and she thanked us for our presence we had been as she expected the only negro male in the group and the negro ladies had been most grateful that there was at least one but we told her that it was we who owed her a debt of gratitude she had allowed us to discover the sincerity and courage of some white suburbanitesand she had enabled us to glimpse the image of our own embarrassing prejudice
