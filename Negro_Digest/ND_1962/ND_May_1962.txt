does integration doom negro colleges
the  supreme v court decision outlaw ing segregation in the  public schools made the negro colleges shockingly aware of the fact that they will soon be in open competition with white institutions what will happen then to the predominantly negro college does it have a future will it be needed what role will it play in american education and what will become of negro professors some people have assumed that when integration comes into full force these colleges will not be needed because negro students will flock to white institutions i believe that this assumption is false college enrollments will double in the next decade and this fact alone will assure the need for all existing institutions plus additional ones but quite apart from the enrollment increase it would be unrealistic to expect the white colleges in the south when they open their doors to negroes to recruit and welcome them in large numbers they will continue to select them very carefully and the great majority of negro students in the south must continue to look to the desegregated negro colleges for their education if these colleges do not perform the task it will not be done negro colleges however can adapt themselves to integration more easily than white colleges because they have no prejudices to overcome and no fears to subdue they are not bound by the customs and traditions of yesteryear they are free to become experimental centers for democratic education and living in the heart of the south and if negro colleges do not play this role it will not be performed any time in the near future  certain centers of negro education will become the main source of interracial intercultural and international education in the south with a faculty and student body composed of teachers and students from all over the world representing every culture race religion and nationality atlanta for example might well be one of these centers the six institutions atlanta clark the interdenominational theological center morehouse morris brown and spelmanthat make up the atlanta university center are by practice and tradition a natural for developing this kind of education for decades these colleges have been building bridges of interracial understanding and good will a score or more interracial gatherings meet on these campuses annually and this has been true for decades it cannot happen anywhere else in atlanta on such a wide scale the faculties have been integrated from the beginning speakers of all races and cultures have always been free to speak to students and faculties of these colleges white people are not segregated when they attend cultural and educational programs it seems clear that negroes are not rushing to attend the formerly allwhite colleges that have desegregated some of these were open to negroes long before  berea which began as a college open to students of all races and later became segregated opened its doors to negroes for the second time in  thirty negroes are enrolled in berea this semester st johns college in maryland began admitting negroes in  but only one is now enrolled the university of virginia began accepting negroes as undergraduates in  but only six are enrolled today meanwhile the negro colleges in these same areas are crowded with students recently we wrote to a large number of white colleges that have been reported to have desegregated since the supreme court decision of  asking two questions what year did your college decide to admit negroes to your undergraduate college and how many are now enrolled we received replies from  of this number thirtythree colleges keep no records on the race of students and sixteen accept negroes but have none enrolled eight said they do not accept negroes the remaining institutions reported that they enrolled  negroes in the second semester of the academic year  this is a start toward desegregation but the total number is small in proportion to the thousands of negro students desiring higher educaiion i believe that for some time to come the negro enrollment in the white colleges will be relatively small negroes will not go to an institution merely because it was formerly all whitethey will seek good institutions we also sent questionnaires to the presidents of the thirtythree colleges that make up the united negro college fund and the presidents of the ten largest taxsupported colleges for negroes the dominant question was what effect did the may   decision of the united states supreme court have upon your college of the thirtyeight that replied twentynine said the courts decision did not cause a change in their charters many said in effect our charter has always forbidden discrimination based upon race three said their charters had been revised to permit integration prior to  six institutions reported however that the courts decision did result in a revision of their charters to make it possible for them to admit students irrespective of race we also asked about the enrollment of white students in these colleges both before and after may   we found that nine of them had enrolled a total of twentyseven white students immediately prior to that date and that since then twenty of the thirtyeight colleges have enrolled a total of  in six years sixty of these white students have graduated these negro colleges expect more white students in the future but so far the numbers are not impressive these figures however do not include howard university which has a long record of admitting and graduating white students or lincoln university in missouri where hundreds have enrolled since  in many of the colleges for negro students the faculties have been integrated for a long time white colleges however will accept negro students more readily than they will hire negro professors and for a long time faculty integration in southern white colleges will be token of the many southern colleges and universities that have token integration in the student body i do not know a single one that has added negro professors even the few that have gone beyond token integration have no negro professors i believe that the institutions now designated negro colleges will become colleges without designationcolleges serving all the peoplebut they will not go out of existence their enrollments will grow if their future is precarious it will not be because of desegregation but because of difficulty in financing their programs if for some reason all negro colleges were abolished at the end of this academic year i believe that  per cent of all negro students now in college would have nowhere to go and the number entering college in the immediate future would be greatly reduced it will take a long time for most negroes to overcome the disabilities imposed upon them by  years of slavery and segregation regardless of his inherent ability a child cannot escape being handicapped if he is born and reared in an environment of semipoverty and semiliteracy and in homes and communities where he is culturally restricted such an environment is the lot of the vast majority of negro boys and girls now enrolled in our schools the encouragement and motivation they need to make them aspire nobly must come mainly from teachers who themselves have experienced what it means to be a negro in an integrated situation where negro and white teachers work side by side the needs of the negro student are more likely to be understood than in one where the student body is integrated but all the professors are white no college whatever its origin has a right to survive unless it is needed and unless it is willing to strive for educational excellence but many of the negro colleges are better than some white ones and the best negro colleges compare favorably with the best white colleges in their areas these will compete and will survive colleges with a long tradition of providing higher education for negroes can play two unique and necessary roles they can administer to the spiritual social economic and cultural needs of the majority of negro students and they can at the same time provide a truly integrated education that rises above the barriers of race culture nationality and faith
greatest craftsman of them all
if movies of the i oldtime heavyweight champions prove nothvy emg else they would seem to indicate beyond even a reasonable doubt that the most superlative craftsman of them all was jack johnson a rare opportunity for inspection was given when sam himmell tossed a luncheon for harry hershfisld and several writers they watched film shots from the private collection of jimmy jacobs some that had never before been seen in this country jim corbett bob fitzsimmons jim jeffries tommy bums and jess willard failed to impress but johnson stole the show it wasnt just that he was big fast clever and a deadly hitter it was the way he performed his chores he talked to the customers at ringside he laughed he clowned at the end of one round of his bout with burns in australia for the title johnson was so disdainful of his smaller foe that he pushed tommy away as the bell sounded then he broke out in a big grin good bye tommy said jack waving farewell so sharp was the clarity of the film that even inexpert lipreaders could get the message tommy got it too he was on the verge of a knockout when the police swarmed into the ring and stopped the fight with johnson the champion the film record of this fight was only recently uncovered because the two battlers could not agree on sharing the loot for the movie rights no camerasor so they thoughtcaught the action however hugh mcintosh the promoter bootlegged it he put  men on a platform to hide the peeking eye of the camera it got it all in the jacobs collection is the first showing of the highly controversial bout between johnson and willard at havana in  the only still picture that received widespread use in this country is  the famous one of johnson flat on his back and presumably shielding his eyes from the sun that proves i threw the fight said johnson afterwards a man whose scruples and morals were not of a high order but the segments of the fight that were shown yesterday gave emphasis to several points the huge willard was not the grossly inflated goon who was slashed to ribbons by jack dempsey four years later he was a trim giant who moved well johnson was then  years old not quite the magnificent physical specimen he once had been if he threw the fight however why did he go  brutal rounds under a blazing havana sun in  degree heat why did he launch assaults particularly in the th and th rounds that came perilously close to toppling willard the eyeshielding episode has been publicized to such an extent that the natural assumption was that johnson took the count and then escaped from the glare of the sun it didnt happen that way at all when willard belted johnson the elderly champion crashed down on his back by some peculiar reflex action his arms came to rest across his face when he was counted out they still were across his face into the ring stormed wellwishers to greet the new heavyweight king leaping across the still prostrate body of johnson with his arms in the same position that knockout was no phony it was for real yet johnson in his prime was a magnificent animal when he fought fireman jim flynn the man who later knocked out dempsey in one round johnson so frustrated his foe by his cleverness that flynn actually engaged in the most flagrant butting ever seen this side of a pasture filled with billy goats big jack didnt complain to the referee he pulled back his grinning face completely unruffled frank moran a topranking heavyweight found the johnson defense so impenetrable when they fought in paris that a strange thing happened when a moran punch finally landed frank stepped back and laughed in an irresistible show of delight what did johnson do he clapped gloved hands together in applause the film gave a brief glimpse of sam langford famed boston tar baby this was the first movies ever seen in this country of this uncrowned champion he too was a superb craftsman so were george dixon and george gans the fellow who came out with escutcheon most smudged was philadelphia jack obrien supposedly the paragon of boxing masters if his bout with burns is any indication the reason no one ever could put a glove on philadelphia jack was because no one could catch him he ran like a thief all the time glimpses of the collection provided a rare treat it even showed the first exhibition ever captured on film an exhibition between corbett and peter courtney on september   the cameraman was a fellow named thomas alva edison
york the slave explorer
unbelievable and mighty it lay before him the thing that had been their one netic objective through months of danger and hardship and excitement stretched away to a western horizon as unlimited and unmeasured as the vast power that came pounding and surging towards their feet while the small thrilled group of white companions watched the young man stripped off his elkskin mag shirt kicked off his pants and shoes and stood ready in his nudeness powerful arm and chest muscles lay exposed under his black skin the loins and legs were like those of some adonis sculptured in ebony he pushed his hands through close kinky hair and with a whoop of joy dashed into the breakers of the blue whitecapped sea when he came out shivering for it was novemberthere were hurrahs and resounding slaps on his back york boomed a gleeful explorer do you know you are the first black man to do it the first negro to start traveling west overland from st louisand wind up wetting his feet in the pacific there was more laughter more congratulative shouts while the shivering young athlete pulled on his clothes no one knows if he realized at that moment he was also the very first negro to a have his name recorded as part of an official u s frontier exploration in our west b be seen and known by many important north american indians c become a skilled hunter of our western buffalo elk and other big game also a rocky mountain fisherman d introduce typical negro dancing jigging buckandwing tapping and folkdancing beyond st louis e act as a trader with the indians for a governmental agency f discover species of wild life in our west g have his act of heroism recorded in an official army account of westernfrontier action who was this man york he was a man whose fantastic and colorful life began as a slave and ended in our history books he was the slave and traveling companion of captain william clark usa of the famous lewis and clark expedition to the pacific northwest in  to  being a slave only the skimpiest of records exist today on his life most are mere notations on capt clarks logs or in clark family papers apparently capt clark inherited york he had no other recorded name in  from his fathers estate clark also inherited five old negroes seven above  years three under  and three children in this group were old york his wife rose and another man named york it was the latter that became clarks invaluable aide on his explorations and a historic personage young york was beautifull v built athletic and comical records indicate he may have been born in kentucky or possibly in virginia historians say he was worth upwards of  his rather remarkable linguistic abilities remember he was an uneducated slave were acquired around st louis then the jumping off place of adventurers and furtraders york spoke french and several indian dialects only estevanico the acamor arabia negro slave of explorer narvaez who was shipwrecked in  off florida had exploring adventures to compare with york estevanico incidentally became a medicine man and linguist with coronados southwest expeditions in the s and a big dealer in turquoise and women but york was a nativeborn american before we get into yorks adventures perhaps it is advisable to recap briefly the lewis  clark expedition studied in grammar school president thomas jefferson commissioned army captains meriwether lewis and william clark to explore certain lands of the  louisiana purchase the man expedition left st louis on may   they ascended the missouri river to the mandan indian villages wintering around presentday bismarck north dakota in april  they pushed into todays montana thence into the flathead mountains of the rockies striking the snake river they reached the pacific coast near the mouth of the columbia river in november  wintering there they explored their way back to civilization in the autumn of  though a slave york was fond of his master clark treated him like a trusted companion admiring his skills york could when asked  do everything from cook to hunt he had a diplomatic gift with the indians when the chips were down he was a shrewd and welcome indian trader expedition logs repeatedly prove young squaws delighted in his companionship conversational and amorous an early log entry october   highlights yorks personality it was so windy rainy and cold in the mandan country that the two captains suspended conferences with indian chiefs nevertheless bucking the weather three great chiefs and many others came from two indian villages to watch in amazement my black servant who did not lose the opportunity to display his powers and strength    this nation never saw a black man before york put on a oneman show of calisthenics fast dancing and caricature that gave big bellylaughs to the soberest chiefs the york charm over the comely maidens is logged on the october  visit to the  lodges of recaras capt lewis and myself went with a chief to visit several of the huts people were kind and much pleased with my black servant    their women were very fond of caressing    him using yorks drawing power many of the gros ventres or big bellies came to see my black man who entertained several curious chiefs during the councils of october  in the future york would cash in on his publicity indian chiefs would return his hospitality with choicest indian maidens even their own squaws to enjoy within tribal tents for example there is the affair with the recaras whose chiefs proffered young handsome squaws for the explorers pleasure one historian says the black man york participated largely in their favors explaining that instead of inspiring any prejudices his color seemed to procure him additional advantages from the indian girls who desired to preserve among them some memorial of their wonderful stranger one recara invited york into his lodge presented his squaw to york then retired outside the door just then clark came looking for york but the gallant husband forbade molestation until his squaw signalled she had entertained york to her satisfaction then there is the meeting with the nez perces their first sight of a negro terrified them so much that they fled into the woods abandoning a papoose strapped to a board york was told to approach them cautiously then to put on his marvelous exhibition of a huge friendly man dancing and laughing with mad abandon this enticed the indians from hiding to talk to the explorers again york was rewarded with the company of a comely temporary wife months later on returning from the pacific york discovered his offspring one historian reported several kinkyhaired nez perces resulted from yorks visit  indeed legend is that chiefs tried to borrow york for mating purposes to preserve his attributes of wonderfully lustrous skin great strength and fascinating agility any virile young man can appreciate then the neartragedy that overtook the southernbred york when he endured his first northwest winter records clark on december  this day being so cold several men returned a little frost bit my servants york feet also frosted and his ps a little however future quixotic entries prove york lost none of his manpower although his genitals were exposed to temperatures lower than  degrees below zero few negroes would have remained undamaged in more academic realms york may have been one of the most important expedition members despite the oversighting historians in order to understand this it must be recalled that important guidework was done by the youthful indian wife sacajawea she and her foreign husband frenchcanadian voyageur charbonneau were hired at the mandan villages bright sacajawea with a good speaking knowledge of indian languages also was skilled in universal indian sign language her husband a wandering furtrader had taught his wife his frontier french too charles mackenzie of the thenpowerful northwest fur company explains yorks role a single word to be understood by the party of explorers meeting indian stran gers was required to pass from the natives to the woman sacajawea from the woman to the husband charbonneau from the husband to the negro york from the negro to the captains in the process indian frenchcanadian and english languages were used actually as is seen much of what lewis and clark recorded in their priceless logs was the interpretation of a negro slave when food supplies ran short the expedition cashed in on yorks appeal to indians moreover york was a shrewd and resourceful swapper the log entry of may   is typical york and squaw sacajawea proceeded to the indian village on upper kooskookie to get some roots for our party two days later they were home with several bags of roots and indian bread gotten in trades on the second of june york and private mcneal fetched home three bushels of roots and bread when all else failed york had swapped uniform buttons for food his foodgetting ingenuity did not fail even when afloat on the missouri as clark explains york dived off the deck and swam out to a sandbar to gather greens for our dinner and returned with a sufficient quantity of wild cresses or tung grass while doing this york discovered some sauk indians preparing to go on the warpath against the osages not a soldier york nevertheless was given a gun and shot for food use buffalo elk and deer geese ducks and speckled broats he fished oregons winter streams successfully during the pacific layover when meat was hard to get it was during such food forages that york as clark records discovered new wildlife species york would risk his life to rescue companions once on a june day capt clark with charbonneau sacajawea and her infant son were exploring a deep rockbound ravine york was scouting brim areas suddenly a tornadic wind with violent hail and rain struck a flash flood came roaring down the ravine charbonneau always selfish started to scramble up the rocky banks clark shouted for him to give a hand with his wife and backborne baby charbonneau only yelled back for them to hurry up and come along clark managed to get sacajawea atop his shoulder and with the churning waters at his feet began to boost her ahead of himself up the rockfaced banks the commotion had alerted york he dashed through the downpour to the rim and saw the predicament immediately he began slipping down the treacherous face of the ravine until he got alongside the endangered people then in drenching rain york used his powerful physique as a human hoist and a block against slippage soon he was literally dragging the two over the rim saving the indispensable people along with important and historic materials york the log says revived sacajawea with spirits administered from his canteen at other times york had swum mightily alongside improvised craft in treacherous mountain streams he helped with dangerous portages he was a skilled aide with an elkskin line in towing craft or helping others in hazardous alpine climbing when a homemade canoe pirogue or bullboat capsized he was the first in the water to rescue irreplaceable gear and records the warmth of yorks personality is shown by his funmaking with indian kids he spoofed that he was once a wild monster until capt clark caught me and tamed me whereupon he would start stalking off the kids swarming after him suddenly he would whirl bare his teeth and roar terrifically the kids scattered screaming in mock fear then pied piperfashion they would regroup and trail york until he would pull the same frightening gag often he would let kids wet a finger and try to rub off the black paint from a white man or dance endlessly for them when the explorers returned to st louis capt clark gave york his freedom what happened thereafter is vague and unproven one historian says clark provided his former slave with a freighting business near louisville so he could be near his slave wife zenas leonard furtrader and adventurer of  says york became a negro chieftain of the crow indians near todays yellowstone park york returned he says to this frontier from missouri about  knowing white mans ways and many languages chief york has four wives with whom he lives alternately and enjoys he says perfect peace and satisfaction    he became skilled in furtrading yorks death some say occurred in albemarle county virginia by freezing others say he died of cholera in tennessee en route to st louis to see capt clark one date  given is late december  since his death no one up to this day has fittingly memorialized yorks contribution to our countrys history but on the record there is a wonderful tribute by the nez perce indians who invested him with the name tsemooktsemook totokean black indian they said simply that of all the men in the famous expedition york was the man with the biggest medicine   
why racism hurts law enforcement
the police officer should not be guided by public sentiment in the performance of duty he should be guided by firmness fairness and impartiality it is certain that if duty is performed in a manner commensurate with these standards it will meet with public approval and commendation firmness does not mean belligerence the former is characteristic of good policing and the latter is characteristic of bad policing it is essential that the police officer act with such firmness and resolution as is necessary to deal with any given situation unless he does so it is impossible for him to command the respect that is essential to keeping the peace however he should avoid assuming an attitude that would create hostility in the minds of either those involved or onlookers the police are only one source among several that must be utilized if we would master the problem of human relations and minimize the consequences of minoritygroup tension often the police are unjustly accused of aggravating and promoting tension this arises out of their crucial and necessary constant involvement in incidents threatening public order it is likely that the police will continue to be the butt of much undeserved criticism and attack they will be damned both for what they do and what they do not do they are like minority groups a convenient scapegoat for those who have failed to accept their responsibilities in coping with major social problems they will attempt as do frustrated and insecure groups generally to deny their own failures and shortcomings by blaming the police we have noted that the police can do much to avoid this criticism however their central role in the protection and securing of civil liberties makes them a rallying point in the mobilization of all the forces of the community the police can do much to indicate the responsibility of related community elements and at the same time to bring about more public support in times of crisis the mobilization of constructive community elements to deal with tension is first an informal task the police department is in an unusual position to spot those localities where tension is rising and to make known the fact in responsible circles here it would be well to utilize the vast network and coverage of the police force in reporting the state of mind of the community every patrolman should be required to record all incidents involving minoritygroup relations in his experience these should be reported as a matter of form and cleared in the central offices of the police department such a record might include the following items  what took place  what appears to have set off the incident  where did it take place  who were the parties to the dispute and what others were involved  other details this information should be carefully examined by supervisory personnel these supervisors should in turn alert their subordinate officer the same type of report could be made available from other strategic agencies with a similar citywide coverage such strategically located persons as school teachers community workers ministers transportation employees housing directors and social workers with officials of the police department would offer comprehensive and important information on tensions and possible developments informed contacts make possible a complete and rounded picture of the communitys condition incidents nearly always occur in public and quasipublic places the police officer who has established friendly contacts with key individuals in his locality local business men tavern owners pool room operators etc can be constantly informed by them as to incidents of this kind it is absolutely essential that police officers keep close tab on the activities of juvenile gangs since it is out of the predatory acts of such groups that many of the most serious incidents of racial friction arise the experience of minority groups with police authorities has not always been a happy one indeed the negro has had good reason to look with suspicion and fear upon the uniformed officer the police authorities should not be lawenforcement officials as we  know them only with reference to the white community the police officer must treat negroes in such a manner that they will be aware of the law as an agent of the entire community the effect of wrongful treatment will cause negroes to carry over the memories of their past experience to the detriment of the whole community the only manner in which the confidence of all groups can be won is by impartial and rigorous enforcement of the law absolute impartiality requires that the law be enforced against all violators the idea that race creed or nationality are extenuating factors permitting different applications of the law must be abandoned equal justice is not merely a term the police officer who is tempted to vary his role according to personal notions as to the worth of various groups is himself in violation of the law an officer has a capacity for delivering equal justice only to the extent that he has this problem under control an unwitting evidence of an officers inadequacy is the persistent use of insulting terms such as jig nigger kike or wop an individual may insist that such a usage is not meant to be offensive such an explanation is lacking in insight for such terms are the symbols of offense and they are violently resented by the persons so labeledprotestations of impartiality mean nothing to an individual who has been so addressed to the injured person the very process of labeling means that the victims right to be treated as an individual has been violated he has been classified in terms to suggest that he enjoys only an inferior or secondclass status the use of such terms must be scrupulously avoided unequal law enforcement also has the effect of encouraging a concentration of questionable activities in certain areas these in turn become associated with the minority groups among whom they become lodged much of the commercialized vice is foisted upon the colored community by virtue of the larger communitys willingness to permit such activities to flourish there to deliberately permit questionable activities to become concentrated among certain minority groups is not only to invite the corruption of that group but it further aggravates the problem of the police in dealing with that group a good standard of fairness would be treatment of the individual in the same manner as the police officer would desire to be treated if he were the individual and the other party the police officer a good reputation for fairness in dealing with the public is an invaluable asset to a police department because it instills public confidence making police work more pleasant and effective acts of partiality are likely to result from excitement excitement in turn may be caused by any happening that would shock a normal individual he must remember that he is not a participant and must refrain from taking sides he is a law enforcement officer and must remain cool and deliberate he is interested in facts and causes which he proceeds to ascertain being very careful to follow the facts wherever they lead him and to treat everyone just the same there is no more important element in disturbing the confidence of minority groups in the enforcement of the law and building up resentment against the police authority than reports of brutality modem police science has long abandoned extreme and repressive measures in dealing with law violators furthermore it is a fundamental tenet of american law that a citizen is to be regarded as innocent until proven guilty correspondingly brutal police methods are especially disturbing since they presume the guilt of persons who may be innocent it is a mistake for a police officer to conceive of his relationship with a member of a minority group as an affair which concerns only himself and an individual minority group members invariably recite their experiences with the police in the community it follows that an instance of police brutality becomes identified with the entire police force and the whole minority group becomes hostile to all policemen each police officer as the uniformed symbol of the law is constantly shaping the attitudes and opinions of minority groups toward the apparatus of law enforcement hence while police brutality may subdue a given individual it at the same time creates hostility in the rest of the community toward the entire police force in some police circles there exists the mistaken notion that the most effective police officers for minority group communities are those who know how to handle the negro this usually connotes the use of forceful and repressive measures by an individual police officer concerning which no questions will be asked experience has proven how mistaken this is the entire police force suffers as a result of the brutal measures of an individual officer the true victims of police brutality are the police themselves since it develops widespread hostility and disrespect for law among the members of the minority group the power that men are permitted to exercise over their fellow men is rigidly limited by the laws of the community nevertheless men desire power and it is nowhere more obvious than in the unbridled actions of a mob it is incredible but true that a mob can derive a kind of satisfac tion out of beating up members of a minority group burning their homes and pillaging their places of business the members of a mob receive from these acts a sense of personal satisfaction this is related to their ordinary helplessness and feelings of unimportance in their everyday lives for the one fleeting moment of a mobs existence its members gain a false sense of personal power they have a passing chance to exercise control and take things into their own hands anyone who has seen a mob in action is well aware that it overrides reason its sense of power is like a tidal wave that sweeps over all who would resist it in addition to the adult insecurities and frustrations there are more intimate and personal experiences of childhood which affect men children often carry into adulthood the effects of damaging childhood experience the alarming amounts of adult insanity and general neurotic and unstable behavior have been partly attributed to unfortunate childhood experiences psychiatrists have pointed out that much hostile behavior in the form of race hatred and prejudice can be traced directly to childhood difficulties it is these highly emotional and excitable individuals who play a large part in crowd and mob behavior they communicate their own personal excitement to others and thus help to organize itthere are always available at any moment and in any gathering a large number of individuals such as we have described they are ready at the slightest provocation to vent their own feeling in the form of aggressive and hostile acts toward the scapegoat minority groups frustrated and insecure individuals numerous as they are are ready and willing to search out others who can be blamed for their shortcomings and failures incitement to racial tension and disturbance comes not only from the extreme right but from the extreme left as well it is important to recognize the sense in which race has become a weapon in mobilizing groups against one another in the interest of other issues which may be concealed from the minority or majority groups themselves hence the police must always be prepared to deal with artificially created incidents as well as those which develop naturally the police must here be doubly cautious since the moods and sympathies of the contending groups are played upon by persons who are calculating and deliberate if the police do not act carefully in the protection of individual rights and in complete impartiality they may become the goat in the situation and play directly into the hands of those who are deliberately fomenting racial antagonisms impartial enforcement of the law and impartial treatment of the public are essential in our society 
operation roadblock
committee y yi the citizens commit  ml mv j s o £ tee for employment  has been getting jobs    for men leaving the cook county illinois jail for the past four years some five years ago the chaplain of the jail spoke at our pta meeting his description of the conditions within the jail and of the plight of the men was so moving that john and i volunteered our services at first we began by collecting books and clothing for the men this of course was easy to do and required no involvement on our part then one day the chaplain told us that if we really wanted to help the men we should try to get jobs for them the beginnings were haphazard the chaplain called us frequently about men whom he wanted to help our mail and telephone calls were filled with requests from men in penal institutions all over the country we had many visitors at the door the need was unquestionably established but we were only two we realized almost immediately the need for a formalized program and a committee of coworkers the committee was organized and the operation formalized in order to let us concentrate on employable men who really wanted and needed a job this meant screening men who were poor employment risks or who had problems too serious to take their places immediately in society with the exception of warden jack johnson and thensheriff joseph lohman who were both extremely cooperative and willing to let us try just about anything we ran into a whole corps of unbelievers the professionals to a man said that we were not trained to work with prisoners the sociologists psychiatrists psychologists did everything but refuse outright to work with us it was true that we could not work in their fields but on the other hand we could see no reason why if we limited ourselves to those men who were good employment risks we couldnt obtain job interviews for them undaunted we began the classification office agreed to select each month  men of those being released the ones they felt were the best job risks this selection was based on men who were not psychotic narcotic addicts or alcoholics men who wanted and needed a job we decided our first step would be to get some idea of each persons capabilities we wanted to test them using a test that could be scored by laymen and could be given to the inmates in a group thus facilitating the jails moving of the men from their cells to the testing room we settled on the army beta and the otis  and  tests as well as elementary and high school tests depending upon the amount of education of the man these tests are noninterpretative and can be scored by anyone the tests are given to the group by one of the members of our committee later they are scored by other members then a group of men from our committee go to the jail and interview individually each of the men the volunteer interviewers are men who are bankers lawyers writers personnel men after a lengthy interview these men ask themselves the question would i hire this man if i were able why or why not our interviewers become very discerning in a short while and we all know we can depend on their judgment this careful processing helps to eliminate our placing any man in a job which he is unable to handle it also protects our program for if a company were to have a bad experience with just one of our men it would be reluctant to take a chance on another now comes the most difficult work obtaining appointments for job interviews for each man these appointments are obtained by women by telephone jobs themselves are hard to find women to locate job openings and then to do the work of persuading employers to interview the men are even hard er to find the time required can often be quite lengthy but so far we have always managed to get an appointment for every man recommended to us and if he can qualify for the job he is hired there are many disappointments sometimes the men dont show up for their interviews sometimes they cant qualify in the type of work they had said they could do but percentagewise and we are working with very small numbers our successes are better than most employment agencies participation in our program is advantageous to the employer too we know so much about our men we can give potential employers more information than they learn from their standard interviewing of men at the gate thus they take less risk than with average applicants we also claim to have opened up a new labor field because we confined ourselves to one area where we knew we could produce results we have been able to establish ourselves securely in this institution this brings results beyond the jobs we have found for a couple of hundred exprisoners let me give two instances of these further results we have persuaded a few companies to revise their hiring policies toward exprisoners and of course this is a continuing effort with other companies our effectiveness on this is in indirect relationship to the experience we have as to the workableness of hiring properly screened exprisoners experience  we can draw on in discussions with personnel executivesand their top management without experience we would have little effect on these men a recent specific instance of further results is a justcompleted study it is an important study that will be very valuable to us in our future work and to others in the field too we had become interested in job training for the prisoners before their release in order to discover accurately what the potential for this is a university sociologist developed for us an intensive sevenhourlong test to be given to a large group of men at the time they are admitted to the jail we were able to do this test because we had the cooperation of jail officials my point is we could have interested these officials in the study if we had not already been established in the institution known to them and having their confidence because we had been working with them for years and performing a service helpful to them and the men for whom they are responsible the main thing our work has taught us is that ordinary citizens can definitely change institutions in their community when this becomes necessary however there are a few rules of thumb to follow ones that fit the seejudgeact formula  see when people begin to study the needs of a local institution such as the jail many areas needing improvement and correc tion come into focus the institution must be observed closely to see exactly what these areas are  judge then an evaluation should be made as to how and in what area these people can best serve the institution  act concentrated successful effort in one area however small produces far more results than scattered efforts on several or all areas that need correction  a person or a committee trying to address itself to all the needs becomes a research committee which still leaves the actual correctional work undone reprinted from community
white house story
not since mary todd lincolns dressmaker caused a national uproar almost  years ago have the published memoirs of a former white house staffer created the kind of furore stirred up by the bestselling tidbits of the little washington d c seamstress lillian rogers parks published early last spring mrs parks my thirty years backstairs at the white house parted the backdoor curtains on a view of life at  pennsylvania avenue which the important guests who enter by the front door could never expect to know the publics enthusiastic reception of mrs parks newsy white house gossip swept the book onto national best seller lists and kept it there for several months it was one of the five best selling books published in  the best seller of all books published by the fleet publishing company and still a good seller in the bookshops a year after its initial publication fleet editor oscar collier said that excerpts from my thirty years backstairs at the white house have appeared in some  newspapers in the united states and in france switzerland finland belgium and holland portions of the book also were published in negro digest july  paperback rights to the book were sold to avon books for  because of the rash of similar books appearing on the heels of mrs parks reminiscences fleet agreed for the paperback edition to come out in november  rather than three months later both versions of the book are selling well mrs parks success far outstripped that of her th century predecessor elizabeth hobbs keckley whose behind the scenes or thirty years a slave and four years in the white house was published in  because mrs keckleys book revealed intimate details of the life of president and mrs lincoln the book was suppressed temporarily by the murdered presidents son robert although no effort was made to suppress mrs parks memoirs steps were taken to make such future publications less likely the white house issued a directive that domestic personnel would be forbidden from publishing such books in the future there is nothing particularly scandalous in my thirty years backstairs at the white house but the glimpses the book gives of some of the tenants of the white house are not always flattering for instance after applauding bess trumans relationship with the servants the former maidseamstress takes a polite slap at two other former first ladies she mrs truman didnt keep looking over her shoulder as mrs eisenhower did mrs parks wrote and she didnt ignore the work that was done as mrs roosevelt did    mrs truman was the most considerate first lady in recent decades the strange customs of some foreign visitors and some particularly amusing diplomatic booboos are described by mrs parks as well as some of the more dangerous hazardssuch as assassination attemptsof life in the nations number one household even the fabled white house ghosts come in for some considered attention in mrs parks light and frothy book the author of this runaway best seller is not a professional author and it was with the able assistance of collaborator frances spatz leighton a veteran washington correspondent that the book was written however mrs parks had been encouraged by her mother who before her death also was a white house maid for thirty years to jot down notes toward a view of someday developing them into a book the book is dedicated to her mother maggie rogers now that the book is a fact mrs parks is busy compiling notes for a possible second try at authoring i see so many changes here in my city she said i think there is much to tell recently i was two blocks from the white house and it was amazing to see the large mansions coming down all the old landmarks will soon be gone it makes me feel very sad because it is taking some of my best memories away in the year since her book first appeared lillian rogers parks has been almost constantly in the public spotlight in the process of promoting the book she has made  trips to new york two to the west coastwith stops in cleveland chicago and new mexico she has made almost  television appearances about the same number of radio shows and has been featured at a number of autograph parties and lectures when it is considered that little lillianas she was affectionately known at the white house is a whole inch under five feet tall and has to use crutches to get about she was crippled by polio while a child her schedule over the past year has been truly remarkable despite all the feverish activity and a continuing flood of mail and phone calls from readers mrs parks insists that her life has not really been changed substantially i still cook my own meals wash iron press clothes and clean she said i dont have time to make my clothes but i do alterations on all that i buy perhaps her new routine seems less revolutionary than it is because keeping busy is natural with her i read as much as possible even when i watch tv she explained i just must be doing two or three things at the same time i have very little social life i visit old friends on the phone or we see each other for lunch or dinner occasionally what has she missed most since the end of her tour of duty as white house seamstress for such a demure little lady the answer is surprising all the races that i intended to see when i retired she smiles shyly i simply love horses

a man who goes to bed a y drunk begets a daughr tershakespeare there is little dispute that the bard of avon £ m l or the victims of his thievery possessed a keen perception of human behavior and apparently a very poor knowledge of human biology sex predetermination has long been a favorite topic for oracles sorcerers and old wivesoh yes and parents too with the feudal and medieval laws of inheritance and particularly with respect to the enthroned royalties the question of the sex of an unborn often unconceived child was of prime importance even today the emphasis upon a male heir has been noted in some regal bed chambers the pride in the continuation of the family name is the basis for many fathers quest for a son the mendelian laws of hereditary distribution were not known until the past century and as does often happen in the absence of scientific fact and knowledge old wives tales became widely known and accepted although most of these superstitions are merely fancies of the imagination some have been scientifically investigated and a few have been found to have some logical basis preference surveys indicate most couples would like to have a boy as their first child and these same people are just as anxious that the second child be a girl in the days of aristotle they could have their druthersfor everyone knew the first egg produced a boy and the second a girl the ancient biologists neglected to specify whether the first egg to which they referred was the first egg produced or the first egg fertilized here we have what is perhaps the grand daddy of the origin of the ovum theories which have received some serious scientific attention since  this theory states that the sex of a child is determined by the origin left or right ovary of the egg on the other hand some contended it was the origin of the sperm and they were on the right track which con trolled the sex factor confusion reigned when the wrong ovary and testicle were matched but boys and girls were born all the same in the literature and legends of the world many folklore superstitions regarding sex predetermination are recorded a prospective bride of palau island has often been admonished to wear mens clothing to bed the night before her wedding in order to present her husband with a son as the first born in sweden a baby boy was taken to bed by the bride if she wished her first child to be male other tales warn that if a brides garter hurts on her wedding day she will bear only girls should the newlywed couple upon leaving the church be greeted first by a male their first child would be male too according to new england folklore a man could help determine the sex of a child by taking a doll for a girl to bed or for a boy wearing his boots or hat during coitus which brings to mind an old georgia legend that if you want a hen to hatch pullets put the eggs from the hen under a young girls bonnet the koreans believed that by turning a certain stone around once a boy would be born into the family many knew when a mother gave birth to a child on the waxing moon her next child would be of the same sex there were theories which insisted the younger the mother the greater the chances of begetting a son and in the same vein if the husband were older than his wife the possibility of a son was increased some thought the intensity of relations during conception affected the sex of the fetus while others maintained that the child would acquire the sex of the parent who had most ardently desired the baby it is very characteristic to find similar folktales in which requisites or results are reversed this last theory is a contradictory variation of starkweathers law of crossheredity the sex of the child conceived will be the opposite of the sex of the stronger parent the hypothesis does not seek to define the form of strengthmuscular virility character longevity desire before the universalor almost soacceptance of the idea that sex as all traits was determined at conception people believed the sex of the unborn child could be influenced by the diet of the mother undernourished women naturally gave birth to young tadpoles eating lots of meat and other protein foods would insure a male heir while mother gooses sugar n spice would produce a girl a news items from iran called attention to the fact that the shahs wife farah had included many nuts and herbs in her diet during her pregnancy it would seem to have had some coincidental bearing upon the recent birth of the long awaited heir to the thronea french physician dr drelincourt published in text in  in which he described over  common superstitions about sex predetermination these the good doctor held to be pure bunk and proceeded to expound a theory of his own whereupon someone was wont to note that the number of foolish ideas regarding the regulation of the sex of unborn children had now been increased by one not entirely in the realm of folklore are the interesting figures collected by statisticians regarding certain conditions which seemingly are more conducive to the conception of either sex perhaps the idea that if a man spends much time in the sun he will beget a daughter can be traced to a survey of children born to greenhouse workers figures indicate the number of male births increases and supersedes the number of girls immediately after wars insufficient feeding breeds more male tadpoles than female frogs were told according to one figure finder who did his research in buenos aires argentina around  parents of mixed racial strains produced more boys than girls many undoubtedly in disgust finally gave up any hope of choosing the sex of unborn children and were content with early determination of the sex of the fetus once it was thought pains on the left or right side indicated a female child obviously an offshoot of the ovarian folklore more of this idea is carried over in some of the french folk medicine if the right breast of the woman were larger than the left or if she threw her right leg forward in walking a boy was to be born it is said some doctors suspended rocks by string or used their pocket watch to determine sex if the object were noted to swing in a pendulum arc or clockwise the mother could expect a boy contrary wise a circular or counterclockwise motion indicated a girl one person currently engaged in medical research claims a similar method is used with a great deal of success the motion or nonmotion of a suspended magnet determines the sex of newly born mice a cornwall legend determined sex by using a shoulder of mutton but pig has been reported from other areas one was to clean all the meat from the shoulder at the evening meal then the blade was held to the fire until scorched using the thumbs a hole was made through which cord was passed the bone was then hung over the kitchen door accordingly the child would be the same sex as the first person exclusive of family members to come through the door if the number of letters in the proper names of the parents and those in the month of conception were added and then divided by seven an odd quotient indicated the child was male  some thought the father would be sick the first three months of his wifes pregnancy if the child were a boy during the fourth month one could determine sex by grabbing a cat by the tail and flinging it into the air if the cat landed on its feet the fetus was male even suetonius records that livia mother of the emperor tiberius took an egg from a brood hen and warming it successively in her hands and those of her servants successfully prophesied a male heir when she hatched a finecombed chick in this area too old superstitions have been displaced by modern techniques chemical tests and biological assay methods are helpful in determining fetal sex as early as two weeks after conception a few folktales have found some justification through scientific investigation although in some cases these hypotheses are rejected altogether and in others not widely accepted experimentation of the effect of body temperature the time of mating the time of ovulation the origin of the ovum or sperm and the alkalinity of the vagina have some logical basismore so than stones and phases of the moon couples who have not been successful in childbearing are sometimes advised to try the temperature method based primarily upon investigations with rats this method suggests a definite body temperature pattern which is repeated at regular intervals when the body is at its highest temperature or the female is in heat ovulation occurs this hypothesis of the correlation between body temperature and ovulation serves as the experimental basis for the effects of temperature time of mating and time of ovulation theories regarding sex determination    but if you are nonplussed by science and newfangled ideas and that first child or the sixth after five girls must be a boy then furnish the bride with a baby boy and a complete outfit of mens clothing on her prewedding night time coitus to occur about one and a half to two hours following maximum body temperature present the

has organized labor failed the negro worker 
n the late nineteen thirties and early forties during the phenomenal rise of the congress of industrial organizations there was a great hope for negroes within organized labor with the rapid growth of industrial unions in the basic mass production sectors of the economy where tens of thousands of colored workers in steel automobile rubber and packinghouse plants joined cio unions on the basis of equality there was reason to hope that the old line afl craft union tradition of racial exclusion and segregation would be thrust aside in the forward surge of the new industrial unions but unfortunately the course of events i n the past decade and especially since the merger clearly indicates that the social consciousness of the industrial unions with their sensitivity to the problems of the negro wage earner have now all but totally vanished instead trade unions are responding like other conservative institutions in american society to the new demands of the negro for full equality and recognition of individual ability in the early years of the s the leadership of the cio repeatedly joined with the negro community in publicly condemning the vicious racism of several major afl unions when they abused negro workers this occurred for example when the international brotherhood of electrical workers upon becoming the collective bargaining agent at the bauer electric company in hartford connecticut demanded that all negro electricians be dismissed from their jobs as negroes could not be admitted into membership when the boilermakers union forced negro workers out of their jobs in several shipyards and the similar action of the international association of machinists at the boeing aircraft company plant in seattle in its time the national cio filed amicus curiae briefs in support of litigation initiated by negroes and assisted in a variety of ways the protests of colored workers against the operating railroad brotherhoods and other discriminatory labor organizations but this has long since come to an end the industrial union bloc in the aflcio hardly differentiates itself from meany and the building trades council on racial issues the leadership of the industrial union department remained silent when randolph as the spokesman for negro trade unionists was repeatedly attacked by meany and they voted with the rest of the aflcio executive council in denouncing randolph and in rejecting proposals to eliminate discrimination and segregation in affiliated unions in addition many  of the former cio unions have themselves compromised especially in the south with antinegro practices it appears that on racial issues the industrial unions have made their peace with the narrow and bigoted afl craft tradition there was a time when they challenged that tradition but today they remain silent and acquiesce as organized labor becomes more conservative and rigid unable to organize vast new industries and basing itself upon an increasingly small and limited section of the work force in the united states the aflcio has greatly compromised the social objectives declared at the time of the merger in  and in addition has not realized the basic collective bargaining goals it set for itself at that time thus today the militant negro worker is confronted not with a trade union movement that is a force for social change but on the contrary with a national labor organization that has become a very conservative and highly bureaucratized institution closely allied in many cities and states to reactionary political forces and defending that status quo which is now directly attacked by the negro in virtually every area of american life a significant manifestation of organized labors conservatism on noneconomic issues is the rigidity of antinegro practices in many important unions the refusal to yield on racial matters to bitterly resist change in the status of negroes is responsible for the fact that today many trade unions lag behind the progress made by other institutions in the community in east st louis illinois and tulsa oklahoma for example negro children attend integrated schools during the day but their parents attend segregated union meetings at night if they are admitted into labor unions at all recently a philip randolph called for a crusade to desgregate the southern aflcio state conventions and city central bodies and stated that this is a problem probably not less significant or difficult than the desegregation of public schools in the south there is a deep distrust among many negro wage earners and others within the negro community toward trade unions it is a distrust well founded on experience for today as in the past there is a profound disparity between the public image presented by the national aflcio and the daytoday realities as experienced by many negro workers this is true in the north as well as in the south there are some few exceptions especially in the mass production industries where historically there has been a large concentration of negro workers and in some unions such as the united automobile workers uaw and the united packing » house workers upw where there is an ideological sensitivity to the negro question but for the negro in major areas of the economy in the building and construction trades the railroad industry among the boilermakers oil and chemical workers and machinists in pulp tobacco and paper manufacturing in metal working in the printing trades and in many other industries highly unionized for a long period of time trade union practices are characterized by a broad pattern of discrimination and segregation the pattern of union responsibility for job discrimination against negroes is not limited to any one area of the country or to some few industries or union jurisdictions but involves many unions in a wide variety of occupations in manufacturing industries skilled crafts railroads and in maritime trades as for example the seafarers international union which operates union controlled hiring halls on great lakes ports such as duluth chicago detroit buffalo and cleveland over the years negro members of the seafarers international union have repeatedly protested the systematic practice of dispatching negroes for menial jobs only as mess boys in the galley but to no avail as the union continues discriminatory job assignments in its hiring halls on occasion after much protest one or two negroes have been admitted into an allwhite local union as token compliance with a state or municipal fair employment practices law as with the international brotherhood of electrical workers in cleveland the bricklayers in milwaukee the railway clerks in minneapolis but this is essentially a limited and strategic adjustment to community pressure and represents very dubious progress after six years of protest and the threat of legal action by the attorney general ibew local  in washington d c gave one negro a temporary work permit the ibew in most cases excludes negroes from membership in the key local unions having jurisdiction in construction installation thus because ibew local  in washington refuses membership to nonwhite persons negroes were prevented from working on the construction of the aflcio national headquarters building the new house of representatives office building and other public and private construction in the nations capital local  remains a lilywhite union there are also many instances where unions have removed the lilywhite exclusion clause from their constitution as a public relations gesture but continue to exclude negroes from membership by tacit consent as long as union membership remains a condition of employment in many trades and crafts and qualified negroes are barred from union membership solely because of their color then trade union discrimination is the decisive factor in determining whether negro workers in a given industry shall have an op portunity to earn a living for themselves and their families this is especially true in the construction industry where aflcio building trades unions exercise a high degree of control over access to employment in the south and especially in alabama and georgia this situation is further compounded by the fact that white citizens councils and the ku klux klan began taking control of some important aflcio affiliates soon after the supreme court school segregation decision in  following the federations practice of avoiding internal conflict on racial issues these local unions have been permitted to become virtual extensions of segregationist organizations white citizens councils kkk and other racist organizations make no secret of their recruitment activities among union members negro members have only to read the local newspapers in montgomery and savannah the ku klux klan advertises its meetings in the carpenters union hall and in these two cities as well as in others officials of several building trades unions are known klansmen newspapers have also printed reports and pictures of union officials speaking at white citizens councils and klan meetings and the point has hardly been lost on the negro worker during the yearlong negro bus boycott in montgomery alabama leaders of the montgomery building trades council and of the montgomery bus drivers union repeatedly led the attacks against the negro community and on several occasions were identified as klansmen in macon georgia the klan meets in a local union hall and has repeatedly intervened on behalf of white workers where there have been grievances filed by negroes alleging violation of seniority and other rights by white workers in savannah the carpenters union hall is the central headquarters for the white citizens council and is so listed in newspaper ads placed by the council the same situation obtains in lithonia georgia where the kkk and the stonecutters union share the same meeting hall no wonder then that negro workers throughout the south feel increasingly alienated from organized labor recently they have shown this by voting against union certification in several significant elections conducted by the national labor relations board aflcio affiliated unions engage in four categories of discriminatory racial practices these are outright exclusion of negroes segregated locals separate racial seniority lines in collective bargaining agreements exclusion of negroes from apprenticeship training programs controlled by unions the brotherhood of railway and steamship clerks which operates many segregated local lodges in northern as well as southern cities is among the important international unions responsible for a i broad national pattern of segregation in the brotherhood the existence of more than  segregated allnegro locals with separate racial seniority rosters limits job mobility and violates the seniority rights of thousands of negro union members this union has persisted in its racist practices despite repeated protests from negro workers and community organizations on april   the new york state commission against discrimination ordered the merger of the lilywhite george m harrison lodge  and the allnegro friendship lodge  the white union refused to comply and the local lodges remain segregated to this day similar situations exist in chicago where negro workers are in segregated local lodge  and in tulsa oklahoma where they are in local lodge  in east st louis and st louis there are  allcolored lodges and  allwhite lodges which function through segregated joint councils ironically the president of the brotherhood of railway and steamship clerks george m harrison is a member of the civil_rights committee of the aflcio and a federation vice president    soon after the merger of the afl and cio in  two international unions were admitted into the federation with lilywhite exclusion clauses in their constitutions although this action was clearly in violation of the policies an nounced at the time of the merger agreement they were the brotherhood of railroad trainmen which later removed the clause and the international brotherhood of locomotive firemen and enginemen which did not in november  the brotherhood of locomotive firemen and enginemen successfully defended its exclusion of negroes from union membership in a suit brought by negro firemen against the union in the federal district court in cincinnati ohio oliphant vs brotherhood of locomotive firemen and enginemen despite many appeals the national aflcio refused to intervene or make any public comment and this union continues to exclude all negroes from membership on october   negro workers in st petersburg florida and memphis tennessee filed affidavits with the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity against the brotherhood of railway trainmen aflcio in these complaints it was charged that the trainmens union conspired with the atlantic coast line railroad and with the st louissan francisco railroad company as well as with other railroads to have all negro brakemen classified as porters that competent negro railway workers are consistently denied opportunities for promotion and advancement that because of improper job classification they are discrimi nated against in wages and that the brotherhood of railroad trainmen a union that is authorized and recognized by the atlantic coast line railroad is a lilywhite union and that said union accepts only white employees as members obviously when the brothererhood of railroad trainmen removed the caucasian only clause from its constitution in  this was done mainly for public relations purposes since the union continues in most cities to exclude qualified negro railroad employees separate lines of seniority promotion constitute yet another injustice to the negro worker these are negotiated into collective bargaining agreements effectively denying negroes equal seniority rights with white workers and preventing them from developing skills the result is that negroes are unable to rise from unskilled and menial jobs into more desirable classifications negro workers employed at the sheffield steel company in houston texas were forced to initiate litigation against the united steelworkers of america and the company and as a result succeeded in eliminating the most extreme features of the separate seniority lines in the union contract very slow and isolated progress has been made in a few other instances as a result of protest by negro workers and action by the naacp nevertheless the fact remains that the pattern of such discrimination remains practically intact in southern industrial operations where trade unions hold collective bargaining agreements many thousands of negro workers who are members of aflcio unions in southern paper mills chemical plants pulp works oil refineries steel plants and in tobacco factories suffer the acute disadvantage of separate lines of progression in lake charles louisiana for example the metal trades department of the aflcio is directly responsible for negotiating such clauses in its union contracts with several major oil and chemical refineries collusion with management in regard to unequal seniority rights is common typical offenders in the rapidly growing paper manufacturing and pulp and sulphite industry in the south are to be found at the huge union bagcamp paper corporation savannah georgia where all the negro workers are limited to membership in two segregated locals local  and  affiliated to the international brotherhood of pulp sulphite and paper mill workers all white workers hold membership in local  and  of the same union and local  of the  united papermakers and paperworkers union similar conditions exist at and in virtually every plant organized in the south by the united papermakers and paperworkers union and the international brotherhood of pulp sulphite and paper mill workers in these and many other paper mills throughout the south these two unions hold joint collective bargaining agreements and maintain a rigid pattern of racially segregated local unions with separate seniority lines limiting negro employment to laborer classifications the harmful consequences of rapid technological change and automation upon the unskilled negro wage earner is compounded by the exclusion of negroes from apprenticeship training programs because there exists a disproportionate number of negroes in the unskilled labor force a disproportionate number of negroes are being permanently dismissed from jobs as a result of automation and other technological change it follows that the plight of these unskilled negroes can become an economic disaster for the entire negro community where these workers are not permitted to learn new skills ie where they are excluded from apprenticeship programs and other forms of technical training such exclusion is widespread in the north as well as in the south according to recent studies no significant breakthrough has been made by negroes in those craft unions in the building trades or in the railroad operating brotherhood which have traditionally excluded nonwhites in the tenyear period from  in the state of new york the increase of negro participation in building trades apprenticeship training programs rose only from  to   in most of these programs the role of the labor union is decisive because the trade union usually determines who is admitted into the training programs and therefore who is admitted into the union almost equally exclusive are the printing trades unions with exceptions being found in some areas of the assistant printing pressmens union and the lithographers union open access to plumbing and pipe fitting apprenticeships controlled by the plumbers union is a rare experience for a young negro in the north as well as in the south similarly negro youth are almost completely excluded from apprenticeship programs operated by the sheet metal workers union the ornamental and structural iron workers the glass workers the tile setters the machinists and the bricklayers union the exclusion of negroes from apprenticeship programs controlled by aflcio craft unions prevents thousands of young people from realizing their full potential and dooms them and their families to a marginal existence it is in this area of apprenticeship training that the disparity between the public relations pronouncements of the aflcio on civil_rights and the daytoday reality for negro workers is most sharply delineated many traditional sources of negro employment the nations railroads and massproduction in dustries for example are rapidly disappearing as a result of automation and other technological changes in the economy today the status of the negro wage earner is characterized by drastic change and crisis thus the virtual exclusion of negroes from apprenticeship and other training programs forces them to remain as marginal employees in the economy they are the ones who are hired last and who can be dispensed with easily with the added advantage that their displacement can be rationalized in terms of lower attainments in craft skills the concentration of unskilled lowpaying jobs with a lack of employment stability together with other income limitations such as denial of access to union hiring halls in the building trades and separate racial lines of seniority promotion in collective bargaining agreements all contribute to an explanation of why negroes constitute a permanently depressed economic group in american society    in the dramatic and historic conflicts in little rock in front royal virginia in tuscaloosa in montgomery and elsewhere organized labor did not meaningfully intervene on the side of the embattled negroes all too often local labor groups were involved with the white citizens council or the ku klux klan this fact has not been overlooked by the negro leadership and by the entire negro community whose views on organized labor are not based on any theoretical assumptions about a mythical trade union movement but are rooted in the painful realities of daytoday trade union practices of course pious resolutions proclaiming shock and dismay were adopted at labor gatherings in washington miami and new york but no action of any consequence was taken where it really mattered instead when confronted with their conservative and donothing record by negroes the labor leadership invariably responds with hostility or crass paternalism as they privately explain that these negroes are going too fast and after all they should appreciate what we are doing for them the negro is now making the same demands upon organized labor that are being made upon all other institutions and it is certain that the attacks upon racism within trade unions will proceed with the same intensity as against other groups in the community the negro struggle is emerging as the really important and decisive issue of conflict and confrontation throughout the united states and it may be well that the fight of negroes for equal treatment and leadership responsibility within trade unions will become the basis of a renewed effort for internal union democracy and for a halt to further stagnation and decay the protest against racism within organized labor may become the rallying point for the regeneration of the american labor movement if this is to occur it will be the responsibility of the best elements among white trade unionists to join with negroes and vigorously support their demands but for the moment it is evident that the aflcio and all other institutions will be judged by the negro on the basis of their actual daytoday performance and not on the exercise of empty ritual

assume that of the biological descendants of the anglosaxons they relate to and long to be a part of the elusive and hostile white world whose norms are taken as models of emulation likewise the white world is to them a looking glass for taking stock of their personal behavior they acquire in this way what sociologists call a looking glass self an image they must keep on grooming to make what they think the white society thinks they are accord with what they themselves would like to be more and more like whites for several years now in diverse localities throughout the country i have been subjecting members of this group to casual but intensive observation i have watched them close up in their private lives for many were and are close friends relatives and neighbors as well as in public places from both the private and the public perspective i discovered that black anglosaxons fall into typical categories  the imagemakers imagemakers are dithered by their belief that all negroes have to do to break down discrimination is impress the white community with proper public manners and the sincerity of the negroes quest for integration they are constantly fearful lest whites think they are prejudiced against whites or have a preference for negro companionship thus it is more or less mandatory for negroes to spread out when in an integrated gathering to keep whites present from thinking we segregate ourselves points of worry for imagemakers may crop up in many facets of their lives while such groups as italians boast of their spaghetti and meatballs for example negro imagemakers may privately consume huge quantities of lowincome southern foods but disown the practice in public many imagemakers will never buy watermelons when white persons are in sight and i have seen them sit in restaurants mouths watering at unsuspecting whites seated before large red slices of melon which the imagemakers long for but cant bring themselves to buy chitterlings likewise are a basis for hypocrisy although some of the best chitterlings still are to be found in negro kitchens the black anglosaxon housewife typically seeks to hide her appetite for them most take extreme pains to safeguard knowledge of their menu from neighbors this is especially so in integrated apartment dwellings such other staples as mustard greens and blackeyed peas also are privately enjoyed but publicly shunned before whites  the mimics or copycats close kin of the imagemakers mimics are especially prevalent among school teachers and white collar workers they chronically mimic white mannerisms in the quest for a feeling of similarity or closeness to their white ideal a white accent for example is to them honorific because it is taken to represent a high degree of association with the better class of whites in the effort to talk like a white person mimics effect a snarl or twang imitative of whites when talking publicly or to strangers though if you listen long enough you are likely to hear an i pronounced ah plus other telltale signs of their lowly southern origins this enthusiasm for aping white behavior pervades the most personal intimacies of their lives married mimics for example are prone to hold up white men or white women as ideals to their mates when a male mimics wife does something that bothers him he is likely to tell her wouldnt nothing do that but a colored woman by the same token when a female mimic is peeved by her spouse she also talks about his heredity or makes the declaration that his type is no account in general anyway  the cultured with the increasing value of education in society and the rising educational attainment of negroes the importance of the college degree has soared to the highest some social scientists detect a degree class those individuals who derive their prestige from the sole fact that they hold degrees but inasmuch as such persons typically are employed as school teachers social workers and church pastors their salaries are often lower than such  uneducated negroes as the steel mill hands this leads to some dilemmas and resentments every janitor for example has found it necessary at some time or another to tell off some of the high class tenants for trying to boss him around the degree class is seldom interested in scholarly matters however except superficially books in fact would seldom enter their homes were it not for bookofthemonth clubs even this is no guarantee that the books will be read yet those of the homeowning variety are beginning to acquire studies usually equipped with plush bar facilities relaxing couch and a small book stand conspicuously placed and containing a couple of shelves of textbooks salvaged from college days the chief activities performed in these studies are drinking cat naps and lounging called relaxing in that order at a typical house party of educators a budding discussion will quickly disperse the inhabitants of one room into another where they may resume their efforts to learn the latest teenage dance crazes such as the madison the twist and the chachacha it is true that the twist has demonstrated some capacity for arousing the energies of most negro and white adults but its acceptance by the whites is taken by the black anglosaxon as an irreproachable justification for his own enthusiasm was she a negro or an old white man really made me mad today thus many are able to grow up and take pleasure in the boast that they never knew there was a difference made between negroes and whites until they got grown or reached the age of say  or was going on  in general the secluded seem to think that the sooner they forget they are negroes the sooner whites will too the foregoing are by no means all of the categories but all have in common an almost pathetic clamor to gain acceptance in the general american society perhaps subsequent to the day when this has been accomplished the black anglosaxon too will disappear from the north american scene
the secret storm
as she looked at the y magnificent peace  roses which centered the speakers table dr gale claren guest of honor fought down an impulse to reach out and pull off a leaf just onelike she used to snip a spicysmelling leaf from her grandmothers straggly geraniums in their rusty tin cans the crowd was clapping and smiling and the applause and the smiles were for her how amazing gale thought this hotel ballroom on a stormy night    this interfaith interracial banquet with jew and gentile catholic and protestant white and negro  teachers clergymen businessmen members of city council representatives from the y boards the womens clubs the junior college    the thunderous applause and the storm lashing at the windows gave way to sudden quiet as the evenings program began gale tried to keep pity from her eyes while she watched the young singer whose trembling hands could scarcely hold her sheet of music i must have looked like that at twenty she thought poor skinny little black girl in her sleazy silk dress which doesnt quite fit poor scared    but panic left the girls eyes as her rich contralto rose he plants his footsteps in the sea and rides upon the storm joy and belief rode the storm with him as the girl offered up her last stanza as though it were a gift being laid upon a sacred altar blind unbelief is sure to err and scan his work in vain god is his own interpreter and he will make it plain plain the word disturbed gale as she looked down at her hands square black replicas of hands which had been an alabama slaves and rebellion surged through her as she thought grannie grannie you deserved applause and banquets and honors but it is i who have them along with a phd and an lld along with a lace dinner gown and a corsage of yellow orchids even god cant interpret that not to me he cant god if there is a god knows im nothing but cheating trash the head of the ymca a handsome viking with a yellow crewcut began speaking of what dr claren had done for children and youth the lives of his own small sons he said were inestimably safer because of dr clarens work which had made the city more nearly what a city aspires to be the public playgrounds he said should be renamed clarengrounds for the woman who had persuaded the city fathers    again the crowd clapped and the thunder the pounding rain the lashing trees clapped with them gale turned the stem of her goblet thinking grannie used to wait for me there by the well so she could let down the old warped bucket on its frayed rope and get me a cool drink when  came home from school she used to tell me not to be scared of storms but now im scared scared of the storm outside and scared of the storms within    a dowagerlooking man president of the school board began paying his tributes he talked of the summer camps the preschool nurseries the gale claren high school all of which he said had grown out of dr clarens love of knowledge in torturous detail he sketched her early struggles against sickness against poverty against a slowly aroused public he talked of dr clarens work with the juvenile court and of the resultant channeling of the terroristic west end gangs into useful citizenship until now the entire city counted it a privilege this night to honor the woman whose inborn love for learning   inborn gales fingers gently outlined a butterfly woven into the linen damask of the banquet cloth    inborn gale saw herself racing from the small shack of a schoolhouse common throughout the rural sections of the south during her childhood saw herself as a tiny black girl wearing a pinafore made from an unbleached floursackracing to her grandmothers to teach an old old woman how to read and write she saw her grandmother smoothing down her stiffly starched calico apron over her billowing lap as she said youre a great woman galey only six years old and already youre a great woman cause you can read cause you can learn me dont never quit galey dont never quit till you can read words longern my arm longern my arm galey and dont you never quit learnin other people neither dont never quit inborn love of learning indeed gale smiled thinking inborn love of showing off inborn love of being called a great woman a flash bulb went off and there was her smile ready for the morning newspapers thunder shook through the room and echoed sickeningly in gales heart we aint poor white trash grannie used to say course we aint quality white folks neither but we aint white trash and we aint black trashhow fiercely she used to add thatwe aint black trash what goes to lying and cheating and stealing galey not never recollections of her aged grandmother were no longer steadying like tearing winds thought of the picture which would be in the morning newspapers and of the caption which would appear under it shattered gale almost moaned aloud oh grannie grannie there are ways of lying and cheating that you never even dreamed of and i can not bear it i can not bear it seeking shelter in her program gale saw that the next speaker was dr everson harvey head of the psychology department at rogers junior college she knew what he would say he would stress the fact that dr claren had built her whole approach to the handling of problem children on love that she had built it on love when this was considered a new approach    the storms within her quieted gale found a moments peace in thinking of the many magazine articles and books she had written on love of the speeches she had made and the tv and radio programs on which she had appeared all giving love as the answer the only answer to interpersonal relationships to interpersonal conflict and because dr claren has so firmly established her own life on love said dr harvey because hers has been so deeprooted so outwardreaching so abounding a love this amazing woman has overcome almost insurmountable obstacles dr harveys words slashed through gales broken defenses so well she knew that the love on which her life had been built was a limited loveif indeed it could be called love at all she wondered when did i turn into poor lying black trash when did i lose grannie and grannies teachings andgrannies god when did i starthating she could not remember any hatred within her until after grannie died and the family had come north then over her parents vigorous protests gale had begun walking four miles to attend the nearest high school that first fall a civic group had sponsored an essay contest subject democracy and she had won gale had won first prize five dollars gale now wondered could a little halfstarved colored girl have meant prizewinning words on democracy at any rate she had received the five dollars and along with it a bitter piece of knowledge no mention of the prize was made at the high school convocation no mention of it later in the school paper no mention at all    this gale now realized must have been the beginning of her hate the smiles she saw that next saturday as she spent her incredible fortune at the methodist rummage sale must have added something to that hate amused smiles followed her about as she picked out a purple sweater for her mother a plaid wool suspender  outfit for her threeyearold sister a white shirtgood all but the cuffsfor her father to wear on sundays shoes for her two brothers measured so carefully by paper patterns she had made by tracing their wornthrough soles and for herself a cerise silk blouse amazingly like the sleazy silk dress which tonights young singer was wearing   so very faint were these beginnings of hate that they might never have grown at all if it had not been for the drama festival gale had been chosen for the cast of a play written and directed by a prominent society matron of the town after several private presentations of the play the authordirectors friends persuaded her to try entering her prodigies in the city drama festival gale felt tears sting her eyes as she remembered those wonderful weeks of rehearsal and the final tea given for their allnegro cast by what her grandmother would have called quality white folks pink candles in silver candelabra bluebells and heather and pink roses in a silver bowl a tablecloth with lace squares set into it and knights in armour worked right into the lace sandwiches with the crusts cut clear off arranged on silver trays and the quality white folks treating five young negroes treating little galey morton in her rummage sale blouselike equals she remembered the applause as the curtain had gone down on their play at the drama festival    the festival was now wholly superimposed on the present banquet scene gale once more heard the judge who was her high school civics teacher commenting briefly on each of the ten competing plays this play with its allnegro cast she said of theirs this play is the best example i have ever seen of stage presence under difficult circumstances i am sure none of you realized that the babys crying and having to be taken off stage was not in the script or that all four ad libbed until cynthia gales name in the play could return with the quieted baby or that cynthia herself ad libbed the team work and the stage presence of the entire cast was amazing to say nothing of their acting i think we all recognize that this play was of professional not amateur standing and the people those white people had clapped until it seemed they would never stop is it that remembered burst of applause or this present clapping which now hurts my ears gale wondered and is it that remembered hate or what that hate has grown into which now engulfs me for after the intermission when the winning play was to be announced a man came out to report that the judge had taken suddenly ill and that honors would have to be announced through the newspapers the toastmaster of the banquetthe young ymca leader with the yellow crewcut scraped back his chair as he rose gale welcomed his bringing her back to the present occasion after all nothing said here could hurt like these memories he was speaking again about race prejudice saying it was time for all americans to wake up and see the writing on the wall    gales sick thoughts flooded back to the past little galey morton at fourteen for all that she looked scarcely ten saw the morning newspapers writing on the wall    their play was not first not second but honorable mention the paper went on to say that the first prize would represent the city in the state finals the second serve as alternate gale remembered the two plays she remembered the small amount of applause they had called forth she remembered    hate hate over being pushed back into place unfairly hate over knowing why    hate centering on her teacher who tried next day to explain that a baby in the cast made their play too risky to represent the city in the state finals    hate that made a little colored girl gather up her school books and take them home hate that made her burn them in the rusty potbellied stove hate that kept her from eating from sleeping hate that finally sent her back to school determined to show them hate that grew and grew on to the day when after crying a long night through over a telegram which regretted young lieutenant clarens death in combat gale had gone to take her senior college examinationsgone on a city bus where two women were loudly objecting to niggers being allowed    gale clarens life built on love oh no she thought sickly built on hate for anyone and for anything and for everything which hurts my people and if my life has been built on hateas it has then it means that all these speeches and awards are false and that i myself am nothing but a lie personified soon this evening this unbearable evening which has been so much worse than i could have dreamed will be over soon  can stop smiling and pretending to listen soon i can go home and put my yellow orchids in the refrigerator lay away my lace dinner gown get into bed and maybemaybe sleep    but first she must listen to the old baptist preacher of the small church which still held her membership her nominal membership he had seemed to her an old man a very old man all those years ago when she had first come north stooped shoulders and wisps of kinky white hair making him into a caricature of the uncle tom in the stowe novel he came slowly and painfully to stand before the microphone will he be able to live through a speech gale wondered  and will i be able to live through whatever he may say he  he used to know me so well    the good book the old man began in his quavering voice the good book talks about folks who are fruitless trees and waterless clouds and wild waves of the sea it says they walk in the way of cain brother jude tells all about them and he knew he knew them fruitless trees wouldnt never go to bearing any fruits of the spirit he knew that gale had forgotten the dramatic force of the man if she had ever thought about him at all it was with the sentimental nostalgia that looks back to remembered pleasures of early adolescence now with profound shock she realized that this aged man held in his hands the poetry and the dramayes and the wisdomwhich could move her as no other speaker of the evening had almost too late it came to her that she scarcely dared to listen and be torn anew by the things he might say but the old preacher was now saying nothing a strange silence made the room tense something tightened in gale something of fear which was greater than the dread of what this kindly man might say in alarm she lifted her eyes and looked into his face for a long moment they studied each other then he began speaking his voice slightly stronger the room was so quiet that every syllable could be heard plainly jesus talked about folks just like brother jude did in his little new testament book only jesus called them fruitless waterlesscloud folks serpents and vipers he said woe to you right to them might of sounded to them like hate but it werent it werent hate it were love love what plumb broke jesus heart cause he ended up all them woe to yous by wanting to gather them dumb deaf blind clucks right up under his own wings like a mama hen gathers her chickies together again the old man stopped someone handed him a glass of water slowly his hand trembling he took a few sips the storm outside had quieted quietly the crowded ballroom waited until the man who had so long ministered to the church which dr claren had attended as a child could again minister to the banquet guests setting the glass down gently close to the magnificent peace roses the old minister smiled his black face radiant as he again started to speak his voice rang out strong it were love all right it were jesus own kind of loving and its love when you hate meanness what treats folks mean its love when you hates injustice what treats folks unjust you aint hating folks you is just hating what keeps folks from being fruitfullike in this hungry starvin world    and we in this room has to go out and love all the folks who dont agree with what we been saying here we has to do it we has to love them most powerfully cause they dont know they is waterless clouds and fruitless trees and wandering stars they dont know so we just got to love em the old mans voice strengthened but it cant be any weak soft love what darent even think up a woe to you its got to be a big love cause god wants all them wrongthinkin folks gathered up under his own loving wings till they grow up and get a mite bigger and learn how to be fruitfullike tears came into gale clarens eyes she made no effort to brush them away though she saw a photographer turning his camera toward her this aged preacher had probably never seen a psychology book how gale wondered could he know that she was one of the millions who despite their learning have never learned that hatred of injustice is love she reached for her goblet the water was no longer cold not even cool not cool and refreshing like the water her grandmother used to draw from the old well when she saw little galey morton come running from school if grannie were here gale thought she would be whispering to me loudly she would be saying what you been so feared about galey you aint never been no lying cheating trash child you just been learning so many words longern my arm that you has plumb forgot the rightsome meaning of some of the short words like lovei thats all you done the young y secretary was help ing the aged preacher back to his seat the things gale knew her grandmother would be saying if she were there rushed on youre a smart woman galey a powerful smart woman but you aint fooled god none cant nobody fool god all this time all this long time gods knowed you was nothing but a mixedup child hes knowed you was turning from him cause you hated what some of his childruns was doing to some of his other childruns but you aint a hating woman galey you couldnt never be a hating woman you listen and mind what that preacher just got done saying child and youll get along all right  gale leaned forward so that she could smile down the table smile into the eyes of the aged minister then she smiled into the eyes of the girl whose singing had been balm a quieted rain touched the long windows of the ballroom as the words of the song came back blind unbelief is sure to err and scan his work in vain god is his own interpreter and he will make it plain gale reached out and gently snipped a leaf from one of the lovely peace roses which centered the speakers table
for fun and profit
i like nutty nifties because    and for just  words or less on that why you could be set for life a fortune a dream house a luxury car or maybe a trip around the world may be waiting for just a little effort on your part are you one of the  people who enter contests every year a slogan a statement a name for a new product the last line to a jingle or the solution of a puzzle these are gateways to a possible good fortune and pleasant surprise each year there are hundreds of new contests each year millions of ordinary people enter and keep an enthusiastic eye out for the mail man chances are that even if you havent entered any contests lately that you have sometime in the past or will in the future contesting is truly americas leading hobby and its followers are increasing daily some of these hobbyists are just dreamers but others are hardworking sticktoit hopefuls who study plan and prepare entries that have a betterthanaverage chance of success in which class are you or maybe youre one of the scoffers you think no judge could possibly read so many entries its just a matter of chance and you were never lucky anyway its all a lot of bunk you dont believe they really give away all that money and so on    well let the choice of whether youll enjoy the great american pastime contesting be yours but rest your mind on one point the contests except a very few tried by getrichquick smalltimers that are soon caught are honest they have to be the united states postal service is used in most of these and its a dangerous business to use the mails to defraud naturally the sponsor expects to profit far more than the cost of the contest by increasing his business volume with the contest publicity the box tops that accompany each entry calls for new sales of his product he also hopes to discover new ideas in your entries that will give him a direction for his future advertising as he learns what facts about his merchandise is making the greatest hit with his consumers so business firms and charities have found that contests are a paying form of advertising from  to  million dollars is spent each year on commercial contests to the mutual satisfaction of the sponsors and contestants contests are a definite part of our great give away system and have many supporters who judges these contests some few commercial firms and charities judge their own but most of the big contests are judged by professional judging agencies such as advertising distributors of  america spotts mailing corporation reuben h donnelley corporation r l polk company bruce richards corporation and lloyd herrold company of course each judging agency has its own preferences and own tabus for winning and losing entries but in general they all have somewhat the same standards rules must be obeyed or the entry is automatically disqualified some reasons for disqualifying are no address given not mailed within the time limit too many words failure to include box top or other qualifier no rhyme when required following the rules eliminates at least half your competition fancy decorated entries are disliked and considered a form of bribery originality is prized after all if most entries are alike all cannot win so all must be eliminated aptness and sincerity are words that are usually included in all judging requirements what do they mean actually they mean that you sincerely gave the product a trial then truthfully describe its benefits to you one box of cake mix may seem the same as another but if you try the sponsors product you may discover that the result is a finer texture the taste richer and more buttery by trying the product you wont risk insincerity by describing qualities that are not true aptness and sincerity can be guided by reading the sponsors ads and wording on the label and then trying the merchandise and reporting the benefit these values have to you personally dont be a phony just be you the result will be the originality and individuality that the sponsor is looking for many contestants become discouraged when they do not win immediately so they do not try more than once or twice then quit they tend to slap off an entry carelessly inviting failure to win with such a haphazard sort of preparation would be like a sweepstakes chance however people do win who are they they are the small percentage who love the pastime keep enthusiastic in spite of failures they try as many contests as they can constantly working to improve contesting techniques attitude is a big factor in whether you will enjoy contesting as a hobby and also whether you will win believe in each entry and in yourself make each entry the best you can do mail it forget it and try some more bitterness discouragement or resentment of others good luck in winning will only block your thinking processes and make you bog down and quit keep your hope and courage up for high creativity by realizing that its a waste of time to be resentful for something you cannot help use that energy to improve your future entries by studying them for weaknesses and comparing them with the winners every winner after years of discouragement invariably declares im glad i kept trying if you give up youve got nothing for sure but if you keep trying youre sure to win eventually one contest fan in tampa florida never owned a television until she won two in contests walked for her groceries until she won a bicycle then rode the bike till she won an automobile now she says shes dreaming of air transportation and is just waiting for some sponsor to stage a contest with a helicopter as a prize dont ever give up says one prize winner recently after she was awarded a total of  her first win after three years of contesttrying one woman in massachusetts won a trip for two to florida just after her husband was recovering from pneumonia it couldnt have come at a better time and to think i was almost too busy and discouraged to even try that contest im sure glad i did you too can be a winner some helpful suggestions gleaned from the writers own experience and that of others are given here perhaps the most important thing is to fall in love with words words can make you laugh cry buy or reject they can paint a bright picture or draw a blank get the dictionary habit just browse through and read word definitions when you read maga zines or newspapers read the ads and underscore picture words try to see what the advertiser is trying to do can you forget buywords like happy go lucky    dont let your hands tell time selling hand lotion    thick and tired of a bad fit foundation garments    bewitching stitching swim suits    strong legs run that weak legs may walk football game benefiting crippled children words and phrases like these did not come with careless thinking they came from a love of words and a study of wordcombinations words are keys to emotion and emotion is the key to prizewinning entries and forceful advertising wilfred funk suggests the following as the most beautiful words in the english language chimes dawn golden hush lullaby luminous melody mist murmuring tranquil starting with these make a list of your own list hopeful words fear words bouncing action words glad words sad words from advertising list picture phrases that may spark your own mind into more original directions familiar phrases and famous quotations can be used by changing them to suit the sponsors product or to create an entirely new meaning start such a list now of all these you can recall such as home is where the heart is    honesty is the best policy    make hay while the sun shines     seeing is believing etc im sure you can recognize clever reversals of these old sayings in many ads today you can do the same or use them to start other ideas of your own in statement and name contests try making up words by using two or more words fused together like applelicious from apple and delicious in naming a pie or pudding a winning flower name was coined by fusing the words memory and florescent into memorescent in one contest entrants were required to name a bicycle that came equipped with a radio some of the winning names were chattercycle airolympic and audioflyer a winner of a statement contest in describing the whitening advantages of a detergent wrote gone are the ghosts of yestergray this was legitimate borrowing that made an original expression of the sponsors product finally to sum up try many contests all you can find time for then forget each one and go on to others newspapers magazines radio tv and special contest publications all announce current contests obey all rules strictly work hard over all entries if it comes too easy then reject it as ordinary and rework it into something different and outstanding use strong picture words and action verbs use the sponsors product read his advertising be honest be yourself slanted to his needs and yours keep copies of all entries you might be able to rework a loser into a winner in another direction keep an idea file or notebook include unique ads titles pictures sayings phrases anything that may put a spark into a sluggish brain wake it up and start the ideas flowing get a good dictionary a rhyming dictionary a volume of familiar quotations and a thesaurus there are books on contesting techniques you may find at your local library contesting magazines on the newsstands and several schools that teach the subject by mail its a big business for many people no one of course should or could plan on making a living wholly by contesting but as a hobby few fields are more challenging so heres to you come on in the funs fine keep hopeful keep trying keep enthusiastic youll make it the odds are with you but if you fail youve had a lot of fun

she was the unlikeliest s £ of heroes there she jj was young and comese«««a ly as trim and chic as a model in a magazine advertisement at the most prosaic it was easy to picture her as a youthful matron dainty and decorative waiting in her wellappointed home for the man who adored her to come in from his labors when the little rock crisis reached fever pitch in the fall of  and people across the world were wondering about the woman called daisy bates writers were turning out reams of copy in an effort to describe her in her native arkansas of course she was pictured as a firebreathing redlining witch and called every vile name printable and a few names which in a truly civilized society are not printable at all but other writers were more objective seeking to satisfy the curiosity about the woman who had turned the nation upside down a united press correspondent described daisy bates as a businesslike woman of  and went on in a kind of awe to list the measurements of her slim figure she wears her black hair in a casual bob sometimes covering part of her forehead he wrote adding newsmen find little trouble talking to her for readers of the minneapolis tribune the famed negro journalist carl t rowan was more to the point actually she is a typical negro housewifedifferent from the average american woman perhaps primarily in that she prefers poker to bridge and has become expert with a rifle inherent in rowans description is the suggestion that had the wanton finger of fate pointed at many another negro woman the results would have been pretty much the same there is nothing in this suggestion to detract from the extraordinary achievement of daisy lee bates rather there is something in it of commendation for all the millions of negro women who have borne with uncommon fortitude the burden of their cultures cruelty and of their mens helpless despair if daisy bates is typical of her kind then she proved a splendid example never once in her long and barbarous ordeal was there a public moment of faltering or retreat if there had not been private ones then she would have been more than human and daisy bates is very human indeed on september   the day the segregationists refer to as  black monday mrs bates came closest to losing her extraordinary calm the vicious mobs had forced the nine negro children from central high school state police had just intercepted a caravan of some  cars loaded with enough explosives to dynamite half the city as it neared the bates home and the threat of violence hung like a living thing over the whole state in the tense stillness of the night the phone rang in the bates home and when she answered it an obscene voice spoke in her ear we have just had our first killing in little rock and you are responsible there will be more before day my heart stood still mrs bates recalls i thought of mr eckford the father of elizabeth one of the nine children returning home from his night job i could envision him being shot down    and at the same time i pictured governor faubus gloating in his illfamed glory faith deserted her in that moment i became bitter for the first time i hated everything for which america stood i hated these people who had as much as burned the u s constitution when they put fiery crosses on our lawn i hated the socalled liberals who were too afraid of their social positions to speak out clearly and firmly    most of all i hated the frightened and complacent negro of the south and the contented negro of the north i walked into my bedroom and cried how much can a people stand i think that in that moment if i could have lifted the cotton curtain and walked through it to the iron curtain that i would have done so without looking back as these things were going through my mind  was praying then something seemed to say to me you cannot spend your time hating you must work and have faith when the report of murder was finally checked and proved to be false i felt like a person who had been given a new lease on life daisy bates did not ask for fame what she sought was indeed what millions of other negro women seekthe freedom for their loved ones which is their birthright as americans simply that specifically as president of the arkansas branches of the naacp she asked that the negro children of her community be permitted to attend without stigma the public schools of the city of little rock and for this she found herself in the eye of a racist hurricane the lady from little rock was first catapulted into the international spotlight on the terrible morning in september  when supported by nothing but her courageshe shepherded the nine teenagers through a howling mob of whites to confront a contingent of hostile national guardsmen with orders to bar the children from the white high school it was an incredible and beautiful thing that procession here were nine children scarcely into puberty facing in their tender youth all the ugly madness of rampant racism and facing it with a dignity that was as old and as proud as the human race and here was the woman who had inspired them who had shown them by her example that a human being is not a beast that there is something in a man stronger and more meaningful than the bombs in his hands and the hatred in his heart but though the outside world first heard of daisy bates after that day she had long been a familiar personage in her native state she had arrived in little rock a very young bride with her newspaper publishing husband back in  and from the beginning from her vantage point on the weekly state press she had waged war on bigotry with her husband she had worked to inform the negro people of their rights and to urge the white people to respect these rights the state press had been active in prodding the city of little rock to hire negro policemen the paper had been in the forefront of the movement for peaceful integration of the state university law and medical schools long before the supreme courts desegregation ruling and it was inevitable that the weekly would urge speedy compliance with the supreme courts edict daisy bates had long been active in the naacp and a year before the desegregation ruling she was named president of all the branches in the state had there been willing and capable local leadership she would have left the job to others but there was none she stepped in requested compliance of the school boards counselled the parents of the negro children and filed suits against public officials when all else failed it was obvious that the white people of little rock had no wish to obey the national law and it was equally obvious that the courts had no alternative but to compel compliance the final clash was between the power of orval faubus the defiant governor and that of the federal courts on the morning when daisy bates and the nine children walked up to central high school faubus had called out the national guard to turn them back nearly three weeks later acting at last president eisenhower inducted the guardsmen into federal service and sent  officers and men of the st airborne division into the city to enforce the courts decision when the children the next day marched off once more to central high school things had changed the mobs were still there spitting and cursing but the danger was gone the children were escorted by paratroopers who made it very clear that they were on the side of the law and that the law was on the side of the negro children for everyone concerned the first stage of the battle was over the negro children did not have to fear the white hoodlums who jeered at them along the streets but they still had to exercise superhuman care and restraint inside the school the racist mobs knew that they had lost but they are poor losers and they shifted their tactics to boycott harassment and terror it did not matter that there were so many others who agreed with the mobs or that they were in high places their numbers and their eminence served only to illustrate how widespread was their affliction and to what tragic extent their disease had been indulged by the nation of course the children were too young to understand this they knew only that they were in the right and that those who abused them were somehow more in need of help than they but daisy bates knew she had after a fashion experienced it all before and she would more than likely experience it all again in the year that followed the morning that the nine children safely went off to school without her daisy bates knew peace only on those occasions when she was away from little rock her phone rang incessantly crosses were burned on her lawn torches were tossed on her roof shots were fired through her house and the big picture window in her living room was broken so often that she finally gave up having it repaired she endured it she also endured the gradual but steady economic pressure on her husbands newspaper that drove the paper out of business and her husband to financial ruin advertisers withdrew and circulation dropped and finally the publisher was forced to vacate the building that housed his plant there were times when mr and mrs l c for lucius christopher bates felt they had been licked at last that those who had schemed to drive them out of little rock had won then for a while sympathetic people from all over the country rallied to their side renewing their hope during those frantic months daisy bates received the avid applause of negroes everywhere and the moral support of people all over the world including some white people among her numerous citations and tokens of recognition is the coveted spingarn medal awarded jointly to her and the nine brave children whom she served as mentor but as so often happens the public soon forgot school integration was an accomplished fact in little rock andbecause of little rockin many other southern cities and daisy bates was no longer news she remains president of the arkansas naacp it is a fulltime job offering no financial reward at all after the demise of the arkansas state press publisher bates was hired as arkansas field secretary of the naacp a job that utilizes his special talents as a journalist and his keen knowledge of the locality but which cannot pay him the money to which he was accustomed needless to say there is hardly any other place in arkansas where he can find a decent job during much of  and  mrs bates was in new york city working on a book recording her experiences in the drama of little rock the book tentatively titled the daisy bates story is scheduled for publication this summer by the david mckay company in the book she will detail for the first time the behindthescenes incidents which the national press dared notor was reluctant to report she will reveal what happened to the nine children and to their parents she will name the white people of little rock who out of christian principle sided with the negro children and who paid for their religious faith with financial disaster and social ruin but most important of all she will tell what she felt herself in those grim and dangerous days when she struggled with superhuman effort against the specter of bitterness and defeat before returning to little rock this spring mrs bates sat in her comfortable suite in the brittany hotel in new yorks greenwich village and discussed her impending return home i admit that the idea of returning to little rock is frightening when i recall the intense hatred that has been generated against me by the politicians she said this hatred has been manifested in many ways by the bombing of our home death threats to me and my family and the loss of our paper some people have said to me that progress has been made because a limited number of negro students are attending classes in the senior and junior high schools i recognize the fact that this could be considered progress i am also cognizant of the fact that the students are not permitted to participate in any extracurricular activities and that the restaurants theatres hotels and recreational facilities in little rock are still segregated i would like to continue to be a part of the revolution that will surely one day write finish to the vicious practice of segregation in arkansas that is why i am returning to little rock it may very well be dangerous for daisy bates to return home but it also would seem that her return bodes no comfort for those who are not willing to make freedom a reality for all the people of arkansas
do negroes and africans really dig each other
accompanying the   v recent emergence of  j independent african   e nations has come a great deal of interest in the dark continent as more and more africans come to the united states there are many very intriguing and revealing developments there has naturally been an intensification of interest centered about the black africanblack american relationship the obvious similarities between the two ethnic groups have often led to misconceptions and fallacies concerning the relationship between the two groups a recent article inthe afroamerican newspaper and the all too apparent misinformation therein dramatically demonstrates this point the fact that the article was written by a negro for a negro newspaper to be primarily read by a negro audience merely makes the situation more acutely embarrassing the fact that afroamerican happens to be the name of a publication adds a touch of irony and ludicrousness that is almost too biting to those somewhat informed on the subject the article appeared in a column called a stones throw by editor chuck stone and was entitled we dig our african brothers but most whites dont after reading the article i was reminded of the old adage he that lives in a glass house should not throw stones the author of the article in his inadequate attempt at proving that africans are accepted by american negroes as brothers builds himself a hothouse inside a gravel pit insults the intelligence of his readers and generously supplies his adversary with slingshots approximately a year ago a newspaper article that had appeared in the pittsburgh courier came to my attention it carried a very interesting informative message unlike mr stone the writer of the courier article spoke of and frompersonal experience the gentleman a high ranking nigerian dignitary had this to say about the contact he had had with  american negroes   they are cold and unfriendly    i was not surprised by this the theme of many discussions i have had with africans coming into my office on state department tours has been the irregular response of negroes to africans african students are often surprised and shocked to see and experience the indifferent and almost hostile attitude of the american negro toward them at times they naively assume as many other uninitiated that because of the common color characteristics common ancestry and some common problems there should exist a close bond of brotherhood between them and the negro perhaps this should be the case but unfortunately it is not before the mau mau uprisings probably the most popular conception of africans held by negroes was based on tarzan movies or some other equally enlightening source most negroes were willing to allow the matter to rest right there figuring no doubt that the less said the better for to get involved in such a question would invariably lead back to the painful fact that they were descendants from such people it was only after ghana gained her independence and the triumphant tour of america by kwame nkrumah that most american negroes became aware that africans were more than an ancient race of people from which they had to grudgingly admit descent even today much of the token acceptance of africans by negroes is based on the fact that having african interests and guests is now socially the thing to do ten years ago there were only a few negroes who evidenced any real interest in africa individuals like st clair drake claude barnett w e b du bois and pitifully few others were the only negroes to meaningfully manifest any genuine interest and concern in africa since the founding of liberia i have been too impressed with hearing dr drake and others speak of the difficult often impossible task of getting negroes fired up about african affairs and culture to believe that there has been a wholesale change in the attitude and action of the negro regarding his image of the african it must be a rather embarrassing thing and due to his apparent void of information on the subject astonishing for the author of the afroamerican article to discover that very few negro colleges have quality programs in african studies this remains the case despite the fact that a number of african leaders received their education at these schools it must be a distressing discovery for him to find out that the leading program of african studies is at northwestern university a white institution it must be exceptionally painful for him to realize that the person nationally and internationally accepted as the leading africanist in the united states is a white anthropologist  dr melville herskovits dr herskovits gave up the very prestigious position as head of the department of anthropology at northwestern university to direct his brainchild the program of african studies at northwestern since its embryonic and almost esoteric inception sixteen years ago its growth in size and stature has caused it to be considered the most outstanding such program in america it must be known to the author in question that the naacp the urban league and other such organizations have had to depend to a great extent on white support for existence this has been the case despite the type of fight these groups have been waging but if negroes twentyone million strong spending in excess of twenty billion dollars a year dont demonstrate a sufficient concern for their brothers right here in america through sufficient support of these agencies then is it reasonable to assume that they are better prepared to show a special affinity for a people even further removed as desirable as it may be to propose that the american negro generally views the african as brother with all the inherent and indigenous fraternal feeling implied by the term borders on being preposterous nothing happens in a vacuum there are many reasonable and plausible explanations for the apathetic attitude of the negro toward the african for centuries the negro has been trying to deny lose and eradicate his african heritage and characteristics fortunes based on hair preparations and skin bleaches are indicting testimony to this very soon after he reached the shores of america the african became aware of the importance that color apparently played he reasoned that the only real difference between him and the massa was color and the accompanying african features he ignored the importance of economics and its vital role in the scheme of things he naively wrapped all his frustrations problems and aspirations into one big white pill and swallowed it thereafter he saw the world in terms of black white and varying shades of brown and assumed if you white you all right if you brown you can hang around but if you black then you got to git way back having established color as the criterion for his own evaluating scheme the negro set in motion a type of ethnic thinking that plagues us even today premiums were placed on possessing white features light skin keen nose thin lips good hair anything african was allocated a negative value and had to be altered hidden or minimized whenever possible jealousies and discriminations within the race itself often paralyzed and prevented action in concert among the various factions of negroes color neuroses and psychoses retarded a realistic acceptance and appreciation of africanness and thwarted much progress toward finding the real basis for the negros inferior position in america that basis was and is economics color is a very convenient rationalization and disguise behind which the operations necessary to subjugation have been carried on the negros rejection of the african image is further encouraged and molded by various aspects of his everyday existence in the educational system the negro first meets the african in the little black sambo tale later in geography he sees the african as a noble savage at best and often as some scantily clothed uncivilized creature whose biggest claim to progress is that he doesnt eat people in as large quantities as he did formerly for better or worse neeroes are americans as such they are effectively reached and influenced by madison avenue and hollywood for years the negro has been exposed to the same symbols as white america he has been just as effectively influenced by them he regards the gregory peck betty grable rock hudson jane russell type as the ultimate in male and female attractiveness after this brainwashing process he is in no mood to settle for the aunt jemimas and uncle bens not to mention the african with the masses of negroes being conditioned and controlled in his thinking along the same lines as other americans with the gross ignorance that remains about africa with his historic repugnance at  africanness there is little cause to wonder at the attitude of the american negro toward the african there has been however some progress made negroes are slowly beginning to feel that there is no inherent shame in being born black but that it is inherently shameful to be ashamed of being born that color many negroes are looking to the accomplishments of the new african nations with pride admiration hope and respect but despite these steps forward there has not been enough progress for most negroes to accept the african as his brother
americas forgotten people
despite certain limited d  improvementson jf paperin the laws americas forgotten people by dale wright reprinted by permission from the new york world telegram  sun protecting the migrant farm worker he continues to be americas forgotten manforced to work long tortured hours at substandard wages cheated and exploited at every turn and compelled to live in filth and squalor and danger i know this because for six months on and off from april to october i worked as a migrant laborer along the atlantic seaboard from florida to new york i saw it with my eyes i felt it in my blistered hands i smelled it with my nose and i rebelled at it in my conscience i labored with slept with ate with and more than once suffered with the members of this vast army of men and women and children most of them negroes like myself who stoop and lift and grub from natures earth a great part of the nations food crop these are some of the things i found many migrant workers are forced to work as many as  hours a day at a backbreaking task the rewards of which are in most cases a string of broken promises they are grossly underpaid and many times not paid at all by conniving labor contractors who have them at their mercy they are cheated and exploited all along the line by profiteers in the roles of growers shippers packers labor contractors crew bosses landlords and merchants thousands of them live in shabby unkempt hovels and shacks usually hidden behind a clump of trees out of public view without sanitary or plumbing facilities and despite laws enacted to protect them their children starting at age  are worked long hours under a searing sun for less than the prevailingor promisedpay under conditions inferior to those afforded cattle and freight migrant laborers are transported from one work area to another in dilapidated hazardous vehicles and at the end of the line when all the crops are worked out hundreds of the migrant workers wind up on relief at public expense in the northern seaboard states the man who sits next to me in this newspaper office allan keller has done much to improve the lot of migrant laborers mainly through his efforts and the campaigns by this newspaper over a period of years a new york state legislative committee was named to look into the migrant labor problem and recommend changes in the laws belatedly teeth were put into regulations to provide better treatment for the migrant the state department of health was empowered to license labor camps and require that minimum sanitary and health standards be maintained other states took stepsalso on paper to help and protect the forgotten man of america the changes in the laws havent helped much the miserable migrants virtually without hope for a brighter tomorrow are still hidden behind those clumps of trees at this moment the migrant labor problem is being investigated anew by asubcommittee of the house labor and education committee with a view toward drafting new remedial legislation its another step in the long investigation of the stoop laborer who has been studied surveyed microscoped and diagnosed over the years as perhaps the sickest segment of the nations economy but i saw little improvement in the condition of the patient the working and housing conditions were bad enough but it was the way hes cheated that outraged me hes overcharged for his squalid shack his food his clothing his bottle of wine at the end of a hard week of work and hes gouged on just about every other item he purchases i found workers in central new jersey who were charged  cents for a breakfast of one chicken wing a spoonful of watery rice and a slice of bread an extra slice cost them  cents more in the long island potato belt where four migrant workers perished in flames recently i found a large crew of men and women being charged by a labor contractor with  weekly dues to a union which didnt exist they also were being charged another  for social security far out of proportion to the paltry pay they had received in many cases i discovered workers forced to pay for social security had no ss numbers at all the payments obviously going wholly to profiteers operating at their labor camp in hastings fla the heart of the states potato belt i bunked for two days in a nearcollapsed insectinfested shanty for which i was compelled to pay  a night next door in an even more dilapidated hovel lived a married couple whose monthold baby had been bom there they paid   a week the infant wailed endlessly from dawn to darkness in its makeshift crib a cardboard cabbage carton as flies and potato bugs crawled in and out of its mouth and nostrils a ragged burlap potato sack served as the babys blanket  but florida has no comer on squalor near hightstown n j less than  miles from trenton the state capital i found seven men and women tomato pickersnone of them relatedliving in filth in a foot square tar paper shack for which they were charged  a week for rent everywhere i traveled i found the itinerant laborer getting a wretched deal and being inarticulate and always on the move he is least able among americas working men to have his cries heard on a warm humid morning last april a rickety old bus jolted along at its top speed between rows of carefully manicured estates along route  from miami south to homestead fla although the vehicle had seats for  persons it was crammed with  passengers i was one of them i was on my way to my first day of work as a migrant farm laborer in the lush tomato fields of southern dade county i had shaped up reported for assignment earlier that morning on a miami street corner and was hiredwith no questions askedby a fat character known as a labor contractor in the south labor contractors round up crews of workers for transport and assignment to farms where crops are to be harvested everybody that gets on this bus he promised reassuringly makes    today if you want to work theres plenty of tomatoes to pick and there will be no cheating nothin taken out of your pay and it will be clean work his pitch sounded good but i wanted to see for myself the smirks on the faces of the seasoned migrant workers around me raised my doubts in a vast patch of ground outside homestead our crew joined about  other farm workers they were busy when we arrived gathering a crop of red ripes tomatoes ready that day for shipment to the markets and canneries it was just after daybreak and a bright sun already had begun to broil the pickers as they stooped in the long rows the job was to pick and pack the tomatoes into baskets that contained fiveeighths of a bushel each loaded basket weighed  pounds when we had them filled we lugged them to the end of the row where they were loaded onto trucks pay promised was  cents a basket in the row next to mine an emaciated man of about  coughed and spat incessantly as he bent to his task when i noticed the blood and spoke to him about it he muttered yeah they say its consumption it dont make no difference i gotta keep working the doctor he cant do nothing for me i got no money for medicine i got a woman and a lotta kids i gotta keep pickin tomatoes obviously the man was seriously ill and belonged in a hospital but he was trapped by the need to work for his family in the only job he knew how to do later when we stood up to smoke a cigaret he said to me been doin farm work all my life dont know nothin else i cant go to a hospital kids gotta eat he said his name was alonzo and that he lived in a tin and tar paper shack near goulds fla for which he paid  a week rent he added that three of his children the small oneshad dry hacking coughs and probably had caught the misery he had in his chest medical treatment no none of the youngsters had ever seen a doctor despite his illness alonzo was a hard worker as we worked along the endless rows of tomato plants he loaded basket after basket of tomatoes and was soon far down the field from me later that day alonzo told me he soon would be moving north from homestead because the harvest was going down to keep living he explained hed have to load his family and his belongings onto a truck or bus going north where other crops were ripening its the same he said this job is just like the last one next be just like this one never no different never will be this sick frustrated laborer doomed long before his time was summing up the lot of todays migrant farm worker the backbreaking labor of stooping close to the orangetinted florida earth begins as soon as a picker can distinguish red tomatoes from green ones in the grey dawn of an endless day his work ends when he no longer can see the tomatoes to pick them at the promised rate of  cents a basket a good picker can fill  to  baskets a day and earn it says therefrom  to  a day as bad as that kind of pay is it generally worked out that the man in the fields received considerably less than the promised rate often the rate dropped on payday to  cents a basket and the field hand who actually took home  a day for his work considered himself lucky on my first day in the fields i worked  hours with only a  minute break for what they called lunch it was the hardest most punishing work  had ever done in the first hours of that miserable day my hands became grimy and encrusted with the green insecticide they spray on tomatoes it covered my khaki pants and ate its way into my legs it collected under my finger nails covered my shoes and socks and festered in the scratches i received from the tomato vines but picking the tomatoes was the easy part of the job the hard part was lugging the heavy baskets to the end of the rowsoften as far as  feetto be loaded onto the trucks all around me were men and womenall agesdragging themselves along the rows on their  hands and knees in the near degree heat toilet facilities there were none the pickers male and female used the field whenever they found it necessary it was more than a mile to the nearest clump of trees that lunch i spoke of a little before noon a battered pickup truck drove into the fields the meal consisted of greasy sausage sandwiches and warm soft drinks the sandwiches cost  cents and the drinks  cents drinking water was dispensed from a wooden barrel we dipped our water with a sawedoff tomato can shared by some  other migrant laborers toiling in the fields because the barrel was in the middle of the field thirsty workers had to walk as much as a half mile for a drink of water as i figured it that first day we picked more than  baskets of tomatoes after  hours of stooping squatting crawling picking and loading id earned just  many of the men and women working with me had earned less the transportation of migrant workers within a state such as florida is a horror story i was in florida last spring riding with and working with the thousands of migrant laborers who follow the harvest of crops for their miserable livelihood travel for a migrant and his family is a nightmare anywhere in florida and other states which dont regulate migrant transportation its worse itemthe federal statutes decree that drivers of interstate migrant carriers must pass physical fitness tests i rode in a bus with a labor crew of  including a young couple with a monthold infant the trip from homestead to ruskin fla covered  miles the driver in a moment of sleepy candor told me he was subject to violent epileptic seizures itemfederal laws say that rest and meal stops must be made at least every six hours our crew traveled  hours before the first stop was made the  driver stopped for gas but not for people the infant had to use for toilet purposes a filthy rag salvaged from the bus floor as for men and women their experiences must go undescribed itemevery state requires that bus and truck drivers be properly licensed the driver of the arklike vehicle i rode in admitted that his license had been lifted because of a conviction for drunken driving itemmost state laws require that migrant carriers be maintained in reasonably safe and operable condition but on our antique bus windows were cracked or broken seats had collapsed floorboards had long since broken away from mountings and been removed both rear wheels with their smooth whirring tires were visible from inside the bus the owner admitted to me later that the bus had not been inspected in the five years he had owned it baggage and trash barred access to the rear emergency exit door and because the door catch was broken it had been bound firmly shut with baling wire and thus we migrantsi was one of them by nowrolled along floridas roads we passedand were passed byseveral state troopers and local police patrol cars not once were we stopped our destination was ruskin next stop on our journey to the nevernever land of plenty wed all been promised top wages good food a real nice place to live the crew boss name was david tuten jr of st petersburg fla he made it sound real good every man and woman of you will make  a day and nobody takes nothin out of your pay an old man sitting next to me muttered amen which gave me a pretty fair idea what was coming when we arrived at the camp outside a big farm about three miles from ruskin we had been travelingwith just one stopfor  hours everybody was tired dirty hungry and then we got the bad news the tomatoes were still green and not anywhere near being ready for harvest sorry to tell you this said the grower but therell be no work for at least  days this i learned from friends i had made on the bus often pens when that land of plenty is just around the comer of the winding road it meant just one thing that the workers were there on their own to wait until green tomatoes turned red it also meant that at the mercy of the tomato farmer and the crew contractor they would run up big debts for food and lodging to be paid for later when they trudged out into the fields there were a few shouts of protests but not many this had happened too often before just as it will happen too often again i looked around the camp there were no toilet facilities whatsoever there was no kitchen equipment in the barrackslike living quarters there was no food that i could see the only available water came from an irrigation pump adequate provisions had been made to water the tomatoesbut not the people some of the migrants washed themselves and their clothes in a muddy irrigation ditch the crew boss explained without apology that he hadnt known the crop was late or that the grower hadnt installed facilities for his workers nobody said anything we were all too tired a man who had brought his wife and child along finally broke the silence we got here broke he said mournfully everything we got is tied up in this bundle he pointed to a tattered bedspread tied up by its four corners and now were even worse off than before cause  we got to start borrowing money to live on the man then walked away with his family and slowly dug a hole in the ground then he set up a makeshift stove by placing a piece of sheet metal on four empty cans and built a fire under it i watched as he tramped off into the fields in a few minutes he was back with a small cabbage and a can of waterfrom the irrigation ditch he and his wife boiled the cabbage over the can stove it was the first meal that they and their child had eaten since leaving homestead  hours before a migrant farm worker expects exploitation as one of the grim facts of his miserable life he knows hell be cheated and he learns to live with it he knows hell be underpaid for his labor and overcharged for many of the things he has to buy for himself and his family because many migrants never get to schoolor have to leave during the early elementary school years to go to work in the fields they are uneducated and illiterate for this reason they are easy marks for sharp operators while driving along a country road through the fertile north shore potato area near peconic l i last august i picked up two hitchhiking farmhands who spelled out some of the gimmicks the sharpies use to separate a migrant worker from his hardwon wages james taylor  and evon washington  both from polk county fla had been taken to peconic fla last july to work as potato graders they had joined a traveling farm crew headed by a virginia man earlier in the summer on a promise that they would be paid  an hour the worldtelegram is withholding the virginia mans name at this time because of an investigation now under way both farmhands agreed that in nearly three months of work with the crew of  graders and loaders they had never earned more than  cents hourly at the time i gave the two men a lift they were headed on foot for new york city  miles away between the two they had  cents in cash and only the clothes they wore they had left their camp the night before they said because there was no chance of earning enough money to subsist the stories they told were so typical of the cruel swindles i had heard many times before in other farm areas north and south that i brought them into new york staked them to a room at a ymca and taperecorded their stories two days later i rounded up some shirts and underwear and helped get them jobs at an upstate new york fruit cannery through the state employment service here are some of the things they told meon two hours of tape their crew leader deducted  weekly for union dues for a union that doesnt exist the men had not signed any union membership cards they did not know the name of the union to which they paid dues the two said they were told that the deductions would be made for  weeks i already knew the reason it was one of the gimmicks frequently used by labor contractors to write off the expense of transporting migrants from one stop to another in their recruiting pitches in the south contractors promise to bus or truck migrants up the road at no cost but they get back the money in hidden charges mr taylor and mr washington also declared that their crew leader deducted  weekly for social security benefits mr washington emphasized that although he had lost his ss card he knew his number neither the contractor nor the timekeeper knew my number he said they never asked me the deductions were illegal even if the crew leader had known the number the maximum legal deduction is  per cent of gross salary up to  annually for the  deductions to have been legal the crew leader workers would have to be paid at least  weekly the two hitchhikers insisted that they had never grossed more than  a week with the crew on paydays the men declared the crew boss charged his workers   a pint for wine which retails for  cents though state law requires that migrant farm workers be furnished with written statements of hours worked and wages received both men asserted they had never received such records another state law requires that farm labor contractors post in conspicuous places either in living quarters or at grading houses copies of labor contracts detailing wages and hours and charges for food and housing mr taylor who has completed  years of public school education said he had never seen a labor contract posted and did not know the procedure was required these are just some of the many complaints of shoddy recordkeeping and questionable payroll operation that both men gave in their interviews mr washington said he had been paid nothing for his first week of work and that at the end of the second week he received  for well over  hours of work this was after the deduction of  for  meals weekly and  for room rent sometimes the boss would pay us whatever he felt like mr washington explained no matter how many hours we worked mr taylor said that for his best week of work he received  after union dues social security and food and lodging both men charged that there were many others at the camp who  had been bilked by illegal charges the two men estimated they had been cheated out of a minimum of  each one of their biggest gripes concerned what they called waiting time as mr taylor explained it if were loading potatoes off the grader and into trucks and the trucks are late we dont get paid for waiting but we have to work around the shed anyway stacking sacks of potatoes for the next trucks or just moving things around theres sometimes two or three hours between trucks were working but were not getting paid the time stops when the truck is loaded and it dont start until the next one comes in an intense serious young man mr taylors summation of the exploitation of migrant farm workers mirrors the feelings of the essential laborers about  come into new york state every year who harvest the nations crops were getting cheated and we know it you gotta take it or leave we left i later made another visit to the camp tucked away in the trees to see for myself what the two men had left behind there
