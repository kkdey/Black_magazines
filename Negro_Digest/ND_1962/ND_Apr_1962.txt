paradoxically fit was the french who  first forced us to seek z  its essence and who then showed us where it lay    when they enforced their policy of assimilation and thus deepened our despair    early on we had become aware within ourselves that assimilation was a failure we could assimilate mathematics or the french language but we could never strip off our black skins nor root out our black souls and so we set out on a fervent quest for the holy grail our collective soul and we came upon it it was not revealed to us by the official france of the politicians who out of self interest and political conviction defended the policy of assimilation its whereabouts was pointed out to us by that handful of freelance thinkerswriters artists ethnologists and prehistorianswho bring about cultural revolutions in france it was to be quite precise our teachers of ethnology who introduced us to the considerable body of work already achieved in the understanding of africa by the university of oxford what did we learn from all those writers artists and teachers that the early years of colonisation and especially even before colonisation the slave trade had ravaged black africa like a bush fire wiping out images and values in one vast carnage that negroid civilisation had flourished in the upper paleolithic age and that the neolithic revolution could not be explained without them that their roots retained their vigour and would one day produce new grass and green branches    negritude is the whole complex of civilised valuescultural economic social and politicalwhich characterise the black peoples or more precisely the negroafrican world all these values are essentially informed by intuitive reason because this sentient reason the reason which comes to grips expresses itself emotionally through that selfsurrender that coalescence of  subject and object through myths by which i mean the archetypal images of the collective soul above all through primordial rhythms synchronised with those of the cosmos in other words the sense of communion the gift of mythmaking the gift of rhythm such are the essential elements of negritude which you will find indelibly stamped on all the works and activities of the black man    in opposition to european racialism of which the nazis were the symbol we set up an antiracial racialism the very excesses of naziism and the catastrophes it engendered were soon to bring us to our senses such hatred such violence above all such weeping and such shedding of blood produced a feeling of revulsionit was so foreign to our continents genius our need to love and then the anthropologists taught us that there is no such thing as a pure race scientifically speaking races do not exist they went one better and forecast that with a mere two hundred million people we would in the end disappear as a black race through miscegenation at the same time they did offer us some consolation the focal points of human development wrote teilhard de chardin in  always seem to coincide with the points of contact and anastomosis of several nerve paths that is in the ordinary mans language of several races and continents it could only be by force that is its first disadvantage a more serious one is that it would not be humanistic for it would cut itself off from the complementary values of the greater part of humanity as i have said elsewhere it would be a universal civilisation it would not be the civilisation of the universal whereas our revised negritude is humanistic i repeat it welcomes the complementary values of europe and the white man and indeed of all other races and continents but it welcomes them in order to fertilise and reinvigorate its own values which it then offers for the construction of a civilisation which shall embrace all mankind the neohumanism of the twentieth century stands at the point where the paths of all nations races and continents cross where the four winds of the spirit blow

who manages the money in your house you or your husband or does your money manage this happens  oftener than most of us will admit offhand money makes a lot of us unhappy it causes many of the domestic upheavals in family life and sometimes seems to be the greatest single cause of all tension why should this be its a necessary commodity and we cannot escape it yet why cannot we learn to live with it harmoniously asking ourselves a few pertinent questions however we soon get an inkling as to why our money seems to manage us rather than we manage our money for instance  do you eat steaks roasts and chops at the beginning of a pay period but find you have to lean heavily on starchy foods bean soups and meat substitutes at the last of the week  when you really need to dress up do you discover that your hat is one color your best purse another and your one good dress will blend with neither  does your family often complain of boredom and though you took the whole group out for a bangup time movies dinner and bowling right after payday theres nothing to do after that till next pay day  are ordinary medical expenses always considered emergencies although as with most families they do occur regularly shots for the children dental appointments physical exams etc an answer of yes to these few questions and similar ones may give you the first hint that no one in your family is really managing your money but you are being managed admittedly money is one of the first reasons of family quarrels and disharmony so doesnt it make sense to get back into the management role as quickly as possible also since money is naturally of first importance in daily living it is  certainly wisest to make it provide more living how take over    make a plan for your money first take time to reckon past expenses get a general idea of how much of your money must be spent for food how much for housing and how much for clothing health recreation etc at the beginning of a pay period divide out all your available money into individual envelopes marked in these categories then plan to manage these different expenditures rather than put all your money in your purse and go on as long as it lasts food plan a weeks meals in advance according to sales items and seasonal bargains refrigerate and store things carefully to prevent any waste housing include rent or mortgage payments plus other housing essentials such as fuel water and electricity repairs insurance and furnishings clothing plan things to coordinate as to color and purpose go over your wardrobe and that of others in the family then resist impulse buying if you start out to buy a straight gray skirt dont let someone even yourself persuade you to buy that pretty lavender floral blouse that wont go with a thing you own health certain items such as vitamins health insurance etc will be easily planned for ahead but all of us should know that extras are normal  so put aside something for those inevitable dental bills doctors visits and prescriptions a health fund accumulated ahead will prevent these things from wrecking the budget recreation a budget that is all business is dreary so be sure to put aside something for fun fare to give a lift to living but make the money really count by composing a fun list of things that cost little or nothing to enjoy things like picnics to state parks fishing hikes trips to the zoo or museum savings nothing makes you feel like a manager like a backlog of savings the amount saved regularly need not be large only constant earmark a certain percentage of all income and if the idea of saving money just for the sake of having money is boring to you then try saving for a purpose a new car new house childrens education vacation boat or retirement if your money manages you life can be stormy but if you manage your money theres fair weather ahead

the past fifteen years  rip f have been a golden era  ii r for negro baseball players in more way § than financial an astounding amount of athletic racial and economic progress has been made since branch rickey first brought j ackie robinson into the organized version of the game and jackies southembom manager inquired of rickey do you really think hes a human being but except ing the racial impact and sheer drama of jackies advent into a sport which had maintained for  years an unwritten rule against negroes the next fifteen years promise to be even more golden again in more ways than financial in actuality the past predicts the future progress begets progress the first and second waves of negro playersjackie robinson larry doby roy campanella et als in the first willie mays ernie banks hank aaron et als in the secondhave accomplished so much in such a relatively short period of time have laid such a firm foundation on which third and fourth waves can build that this prediction cannot be easily dismissed as wishful or fanciful thinking it is almost as sure as the fact that god made little apples when rickey signed robinson this historic event occurred in the fall of  robinson made his debut in organized baseball with montreal in  entered the major leagues at brooklyn in  he upset a pattern of racial discrimination which had existed since  prior to  and as early as  in recorded sports history negroes had participated in integrated baseball including the major leagues of those days this spring as the  major league clubs prepare for competition in the american and national divisions every team lists negroes on its parent roster or farmclub rosters the most successful or best and better teams are bulwarked by negro stars indeed if it were not for negro players the caliber of major league baseball today would hardly approach triplea negro players have been the saviors of the game as millions of fans have come to know itfor as rickey wisely discerned the ravages of world war ii and the lure of betterpaying jobs available to caucasian youngsters in other professions had seriously depleted the ranks of baseballs talent stock in this year  the best allaround player in baseball is a negrowillie mays of the san francisco giantsand he is also the highestpaid player in the majors drawing down an annual salary ranging upwards of  with baseballallied income added he will earn more than  this year the player generally regarded as the one most likely to wreak a successful assault on the home run records babe ruths total of  for a game schedule set in  roger maris total of  for a game schedule set last season is orlando capeda also a giant the  pennant hopes of such teams as the los angeles dodgers milwaukee braves new york yankees pittsburgh pirates cincinnati reds the aforementioned giants chicago white sox detroit tigers st louis cardinals cannot possibly be realized without outstanding performances from such stars as maury wills hank aaron elston howard roberto clemente frank robinson willie mays a smith jake woods bill white and others the impact of jackie robinsons success as a major league baseball player transcended the initial fact that he reintegrated the game which is popularly called the national pastime negro baseball players today have escaped forever the tortuous life of their predecessors who were forced into the helterskelter existence of nomads who were grossly overplayed and underpaid who seldom obtained enough rest between games in the fleabag fleabitten segregated hotels where they were forced to live whose health and wellbeing were constantly jeopardized by the inadequate diets of the roadside greasy spoons where they not infrequently took their meals from the back door so rigorous was the life of the oldtime negro players that bunny downs bus driver for the cincinnati clowns was moved to ejaculate shuckin com hoein potatoes nothins tougher than this herewhatchacallittourist baseball negro baseball stars today are national and international heroes they travel firstclass sleep firstclass eat firstclass they play schedules which are within the limitations imposed by night games  and the genius of the schedulemakers the best yet devised they are protected by minimum wage scales boast a pension plan second to none often are the recipients of lucrative bonuses are virtually assured that one or two years of play as regulars will guarantee healthy fivefigure salaries one or two of them have even been allowed to shave on the television commercials baseball salaries paid to negro stars have purchased security many fine homes and cars many minks and more than a few giltedged investments andor businesses beyond this the achievements of negro players beginning with jackie robinson who is now a wellpaid vicepresident and director of a multimilliondollar new york restaurant and coffee chain have spun off human civil_rights social and economic benefits for millions of americans patently the kid or adult who cheers lustily for a negro athlete at the ball park cannot retain the depth and breadth of old racial prejudices he may not yet want to live in the same neighborhood with the negro star nor have his sister marry one but his total ideas about race and democracy undergo significant changes as he applauds the negro home run hitter or shutout pitcher today negroes are accepted in many of the nations best hotels such as the chase in st louis because integrated baseball teams broke the ice this spring several major league clubs will house their players negro and white in southern hotels or motels purchased for the expressed purpose of insuring equality of housing eating and recreational facilities in countless american cities and towns race relations are improved the negro receives a better break and everybody is happier because integrated baseball brought home the invaluable lesson that negroes and caucasians can live and work together harmoniously for the greater good of all indeed in many southern areas where integrated schooling remains controversial and white citizens councils call the political plays integrated baseball is accepted it was several years ago that a clevelandowned pitcher named dave hoskins porformed in the texas league and subsequently was publicly acclaimed as the savior of the league the owners of the little rock arkansas team spoke out for integration before eisenhower prodded by louis armstrong decided to protect negro students who courageously walked through angry lines of bigots on their way to class in what may well be adjudged historically as a most significant move the famed birmingham barons withdrew from the southern association a few weeks ago because of archaic jim crow laws in that city and alabama but the limits of achievement by negro baseball players have not yet been posted on the horizon as  inspiring and rewarding as the golden era has been the end of the rainbow with its huge pot of doubloons still lies ahead the surface has been scratched but serious mining operations are just beginning negroes have not yet been employed notably in the frontoffices of organized baseball clubs louis jones exhusband of lena horne and former olympic games track star harrison dillard have held public relations jobs with the cleveland indians other negroes have held positions of varying importance with these teams but there are not yet any negro major league managers vicepresidents general managers directors of playing personnel from baseballs standpoint one of the most unfortunate incidents occurred when the dodgers coldbloodedly dumped jackie robinson as he neared careers end for jackie as his subsequent success in business and public affairs proves possesses one of the keenest minds the sport has ever known personal resentment of jackie was the big factor behind his being traded to the thennew york giants a transaction which he canceled by making a dramatic retirement from baseball one of jackies contemporaries campanella purportedly was tabbed for an eventual managers role but his tragic automobile accident ended his career prematurely despite his physical handicaps however campy has worked for did he establish with mays a policy of paying a topflight negro star what he is worth it is reliably reported that a major factor in stonehams hiring of willies former teammate alvin dark as giant manager was darks ability to get along with mays the next fifteen years the goldengolden era for negro ball players will bring a solution to virtually all of the problems large and small endured by them today as these players move up in rank particularly as the general press public and club officials recognize their mental abilities as well as their physical attributesstartling progress will be made on all fronts such practices as negroandnegro rooming assignments or road trips placement of all negro player lockers together in one defined section of dressing rooms lower salaries for certain negro players than are being paid their lessable caucasian teammates james junior gilliam of the dodgers is an outstanding example of the underpaid negro star will disappear    if as attorney general bob kennedy visualizes the potential a negro may be elected president of the united states within the next halfcentury then it is not hyperbolic dreaming to expect a major league manager general manager farm director orpossiblya club president during the goldengolden age of the soaring s and s before these startling possibilities are discounted it is well to remember that just fifteen years ago rogers hornsby was arguing that negroes would never fit into organized baseball because of the social angles such as playing cards during road trips involved a new york writer nationally famous was claimingjust fifteen years agothat negroes are always pushing themselves into jobs for which they are not qualified if no one suggested that the sky would fall because of jackie robinsons advent it was only because no one thought of it but oddly enough it was a southerner w n cox of the norfolk virginianpilot who informed the world that if negro players began to hit homers run bases and field with elan the question of their color would soon be forgotten up to date the greatest allaround negro baseball playerofficial has been the late andrew rube foster who not only starred on the mound in negro leagues    but also was a colorful and successful manager he used to signal his outfielders with puffs of smoke from an old corncob pipe promoter teamowner league founder and president and baseball commissioner during the next fifteen years someone in major league baseball as we know it perhaps bill white or bill bruton or gene baker or ernie banks will put rube foster into second place its bound to happen progress is like rabbits it reproduces its kind    fast 
open hiring
you can sit and talk about it at staff meetings for hours on a high lofty plane you can tell yourself that this is the twentieth century you can ask yourself what kind of a citizen you are when you give lip service to hiring the negro yet never really do anything about it then alone you begin to entertain the small nagging doubts would he fit in with the other salesmen would your customers resent him would the negro salesman mesh into your organization maybe the experience of a national company atlantic gummed paper corp with headquarters in brooklyn would be helpful atlantic supplies strip box sealing to the packaging market it has sales offices in most of the u s it has southern customers its not a giant about  million a year in sales but this firm whose building is at the foot of the brooklyn  bridge has a problem and its first negro salesman a young man named john anderson has solved it but let atlantics president saul warshaw tell the story i live in the greenwich village area he said and i like to walk one evening he found himself in the center of a market his company hadnt been able to crack the garment area this is a businessasusual district buyers do business with cronies friends relatives most of the time a salesman cant even get through the door i wondered if there werent some way we could get a salesman in a salesman with the guts and tenacity to keep plugging away despite rebuffs one whod be remembered and thats when i decided to try a negro salesman if one could be found whod meet the requirements the door opened and john anderson came in tall and person able he was dressed in clothes of excellent quality and he knew how to wear them after introductions warshaw continued i worked with employment agencies they sent me eight negro salesmen and i got a surprise any of them could have done the job why anderson we asked warshaw smiled said he didnt think john had ever heard and maybe he should he has the hide of a rhinoceros but it doesnt show anderson had sold shoes before he got his first job after service in korea with the marines at a fashionable fifth avenue shoe salon he had found that  of the stores customers were negroes but when he originally applied for a job he was told there were no application blanks we negroes are used to that answer i kept plugging until i got to see the vp john anderson was the first negro salesman the firm ever had and became its top salesman later at gimbels he repeated the sales performance but he was ambitious and he wanted what he calls a real sales job after hiring him warshaw gave him intensive sales training in addition to the usual training he sent anderson into the plant to learn how various stock is manufactured to arm him with every piece of factual information knowing hed have a tougher row than most to hoe as far as he knows  there was no resentment the salesmen actually went out of their way to help then john was sent out on his own he was given the garment district known as the jungle he learned that when the denizen who guards the traditional barred gate a jungle hallmarkwont let him in he can often make it by the back door and he learned that his very color causes prospects to remember him in that split second i open up with the fastest sales pitch i can since i handle the new gummed tape with fiberglas interior i begin to demonstrate how it works one customera good one now but one we hadnt been able to sell beforesaid you dont know how good that dark face looks to me im jewish and i get mighty tired of seeing nothing but jewish salesmen  ? warshaw admits to a bit of trepidation along the way when the company held a large meeting for its customers he wondered what some of his customers might have to say about anderson instead of icy blasts he got telephone calls many people wanted to know how a negro salesman had worked out they were toying with the idea of adding negroes to their sales forces i gave them one piece of advice if you hire a negro as a salesman you must integrate him into your organization by a tiein to top management clearly understood by the organization and i told them that looking at it from a purely selfish point of view the negro salesman will work harder to prove himself because the stakes are bigger john anderson who attended ucla and lives in westchester with his wife a successful designer of boys wear sums up one day people wont think twice about hiring a negro salesman one day all the sales manager will ask it whos the best man for the job  
a fighting wenching singing man 
the bigpowerful negro man stood in the middle of a circle on the sp louisiana prison farm  and thrashed the twelve strings of his guitar with fingers of ebony steel the melody he played and the song he sang spoke the joy of deliverance he was getting out he grinned at the other convicts as his brawny voice took up the melody sometimes i lives in the country sometimes i lives in the town sometimes i haves a great notion to jump into the river an drown stop ramblin an stop gamblin an stayin out late at night go home to your wife and family sit down about a fireside bright   it was his story and his life most of his fellowconvicts gathered there in the circle around leadbelly had heard the song before and most of them knew the words and its name good night irene by heart he had sung it for them on the long hot summer nights that came after blistering days in the cane rows when they gathered stalks to feed the pelican state factory a mill with a  ton intake per day the state ran the mill as it did the rest of the selfsupporting penitentiary spread out over the tract that had once been a plantation they had heard irene before as they had heard most of leadbellys big bagful of more than  songs but they had never heard it sung quite that way for this was a day of triumph for leadbelly a day he had lived all his life to celebrate this convict without knowing how or why a responsibility had fallen on his shoulders was a man with a long way to go the journey now more than twothirds run had begun more than  years before on the day a son named huddie had been born to sarah and wess ledbetter on a farm near mooringsport louisiana probably in the year  before it came to an end leadbelly would go halfway around the world with his own inextinguishable and apparently inexhaustible stock of music and folkways with that would go a way of living beyond the margin of comfortable society that would qualify leadbelly to stand at the same bar with o henry and gauguin villon and van gogh he was not an average man his mother was half cherokee and that explained the copper in his otherwise richly dark skin it might explain too some of the dark confusion and tragedy of leadbellys life but it would be only part explanation the ledbetters enjoyed as many negroes living in the caddo lake district of louisiana have enjoyed a degree of freedom and independence his father wess had bought   vi acres of land when leadbelly was five years old and worked most of them leadbelly used to say that he was pretty happy as a child that my father would cut down trees and my mother would cut down brush and id be home sleepin   they never touched me to whip me possibly this gentleness of his parents came from deep religious convictions but it was not enough as huddie grew stronger and smarter the conflict came with adolescence and the development of leadbellys giant physical prowess as long as he was a little boy the son of a generally respected and hardworking sharecropper leadbelly was secure nor did his heritage either of african or indian blood cause him any trouble as long as he stayed close to peaceful caddo lake but that couldnt last his troubles were waiting outside as soon as he could get up on a horse and stay there leadbelly rode off into the bottoms at night to play for sukey jumps caddo lake was close to cajun country besides the jumps or play parties there were breakdowns for square dancing the accordion fiddle and guitar usually supplied the music which usually kept going until dawn off in the canebrakes every saturday night at the age of  or  it didnt take long for leadbelly to learn to like girls drinks and music at some weathergray shanty set down in the bottomlands he could play all night get all he wanted to drink and lie out back in the pines between sets i used to be terrible wid womens terrible rough he said years later ive had trainloads of em trainloadssometimes eight or ten at a dance at fifteen leadbelly was married and the father of his first child the next year he ran away his wife willie mae was pregnant againbut not by leadbelly this time he insisted even before this leadbelly had already made his way to fannin street in shreveport he has told how he took off his short pants to go down there and how he sneaked away from his family to do it the first time out he fell in with some girls who were drinking beerand sugared it so it would taste better but when he took off at  he headed for texas i couldnt sleep for thinkin bout the music is the way leadbelly described his appetite for mu sic while still a boy his uncle bob had taught him how to play the guitar then at the sukey jumps he learned about the accordion i as good as they had on a win jammer he boasted the first piece i ever learned to play was po howard from jim faginan green corn from bud coleman these were dance tunes and that was a beginning the rest of leadbellys music came from sources as varied as his wanderings and no one knows exactly what these were at  after two years of rambling he banished away and went out in west texas pickin cotton he had also recalled how he went into a bar one day and found blind lemon jefferson little bit of something about blind lemon yes sir just to remember him he said in answer to a question years later  cause him and i was buddies we used to play all up and around dallas texas the guitar plinked gently as he talked along fort worth    we just get on the train an them time wed get on the    that interurbans run from waco to dallas    cross the cannon walk the hatchet from dallas an then they had interurban that run fum down to fort worth id git blind lemon bout home an wed get out two guitars an wed just ride anything wouldnt have to pay money in them times wed get on the train ride to tyler texas everywhere we wanted to go    well we just get on an the conductor say boys seein how yo all going to play music an we told him yas an wes just out collectin money thats all we want extra money you know an so we sit down turn the seats over an hed set in front of me an id sit down there an start   another twang of the guitar got a silver city out there too we always go through silver city    anwhen we get on the bus were silver city bound first a lot of pretty girls out there an thats what we was looking for you know we like for women to be around cause when women are around that brings mens an well git money cause when you git out there the women git to drinkin an not thinkin they just fall all up on you an boy that make us feel good an we tear them guitars all to pieces    never would quit playin leadbelly was learning his music the best way picking it up as he went along blind lemon who needed a lead man to guide him on his tours was a willing teacher in this way leadbelly lived out the kind of experience that has given to music and folklore so much of its vitality and lusty repertory he rolled along learning from others all the way always adding to music he already knew in dallas in  leadbelly heard his first jazz band he threw in for a while with a crew that toured the streets playing alternately guitar accordion mandolin mouth harp and bass fiddle and he had more encounters with women in marshall a town near the texaslouisiana line where he  at one time may have gone to college he was hauled into court by a woman who claimed he had attacked her for leadbelly this was the first real trouble he was sent up for a year on the harrison county chain gang on the third morning out the guard got nasty as leadbelly said later in his magnificent chaingang song take this hammer that hurt my pride he just couldnt take it so he cut out across the fields chain and suit with a slug from the guards winchester nicking up the ploughed ground beneath his feet that first time he was lucky enough down in the backwoods he found some negro men and women hoeing they cut his chain loose with an axe and he somehow got home to caddo lake and hid away for a while in a cotton patch the next trouble leadbelly had was more serious on may   he was charged in the bowee county court house in new boston texas with murder and assault to murder in this case with two men a gun had been drawn and one of them had fallen leadbelly alias walter boyd on this slate was sentenced to thirty years he tried two breaks the first time he got clean out of jail and stayed out for three days then on june   he was sent up to the shaw state prison farm to serve out his year term not long after he took to the pines once more the hounds were after him and he was trapped but he couldnt go back so he jumped into the water they fished leadbelly out of the stream half dead and for a while at least broken in spirit but it didnt take long for him to come back when he did though his spirit had changed instead of trying to run away he tried to work his way out both literally and with guile that was where his strength and his music both helped while he had been out in the blacklands belt of texas leadbelly had done some hard cottonpicking his wife at that time lethe showed him how one day he got the hang of it and before long he climbed up from lethes respectable  pounds of cotton a day to an impressive  pounds then to  pounds a day then he heard of a man who could do a thousand a thousandpicker dont look back at it he yelled and shot for that mark so he was ready for the prison farm once he made up his mind to work he became as alan lomax has written the number one man in the numberone gang on the numberone farm in the statethe man who could carry the lead row in the field for  or  hours a day under the boiling july and august sun and then cut the fool for the guards all evening  cutting the fool for the guards was part of leadbellys plan for his freedom one day he heard that governor pat neff occasionally came to inspect the farm by now leadbelly knew the power of his music he had seen it charm coins out of rich white folks hands in the plushy suburbs of dallas he had ridden all over west texas using his guitar as a free ticket it had got him out of scrapes and women headed for it like bears for honey one night a woman threw herself into his arms so hard she broke all but one of the strings of his guitar besides knowing what he could do with music leadbelly had added to his stock of it along fannin street in the redlight district of shreveport he had heard slow somber blues moaned out by weary prostitutes he had heard flashy ragtime pianists in the cabarets and more elegant bordellos on the state farms he had tapped the rich source of afroamerican song and lore that goes back farther than inmates can remember work songs came as naturally to him as the heave of a hammer or the heft of a steel rail fancy songs he knew from childhood down the red river valley and along the brazos bottoms he had heard cowboy songs old slave shouts field hollers and laments in tent shows that toured the south he heard minstrel music and in one tent in particular he remembered hearing black patti the negro coloratura who had a company of troubadours and who wound up an evening of cakewalks with a finale billed as the operatic kaleidoscope on the mississippi he had picked up the songs of roustabouts stevedores levee workers and boatmen as part of his own oneman performances he had added dancing to his music and could do a buckandwing ballthejack and eagle rock he knew hundreds of popular songs and had already improvised verses of his own based on their melodies his version of the titanics sinking had proved a hit wherever he went leadbelly in  then was no mere singer of folk songs as they were then being sparsely studied in american universities he was a fullfledged two fisted professional entertainer a member of good standing of the raw roistering frontier life of river and valley mesa and bordello before governor pat neff came to the shaw state prison farm leadbelly had worked up a piece called governor pat neff it isnt hard to imagine leadbellys cavalier words of greeting to the titlesubject of his song when pat neff did come down leadbelly was summoned to the edge of the porch much as negroes in the old feudal south used to come up to the plantation verandah with their rattles and jawbones and cakewalking to entertain de white folks he danced he sang he played the guitar he worked all the way up through his routine then brought out the governors song as if it were the most casual interpolation the effect was shattering but it produced a result far from what leadbelly who had counted on it to immediately open the gates of the prison farm had intended neff said right off he wouldnt pardon leadbelly im gonna keep you down here to play for me when i come the governor told him but when i get outa office im gonna turn you loose if its the last thing in the world i ever do leadbelly had to wait until january   for the governor to keep his promise then just five days before ma ferguson the first woman governor of texas and second woman to hold that office in the united states was inaugurated the pardon for leadbelly came through to the state prison farm huddie leadbelly was out but it was a changed world he was a marked man now with all counts against himfirst for attacking a woman second for murder and assault to murder no hundred other counts could have indicted him more a negro and a man in the deep south he found himself condemned to exist in a halfworld always living in shanties down on the other side of the tracks always performing in halflit lowcaste gin mills and dance halls he tried hard work at first and was employed in a buick agency in houston from  to  but trouble clung to him as persistently as music stuck in his head in the next five years he came close to being killed at least three times and was undoubtedly involved in scores of other unrecorded fights the first incident was recalled years later when xrays of leadbellys skull in a new york hospital recorded a fracture he said then that he had felt numbness in his head for many months after the night a bottle cracked his scalp open he never went to a doctor on another night he was picking out mrtom hughes town on his guitar in a dance across the lake from oil city when a man stuck a knife in his neck and drew it half around to the other side before his girl era beat off the wouldbe murderer huddie went to the police that time bleeding like a hog and was told to get out and fast then for the third time he was attacked while on the way home from work some men stopped him and asked for whisky from his dinner pail he swore he didnt have any and when he refused to give up his pail his blood began to flow again on february   leadbelly was packed off to angola with a second assault with intent to murder written against his name when john alan lomax a scholar a southern gentleman and curator of the archives of american folk music of the library of congress found leadbelly at angola he pulled every wire in sight and added a few invisible ones of his own to get him out leadbelly  made his contribution to the campaign by composing a new gubernatorial song this one titled governor o k allen dedicated to the louisiana incumbent a hard man who had vowed never to release any con from any state pen the new song about governor allen was duly recorded by lomax and transmitted to the governors office nothing happened more people were seen then it was finally announced that leadbelly although he had not served his term of ten years could be released on a technicality by august of  huddie would have accumulated enough good time to warrant a reprieve that gave huddie leadbelly on august   a little over fifteen years until his death on december   in which to transmit his music to the world but the rest of the world was slow on the day of his release there were no more than a handful of persons including john a and alan lomax his son who were aware of leadbellys vast repertoire and its potential impact on american music these two men arranged tours for huddie and after he got to new york helped him with recording dates but aside from a temporary flurry caused in campuses along the eastern coast where leadbelly had lectured and sung and a spurt of publicity that ensued when his book negro folk songs as sung by leadbelly was published the rest of the country remained unmoved sales of the book slumped at the  mark the march of time did a quick runthrough of leadbelly in march  reenacting his release from angola but this was not enough to swing leadbelly into the position of national stardom that he felt he deserved this was a strange thing about leadbelly as long as he lived he was sure of his greatness he thrust it upon everyone and in so doing alienated many persons who might otherwise have been eager to help him almost all the time during his last  years he was talking to persons who only halfbelieved him halflistened to him ise the king of twelvestring guitar players of the world he used to boast and everyone smiled indulgently tse the greatest folk singer in the world he said and titters ran through small audiences in small rooms he recorded for many recordcompany labels large and small first perfect milotone then musicraft victor asch and capitol and none of the records sold very well the song he had always said was my song good night irene he recorded for both asch and capitol neither pressing sold well he was interviewed by theatrical agents and each one had a different idea one wanted to put him on the concert stage another suggested that he grow his hair long cultivate a beard and pose himself into a big role as de lawd in a revival of green pastures the folk song people took him to their hearts but that was a limited circuitabout  records sold every time he cut one he sang at the village vanguard an intellectuals bistro in greenwich village and for this he earned  a week and an occasional nod from a stray critic who became lost below nd street and broadway for a time he was the nineday wonder of the leftwing world he played for rallies he played for parties he was feted and considered socially significant writers found that his songs were founded on social protest sure there was social protest in leadbellys songs they were about his life and the way he and a great many other negroes had been kicked around in the south but they didnt always read like the latest dateline from union square and after a while the tide of leftist praise receded leadbelly was broadminded he also composed songs celebrating the virtues of wendell willkie and came up with an ode on princess elizabeths wedding day the trouble seems to have been that everyone saw a little part of leadbelly but no one saw all of him tin pan alley too turned him down although irene when published after his death by a little sheet music company the first possibly the second music publication ever accorded him was plugged to a faretheewell and sold over a million copies in the decca recording alone sometimes his attempts to get in the bigtime were pitiful in  without a contract without even an offer he boarded a train for hollywood sure that this was his destiny but like many another of leadbellys destinies it fell as flat as celluloid during his entire stay there the only offer he ever got was to play for partiesparties given for the stars but leadbelly although he was patted on the head by a galaxy of them was there not as a star but as a curiosity on the performers platform he had sense enough not to be fooled by that and he returned to new yorkstill pretty broke but much wiser but he accomplished two extraordinary things in those last  years of his life and by these things alone huddie stands a good chance of being remembered in the first place he succeeded in making good on a boast he had sung when he first hit manhattan i was born and raised in the country man but im stayin in town by this he sang that he was turning his back on the south because he had lived there as a condemned man he was going to make good in the city and stop ramblin an stop gamblin many of his friends thought hed never make itthat exposed to the hypedup tempo of subway life booze and a whole city of new women he could never stay out of trouble but he did a great deal of the credit for that goes to martha promise a girl he had met in louisiana but married later  in wilton connecticut in  martha stuck with him and she gave him a fireside bright to come home to huddies other accomplishment was sweated out under a sort of desperation that must have been almost as great as the desperation he knew when he halflived a condemned man on the other side of the tracks in the south what he did during those last  years was to get all of his music down with calm cheerful insistence he somehow managed to hand over most of his vast inheritance of folk music from the past blues slave songs spirituals work songs ballads popular songs everything was set down in one form or another some of it is on records now for the most part out of print some of it is on several thousand feet of tape recorded only a year before he died some of it was transcribed and published in the first book about leadbelly some of it reposes in the form of aluminum discs in the archives of the library of congress still more was recorded by moe asch of folkways records who plans to issue one longplaying record a year from this source as long as it lasts further material may come to light if and when columbia records chooses to open its archives of leadbelly recordings of all this material so far only irene had enjoyed any great public acceptance yet there is in the rest of this legacy of leadbellys enough to serve as basis for at least two more books a trio of operas a score of films and a bakers dozen of popular hits when irene burst upon leadbellys first big public a few short months before his death in late  the cognoscenti of the music world discovered a resemblance to the music of stephen foster in leadbellys song they were years behind a biographer of foster who had already and quite unconsciously delineated this resemblance he has published  songs and instrumental compositions john tasker howard wrote some  years after fosters death wrote howard the best of the songs form the most important group of peoples songs that have ever come from the pen of any one composer they are probably the most typically american expression that any composer has yet achieved born and raised in the interior foster was little affected by the foreign immigration of musicians that enslaved the seaboard in midcentury the influences that molded foster were inherently americanthe singing of the negroes on the wharves of the ohio river and the sentimental songs that were carried through the country by the socalled singing families in concert he found a medium that was simple and sincere at its best dealing with emotions that are fundamental to all mankind and at its worst never quite so bad as the other popular songs of his own day or later why shouldnt there have been a resemblance between stephen foster and leadbelly the point is interesting and undoubtedly true but like many another approach to huddie during his lifetime it misses the essential in this singer and dancer convict and rambler we had another and possibly even more prolific and imaginative stephen foster in our midst he was quite a character this man who spent most of his life fighting wenchingand singing

the summer of my six£ teenth year got started in the same way as any other summera lot of tennis in the morning in the washington park courts and swimming afterwards in the park pool down near fiftyfifth street i saw a lot of ben better than swimming myself i liked to watch him gliding up and down that great big pool he was like a great fish sliding through the water and i liked to watch him leaping off the high board winging upwards a mite before leaning down into the cool greenblue water cutting it with scarcely a splash and when he would climb out so tall so brownblack and glistening and come over where i was sitting and id say hi and hed say hi whats new my heart would pound violently and id know that it was a summer like no other there were to be dances in the park that summer that was different carpenters laid a wood floor for dancing in the old boathouse down by the side of the lake and at one end of it they set up a bar for soft drinks folks were talking about those dances and about the balloons and streamers and japanese lanterns that would decorate the boat house evenings i sat on my porch an old grey stoop with iron balustradesthe same as every other porch down that block of plain brick row houses i just sat there leaning again the iron balustrade watching the catalpa tree which shaded the porch shed its fading pink blossoms little girls played rock school on the stoop next door their flared pleated skirts stood out as they bounced up and down the steps little boys slid down the balustradesno handsand folks passing by complained about the heat and called hey boy to the men peddling ice cream bars one evening that summer when i was sitting on my stoopsitting there with nothing whatever to do ben came down the street i dont even remember what i was thinking about just suddenly big as life there he was and i was smoothing down my dress and smiling at him and saying hi and wondering if my eyes were as wide apart as folks said and if my bangs were lying flat against my forehead or rising upwards from the heat ben said hi to me and his teeth were gleaming in a friendly smile and his beautiful body was standing full before me close enough to reach out and touch he sat down on the steps besides  « v me and started talking away about this and thati couldnt tell you just»whatbut suddenly he was asking me to go to the dance at the boat house and i say yes without any reservations wondering on the one hand how it was that he had decided to ask me and wondering at the same time what i could wear if i didnt know that it would be the red dress when ben left loping on down the street in an easy stride i took a mirror from my skirt pocket to look at what he had seen prominent eyebrows sleek bangs eyes wide apart and a small mouth made up red a dimple showed in my right cheek when i smiled i only had the one saturday night a tawny brown girl in an orangered dress bangs artfully arranged i crossed my legs waiting for ben elegant legs legs like your mothers my father once said i was glad to have such nice legs to go dancing with ben ben called for me around eight he wore a white suit and he smelled of shaving lotion it wasnt even dark yet but off we went to the park we walked unhurriedly past all those tennis courts on south park empty now in the fading light cabs flickered past us picking up fares but we walked enjoying the summer night at fiftyfifth street we turned into the park and followed the path leading to the boathouse that dumpy old boathouse surely looked different we could hear the music of the band as we came up and then we saw the couples dancing on the newly laid floor balloons and streamers were suspended from the rafters and orange and green japanese lanterns bobbed in the evening breeze just roof and floor and dancers in between and the girls in their summer dresses ben and i joined the dancers we changed off with other couples but mostly we danced together we took a row boat out on the lake under the summer stars and the new silvery moon i remember yet the laplap of the water the ceaseless call of the crickets the smell of flowers and fishy water that night at home in my small upstairs room i sat at my dressing table leaning on my elbows looking at myself in the mirror now at last i was sure that i was pretty at least pretty to somebody i stood up and let my clothing fall to the floor i slid into my pajamas and sat down to pin up my bangs i creamed my face and wiped it clean now it all had a purpose i took a notebook from the  bookshelf ben i wrote and then sally i drew a heart around our namesa childs game and then the speculation tall brown boy are you for me i lay down on my bed to think that question over and wondering about it i fell asleep ben telephoned the next day what about swimming he asked swimming idly i touched my pinnedup bangs its going to be hot he explained we might as well go over to the pool id love to go i said id love to ben called for me at one oclock when we got to the pool it was already crowded i sat on the side of the pool and watched ben swim as i had so many times before only this time i had come with ben i was his date he swam over to where i was and grinning from ear to ear pulled me in the water ducking me until i sputtered i ducked him back and swam off to the shallower end up and down we swamfun to swimfun to float on our backs watching the fluffy clouds drift in the wide summer sky on the way home we strolled across fiftyfifth street bought some popcorn stopped in at a neighborhood show two features and a newsreel ben held my hand during the two features during the newsreel he put his arm around my shoulders sally he said soft on us close together we sat our thighs touching our shoulders touching bens arm around me we were filled with the wonder of each other filled with the wish that the night would never end come in sally father stood in the doorway in his housecoat and slippers i guess that he had tired of waiting for me to make up my own mind to come in his tone was stern and unfriendly it is very very late he said ben took away his arm and stood goodnight sally he said and started off down the street how i longed to run after him how i longed to stay with him forever i hated to turn into the house my fathers housethe house of my childhood dad stopped me before i went upstairs he said that i was seeing too much of ben that i was only sixteena lot more in that moment i could not bear my father i hated him i only wanted ben but then even then somehow i knew that i was glad to be important enough to call out dads sternest voice his deepest concern i knew it was his way of showing how much he loved me upstairs i creamed my face as usual i pinned up my bangs i hung up my red dress and climbed between the sheets of my bed i thought about my notebook but did not take it down there was nothing to add that i wanted to say i remembered too well what i had written in it not so long before  tall brown boy are you for me i knew what the answer had to be and i cried i did not see much of ben after that my father was adamant ben telephoned off and on and then not at all i did not go to the pool i did not play tennis evenings i sat alone on my stoop with nothing whatever to do save watch the children race up and down with their endless games of tag and hideandseek long green seed pods formed on the catalpa and now and again a huge forked leaf loosened and fell to the earth that was the end of the summer of my sixteenth year after labor day school reopened and from time to time i saw ben seeing him brought me pain pain where my heart should be but even then i was grateful for the moments of perfection we had known together sometimes we would meet and he would smile flashing that wide grin he would even say hi whats new and the old rush of giddiness would come over me but id be ashamed to let him see the flush of color that came to my face after a while when i saw him coming i would walk another way the long green pods of the catalpa tree turned brown the children on my street put them into their mouths and pretended to smoke indian cigars they called them for the october school dances ben dated a new girl who had come to our school in the years that followed i had not ben whenever i am thinking many dates  many beaux  but of my youth i remember ben and most of them i have forgotten but that summer of my sixteenth year

the negro in america  nn as some right to he £ sensitive his black  cv face is to many white americans a badge of inferiority even before his actual level of culture and accomplishment is known the prejudice which confronts him at every turn in life is sufficient to implant within his conscious mind the weeds of cynicism and discouragement but perhaps the real danger that the colored man must try to avoid is swpersensitivitythat omnipresent chip on the shoulder with its ramifications of distrust and selfpersecution though in a high percentage of cases his conclusions on race animosity may be warranted he must give the benefit of doubt to whomever he is not certain bears him malice this should be true in all areas of his activity sports housing industry public transportation social gatherings for instance he should not immediately condemn the baseball or football team as discriminatory which does not employ a negro player management on that team may be content with its roster of players at the moment of decision and would hesitate to place a negro of inferior capabilities onto the squad it might be possible that a superior colored player would find immediate acceptance on the team yet the supersensitive negro citizen would despise the team for rejecting a player which in the opinion of the mentors would add nothing to its momentum the theory that negro players regardless of their contribution to a team should be accepted on the basis of simple color balance is no more logical than its reverse of rejection because of color in fact this doctrine has certain dictatorial aspects there should be irrefutable evidence that the owner of a team would refuse to add a negro player to its lineup no matter what the situation then this particular team deserves the wrath of negroes everywhere a good example of a quick jump to false conclusions occurred among a group of negroes in the boston area who a few years ago decided that the boston red sox baseball team had slammed the door on colored players and that ted williams in particular was responsible for that policy this supersensitive group repudiated the boston team the hatred which consumed them when they discussed ted williams was far more deeprooted than the animosity of average williams dissenters but soon the sox were fielding a fair not great infielder named pumpsie green and offering a real chance to a pitcher named earl wilson sports writers who would never flatter williams were admitting that he was working with green without directives from the front office to help the rookies batting average the negroes who had vilified both the red sox and ted williams prematurely should have felt sheepish thus while there are admittedly a few cases among nationally prominent sports aggregates of discrimination the evidence would seem to favor a more tolerant attitude on the part of negroes who would ostracize a white team without knowing all the facts the mantle of supersensitivity moves into many areas we find it in restaurants where negroes are constantly on the defensive as they look for signs of displeasure among the waitresses and other help if a waitress is sullen and illtempered the negro might feel that his presence was the reason for her nasty disposition when actually she might have acted just as unpleasantly with white patrons many negroes seem ready to bristle over any action or attitude that might be tolerated from members of their own race we find it in buses and subway trains where a white person suddenly finding himself or herself seated next to a negro might rise and walk to the door this might have happened anyway but the negro will often conclude that his proximity provided the motivation there is a moment of awkwardness embarrassment or anger which may not have been necessary we find it in real estate where a homeowner cannot reject a colored family without being branded as discriminatory there is real danger to this since the homeowner may lose the privilege of selectivity let us assume that this imaginary landlord has interviewed several white families he has turned down the first apartmenthunter too many children the second flatseekers have all the qualifications but mr apartmentowner simply disliked them for reasons of personality and attitude a third prospect may have pets which he insists upon keeping and the landlord does not want animals on the premises these are valid reasons to reject white families at least no official action would be taken to attempt to force the landlord to change his mind however the homeowner would find himself in trouble if he tried to refuse negroes for the same reasons no matter what the objections the national association for the advancement of colored people would call it discrimination if this double standard is carried too far more and more of the rules which apply to white families will not apply to colored families thus while one must admit that the negro has been improperly excluded from many neighborhoods even in the supposedly relaxed northern regions of america and deserves the cooperation of state and fed eral agencies to improve his constitutional rights in matters of housing negro sensitivity should not expropriate from a landlord his privilege of personal choice in selecting that family which will occupy his private property the same objections which would apply to white families should apply to colored families and negroes should be aware of these common objections and react to them as gracefully as white hunters of apartments are forced to do the same situation exists in industry the boss who may honestly feel that a negro employee lacks the necessary equipment to ply his trade may be suspected of discrimination for discharging that worker supersensitivity more than ever will emerge in this instance since income and sustenance are on the block quite often a negro discharged will complain that the color of his skin was behind his dismissal with the result that pressure may be brought against an employer to rehire incompetent or lazy help since the matter of employment is a vital personal issue one must expect resentment at the time of forced departure from a job on the other hand the inflexible conclusion without positive proof that bias figured in any such decision shows lack of confidence and reflects defeatism it would be better to determine that a competent employee black or white will usually keep his job to some degree the spectre of supersensitivity is present in the framework of school integration but in this area the negro is on firmer ground without question the attack upon integration in education by white people in the south or anywhere else it occurs is the most shortsighted objection to arise in the race conflict what possible chance for equality exists for an ignorant minority what better place to start an upsurge of the american negro than in the schools and most certainly on an integrated level where basic respect for one another can be implanted in youth and where all of the facilities of the best educational systems and institutions can be made available to a people sorely in need of this basic freedom if we can continue to concentrate upon this dilemma in the light that negroes cannot be swept under some imaginary rug and that their explosive birthrate tends to increase the black tide too rapidly for an attitude of indifference we may then realize that extensive progress in education should be made however negroes particularly in the north might tend to be oversensitive on this subject where a section of a city is predominately colored there should not be an enraged outcry at the greater number of negro children in the schools within that area the desire to send children by bus far from their environs for the sake of integration at any cost is once again a kind of hysteria which might well be avoided what all this actually boils down to is that the slow emergence of the negro into the doorway of civil_rights could easily extend beyond the bounds of common sense unless the negro controls his sensitivities and allows himself to be judged on his merits this will not be easy for an oppressed race struggling with a builtin inferiority complex supersensitivity is the disease of people who have faced adversity and scorn to some extent it is to be expected and should be accorded reasonable sympathy only when carried to an abnormal degree does it become reprehensible the colored man who feels that a police officer would not have stopped him if he had been white or that a judge might have meted out a lighter sentence may be grievously punishing himself before he can be accepted the average negro must accept himself in other words he must feel like an equal consequently this would result in confidence and selfesteem two characteristics which would preclude supersensitivity once and for all

if law is an ordinance   of reason directed to £ the common good and if american lawmakers are rational men this article will effect the immediate repeal of u s narcotics laws without great difficulty it can be shown that this countrys narcotics laws produce little good but much harm that they rest on false premises that in form and in manner of their enforcement they are destructive of orderly legal process indeed the only reason for not anticipating repeal is that the wisdom of it has been demonstrated many times yet the narcotics laws remain why this should be so is itself an interesting aspect of the controversy products of the indian hemp plant have been used as an intoxicant by millions of people from ancient india to harlem for five thousand years because they are subject to the new york penal law however residents of the latter community are sometimes sent to prison for fifteen years because someone
finds them with two ounces of the hemp product they know as marihuana under provisions of the marihuana tax act passed in  and now incorporated in the internal revenue code no one can import manufacture sell or buy marihuana in the united states without obtaining certain forms from the treasury department and paying the specified tax since the marihuana act like other federal narcotics legislation is in reality a law to regulate social behavior disguised as a revenue measure the secretary of the treasury invariably refuses to provide the necessary forms traffic in marihuana is perforce illegal and a proper concern of the departments bureau of narcotics behind such legislation lies the belief that use of this venerable intoxicantwhich can be grown in any window flowerboxis destructive to the character or personality of the user that the drug is habitforming that it leads to crimes of violence and in particular to crimes of a sexual nature assuming for a momentand it will be a brief momentthat there is some truth in these allegations there would still be great difficulty in explaining our marihuana legislation for to whatever extent they might be true each of the statements can also be applied to alcohol most of us know at least one individual whose personality has been affected by alcoholism which is a form of drug addiction we are aware that some people become aggressive to the point of violence under the influence of too much whiskey and the aphrodisiac qualities of alcohol are part of our folklore such arguments were in fact vociferously advanced by the advocates of prohibition yet the volstead act has been repealed and america today tolerates despite the existence of four to five million alcoholics some fifty or sixty million social drinkers these latter are sufficiently familiar with their favorite intoxicant and of sufficient number to insist that government recognize alcohol abuse as a problem pertaining to certain users and not to the drug itself marihuana prohibition however remains with us not because of what we know apparently but because of what we do not know the agency most concerned with the effects on human beings of the drug from which we are thus protected by a benevolent government is the u s public health service a film prepared by the research branch of the u s public health service hospital at lexington kentucky for circulation among medical groups shows several experienced marihuana smokers under the drugs influence and states as follows marihuana smokers generally are mildly intoxicated giggle laugh bother no one and have a good time they do not stagger or fall and ordinarily will not attempt to harm anyone it has not been proved that smoking marihuana leads to crimes of a sexual nature smoking marihuana has no unpleasant aftereffects no dependence is developed on the drug and the practice can easily be stopped at any time in fact it is probably easier to stop smoking marihuana cigarettes than tobacco cigarettes almost two decades ago in an effort to prevent use of marihuana from becoming a court martial offense in the military service the editor of the military surgeon col james m phalen md wrote an editorial to which he gave the title the marihuana bugaboo and in which he offered the following conclusions    it is my considered opinion that the smoking of the leaves flowers and seeds of cannabis sativa the botanical name for marihuana is no more harmful than the smoking of tobacco  it is further considered that the legislation in relation to marihuana was illadvised that it branded as a men ace and a crime a matter of trivial importance    finally it is hoped that no witch hunt will be instituted in the military service over a problem that does not exist dr phalen was ignored as medical opinion on this subject is usually ignored but the subsequent continuing witch hunt has at least the advantage of furnishing a corps of imprisoned marihuana users upon whom to experiment  and the results of all studies to date have been negative thus a former medical officer in charge of the public health services lexington hospital can state marihuana is not possessed of any mysterious power to force people to commit acts which they would not otherwise perform like alcohol marihuana is an intoxicating drug which releases inhibitions    by direct action neither alcohol nor marihuana produces criminal activity and criminal acts may result only insofar as the inhibitions on the personality are removed    we see this phenomenon regularly with the consumption of alcohol normal people    even when thoroughly intoxicated usually remain affable though their behavior may be silly or even disgusting the psychopath howeverand we all have one or more among our acquaintancesoften tends toward belligerence with the first few drinks and with continued drinking moves toward complete and uncontrolled violence the dockets of police courts are crowded with these cases every morning and of course hundreds of others are kept out of court by good fortune or the handling of the drunk by friends who excuse his fighting and brawling on the grounds that he has had too much to drink in the face of such findings and the utter absence of any to the contrary our marihuana laws should be repealed or at least revised to conform to the various federal state and municipal ordinances regulating alcohol the government should cease imprisoning its citizens for trafficking in a drug which exhaustive research has shown harmless to its user and unproductive of any conduct on his part harmful to society the marihuana statutes are not reasonable are not directed to the common good and neither produce nor preserve happiness for the society they are unjust so also are the diverse statutes regulating opiateseg opium morphine heroinand these are furthermore productive of far more serious and pernicious effects upon the people in whose interest they were misguidedly enacted although hard to credit by those encountering them for the first time the indisputable facts about the opiates are these used long enough or with regularity opiate drugs create a situation in the body which causes the user to get sick when the drug is withdrawn the illness or withdrawal syndrome is however selflimiting and leaves no aftereffects moreover there are no serious toxic effects of any kind associated with the use of opiates including heroin and one may employ them for a lifetime without physical injury dr alfred r lindesmith of indiana university has written it is impossible to interpret the effects of a drug habit upon a persons social life or his character in terms of organic deterioration or alleged toxic effects    there are no demonstrable major effects that necessarily follow the use of opiate drugsaddicts escape most of the alleged degenerative results of the drug if they are sufficiently welltodo and many addicts suffer serious character deterioration only after the narcotic agents catch up with them in other countries about which we have excellent information    addicts do not suffer the evil effects that are forced upon american users they do not steal lie engage in prostitution or become derelicts to the extent that our addicts do it seems quite clear that american opiate addicts steal or engage in prostitution not from the effects of the drug but from the effects of laws laws which transform a cheap and common chemical into a priceless commodity able to support a vast criminal drug traffic having created the economic basis for this traffic with passage of the harrison narcotics act in  our lawmakers have for fortyseven long years been unable to eradicate it in the meanwhile unnecessary human misery the civic corruption which accompanies opiate prohibition no less than alcohol prohibition remain the hallmarks of u s drug control policies there is no excuse for this the problem of heroin morphine and other opium derivatives is inherently more complicated for where marihuana is less habit forming than tobacco the opiates are very definitely addicting drugs in soberly considering the question of addiction however we must endeavor to suppress certain emotional irrelevanciesnot least of which is an inward fear of temptation many of us are disturbed by the thought of chemically sustained happiness or euphoria whether from tranquilizers the soma of brave new world or heroin this is a legitimate and real concern and one which deserves discussion but it must not be allowed to muddy our thinking about the justice of u s narcotics legislation these narcotics laws are not predicated on a reasoned objection to hedonism or some newfangled chemical eudaemonism they are based on the supposition that drugs like heroin are so harmful that we are compelled to treat them as a class apart spend millions vainly attempting to enforce prohibition and turn a deaf ear to the importunities of addicts whom we thus consign to the underworld when this supposition is shown to be unfoundedand such is the overwhelming import of forty years of researchand when the laws based upon it themselves produce undeniable and widespread evil then such legislation should in all logic be abandoned    it may be suggested that the fact of a drugs being addicting is in itself sufficient justification for prohibition the difficulty is that it is impossible to write a definition of  addicting which does not include alcohol to use the words of dr harris isbell of the u s public health service statistically alcohol is the most important of all addicting depressant drugs contrasting the effects of alcohol and opiate addiction dr roy p finney has written alcohol is by long odds the worst habitforming drug known to man not only is chronic alcoholism many times more common than morphinism but in point of view of viciousness bacchus excels morpheus in many important respects    morphine does not intoxicate hence as a driver of a motor vehicle for example the morphine addict is quite safe while the alcoholic is a menace to society the libidinous insulting stare the fermentative halitosis the disheveled inebriate lying comatose in his own vomitsuch things have no counterpart in morphinism it was dr j d reichard who observed that the alcoholic gets high comes home and beats his wife while the morphine or heroin addict gets high comes homeand his wife beats him    u s narcotics legislation beginning with the harrison act of  is a product of the same mentality which produced the unfortunate and unlamented volstead act of five years later every argument against the latter law applies equally to the former our failure to so apply them results from the relative unpopularity of opiate drugs in our society and our consequent ignorance regarding them as well as from a profound revulsion of the same ethnic origin as that which causes an hashhishusing arab to abhor the whiskey dens of the decadent west america survived repeal of the volstead act and would survive repeal of the harrison law federal narcotic legislation and the local legislation inspired by it is unreasonable in the light of informed opinion concerning narcotics addiction it is productive of much social evil and personal unhappiness incorporated in the internal revenue code ostensibly as a revenue measure it exercises a control over the use of opiates which in the case of alcohol was permitted only by constitutional amendment  and which the people ultimately rejected as unwise for all these reasons control of narcotics should be transferred to the food and drug administration which should see to it rigorously that narcotics are dispensed only by or on the prescription of a physician as prescribed by the federal food drug and cosmetic act the federal bureau of narcotics should be reduced to a role comparable to that of the treasurys alcohol tax unit and the government

quite our problem at the moment we have  pamphlets to count right lets get stuck into cape town central ok there is something about upper long street that is different from the lower half it is clean and dirty modern and oldfashioned plastic and enamel with just a touch of crinoline and the sedan chair it is moral and immoral its shops are respectable its lanes notorious it contains bankmanagers and clerks whores and pimps mosques and churches englishmen afrikaners coloreds moslems africans jews gentiles germans greeks italians it is south african and unsouth african the lower half is sophisticated and pretentious the upper half vulgar and unpretentious boston cloete and lennie damons turned into it from wale street we nearing the bookshop now its not far to go only two blocks further boston said i hope so do you think hell have it ready who katzen i suppose so i dont know the man apparently hes a strong sympathizer that explains why he is helping to distribute pamphlets whos supposed to drop them joel this looks like the shop boston spoke with a slightly affected accent which made people look at him a second time in conversation and wonder where he came from it offended at first until one became used to it his face was dark brown with heavy bushy eyebrows and a firm jaw his hair was black and wavy in durban he could pass for an indian only his accent gave him away he was soberly dressed except for a brown suede jacket which he hoped gave him a bohemian touch just sufficient to indicate that he wrote short stories he was in his late twenties and starting to put on weight he paused outside a dimlylit secondhand bookshop and compared the number on the door with that on the back of the envelope he took from his jacket pocket yeah lennie agreed peering over his shoulder seems like it lennie was as taciturn as boston was voluble he became cynical when aroused very dark of complexion he was often mistaken for african he didnt like being mistaken for african his face was round and the skin smooth and healthy he was an artist fairly successful but his portly shape belied the myth of a starving painter his clothes were neat somewhat loud in contrast to his cautious personality many thought him arrogant and he did nothing to counteract his reputation well lets go in boston said the bookshop was empty except for a bespectacled attendant sitting at a desk in a far comer and a university student paging through teach yourself calculus it was dark inside after the brilliant glare of long street and it took boston  some time to get accustomed to the light the university student nodded to the attendant and left lennie wandered over to the africana section may i help you well yes boston hesitantly began are you mr katzen yes im cloete boston cloete im supposed to pick up a parcel left for me oh yes its at the back of the shop is that the parcel joel left thats it ill get it for you wont be a minute he disappeared into a back room so lennie asked raising his eyebrows he seems all right wonder if he knows joel he must or about the strike pamphlets possibly seems a sympathiser there are i few whites nowadays prepared to help i guess so mr katzen reappeared with a brownpaper parcel tied with string here we are thanks thanks very much mr kat zen boston said putting it into his empty satchel havent i met you before the  bookdealer enquired he seemed j the talkative type boston felt he had to get away he was still suspicious and selfconscious about most whites i dont think so are you by any means a writer well yes i try to thats it i remember your name i read some of your stuff yes i cannot recollect where but i remember the name distinctly boston cloete thats it i liked your stories very much boston felt embarrassed he found compliments gratifying but was never quite sure how to accept them lennie watched patiently this is len damons oh yes the artist yes the artist lennie repeated they shook hands and an uncomfortable pause followed well thanks again mr katzen we must be off good luck and i hope everything works out all right they left the dark interior for the bustle and brilliant sunshine outside it was one of those bright saturday mornings wonder if he can be trusted boston said wonder lennie repeated vast patrols next week in peninsula police chiefs reassurance peninsula is prepared for a possible strike undeclared state of emergency begins the people demand a national convention he found his own relations hardest to convince blearyeyed from        lack of sleep arguing canvassing threatening discussing but what do you want us to do stay at home during the strike its easy for you to say so but what about us we must learn to take risks yes but i have a wife and kids there are wives and kids all over south africa but this looks like every man for himself i must look after the interests of my own children i wonder if your children will agree with you one day my wifes all right mary understands i can keep the kids from school for the strike but joe and i must work and if you turn up and find all your colleagues stayed at home then i come back     but you would have gone look its too big a sacrifice to expect from a family man there are plenty of family men all over south africa who are prepared to make the sacrifice that might very well be but the fact remains that if i dont report for work they might kick me out so so where does a colored man find another job where did you find the one you have now will you politicians find me another dont be silly my kids will starve so that their kids might eat one day im not thinking of one day im thinking of my children not in ten years time or next year but next month im thinking of ten years time all very well for you to speak so but i must consider my position think it over but think fast there isnt much time i dont think theres anything to think over well make an attempt at any rate long street was crowded with office workers lastminute shoppers women with babies tramps newspapervendors slick citytypes wontworks bus boston and lennie made their way towards the central area edging and dodging between people the noongun boomed from signal hill boston adjusted his wristwatch must get to castle stationers before  lennie said why on earth i want to buy some drawing paper cant it wait no i have to paint over the weekend hell must you buy it now it wont take a minute we must get these pamphlets to alec by  well make it there are plenty of buses theyre usually crowded at peak hour well manage they wove their way through the crowd boston stopped to buy a times what does it say the countrys jittery the whole damn south africas jittery strike fever yes what a way to welcome their new republic boston accelerated the pace you helping to distribute leaflets tonight no why the hell not boston turned on him im a painter not a pseudopolitician were all in on this are we ive not been invited thats not funny at all didnt intend it as such must you go through life as a cynic if you prefer it that way o go to hell boston always felt annoyed at lennie when the conversation reached that stage it had often happened before he knew it was useless to continue in the same strain he would start arguing and the more excited he became the more cynically lennie would react finally it would sink to the level of personalities he walked on moodily refusing to continue the conversation cigarette lennie asked peace offering come off it no thanks oh well artists of the world unite your world is so small i love it comfortable isnt it boston sneered very but it doesnt cramp my style but then your style is extremely limited isnt it terribly so confined to posterity what price arrogance they continued their silent walk long street was becoming less crowded but queues stretched along the pavements so boston began meaning to paint masterpieces over the weekend one can but try except that one might succeed that would be a pity how is your novel getting on your answer to dreiser the great south african tragedy no time for writing these days too busy helping to organize a strike how noble yes its terribly hard work not being selfish behold i take upon my shoulders all the burdens of south africa drop dead you started it did i they continued without saying a word till they reached castle stationers ill wait outside boston said alright now dont take a helluva time boston leaned against a lamppost and lit a cigarette the newspaper was full of strike news he scanned the headlines a huge gas explosion at coalbrook high heels prevent city mayors hike thousands arrested in mass police raids theyre jittery he thought damn jittery he hoped that lennie wouldnt be long there was alec to meet at  cape town is ready to cope with strike every hope republic will have peaceful birth we the people are granite durban coloreds on the march transvaal coloreds up in arms two nonwhite men one a young university student dropping leaflets in letter boxes  pm in district six you take the next block be careful right how many pamphlets are left quite a few still in the car ill take the first ten houses no dogs i hope take my torch but dont use it unless its really necessary this is sure risky i know have a cigarette before you go thanks first time you do this yes youll learn i

to knock just slip the leaflet under the door or in the letterbox then run not really unless its necessary ok ill tackle this row meet you in the car ill take the next block all in order v see you later boston finished his cigarette and stubbed it out impatiently against the lamppost damn it was time lennie came he tried to do the crossword puzzle twelve across discovered  a stout domestic penny he gave it up he glanced at his watch  and get to alec by  there was no sense in standing around he might as well find lennie inside and shake him up he spotted him patiently stand ing at the crowded stationery counter while whites were being served first his face was impassive as usual like an african dan mask one never knew what lennie thought or felt unless he spoke boston tried to catch his eye but lennie stared stolidly ahead of him oh well boston walked over to the bookshelves his eyes ran over the titles plays pleasant pursuit of love the floating chinaman he removed the last named from the shelves    what a giddy title this is a book one must not read emphatically not he replaced it somehow he had a strong feeling that he was being watched he looked around selfconsciously the shop was crowded and no one looked as if there was time to pay any attention to him there were so many books one must not read sex detection space fiction he would not shake off the feeling of being watched but then he always felt selfconscious about his presence in a crowd lennie still waiting to be served and alec to meet at  he removed modern american short stories from the shelf hemingway katherine porter erskine caldwell he glanced at the introduction the americans have a genius for the short story   may i help you he looked up selfconsciously at the rather downatheel shop assistant in a pink overall may i help you no thanks its quite all right he said somewhat confused im waiting for someone just waiting he halfsmiled at her are you sure he detected a slight suspicion in her voice yes quite sure why i only asked sorry she turned around and walked away hurriedly boston didnt like it he wished to god lennie would get done should he have come in should he have waited outside why the hell should he he walked over to the stationery counter one cant even look at books in a shop without attracting attention he wished lennie would finish so that they could get the hell out of the place meet alec at  it was now close on to  christ was it a crime for a colored man to read books in south africa couldnt one even remove books from a shelf excuse me was every nonwhite a potential thief pimp liar excuse me the manager stared down at him weak blue eyes peering through strong lenses in contrast to his huge size the assistant fidgeted at his side yes miss smart claims she saw you putting a book into your satchel the assistant nodded agreement of all the bloody cheek please control your language do you mind mind what opening your satchel yes i do mind i mind very much may i ask what you have in there encyclopaedia britannica and van riebeeks journals im not asking for your sarcasm and im not asking for your cheek will you please open your satchel im waiting for a friend thats not my business neither are the contents of my satchel very well if you insist on being difficult i shall have to call the police boston felt strong resentment humiliation had he been a white man they would have taken him to the privacy of the managers office a crowd collected must he be subjected to all this they could call the whole bloody police force he would not open his satchel whats up lennie enquired anxiously as he came over im accused of stealing books hell so so theyve gone to fetch the cops thats bad yeah what are we going to do we stay right here that could be nasty well im not a bloody thief the crowd increased in size the manager bustled his way through leading a policesergeant and an ordinary constable whats your name the sergeant demanded cloete boston cloete age twentyseven years address is all this necessary address eight church street crawford where do you work im a writer a what a writer the crowd giggled the sergeant noted down the details in his book well then open your bag boston reluctantly started undoing the straps the constable grabbed the satchel from him and removed the brown paper parcel he handed it to the sergeant whats in here lady chatterleys lover which i wrapped up before i stole it from the childrens section the sergeant glared at him then commenced undoing the string he removed a pamphlet and read slowly his eyes hardened oh i see he said ill give you lady chatterley come along with me

i guess that most of us have some kind of prejudice though a prejudice may be positive we usually think of the negative kind the objection to a whole class of people on the basis of experience with a certain number or simply on hearsay some prejudices like those against divorcees artists clergymen or ivy leaguers cause disadvantage only to the people who hold them in the sense that these individuals automatically cut themselves off from contacts which might be valuable in different ways its the prejudices shared by the members of a dominant group and carried out into discrimination against others which really hurt i try to imagine sometimes how painful it must be for a parent to have to tell his young son and it has to be told by the time he is four or five that he will automatically be considered undesirable no matter how good his character and behavior that he will have to be prepared for slights and insults beginning soon if your child is being picked on by one bully its not difficult to explain that this individual is rude or all mixed up but what do you say when it is the bulk of the community it must be hard to reconcile this for him with the religious and ethical ideals you are trying to teach about gods justice the good intentions of most people the obligation to respect them we know that children and adults are influenced to behave according to the expectations of the community i think its a tribute to the good job done by the overwhelming majority of parents of scorned groups that their children have grown up not too seriously impaired by the low opinion in which they are held in the community we are less apt to think about the effect of serious prejudices on those who hold themand on their children at first glance you might think that being in the supposedly preferred position they wouldnt really be harmed but i think that from the psychological point of view there must always be at least some damage to personality the young child who is being taughtby parents or playmates to look down on or shun a group is usually being given the impression that they are somehow dangerous  remarks such as they arent like us    they arent nice    theyre dirty have a vaguely ominous sound its left to the anxious imagination of the preschooler to picture just what the danger consists of this has the same effect on children as giving them fears about policemen or bogeymen or kidnapers which most educated parents try to avoid nowadays to the degree that the child takes the warnings seriously he feels endangered by the group this impairs his trust in people andmore seriouslyhis trust in his own ability to deal with people it also gives him as he grows older an unwholesome method for bolstering his ego when he secretly feels inadequate i think that most of us when we hear a grown man making sneering remarks about a minority immediately sense his lack of selfconfidence his readiness to seek solace through scorn and we lose some of our respect for him so it seems to me unhealthy from the point of view of the childs own welfare to start him out with readymade fears readymade selfdoubts readymade props i suppose that the readiness of human beings to believe ill of an entire group or to swell their dislike of a few individuals into a wholesale prejudice is a capacity which was built into humanity during the savage process of evolution so that men who were threatened with a genuine plot or an enemy tribe would be suspicious enough to fit little pieces of evidence together and to take alarm it is illuminating and disheartening to read for instance a description by an anthropologist of tribe a on a pacific island who are nice people but who believe that tribe b a few miles away are fiends when the anthropologist moves over to live with tribe b he finds that they too are agreeable people but they feel terribly threatened by what they consider the bloodthirsty barbarians of tribe a in a discouragingly similar way in times of hot or cold war in the twentieth century russians germans britons japanese americans have been easily convinced that the enemy were hardly human but experience in the psychiatric clinic as well as in life shows us that there is enormous variation in the amount of suspiciousness and hostility in different individuals one child grows up ready to hate almost everybody another reared in an unusually loving and peaceful family cannot be taught a deep distrust of anyone it may be helpful for our discussion if i point out some of the violently prejudiced distortions of thinking which are obvious in the mentalhospital patients whom we call paranoid this should aid our understanding of some of the deeply hidden roots of ordinary prejudice in everyday people since most of us have the capacity to think in a slightly paranoid way when we feel threatened if insecurity drives the paranoid individual into delusions he imagines that he is both a victim of persecution and at the same time a highly important personagethe head of the secret service for instance or the leader of a worldwide religious sect he keeps enlarging his estimate of the plot against himself until it involves an entire fraternal order or the hierarchy of another religion or international communism though his reaction is insanely exaggerated it reminds us of the ordinary person whose sense of inadequacy makes him feel threatened by a whole group and who tries to overcome it by thinking and talking about how superior he is to them paranoid individuals are also haunted by sexual jealousy they frequently imagine when sick that many people are carrying on successful affairs with their spouses hitler who was not insane by the usual definition but who was severely paranoid in personality rose to power in part by selling his idea that the jews were all plotting together to destroy germany and he and many of his henchmen kept themselves in a frenzy with the fantasy that the jews were successfully seducing aryan girls on a wholesale scale in the end he nearly destroyed his nation this reminds us of the preoccupation of some raceprejudiced americans from all parts of the country whose most impassioned arguments for segregation is their assumption that if white girls should go to school with negroes or work with them theyd automatically prefer to marry them these men repeat with childish belief fantastic tales about the superior virility of negroes doctors know that sexual success and doubt and failure are the monopoly of no race when the integrated use of childrens public swimming pools has been discussed in certain cities the agitated opponents have not objected so much to boys swimming with boys or girls with girls but to white girls swimming with negro boys these examples from the hospital and from the outside world give us clues to the basic importance of insecurityincluding sexual insecurityin prejudice fear of competition for jobs is another factor but this is not to say that only the sick or the very insecure are prejudiced if that were true the solution would lie entirely within the field of preventive psychiatry it would be an enormous burden for psychiatry but it would excuse the rest of the community unfortunately a degree of prejudice can be taught easily to all except those who are thoroughly trustful and loving a tragic example is the apartheid movement in south africa in which political leaders have convinced a majority of the electorate without valid evidence or provocation that they are so threatened that they must enact harshly discriminatory laws against negroes and asians  this campaign of fear and hostility is creating of course the corresponding feelings in those who are attacked thus the political majority has made itself sick with suspicion and is inviting its own destruction babies and small children may be temporarily frightened by someone who appears strangein pigmentation or garb or manner or tone of voice but they sooner or later come to trust anyone who is sympathetic and affectionate by four and five they are interested in their parents ideas about the world and sensitive to their parents feelings about individual people but they are not so ready for generalizations and rationalizations that they can be said to have fixed prejudices more important in regard to their future is whether they have learned to trust their parents consistent love and through this to trust other people generally and themselves for the specific teaching of tolerance or intolerance i think that the early school years are particularly important at this age the child by his very nature is easily able to be pushed in either direction he is seriously interested in what the outside worldof contemporaries and adultsconsiders right and wrong he feels the obligation to channel his aggression within socially acceptable limits he wants to be a member of the right group and to conform to its pattern hes ready to disapprove of wrong individuals and groups if he spends these years with friends and adults who have common prejudices he takes these to be not only permissible but noble hes proud to be included as a soldier on what he assumes is the righteous side but if his parents and particularly his teacher whom he now considers a higher authority than parents take advantage of the occasions provided by books the news the neighborhood the classroom itself they can teach tolerance instead they can agree with him that everyone has personal likes and dislikes most of which hes entitled to they can show him that every racial religious and nationality group has produced benefactors scoundrels and everything in between they can point out that the very same groups which are looked down on in one country are well accepted in another they should explain with regret that prejudices are held in all parts of the country and that much of the undesirable behavior of certain members of groups for which the whole group is blamed are fostered by the discrimination they suffer they can demonstrate by all kinds of examples that acceptance brings out the best in everyone when children are taught tolerance they do not merely accept it grudgingly they respond to it and practice it with enthusiasm because it appeals to their straightforward sense of right i know because ive seen it happen in families and in good schools

it is like searching for the one woman with j whom jesus christ  had an illicit love affair i thought as i gazed dejectively at the hundreds of pages of worn wrinkled documents and manuscripts on the table before me it just isnt there and yet what i was looking for had to be there there was so much hidden in between those pages during the previous two years of agonizing days and sleepless nights i had read the words in those documents ten thousand times over i had long since come to the conclusion that it was what those words did not say that i had to find it was what no written documents revealed that i had to discover thirteen of us sat around the long mahogany table in the lobby of the theater at the university of iowa that warm day in late spring ten years ago we were the members of the playwrighting seminar analyzing and discussing each others plays hoping that through such discourse each member would derive some particle of constructive criticism to aide him in the writing of his respective play my play was on the agenda for that particular discussion i had selected to write about the wellknown and very eccentric scientist george washington carver the peanut wizard of tuskegee institute in alabama it is a matter of record that george washington carver was a great scientist and discovered hundreds of useful products what is not yet known is the scope and significance of dr carvers chief discovery that is what it took me ten years to find that one hidden discovery out of the hundreds that was his most important most useful contribution to humanity evidence of its existence was well known my job was to isolate it and bring it out of its hiding place into the open where it could be used and applied by the civilization to which it had been given as indiscriminately as every other thing that carver discovered what has not yet been revealed to the american public and to the world at large is that scientist carver spent many years over the test tube and in the fields to discover a cure for one of the worst and most insidious diseases that ever plagued mankind the more i searched into the life and works of this great man this freak of society by analogy to our present day expectations who made his services available to anyone for the mere asking and gave over sixty billion dollars in talent to the world for free the more difficult it became to isolate that one discovery that accounted for his greatness i pondered the facts as they presented themselves to me there has to be some contribution to society that affects the life of every single human to one degree or another after all isnt that the only means of determining true and lasting greatness it is easy to locate in a pasteur or a curie it is far more difficult to point out in a carver since contrary to the usual pattern carvers greatness preceded the knowledge of his most important discovery it was that very factor however that gave me to know in the beginning that the discovery was existent but hidden i knew too that until it was found that everything that george washington carver ever did would be in terms of historical achievement and lasting greatness limited to the realm of mediocrity this would indeed have been an error in history for if there is anything that george washington carver was not it is average the two hours that i had spent in seminar that evening had been as fruitless and trying as the many others in which carver was the subject of discussion we had analyzed his life and works but could not find a single discovery that was universally outstanding to the extent that it affected the life of each person individually we all agreed that there were hundreds of products of merit that had served a specific need during a particularly grave period in a given situation his discovery of a substitute for quinine from the hulls of peanuts to save the lives of the people around him who were dying of malaria because of the lack of quinine is a typical example but the one discovery that could unmistakably make life better and more tolerable for all humanity seemed to have been missing there were outstanding developments from soybeans milk that was as good as cows milk developed from peanuts to feed the starving young patented discoveries of new species of useful plants that had eluded the searching eyes and trained minds of scientists since the beginning of time there had been notable experiments conducted at the ford laboratory to add to the advancement of the automobile industry new methods of agriculture de veloped to give life back to the dying soil new shades of dyes and colors from sweet potatoes peanuts and worthless clay to enhance the beauty of gods universe and hundreds of others that were given to meet a specific need but that were never recorded but which was the greater trying to find that was like running headon into a stone wall and my head throbbed from each one of those sessions he carefully guarded each experiment in this discovery with total and reverent secrecy only he and his god were permitted that secret knowledge during his lifetime at the end of that discussion excepting the late e c mabie head of the drama and speech department at iowa i stood alone in believing that such a discovery existed the incredibility of carvers ventures of his life as he lived it and of his faith as a scientist in the supernatural was one of the more difficult obstacles that i had to overcome in my search i asked myself how could a man of science have had such faith in god to the extent that he claimed divine communication and supernatural guidance in making his scientific discoveries what did he mean when said god tells me what to do is the secret to be found there    incredible sitting there in the theater lobby that day at the university of iowa i had no way of knowing then that before morning of the following day that i too would have had an experience so incredible that it would defy all reason as mans limited senses know reason upon leaving the theater seminar i had the horrible feeling of emptiness that one sometimes experiences when face to face with defeat i felt a strong need for complete relaxation some means of escape whereby i could forget the culminating failures of the past two years that had suddenly landed with one big blow several of us walked from the theater past the art building and along the bank of the iowa river which ran through the campus gently tossing its pale blue waters against the gray stone embankment the sunset hovered over the brink of the distant horizon of the west like a giant disc of dying embers the whole campus was alive with spring and the cool breeze off the waters felt good to my lungs we crossed the north bridge that spanned the river to the east campus and stopped at the iowa union for the usual cup of coffee with the club a heterogeneous group of males and females who discussed everything from einstein to burlesque it so happened that einstein had the floor right off and since too much carver in one day had already given me a momentarily strong aversion to science or scientists i enticed one of the fairer sex of the group to accompany me to the dance floor we understood each other at once she was intelligent beautiful and uninhibited   and a little lonely two hours later we had found our own place of privacy on the grass under the stars the presence of her warmth in my arms relaxed me completely our lips met in a tremendous release of passions and i forgot all about carver and his great discovery  i was glad to be alive at eleven oclock that night i was walking home alone i took the long walkway that ran up the gently sloping grade on the north side of the quadrangle dormitories a grove of trees stood tall and green on each side of the broad stone walkway near the top of the grade stood one giant tree that towered above the rest as if in guardianship over them there was nothing strange or eerie about the night i had no reason to suspect the unusual would happen it was certainly not the kind of night on which one would expect to see a ghost or in any way encounter the forces of the supernatural it was in fact a bright starlit night with not a cloud to be seen and the wind blew so mildly that it would scarcely have swayed a falling feather from its course as i walked slowly up the grade thinking about the wonderful time i had had with my date that evening i had a feeling of peaceful exhilaration she had been good for me being with her had cleared the confusion from my mind now i could think clearly again i mused there was only one thing to be done now and i would do that    yes i would give up this preposterous search    that was the only sensible thing to do this carver fellow didnt make any sense anyway  talking to plants and getting answers from them and all of that    god speaking to him and telling him what to do    no  it just could not have happened for the first time in two years i had actually thought out my real reason for failure without realizing it i was to learn ten years later that the real failure was in my not being able to believe and accept the facts that i had already found i had rationalized carver clear out of my mind  i thought again on the pleasantries of the evening as i walked along in the night i had come to near the top of the grade and was walking under the huge branches of the giant tree when a very strange thing happened suddenly for no apparent reason at all i had a very strong impulse to run quickly it is a ridiculous thing to do without reason but without question or thought i ran as fast as i could the only sound to be heard in the stillness of the night was the sound of my running feet against the stone walk    soon i stopped running and started walking at a slow pace again while laughing at myself for being so silly then as suddenly as the impulse had struck me came the fierce cracking sound from the sky above my head fol lowed by a thunderous crashing of the giant tree to the stone pavement  i had run just far enough to escape by inches the path of its sprawling branches it had split almost in half the next morning i returned to the scene of that incredible experience to examine that tree i was even more amazed to discover that there were no old cracks or lacerations in the wood the place where the tree had split was fresh and green this indicated that the tree had split instantaneously that nightafter i had run clear of the place where it was to land it was then that i began to understand the credibility of the methods and objectives of george washington carver which had until then seemed absolutely incredible i still was not able to isolate his most important discovery at that time but my experience of having received an inner revelation of an impending danger through a sense about which science has no knowledge consequently a sense to which science gives no credit gave me to know that carver had in fact received messages from plant life that god had told him what to do through some sense other than the five known senses of man these unknown senses which science is now beginning to believe that we all possess but may not recognize must have been very highly developed in carver after leaving the university of iowa with a masters degree in speech and drama i continued my search for carvers most important discovery ten years of searching the written records a visit to tuskegee institute and the carver museum and the interviewing of scores of persons who knew him during his lifetime has led me to the conclusion that the many individual discoveries that george washington carver made and gave unselfishly to the world were actually only sequential experiments in an objective progression to his one great discovery which because of its seemingly incredibility could not be revealed during his lifetime likewise because of its very nature it demanded his life in order to be successful beyond doubt his death marked the completion and success of his great discovery of a cure for one of the worst and most insidious diseases of mankindgreed he had made himself a lifelong guinea pig to discover a cure for mans greed it had been an incredible undertaking which demanded the existence of an incredible life    not even the most skeptical can deny that george washington carvers great discovery has been successfully tested and proved at least once by george washington carver himself how long it will take humanity to reach the critical stages of the disease of greed when at such time it will have no alternative for its own salvation but to make use of carvers cure is open to speculation is it not possible to start making application of carvers cure to some degree on a domestic and world level now    would it not be of national and human interest for parents and schools to provide their children with the knowledge of the existence of carvers cure    would this not provide the world with the needed incentive to obtain the peace and harmony that heretofore only the immortal gods have claimed possible  is not the very fact that carver was a mortal in our own time the key to the value of his cure    or must we wait until the united states and russia land side by side in another world to make use of the cure    or will it be after those incredible unknown senses reach full maturity in man    only time can tell the one thing that is now certain however is that whenever the world becomes receptive to carvers cure it will be a much better world in which to live the time for first application is now the world should have one holiday in common  as a first step in applying carvers cure i prescribe that the world set aside and observe a george washington carver day this would be one holiday that both communists and capitalists alike could celebrate together some may prefer calling my strange experience precognition but i agree with george washington carver in calling it god

we are at war today the battle lines  ww j are clearly drawn laos south africa iran east germany  the american hemispherewherever communism and those powers representing western civilization meet there the lines exist the worlds battle lines run right through the heart of cleveland and you and i are involved our sector is a small one but its issues are the fundamental ones people are deciding on everywhere the issues of mans worth and dignity the system of government under which he can best realize this dignity the kind of society which will give him the opportunity to grow lets examine one of these issues in detail racial discrimination its battle line circles the globe from clevelands hough to new yorks harlem from london to johannesburg to bombay to singapore the line runs and on opposing sides communism and the western world face each other in the struggle for mens allegiance you and i are in this struggle whether we choose to be or not we must win it not halfway around the world but here in our small sector of cleveland what is the situation in cold blunt facts were failing our responsibilities to the negro in cleveland or to put it more directly we as americans are failing other americans simply because of racial bias they have been segregated in ghettos and told in effect stay where you are dont move into white neighborhoods they have not been provided with adequate educational opportunities they have been guaranteed an inferior standard of living through discriminatory employment practicespractices in which management and labor unions share equal blame it is not a pretty picture and it has been going on for a long time world war i marked the beginning of the problem war plants needed workers so industrial agents were sent into the south to hire negroes they came to cleveland in carloads many of them with only the clothes they were wearing bound for what agents had painted as a promised land what they found was a city with substandard housing facilities for them a city with little understanding of their problems and little disposition to care a city whose limited social agencies were unable to handle their problems families began doubling up crowding in on each other the slums began by  within a year period clevelands negro population had risen to  and with the beginning of world war ii the process started all over again war plants needing labor negro labor migrating up from the south inadequate provision to care for them and the spread of slum areas in the heart of the city in   years later the nonwhite population in cuyahoga county was  in  an increase of  per cent the negro today represents  per cent of the total county population about  per cent of the city population by  as a conservative estimate it will reach around  per cent this in brief is the story of how the negro came here and why what has he found lets examine this from three standpoints environment education and employment from the standpoint of environ ment the negro has found a ghetto not the walled ghetto that existed in poland during the war but the american kind the ghetto bounded by invisible walls of race prejudice he is segregated here as surely as if he lived in memphis or macon or little rock under law of course he is not segregated he is as free as his white neighbor to move about and settle where he pleases but he doesnt the walls of prejudice are high when a negro moves into a white neighborhood he usually pays higher rent and buys his home at a higher price he lives quite often within a silent enemy encampment the price of acceptance comes high so high in fact that the majority of negroes prefer to live within the invisible walls of their ghettos the kinsman area mt pleasant glenville hough and central these areas all look the same dwellings that range from frame houses to suite apartments small lots narrow alleys occasional junkfilled vacant lots most of the dwellings are old and substandard as to facilities many are pestholes and firetraps privacy is the exception overcrowding the rule we in cleveland have done as much if not more than any other  city in the nation in our approach to slum clearance relocation and urban renewal we have a right to be proud but the slum is still with us so is the big question what are we going to do about it from the standpoint of environment the negro has found a slum from the standpoint of education he has found a school system which as yet has been unable to meet his problems a cleveland newspaperman put his finger on it a few years ago eleventh grade dixie style he said is eighth grade or lower here this means that when a negro student from the south enters our public school system we have two alternatives we can put him among students of the same educational level or we can place him among students of his own age if we go by educational standards we force a  or yearold negro to fit into the highly immature social pattern of  and  yearolds if we put the student in his own age and classroom group where he is the slowest member the entire class is slowed to his pace the answer to this of course is special remedial classes for the migrant negrobut we have failed to provide them instead we forced an added burden of teaching upon the schools and a cruel burden of learning upon students trying to keep up but unable to do so as a result the number of negro dropouts from high schoolor grade school for that matteris dispro	portionately higher than that of whites and because of overcrowded school conditions little effort is made to encourage them to return the result a growing army of unemployed youth ages  no job to work at no school to attend one strike against them because of their color another because they lack a high school diploma as for college education despite the fac hat we have many fine higher educational plants here in cuyahoga county one percent of the students are negro although negroes account for  per cent of the countys population our churches have failed the negro too and by our i mean both negro and white churches in cleveland as a protestant im sorry to say that protestant denominations are most to blame unlike the roman catholic church which took care of its own the great wave of catholic european immigrants to cleveland the protestant churches have largely ignored the southern negro as the white parishioners move to the suburbs the church moves with them and the methodist and baptist successors from the south are left on their own the result churches in abandoned store fronts an inadequately trained ministry an unfinanced church organization and a shallow religious life which fails to meet the deeply spiritual needs of the negro there are of course a few magnificent exceptions from the third major standpoint that of employment the negro has been the victim of discrimination in a peculiarly subtle form he has not been denied work he has simply been denied the opportunity to work at jobs for which he is qualified both by skill and education i think we may as well face a few hard facts about this in our job market today the negro is still the last to be hired and the first to be fired despite qualifications for higherlevel jobs he is for the most part accepted only for unskilled and semiskilled jobs a negro competing with a white man for a professional managerial technical or responsible clerical job hasnt a chanceunless he is dealing with a company which makes a point of nondiscrimination in employment procedures thus the negro is doomed by prejudice and by lack of educational opportunities to accept the lowerskilled jobs the kind hardest hit in a recession the result inequalities of earning power and widespread unemployment average annual income of a negro family for example is  that of an average white family  and when unemployment strikes economic hardship follows a similar pattern in  for example  percent of the white labor force was unemployed at the same time negro unemployment was up to  percent as with housing and education however the employment picture is not entirely dark we have made slow but steady progress over the past quartercentury in providing more negroes with job opportunities in industry weve whittled away at the barriers of discriminatory practices but management and labor alike have a long way to go before racial democracy exists in their ranks this is the negro situation today in cleveland what are the effects of such a situation you can sum it up in one word waste waste of people waste of dollars waste of a way of life waste of people look at the situation a moment today america needs to use every available resource it has in its tremendous struggle against worldwide communism yet were neglecting the negro were failing to qualify onetenth of our total population to join fully in this competitive effort even to support himself and this is waste waste of people we definitely need all of us are very prone to speak of what were doing for the negro weve reached a point where wed better start thinking what can the negro do for us translate this waste of people into economics and the cost becomes impressive nationally our economy produces around  billion a year ten per cent of the people engaged in that production are operating at about halflevel in terms of annual income because negro annual income is about half that of white butif that  per  cent could be brought up to full operating level it would mean a billion increase in our gross national product in  years from now a billion increase examined from the marketing angle waste also exists the negro race today has a purchasing power of  billion if that could be doubled another  billion would be added to the nations purchasing power and this is a home market were spending millions abroad cultivating foreign markets yet here at home is a market of  million negroes more people than there are in canada more than in norway sweden and denmark combined almost as many as in belgium and the netherlands combined indeed if we should merely reduce negro unemployment to the same level as white unemployment negro purchasing power could be increased two or three billion dollars annually on the local level the cost of prejudice is also high were wasting human skills and services that could contribute to the economic health of the area were wasting a large segment of potential purchasing power and were paying for this wasteout of our pockets in tax dollars the reason is the slum it devours health and welfare dollars in  for example cuyahoga county paid out over  million in health and welfare costs the negro race constituting only  per cent of the population received  per cent to  per cent of that money the slum breeds crime it can do nothing else for overcrowding creates antagonisms deprivation leads to theft it is not surprising therefore that between  per cent and  per cent of major crimes are committed by negroes but this has nothing to do with race according to a statement made by a high cleveland police official some years ago if the same number of whites were crowded into the negro areas crime results might be the same environment is the villain here and because it exists we pay thousands of dollars annually for increased police protection and related costs the slum moreover is a drain on the citys entire economic life according to a study made by the american bar association slum sections of city yield only about  per cent of its total tax receipts but they absorb about  per cent of the total cost of services so racial discrimination results in waste of people waste of tax dollars waste of a potential market waste of a citys economic health it results also in disillusionment with a way of life look at the world for a moment through the negros eyes around him a slum beyond that the intangible walls of racial prejudice he knows what is happening in the south he looks beyond the oceans and he sees on all continents the same churning racial problem called by different names and he wonders about words like freedom and democracy which promise one thing but deliver another the negro looks out across the world and says under  years of free enterprise government i have made little progress colored peoples elsewhere in the world have made as much progress and perhaps more under strong centralized government in a far shorter period of time is democracy worth it and sometimes in his heart the answer is no this is waste of another kind for loss of faith and inability to believe in the american dream mean a wasted capacity for responsible citizenship this disillusionment has had two important results first the negro is becoming biggovernment oriented since most of his social gains have come through the federal government instead of through local agencies and governments he turns naturally to the federal government for help this is understandable but it is also a dangerous factor in what is already a pronounced drift toward socialismor big statism the second result of the negros disillusionment is that he realizes in order to gain the equality denied him he must fight for it and his most powerful weapons are the economic boycott and bloc voting if a company is unwilling to give equal opportunities to negroes says the negro it must pay the price of losing its negro customers this is the economic boycott when issues arise which affect his own interests the negro has learned to vote in an organized manner this is bloc voting both bloc and blockade are powerful weapons both are legitimate and if we had met our responsibilities to the negro as we should have done in the past there would be no need to use them now they are forces to be reckoned with the logical question now i think is what can we do about the negro situation what can you and i do as individuals to alleviate and correct these problems there are three things we must do we must first take the trouble to understand the problems we must then evolve workable solutions and finally we must bend all our efforts toward achieving these solutions reprinted by permission from the cleveland

igger nigger this scornful expression followed the blueeyed blonde child down the street from the allwhite school she was of english irish descent caucasian in appear ance but the child was not socially acceptable to the white families of this small town in central mississippi her parents had expressed sympathy with the unfortunate plight of the negro racethe poverty the humiliation the utter hopelessness of their lives this white family had spoken out had dared to be counted with the few who felt this oppression should end they had paid dearly for their courage their schoolage child had steadily lost friends had been dropped by the better families of this old old town had been called names in school since it was learned that her parents were niggerlovers this was a timeless expression a term attached to any who showed sympathy for the colored race another white man welleducated a tenyear resident in the community felt he could no longer be silent he spoke up against racial discrimination the man was in business for himself his world suddenly turned upside down his employees were called names by former friends they were asked do you work for that soandso niggerlover you must be hard up for a living this businessman who spoke just once for right and freedom was harrassed by phone calls night and day by radical racehaters who called him names who shouted obscene words to his wife and daughter if they answered the phone the phone calls reached his brother who was listed under a dif ferent number they reached his mother who lived at another address under a different name this harrassment went on for three days then it quit the man was defeated subdued he had learned too well the price to be paid for freedom of speech in another small community two neighbors lived sidebyside for three years they had had doorstep discussions of religion economics politics then the newspapers printed the shocking news that a grade school in another state had been integrated one man mentioned this to his neighbor he was obviously agitated deeply disturbed almost obsessed with the problems that this could bring to his own state the other man tried to calm him by saying soothingly well it has to come some day it may not be so bad the same people who try to suppress the colored man would suppress the white man too if given the right opportunities the disturbed man bounced to his feet his face reddened with fury he puffed for breath struck his neighbor and knocked the startled man to his knees with one fanatical blow as the astonished man stood to his feet the erratic neighbor ran into his own house shouting you get off my property if youre here when i come back with my gun ill blow your head off the sensible man although stunned at the turn of events left the yard because he knew that most white southerners kept a loaded gun in the house to protect my family lack of personal freedom has been a source of annoyance to one liberalminded man this white retired minister sometimes assisted the sketchilyeducated negro pastors in organizing childrens services townspeople in the small community felt this assistance could develop into trouble and kept close watch on the minister the license numbers of white friends who parked their cars in his driveway were written down and checked against files in the county records to identify the owners of the cars then a selfappointed watchdog of the state would visit the car owners in their own homes warn them that the minister was there to cause strife accuse him of being communistic and warn the car owners that it would be wise if they no longer associated with such a person one individual became angry but later joined the many who succumbed to disapproval and avoided the minister in the future certain churchmen and women are concerned with the ignorance between the two races they realize that the southerner doesnt really know the black man the caucasian may know the janitor in his place of business the storekeeper knows his stock boy during working hours but he knows nothing of the boys attitudes and opinions of the white race that he accumulates in the process of growing up the white housewife may know very little of the personal life of her domestic servant by comparison the colored domestic servant knows everything about the white family from overhearing conversations she knows something of their economic standing in the community the maid may be a sounding board for the frustrated housewife the servant may sooth give cautious advice sympathize but she is never to mention her own personal problems it is untidy of her to do so not the best etiquette and it is rarely ever done because the white race has only a stereotyped picture of the negro race and because the average negro is afforded an even more limited view of the white race certain uplifting individuals may seek to form an interracial nonaction group to meet regularly to discuss the problems the differences the likenesses and goals of both races if this group is discovered by the public as one group recently was it produces unfavorable publicity social and economic hazards to many one such group met in a church although not sponsored by the church itself and brought embarrassment to the pastor dissension among church members and criticism from other sources for this reason only a courageous pastor can be broad minded toward racial issues many white pastors and their churches are cool toward anyone who is liberal in his thinking concerning racial issues to be other than cool or even polite to such a person may create a real problem for the pastor because of this situation the pastors feel they cannot preach the entire truth in this socalled bible belt to preach that love of god results in love of ones fellow man to preach brotherhood of man is an anathema all too feared and consequently avoided by the white clergy on the other hand some ministers are sold out to a racist religion they proclaim it is against gods will that the negro be treated as a member of the human race a generation ago some white ministers preached that the black man had no soul was akin to the lower animals therefore could not respond to a spiritual ministry now in this present generation it is more popular to preach that god made the black man a servant to the remainder of the human race they seek to prove their theories from the bible because this is the bible belt this belt is noted for its many churches its much churchgoing its insistence on having the bible read in the public schools this state votes a dry ticket insists on prohibition at the encouragement of the many outspoken pastors its ministers preach long and often on the evils of liquor but say nothing about the evils of hatred and the sin of violence against ones fellow man that would be meddling in affairs that do not concern the church  often the pastors of this state are leaders in community affairs they spark drives for this and that things that better the community but if they teach brotherly love it is a vague reference to some brother far away preferably overseas it is uncomfortable to speak of brotherly loveunfashionable unpopularin this day of racial conflict it could cause the honored pastor to lose his church in this community and prevent him from getting a church in any other community in the entire state there are many minor evils that a pastor can speak out against and still remain a popular fellow consequently he speaks on them pastors feel that they should not interfere with things outside the church they just want to serve their congregations and watch them prosper yet somehow a certain percentage of pastors belong to the white citizens council a radical pressure group that believes in white supremacy more than it believes in religion the pastor can attend the hate campaigns can even be a leader in the local chapter without searing his conscience in this famous bible belt white pressure groups find it easy to recruit new members and hold old members they create fear in the heart of the white man if he does not keep the colored man in his place he is taught to fear amalgamation of the races social mixing and intermarriage are readily connected with the term integration integration is a hated word it is used as a whip over ordinarily logical citizens of the state of mississippi if a politician wants to be elected he becomes a segregationist he cannot be a moderate the ordinary segregationist wont be elected the segregationist must speak often of protecting our families against the present crisisthe threat of the negro who wants to marry a white woman and rear children of mixed bloodchildren who will eventually cause an amalgamated race of people the implication of mixing the pure blood of the lovely blueeyed blonde southern woman with that of an african causes the most stoic southerner to shiver to point out that few negroes are seemingly attracted to white women that a vast percentage prefer negro women is not logical to the fearful white man why shouldnt the negro want to cross the color line when he the white man has often crossed the color line to seek sexual satisfaction if negro women are desired by certain ignorant immoral white men it is logical to this same depraved person that white women are desired by the colored man knowing his own heart is the thing that causes this terrible fear in the white man when socrates the ancient greek philosopher said know thyself he might have added for mississippi posterity to thine own self be true who pays for the immorality of the white man when he crosses the color line for sexual satisfaction does it bring reproach on him and where is the proof that the white man is crossing the line the proof is in the illegitimate babies born to young colored girls girls with dark skinfrom families of blackskinned peoplewho produce lightskinned babies fifty percent white blood can produce a light baby that is a misfit in a family of dark children the following is a classic example in one rural community a farmer saw a couple meeting secretly in the woods days after day he noticed them particularly since the man was white and the young girl was colored integration between the races is against the state law integration in any form is strictly opposedexcept in the boudoir the colored girl who was orphaned and lived only with two brothers and a sister in their late teens or early twenties became obviously pregnant this girl had no prenatal care it was offered free at the local health centermonthly examinations and vitaminsbut the girl was fearful of the white nurses and ashamed of her condition there was the terrible fear that white women would somehow suspect that a white man had been involved in this and she knew that she would be considered the guilty party she couldnt obtain work for these same reasons and the brothers and sister in the home had scarcely enough to feed everyone there was no money for a layette the baby was bom delivered by a partiallytrained colored midwife who offered no sedation she performed this service on credit for  to be paid in small amounts whenever possible there was not one garment in the house to clothe the skinny squealing infant with the strangely light skin no layette had been prepared not one diaper had been purchased during the lengthy time of confinement the midwife did the expedient thing she removed the pillow from the head of the exhausted young mother ripped off the frayed pillow case and made two diapers then the baby was tucked under a corner of the single quilt that covered the bed he was ready to face a harsh new world what of the white neighbors when they realized this reproach against their community had been delivered ugly rumors began to fly each white wife looked at her own comfortable home her pretty mannerly children and fearing for them fought back she told her husband that she would personally go down there and get one good look at that baby im going to see who he looks like no one is sure how the various white husbands in the community reacted but word somehow reached the young colored mother in terrible fear for her own safety and that of her child she lifted herself from her bed wrapped the infant in a borrowed crib blanket and fled the state by bus chicago is a big city and the orphaned girl had  a distant relative there no one has stated who gave her money to buy a bus ticket but everyone knows that her own brothers and sister were too poor to even purchase a dozen diapers for the baby there are other social problems in this state perhaps not as shocking but real problems nevertheless to those involved a white college professor who is a single woman on the faculty of a negro college with an integrated teaching staff recently complained i have no place to entertain my friends i work with other professors often they too are single women like myself with one exception they are colored where can two or three of us go offcampus to eat in a nice restaurant how can we attend the theater and be seated together these other ladies are cultured refined sensitive to embarrassment where can we go in this state without facing the humiliation of prejudice and discrimination it is just too limiting recently this same college professor received correspondence from a local bank where she had just opened an account the letter was addressed to her without the usual title of miss ann smith it simply read ann smith upon opening the letter she discovered that the salutation read the same not dear miss smith but simply the casual greeting dear ann baffled and angered with this familiarity she began to think through this strange circumstance finally it occurred to her that since she taught in a segregated college and lived oncampus the bank had assumed that she was a colored person in the state of mississippi negroes are never given the dignity of such titles as miss mr or mrs whether in correspondence or in newsprint regardless of age marital status standing in the community or education the colored person is referred to simply by first and last name this college professor decided on a course of action she wrote to the bank and inquired of their policy in addressing her fellowteachers who were negroes pointing out that it was distasteful to her to learn she might have been afforded a courtesy that was denied her colleagues if this were their usual policy she asked that they close her account the bank without any reference to her unusual statements followed her instructions common courtesies are daily denied the negro on the street the young man or woman may be addressed as boy or girl and the older person with grey hair may be called uncle or auntie by members of the white race but they are never called mr or mrs when two white men meet an elderly colored man and inquired directions of him calling him uncle he spunkily replied smiling i didnt know we was kin the deep south and particularly the state of mississippi lives behind a blackandwhite curtain if it creates certain problems for the moderate white southernerwhat does it do for the negro who must live with it day after day year in and year out generation after generation how does it affect his personality shape his ideals limit his hopes and dreams it produces a new form of slavery when actual slavery was abolished even the southern gentleman admitted that he had found a more profitable method of farming it was share cropping under this system today the landlord gets onethird of the crop and pays onethird of the expenses the tenant usually a negro agrees to raise the crop receives twothirds of the profit and pays twothirds of the expenses he also is given the use of a house usually a badly deteriorated threeroom shack that has never known a coat of paint during certain seasons of the year the landlord loans  per month toward living expenses for a family of  or  persons this money is loaned at  per cent interest and it is deducted from the profit when the crop is sold late in the fall there is no source of income in the winter when no work is is being done in the fields if an emergency arises during the year such as a serious illness the landlord may loan extra money at the same interest in a bad crop year the tenant may find he not only made nothing but that he owes money to the landlord this means he is forced to stay on the property whether or not the relationship has been satisfactory because the negro family lives on his property the white landlord often feels that he owns the negroes body and soul if they attend a colored church where the pastor holds some radical views or is a member of the national association for the advancement of colored people the white landlords in that vicinity may warn their people to get rid of that troublemaker or if that fails they may warn the individual tenants to quit attending that church they may be frightened into obeying if all else fails and the indignation of the white landlords is sufficiently aroused the local sheriff may lend assistance a recent case involved a negro pastor who spoke out against popular opinion in a public school for negro children what he said was not too unusual in itself the negro community wanted something for their schoola gymnasium that seemed unnecessary to the surrounding white community to quiet the unrest some colored person had to be made the scapegoat the negro pastor was the victim he was arrested for whitecapping according to websters dictionary whitecapping means a member of a selfappointed vigilance committee attempting by lynchlaw methods to drive away or coerce persons obnoxious to it the white community found this a very effective method in settling the negro communityon the surface at least after the pastor had paid a heavy fine he was released  and nothing more was said on the matter one landlord knew that his colored tenants wife worked in white homes the year round to supplement the family income he had no objections until he realized one family that employed her was very liberal in their views concerning the racial situation upon learning this he demanded that she no longer work for this family although she needed the extra money to feed her large family of fourteen members often a tenant farmer will suspect the landlord of cheating him on the crop but he dares not mention it the landlord keeps the books the tenant is considered too poorly educated to handle the task or perhaps not sufficiently honest to accept the joint responsibility so it is the landlord alone who keeps books at the years end after the harvest the negro is simply told the amount that he owes the landlord it would be presumptious of the tenant to ask to see the books thus he is obliged to stay on the property for another year and work off the debt in good crop years when it is obvious that everyone is making money the tenant may be told that he has earned  profit for the years workwork which involved the tenant his wife and a number of children who worked in the fields month after month for the loans given widowed women may find life hard at the end of the year if one is told that she made no money but that she owes the landlord she may feel cheated this was the plight of one widow but she was afraid to move finally she managed to move her few belongings and halfgrown children at night under the cover of darkness with the assistance of a relative and his battered pickup truck her landlord resented losing a hardworking gullible family he located their new residence accused her of stealing the electric wiring from the old shack and asked her to pay  to cover this theft the woman denied the theft and further pointed out that the wiring in the house could scarcely have been valued at  and was not worth the risk to her the angry landlord finally brought a constable who had no legal papers he warned that she would have to pay the debt or go to jail finally in fear she consulted a lawyer who only advised her to pay he told her that a court battle was useless loaned her the money and suggested that her son work for him at low wages after school hours to repay the debt another widow found it necessary to harvest the crop with the help of her very young family the  and yearold girl and boy worked beside her in the field and the sevenyearold boy was nursemaid at home for four younger children this family of children enrolled in school in the middle of november when the crop was finished because of overcrowded conditions and the late enrollment the oldest boy attended the fifth grade for the remainder of the year without any textbooks the colored school simply had no books to give him in their separate but equal schools across town the white school had books to sparenew books as well as secondhand books for fifth graders in a county in central mississippi where the colored children far outnumber the whites only secondhand school busses are used by the colored schools if new busses are purchased they are given to the white schools because the white man is carrying the heaviest burden of taxation the negro schools accept the secondhand busses and try to keep them in repair it is difficult because they are overloaded busses designed to carry  to  children are sometimes packed with  to  children daily some busses run two routes which means that very young children must necessarily arise early be dressed and ready to catch the bus by  am because too of the double route or the long route these same children may arrive home as late as  pm if the bus breaks down which often happens there is a further delay one mother of a firstgrade child said when bonnie gets home from school shes too sleepy to eat supper she naps then gets up and eats i dont see how she can wait when she aint had no lunch in mississippi the oftennew modem negro schools offer a hot lunch at  cents per child town parents who are employed may pay for this and the welfare helps some families with lunches many rural families who are share cropping and sending five or six children to school can illafford to buy hot lunches some send a cold biscuit and homemade butterrarely ever meatbut the great majority of the young children and rapidlygrowing teenagers must skip lunch the negro school teachers are paid less than the white teachers though the negro teacher may have a better education it is common for both husband and wife to teach in order to have better housing music lessons for their children and the other things that are important to those who are lifting themselves by their bootstraps because the teachers have had education and its accompanying taste of culture it is impossible for them to live under slum conditions such as their pupils may have to do a negro school teacher may discover a colored family in desperate need where the children are unable to attend school this family may be referred to the welfare but action is often slow if a white man recommends a colored family they will be eligible for assistance often a white storekeeper will recommend a widow and her large family with the understanding that they are to buy at his little store if the family fails to  shop with him even though the goods may be overpriced or the credit books carelessly kept the negroes dare not complain in several cases storekeepers have shortchanged a family in cashing welfare checks one such merchant covered up by presenting the widow who protested with several bills one of which was obviously a duplicate of the other one elderly negro woman whose husband was an invalid applied for assistance through the local welfare office the welfare worker arrived at her home studied the needs of the couple and agreed that they could have welfare assistance on one condition that condition was that they would agree to pay  a month for the first five months upon receiving the aid the total of  was to be paid to the welfare worker who recommended aid another needy family reported this same knotty problem to a white friend this colored family had also been asked by the welfare worker to pay  per month for six months in this case to the welfare worker when the family was urged by friends to report the welfare worker to the local authorities the colored family shrank back in fear a negro in mississippi rarely ever takes a case to court because he understands he will receive no justice regardless of circumstances he feels that he will pay his hardearned money to a lawyer for nothing this is particularly true if a negro goes to court against a white person the white lawyers meet together out of court decide how they can best keep the nigger in his place and still collect a fee then the court goes through the motions of a trial once a white judge remarked to a crowded courtroom while the court was in session and a negro was on the witness stand i wouldnt believe any niggers testimony even if the niggers were lined up four deep for  miles down the road in this area there is no equal justice under the law if a crime is committed against a white man or woman by a colored person the police go into action the case is promptly solved action brought in court and the harshest penalty possible under the law is imposed if circumstances are such that a white man has erred against a colored person justice moves very slowly if at all if the case is properly solved finally brought to court with a white jury the white man may be acquitted or given the lightest sentence possible since there are few colored voters in the state the jurors are inevitably white on the other hand if a black man commits a crime against his black brother the case may never get to court its just another dead negro you know how they are always drinking and fighting with razors what can you do with them is the attitude of the authorities in an area where illegitimacy is common due to poverty and overcrowding some conscientious mothers with herculean efforts strive to rear daughters with high moral standards the mothers feel that they work singlehanded without even the cooperation of the law officers if a young girl is frightened by the forced attentions of an immoral man the girls parents have no assurance of getting action by the police in fact rumors whether  founded or unfounded run rife through the colored section of town the parents fear the police the negroes believe the police try to entice young girls into police cars at night and drive them to isolated areas there are rumors that it has happened but no one has the courageor the factsto bear out the cases the problem seems to be that the two races have no common grounds of understanding no means of communicating with each other no opportunity to air grievances and clear up misunderstandings in an atmosphere of common trust when a colored man breaks a law he fears capture by the police although suspected of a minor robbery he fears that he will be beaten and there are reports that it has happened he fears rumors that are spread of a hotbox where a closemouthed prisoner is put in solitary confinement until he is ready to confess to a crime he may or may not have committed this hotbox is a very narrow dark cell with no ventilation equipped with radiators that send the room temperature up up up although he may plead for water it is given only three times a day with a single piece of corn bread there the prisoner is kept for days until he is ready to confess the constant high temperature has caused dehydration and permanent impairment of vision according to medical doctors too many prisoners after being arrested frisked for weapons and handcuffed are later shot trying to escape the newspapers often either do not report the incident at all or give very few details whatever the circumstances the policeman involved is not investigated he is made a hero and the victims family is left to support itself with only bad memories of police officers who used abusive language with the woman and young girls in the home during the arrest after hearing of such incidents from friends it is not surprising that colored southerners fear all law officers there are other complaints one hardworking thrifty colored man objected to the white persons attitude concerning welfare assistance the whites put my people on welfare then complain about it my people dont want charity they want work they were born for work they were taught to work they love work finding work is not always easy for the colored man jobs that pay a living wage are difficult to find only jobs requiring unskilled labor are available and there are more applicants than jobs the heaviest work the dirtiest work with the longest working hours are the only kinds available still there are more workers than jobs if the job is made easier or the hours shorter or the pay better there are a number of whites waiting to take the job from the negro in some small towns in mississippi the mailmen delivered the mail on foot these jobs were held by colored men who did not object to the many miles walked over burning pavement in the hot sun they liked the pay then the government provided the mailmen with motor scooters or trucks and white men applied for and received these jobs discrimination takes on other forms vengeance raised its ugly head when a colored man tried to improve his lot in life one white man had two sources of income he was a city policeman and he owned a small farm outside the town he hired a colored man to drive a tractor and till the land the colored driver was underpaid although experienced for this type of work a construction company needed a tractor driver and the colored man was hired his former white employer was furious at losing a good driver he found a method of revenge when the colored man drove back to the smaller town to visit relatives his car was often stopped by the policemanthe very man who lost him as a tractor driver on the farm the negro was ticketed and fined for speeding not just once but on several occasions many city officials of the larger communities want the world to believe there is racial harmony between the two groups they speak in glowing terms for radio television and newspapers of the good feelings and understanding between the two races this causes resentment to flame in the hearts of the usually oppressed downtrodden meek negroes and a few of themin retaliationtry to use white facilities recently several teenage negroes sat on the benches at the jackson zoo and watched the monkeys at play police appeared and arrested them for disturbing the peace negroes in small groups are allowed to walk quietly through the zoo but the benches and water fountains are reserved for the use of the whites since that incident occurred the benches have been completely removed from the zoo to prevent further such occurrences if anything more bold than this is attempted the white authorities place the blame for such unrest on outsiders we southern folks know how to handle our niggers this serves as a warning to local negroes that they should not try to change the status quo most are afraid to try clyde kenard a yearold negro tried to register as a student in an allwhite college mississippi southern it was necessary for him to make an appointment with the president when kenard arrived to keep the appointment he discovered that police officers were there waiting to arrest him they found illegal whiskey under the seat of his car according to the officers and arrested him on that charge kenards friends stated that the young man never drank whiskey beer or anything stronger than soft drinks still later kenard was arrested and convicted for planning a theft he declared himself innocent the negro who actually stole the  worth of chicken feed and who implicated kenard was given a fiveyear suspended sentence kenard was sentenced to seven years and this attemptedintegrationist is now serving his sentence there is a similar case of punishing the nonconformist jess brown a negro lawyer who handled the kenard case has since been arrested on a bad check charge in this state of small incomes and small bank accounts citizens often overdraw their accounts if a merchant is given a check that bounces he usually gives the person an opportunity to write another after depositing more money in the bank mr brown had traded with this merchant for years with a satisfactory relationship what caused the change of attitude was the merchant influenced by some other element intimidation is a common method of preventing outbreaks of violence several towns in mississippi have trained police dogs these dogs are used in the colored section of town police may hold a dog on the leash and walk through a crowded cafe on saturday night negroes have a natural fear of the white mans dog and the police are aware of this on one occasion police dogs were used to break up a peaceful demonstration the white crowd stood in one group and the colored in another the dogs were held on leashes in such a position that they could only reach the negro group and inflict injury on them on another occasion after a series of small night robberies a police dog was used in an attempt to track a thief when the dog followed the scent to a white mans house and walked up on the porch the police pulled the dog away and urged him to move on down the street a few doors to the colored section of town during the tension concerning the freedom riders police used the dogs to meet incoming busses in at least two cities in central mississippi there are very few colored registered voters because they must pass a complex literacy test each person must be able to understand and explain the constitution of mississippi the test is given by the circuit court clerk in several instances when white people registered and could not answer a ques tion concerning some article in the constitution the clerk either explained the answer cheerfully or gave them a simpler question when the person answering is colored he is not given any help if the clerk has been instructed to discourage colored voters thus pressured he may turn down intelligent people with highschool educations in one case the clerk refused to register a colored woman then observing that she was welldressed asked her means of income on learning that she was a public school teacher with a bachelors degree he replied curtly all right girl sign the register some negro ministers have attempted to register a few have succeeded but others have been discouraged they have been told that it was too late to register regardless of date or that the clerk had other duties and the negro should come back another day the ministers interpreted this as a form of intimidation and were defeated most negroes do not earn a living wage in mississippi the few professional middleclass negroes who do find they have escaped the problem of physical hunger and added a multitude of new problems vacations now possible present new humiliations the businessman whose family wants to take a trip while he is working feels uncertain about travel accommodations one successful insurance salesman told of having to wait in line to buy bus tickets for his wife and children there were segregated waiting lines the white line had to be completely eliminated before the tickets could be sold to the colored line it was a timeless custom the ticket agent held to the custom although the impatient bus driver urged and pleaded and finally swore at him to sell the colored man a ticket the welldressed colored woman and her two neat children waited in humiliation while the crowd stared after they were on the bus they had to find seats in the rear if they had traveled by car they would have bought food at the back doors of many restaurants if they had required motel accommodations these would have been few and far between colored families with two drivers present would have tried to drive straight through to their destination even though they could easily afford a motel and would prefer to stop for the night even vacations are no vacation for themno vacation from embarrassment and humiliation in many areas because of acute poverty the government offered surplus food called commodities to be distributed in destitute areas in the winter months after a bad crop failure this provided staple items such as flour corn meal powdered milk cheese butter and shortening this food was distributed each winter for a year or two in mississippi then suddenly a county stopped the practice when residents of this particular county inquired they were told that it depended on the elected supervisor of each beat or ward if the man felt voters in his ward did not want the needy families to have commodities he did not vote for it why wouldnt the predominantly white voters who elected him want this there were two answers given  businessmen or farmers who wanted to hire cheap labor during the winter complained that the colored men wouldnt work for low wages when their bellies were full of commodities  grocers complained that the giving of commodities to destitute families cut down on the profit of the local merchant therefore the hungry became hungrier colored mothers remarked often its hard to listen to a hungry baby cry hisself to sleep skinny toddlers learned to walk on crooked legs due to malnutrition school childrens lean frames entered newly erected modern buildings smelled the hot lunch cooking in the cafeteria knowing that they would not eat until they returned home six or eight hours later they were expected to learn under such circumstances to fill their minds with knowledge in appreciation for the nice buildings that the white taxpayers had given them physical oppression brings with it brutality intimidation a thwarting of understanding and interaction between the races by enslaving the negro the white man has enslaved himself he is himself in intellectual bondage even the idealistic college students who may be willing to change the old ways are not permitted that luxury and challenge of youth the white sovereignty commission is a pressure group similar to hitlers gestapo it is truly the watchdog of the state students have said that the commission hires a student in white colleges within the state to observe what is taught in the classroom for  per month the student is expected to spy on professors students and school authorities and report on their attitudes and interests certain pressure can be brought to bear on a college that is nonconformist with the ideals of the old south recently statewide newspaper publicity was used against a student who was seeking a college office newspapers considered him too broadminded unfavorable newspaper publicity has frightened away speakers on planned programs also that might have set young people to thinking for themselves they are to be taught as their dads were taught and thus be good disciples of dear old mississippi standing for white supremacy there are some white people nativeborn mississippians cultured educated humanitarian who see the injustices within the state they would change them if they couldif they believed there were others who felt as they do and who would stand firm how is one good man to recognize an ally in a state that has no freedom of speech a terrible fear of reprisal if he opposes longheld customs and beliefs perhaps it is time for the humanitarian men and women of mississippi to stand up and be counted to risk loss of social prestige loss of income loss of popularity in order to change the circumstances before the hated outsiders force the issue
