great lady of opera	
leontyne price hapl gt pens to be an ameri£ can negro born in  mississippi and this circumstance has added non musical elements of interest to her career these need not concern us the singers of the past for the most part also had modest origins think of caruso or emmy destinn for example what does concern us is her voice and what she does with it in that mysterious composite called an opera performance i heard price for the first time at the metropolitan in  trovatore in the midst of the greablizzard of saturday afternoon february   struggling through the polar wastes of the empty streets i reflected that i was likely to have the whole theater to myself not many would undergo this ordeal to get there but on arrival i found a seething mob a good part of which had no hope of getting into the soldout house from her first entrance price was mistress of the stage both vocally and dramatically and by the end of the afternoon i found myself wishing that poor old verdi who never could get a singer to do anything right had been alive to hear her performance she did not come to the metropolitan unprepared or unknown she had been singing in the leading opera theaters of the world but it was at the metropolitan that i heard her first thousands apparently felt as i did that what we were hearing and seeing verged on the impossible in view of her origins we could hardly believe that this ultraitalian and supremely verdian creation could be what she was i found myself being reminded of singers who had not been heard for decadesrosa raisa claudia muzio artists of my youthand then wondered as we all must whether memory plays tricks in such matters but then was not rosa raisa by birth a russian jewess and was she not also the most italian of artists on the operatic stage this kind of bewilderment befalls those who hear price for the first time and as i have suggested  it comes from mundane considerations which properly speaking ought to make no difference in the five operas of her first engagement  trovatore aida madame butterfly don giovanni and turandot price showed a versatility which is not in itself too unusual today there are other celebrated artists notably maria callas who range even more widely still from the ethereal floating high notes of the slave girl liu to the dramatic urgency of aida is quite a distance and the florid passages of leonora are not a bit like the classic ornamentation of donna anna vocally each of the five parts is utterly distinct from the others with price not only style but the very color of her voice seemed to change with the character as butterfly for example she achieved a childlike sound in some passages which made the character seem indeed less than sixteen years old particularly when butterfly speaks of her happiness each of the five personages was thus characterized by the voice alone in a manner which if we were speaking of painting we might describe as the brushwork of a master dramatic outbursts strong high notes and the like are not subject to this sort of characterpainting a high c is a high c and it would be difficult to guess at a character by the sound of it but the passages which hold the drama together the crucial passages which build characterare rarely written to reach extremes of vocal display nor can they easily be played upon as price plays upon them to build up in our aural imagination the personage the composer had in mind too often what the composer had in mind during his long solitary labor is not at all what we see and hear on the opera stage and almost every composer has said so price seems to compose each character from the inside out so that a living being comes into existence through the music she sings what is written in the score and she is uncannily accurate about it her versatility is qualitative not quantitative and depends not so much on the number of different things she does as on how she does them it is that rare thing actingthroughthevoice and it is essential to an opera singer of real grandeur price also has the other kind of acting talent which is the ability to express dramatic situations or emotions by means of the body however valuable this seems to me a secondary attribute for a great opera singer most of our opera theatres are too big for subtlety or suggestion thirty years ago we were told that mme lotte lehmann exaggerated in the first act of die walkure when she pointed out with a majestically extended arm the magic sword which siegmund was to draw forth from the tree in orthodox wagnerism she should have indicated it by a look how many persons in the metropolitan opera house would have known what she was doing if she had indicated the sword by a look nothing less than a broad gesture enables the whole audience to understand what is going on at that point this is the problem of all acting in opera it must be broad strong and obvious or most of the audience cannot see it miss price had theater experience before she sang opera notably in the revival of porgy and bess which traveled all over the world something of the technique of smaller theaters has remained in her consciousness she is capable of very effective details of look and gesture which may not be altogether visible from the gallery her butterfly is full of these small  touches even her aida although  on the grand scale has them she thanks radames with her eyes for having demanded the freedom of the captives her friends and relatives even if each detail is not perceived by everyone these small effects accumulated give a consistent impression of the character she builds her art penetrates the vastness of the metropolitan mainly by its coherence in the larger lines in the main intention thus it is precisely in the absence of movement the classic stillnessthat her donna anna makes its most profound visual effect except in the struggle with don giovanni at the very beginning price hardly moves during the opera she walks a little at the festa and uses her arms when she is demanding that don ottavio avenge her fathers murder otherwise she seems generally still still still she is always intent she is singleminded not a finger moves she does not frown or smile above all she does not grimace she is living for one thing only revenge yet there is a hope at least of joy but it shows only in the voice the metropolitan has seldom been privileged to offer its stage to a performance of such austerity and beauty on a quite different scale her butterfly is as revealing as her donna anna she condenses her body into a small space her movements into the pervasive ballet of the geisha her feet and hands and arms into a style that almost suggests a person confined in a straitjacket her very head into a different physical and therefore psychological relationship to the world she becomes a japanese child bride of about  with a candid willingness even eagerness for the act of love the high dflat at the end of the first act is rapture in anticipation here if anywhere the vocalism and the acting are the same thing on the night i heard it i was oblivious of the tenor even though i suppose he must have been singing that same note in aida there are lines in the text which take on new poignancy and depth when she delivers them those about slavery and freedom for instance if she had an amneris of her own rank at the met such as giulietta simionato their clashes on that subject would be a revelation one vital and littlenoticed asset she has for characterization is a feeling for the italian language most of our american singers and many other nonitalians learn italian parts by rote hardly any of them can order a meal in a restaurant when they get to milan no matter how many teachers and coaches they may have no matter how carefully they may enunciate on the stage and no matter how letterperfect they are on dictionary translations such singers thinking in english cannot feel all the meanings in italian poetry true the poetry in opera is seldom subtle or even good but it contains all the echoes associations and subliminal suggestions of a great language price can put the full meaning into her words because she has absorbed them and to put it plainly because she can order a meal in milan and read the newspapers and get around the town and understand what people are saying to her and because she likes italy and the italians this constitutes to a sense of italy and i never have understood how opera singers have to go on the stage in italian repertoire without it generally acting is hardly a word that applies literally to opera where the conditions of work are so different from those of the speaking stage at the metropolitan singers must be forever watching the conductors batonand not only his but that of the cue conductor in the second prompters boxas well as listening to the vociferous word prompter himself it is seldom that they can afford musically to turn toward the person they are supposed to be addressing to look away from the conductor and the prompters on the opera stage requires a confidence in ones knowledge of words music and tempo which few have price can sing with her back to the conductor and never get off the beat bv a fraction so can callas there is another part of ooeratic acting which is radically disjointed from anything we know in the speaking theater everything done on the stage in an opera must be to some appreciable degree akin to the music slow statelv strides like isoldes or the hop skip and jump of don giovanni are determined not only by the character but by the music itself this fact cannot be circumvented in an opera house all the broadway stage directors rudolf bing has been able to entice into the metropolitan have not overcome this fundamental rule that is so ingrained in the singers instinct what they have to do is almost insuperably difficult  all those words all those notes all those stage directions if they were to try acting in countertempo to the music they would probably collapse so the singers trap themselves into doing everything in time to the music this is fatal because within a very few minutes it will move any audience to ridicule it tempts singers because it is easy and it arises naturally from the task thus it was that amalie materna fifty or sixty years ago began to wave her scarf to the exact beat of the music in act ii of tristan and isolde unfortunately it became a tradition that has long been honored without question only in recent years has the sequence been broken down into something less than calisthenics price acts neither against the music nor in time to it she acts in relation to it she has that natural adaptability which is instinctive you never see her flapping her elbows or nodding her head in puppet fashion in act iii of aida she throws herself into the duet  with the tenor the ugly cabaletta verdi called it the only thing in the opera he seems to have disliked afterward with an abandon that is only frustrated by the woodenness of the tenors she faces her entrance in act ii scene i when she is abject and despondent in the presence of the imperial egyptian princess is wonderfully in the mood of the music without being based on its metrical count but acting even in all the special senses the word assumes in opera can never be the main achievement of a great operatic artist that must always be the fusion of the elements the interweaving of many strands of effort and achievement voice ever first but never to the exclusion of the others this fusion includes all sorts of things makeup and costume among them an awareness of lighting and an absorption in the music to the point at high moments of forgetting the audience price is not yet fully aware of lighting and its powers not many opera singers are callas has a genius for it when she does not have or cannot get the kind of lighting she requires she adjusts her stage movements to get the closest possible approximation if the light is wrong and cannot be changed she simply moves out of it under her ideal conditions of performance the light does not follow her she follows the light the grecoitalian production of medea which she took to london athens and dallas was a high example of the technique with at moments stupendous effects this was prices first season here and she may not yet realize the perils of the metropolitan stage in her final scene of don giovanni she was placed far upstage on a platform from which she could not really have heard the orchestra she could have seen mr boehms beat especially since he kept it high and she has good eyesight she did not deviate an atom from pitch or time conveyed all the meaning of her aria and vocalized with unequaled virtuosity all without descending from her classic stillness yet the lighting was wrong  for her having been spanish all evening she suddenly became caribbean because they had thrown a yellowish light on the remote perch where she was obliged to sing it was not a thing an older singer would have welcomed nor is she likely to take to it a second time a great operatic artist not singer alone not actress but operatic artist excels by intertwining all the elements some internal and some external into the whole which is the creative performance there are few such artists at any time when the phenomenon occurs as it does with price we try to dissect analyze and specify but the fact is that there is something baffling in it something beyond and above what we can label there is a hard core of sheer genius in every such performer the mysterious something which differentiates which sets each apart from all others talent and hard work however necessary to the singer are not enough to explain the awe and wonder that fill us when price sings ii trovatore or butterfly or aida or the others in everything she does we have a weird sense of discovery no matter how often we have heard the music before she makes it seem new and again as has been true of other exceptionally gifted beings of the past we are hearing absolutely for the first time something we thought we had known for most of our lives price being the artist she is will never allow her american success to separate her permanently from milan and vienna she gets a higher quality of cooperation there better casts in generalthan american theaters can afford she is devoted to herbert von karajan as a conductor and since he too is enamored of italian style they are said to produce remarkable results she has exceptionally long breath and he likes her to use it for sustained cantilena even when it is not called for in the score thus giving a seemingly endless vocal line her first triumphs in vienna and milan were achieved with great artists as her colleagues and she acknowledges their help with gratitude simionato was her first amneris at la scala for instance she has had no such luck at the metropolitan or at other american opera houses where as a rule one star or at most two is considered enough for one evening this weighs heavily on an opera like aida which demands four or five singers of the first rank what with illnesses from manhattan weather the present wellpublicized unionmanagement hassles and the continuing financial problems such casting is not possible in new york at this time leontyne price is only thirtyfour and it is possible for us to look forward to a series of new creations in the years ahead there is much for her to do in the italian repertoire she has just begun on the inexhaustible treasures of verdi for instance the time will come no doubt when she will be claimed by some german works too this season she is also singing the girl of the golden west for the opening and tosca at the metropolitan and although some of us have only a limited enthusiasm for puccini it will be difficult to stay away from the house when she brings those old war horses to life for such an artist anything is possible
starred with errol flynn
whenever one of the  later mr errol flynns pictures crops up on tv my husband gives me a nasty grin starts his lights camera action routine as he plays with our now elderly poodle yerrol flynn yerrol flynn is the name on the dogs pedigree because the dashing mr flynnalthough he never saw me in lifewas responsible for my buying the dog also unknowingly the handsome mr flynn ruined a summer friendship for me with a woman named anna in  another negro woman sue and i were traveling by bus to the cote dazure wed spent a wonderful july in europe sue was a teacher while i was merely a housewife slightly tired of hearing about my husbands tour of europe via the army on the bus we met anna a white woman in her plump middle years who was most happy to see fellow americans from manhattan anna was one of those friendly but aggressive types the dominating kind so certain they can do all things right and often do fairly rich she immediately whispered about the technique of carrying american money in the shoulder padding of her summer coatproof of how welltraveled she was anna talked far too much and sue didnt like her sue didnt like most whites anyway but i didnt mind annas chattering she had been to nice before promised to show us the town innocently we arrived at the height of the season minus hotel reservations and after tramping from one filled smallhotel to anotherover sues protest i phoned anna she told us to rush over yes rush to her hotel that she would get us a room the hotel turned out to be an imposing palace on the promenade des anglais looking far too expensive and ritzy for us sue was against even going in she sometimes forgot she wasnt in the states but we did step inside anna had a nice double room reserved for us at the simply impossible rate of  a day i immediately decided i didnt at all mind annas taking over i dont know whether she was lonely or what but anna really took us in hand she knew a number of nicoise and had our money safely exchanged at the unofficial rate then went out of her way to introduce us to her friends even sue had to admit anna was pretty okay i guess anna really made the next few days a dream literally a living dream mornings she took us to visit the homes of her friends or their shops then after a stop at the american express to see if we had any mail we would lunch in the various nontourist the most valued label to a tourist restaurants then spend the afternoons on the rocky beach we seemed to be the only colored women about and caused more neckturning and camerasnapping in our modest swim suits than did some of the startling bikini chicks evenings were also delightfully fullaperitifs on the terrace of the hotel then to some marvelous and cheap restaurant anna always knew about or even dinner in the home of a friend of tiers followed by drinks in some promenade cafe as we listened to the music we fell into bed exhausted every night and i felt i was seeing the real europe one afternoon about a week before we were due to return to paris we were busy mailing cards at the old post office when a thin blonde in her late twentiesabout the only woman in the post office not wearing a bathing suit or shorts came over to sue and i asked in good french pardon me but can you understand what im saying what i asked what is it you speak english the blonde said with a clipped british accent how splendid i took you for africans or    were americans sue told her coldly of course tell me would you care to be in pictures were practically in every tourists album now i began so    no no i mean motion pictures with errol flynn you see were making a picture outside nice and looking for some colored women i was too surprised to speak sue managed to gasp but were not actresses these are extra parts dressed in creole costumes youll merely walk in and out of scenes it will be quite simple the blonde assured us are you interested at this point anna stepped forward of course theyre interested provided the pay is right how about transportation we can only use theseyou two the blonde said seeing anna for the first time they will be paid of course and i imagine we can arrange for a car to take them to and from the set she turned  directly to me where are you staying i eagerly gave her our names and the hotel she said we would hear from her within a day or two and started to leave one minute anna said how long will the job last if they miss out on any paris hotel reservations we expect your company to reimburse them for that the shooting will only take two or three days at most and    really as to money and other such details i cant give you any exact figures thats not my department but i assure you the pay will be standard and dont worry about it i must go but ill be in touch when she left sue and i immediately sent more cards to the states proudly announcing we were going to be in an errol flynn movie anna a bit envious i thought said now ive heard everything this should about pay for your stay in nice think i once read where hollywood extras earn  per day wow sue said slapping her thin face and if the sun isnt right or something it means retakes and more days anna went on i cant remember perhaps they pay  per hour after all youre the only colored women here you should be above extra pay just let me talk to them when they call sue and anna excitedly talked money all the way back to the beach having fallen in love with a poodle pup in paris which id found out would cost  to send home all i said was if i can get my poodle out of the deal ill be happy two days at  per would about do it and  i hope madame simone hasnt sold him already forget  ill get you more than that anna said old law of supply and demand you know listen you wire this madame simone youre taking the dog youre bound to get more than enough out of this to pay for him i dont know i said almost to myself even if i should be paid  theres still another  and im on a tight budget havent the nerve to wire my husband for any moneywe strained like hell for me to make the trip but i really want the pup i turned to sue look in case i dont make enough to pay for the dog can you lend me part of your movie money until we return to the states certainly sue said this isnt money i counted on within minutes id cashed nearly all my travelers checks and wired mme simone the money telling her to send the pup to my husband then i quickly wrote a jumbled air mail home explaining things as best i could we spent the rest of the day at a plage in a state of high excitement talking about cutting room floors stills closeups and what not as if we really were actresses that night we went to bed early to look our best for tomorrow the following day we hung around the hotel finally when the day grew too warm we went to the plage across the promenade one of us rushing back to the desk every half hourbut there wasnt any phone call i had a wire from paris saying the dog would be on a plane the following week what did i wish on the pedigree in  all french poodles had to be registered under y so i wired back yerrol flynn there wasnt any call the next day either when sue suggested we try locating the film company anna said that would be the worst thing you could do seem overanxious remember they want you just wait the blonde said she would phone in a day or two but we leave saturday for paris sue said no point in playing it too cool all the better anna said for  when they do call and hear youre about to leave theyll pay more this could even prolong your trip for another few weeks we cant do that i said we have our boat reservations anna chuckled dont be simple errol flynn can always get you new reservations wednesday and thursday passed without a call friday we tried to find the movie company although all nice knew mr flynn was on the riviera no one knew exactly where early saturday we boarded the paris bus anna who was staying another month told me to be sure to look her up when she returned to new york and did i want to borrow any money i said no rather abruptly im afraid we had a sad week in paris before our boat sailed sue was a little brusque with me as i was now flat broke and had to borrow all of her gift money to eat but mostly sue raged against anna claiming she had frightened the movie woman off with her talk about big wages i often found myself agreeing with sue although in fairness to anna the blonde could have been a pure crackpot sue and i returned to the states with a lot of explaining to dofirst about why we didnt bring any souvenirs back for friends and then the questions about our nonexistent movie careers whenever a new flynn picture turned up even years later some clown would phone and ask this the one youre in i never called anna in new york and after i paid sue the money id borrowed we sort of fell apart for a time each morning when the unhousebroken pup got us upusually before dawnmy husband would shove me out of bed mumble take him out lights camera action and then turn over to sleep again but whenever i did see mr flynn on the screen in the past nine years i still liked him for he had if all unknowingly added a bit more glamour to the famed riviera for me

we went up to hell
we went up to the j trjrr £ mountain to eat we  vv £ went up to hell there c£fi were ten of us a episcopal priests we were fr john morris executive director of the episcopal society for cultural and racial unity from atlanta georgia fr robert fortna graduate student at union theological seminary new york and one of the chaplains to columbia university fr layton zimmer of pennsylvania fr malcolm boyd episcopal chaplain to wayne university detroit fr robert pierson assistant to the executive director of the american church union with offices in new york fr robert taylor prison chaplain in chicagothese priests are white and there was fr james breeden of massachusetss fr quinlan gordon of washington d c fr robert hunter of chattanooga and the writer fr robert chapman executive secretary of the new york branch of the naacpthese priests are negro at the top of the mountain stands the vaunted university of the south it encompasses  acres of beautiful campus grounds educational institutions dormitories and studentfaculty homes a magnificent chapel and a restaurant the university of the south at sewanee tennessee is owned by twentytwo southern dioceses of the episcopal church the restaurant on campus the claramount inn is owned by the university and is leased by it to one mrs clara shoemate a local mountain girl who made good mrs shoemate has never served a negro at the claramount she has denied entrance to the then only negro bishop of the episcopal church bishop harris of liberia who was a campus guest she has denied entrance to negro priests who have been summertime students at the episcopal theological seminary on campus she had denied some of us in september of last yearand it was her intention to deny us entrance on wednesday of last week we had to arrive unannounced and take her by surprise before she could lock the doors at approximately  pm that day we pulled up in two cars got out swiftly and made for the entrance fathers pierson gordon and taylor were the first to enter they were met by a waitress who greeted them and told them that they dont serve colored here while she talked i outflanked her passed behind her and made it to the main dining room followed by the others we quickly sat at three tables waiting to be served the dining room lights were immediately turned off and a rope was hung across the entrance to the room indicating that the room was not to be used for serving we sat then from  pm until  am without so much as a glass of water we were ignored except for the occasional visits from college and seminary students these young men came in for one of two reasons  to tell us that we were destroying all chances for a solution with our coercive action or  to tell us that we had no business at sewanee and ought to leave there were two other visitors around  pm bishop juhan retired bishop of florida now living at sewanee and until that night only suspected of being the segregationist power behindthethrone there came into the dining room it is a custom within the episcopal church that priests rise in respect when a bishop enters a room in which they happen to be we each stood bishop juhan began to address fr taylor who happened to be at the table nearest to where the bishop had entered he said to fr taylor my advice to youall is that you leave fr taylor asked why bishop juhans reply was so as not to increase the contention here fr taylor said thank you for your advice bish » op i was at the next table and the bishop was between taylors table and mine i said to him what did you say bishop his answer was my advice to you is that you leave i asked him why and his answer was because they wont serve you here again i asked why his response was ask the management shell be in later i pressed the point to ask well do you know why bishop the bishop did not answer i broke the silence with the question is it because of my color bishop juhan did not hesitate as he said slowly and clearly yes i believe so in my own church i asked the answer was decisive yes there was nothing further to ask i said thank you for your advice bishop with that i removed my coat from the chair and sat down at the table all of us sat once more later one of the students who came in to talk with us was refused service in the smaller dining room which was kept open to them during our sitin he came back to tell us that bishop juhan had instructed the help not to serve any students who came into the large dining room to talk with us the bishop incidentally remained on vigil in the lobby and small dining room until the hour of our departure the second most significant visitor was miss clara as she is lovingly called by all who dwell on the mountain she came in at about  pm saying she understood that someone wanted to talk to her we invited her to sit i asked her if it would not be well to have the lights turned on so that we could see each other she said no this is alrightthe darkness was very dark indeed we asked for a meal she said she has a plan for desegregation which involves feeding a negro student in june and a guest in september she said that she had to overcome resistance from many quarters and that with her plan she would be able to overcome the last obstacle the mountain people the poor white folk who dwell on the mountains side she said that she had thus far been successful in overcoming the resistance of the board of regents the faculties and the student bodies but that the mountainfolk had to be assured that this thing would happen slowly we asked her if any possible harm could come if there just happened to be food in front of us herself included at that moment and if we each just happened to be eating while we talked she said the mountainpeople would blow her place up by morning she said she would be glad however to take us to her home right then and give us the best meal we had ever had we told her we would be overjoyed to accept that invitation for breakfast if she
would serve us supper at the claramount now she refused we asked her if the mountain people would not blow her home up if she fed us there she said that they would not at this point there was a sound something like poofthe darkness was made light we looked outside the huge glass windows at the rear of the dining room and beheld a huge cross blazing on the lawn perhaps fifty feet from the room itself we asked miss clara again if we might be served this time she said that the help would refuse pointing out that thev probably needed their jobs we bid her call them into the dining room and ask them in our presence she arose and without saying another word disappeared into the kitchen by now the students were getting somewhat beeredup they would come to the rope which divided us from them and we would be greeted with remarks such as these i like niggers i think everybody ought to own one im gonna buy me one for christmas or look at the zoo or im gonna take a nigger home with me in my trunksome of these men are studying for holy orders in the episcopal church all are college or seminary students of the university of the south eleven oclock is the normal closing hour of the claramount inn soon we heard a voice from among the beeredup students in  the lobbyeight more minutes you all and theyll be coming out thentheyll be coming out in six minutes there was a crowd mostly students with some mountainpeople gathering outside in the parking lot we could see the lights from their cars and we could hear their voices they waited and so did we in a quick teteatete we decided that we were not going to leave unless miss clara informed us that she was closing and that it was time to go at  am miss clara appeared in the dining room announced that she was closing and we arose we walked swiftly to our cars hearing and not hearing the shouts and the catcalls seeing and not seeing the blackjacks and beer cans we sped down the mountainside one car pursued us followed us to chattanooga and the driver took note of the motel at which we checked in we felt compelled to return on thursday lest students faculty mountaineers and everybody else on that unholy mountain mistakenly gloat over having chased us and lest they be misguided into thinking that our real purpose had been to have our pictures taken as some of them had taunted thursday noon when we drove up the door was locked before we could get out of the cars there were some patrons in the dining room these were allowed by the management to finish eating and to leave by a side door we priests embarked on a standin at the locked entrance throughout the day tension mounted as students faculty and even a few mountainpeople approached us to tell us why we were wrong and why we should go and how much harm we were doing to the progress mrs shoemates plan which had been accomplished no more guests were served that afternoon the kitchen help was sent home earlyand we decided not to be caught there by dark that afternoon breeden pierson zimmer and taylor were obliged to return to their respective homes because of the pressure of their work we felt that if we returned to sewanee on friday it should be only to try the door and finding it locked to leave the mountain with a statement that we had come to sewanee in an attempt to awaken the moral fibre of all there to the unchristian essence of segregation on church ground that we had failed and were going home  i for one tried to get a flight out of nashville that night for we did not return to chattanooga on thursday night we went to nashville it was impossible to get a flight and it is only because the morning flight was also delayed for from six to eight hours that this frightened priest was among the number of the six frightened priests who returned to try the door on friday when we arrived at the parking lot of the claramount inn at about  pm we at once took note of several cars which bore licenses from georgia and alabama we saw one of the waitresses leap from a table and run to lock the door it was locked when we reached it we each walked up to it tried it found it locked and returned to the car father fortna and father morris had on thursday made an appointment to talk with some students of the seminary at  friday night at the campus home of one of the students for this reason we drove both cars outside of the gates to put the proper luggage in the proper cars and parted company fortna and morris were going to have lunch at the rebel inn which is a desegregated bus terminal on the mountain while there they were going to and did send our message to the wire service they would rest a bit down in chattanooga and at night would return to sewanee and their appointment with father hunter driving boyd gordon and i took off down the mountain our destination was the chattanooga airport and our respective homes the road leading down from the mountain is winding but good we took advantage of its goodness and moved off at about fifty miles per hour we had barely moved a mile the trip to chattanooga is about sixty miles when a black and red chevrolet station wagon coming from behind us shot by as though we were standing still it quickly overtook and passed the one car in front of us and disappeared around a turn just ahead when we rounded the bend we were confronted with a sight horrible beyond belief part of that station wagon was lying upside down in the middle of the road some fifty feet in front of that lay the driver half of the engine rested twenty feet up the side of the mountain on the left part of the left front fender and door were stuck in a crack made in the rock on the left which had been the point of impactthe driver had never come out of his lefthand turn on that mountain curve over to the right beyond the road and in a field lay half an axle with a twisted wheel attached metal everywhere was still steaming from the heat of the impact and the disintegration of the car our car screeched to a halt perhaps fifteen or twenty feet short of the broken distorted man on the road i covered him with my coat hunter found a pulsebeat boyd covered him with his coat it was windy so boyd knelt to hold the coats in place gordon asked the other drivers to get the police and ambulance i knelt at the victims head placed my stole about my neck opened my priests manual and began to administer last rites gordon knelt beside me while i prayed a few mountain people gathered a few students who had fol lowed us gathered i prayed for his forgiveness when the ambulance took him away we headed toward our car father hunter gave a patrolman a brief description of the victims recent recklessness he told him of our prayers two students asked me if he was dead i said no we prayed for his forgiveness and healing and if this is not gods will for his reception into heaven we drove away i think it was father boyd who gave my coat back to me saturday morning father fortna called me at my home he told me the man had died he said that a reporter had found out that the dead man was one of miss claras kitchen helpers and that miss clara was reported to have said that he was chasing us but he had passed us some of the kitchen help is reported to have said that he had a shotgun did he plan to get sufficiently down the mountain to park and blow our heads off from ambush as we reached him we probably will never know we do not know if anyone even found a shotgun we do know that he was at work when we arrived at the claramount that we had not closed his place of business that friday the thirteenth and that for some reason he was in the devils own hurry to get away from work ifand god grant that it be not sobut if he was intent upon killing one or all of us four priests god stopped him dead in his tracks sunday afternoon father fortna called me to tell me that before he left for home on saturday the mountain was bewailing not so much the fact that those unwanted priests had administered the rites but was angered over the insult that a black priest had actually laid his hands on their boys head in a final blessing their interpretationa curse we went up to the mountain to eatwe went up to hell may god draw near to that mountain may he shake it to its spiritual depths and place lord jesus in command there over his church as indeed he will some day be
capitalism s show place in africa
during ivory coast jj v president felix hou  jff phouetboignys recent official visits to  he united states and britain he was being seen as a spokesman for a particular approach in africa it is an approach which his ambassador in london referred to as a policy of realism and hard work today half way through her second year of independence the ivory coast is a showpiece for that particular approach although houphouetboignys own party the reassemblement democratique africain rda was among the most radical and outspoken of preindependence movements the country today remains the last haven of comparatively unfettered french private enterprise in africa the minister of finance is still frenchborn pioneer industry leg islation is of the most tempting and liberal the approach in terms of economic progress appears to be paying off a survey made by the industrial union of the ivory coast gives the total industrial turnover in  as m francs cfa in  as m and in  as m  the countrys capital abidjan is a showpiece of what a modern europeanstyle town can look like in africa industries of all kinds mushroom a giant bakery textile works tobacco factories coffee plants vehicle assembly plants new industries now in process of establishment include a chocolate factory four instant coffee plants two aluminum works one of which will produce some  aluminum sheets annually from laminated strip imported from the cameroons federation and an oil refinery despite the fall in the price of the materials she exports the ivory coast has managed to maintain a favourable balance of trade in both her independent years her  exports were worth m francs cfa  which is some m francs in excess of imports in that year the country which has a population of m exported  tons of coffee  tons of hardwood  tons of cocoa and  tons of bananas radical observers find it easy to criticise the regime of m houphouetboigny for its apparent lack of enthusiasm for a deep break with the economic past and they are quick to label his country a haven of economic neocolonialism others however are convinced the old man knows what he is doingthat he is merely using the foreign capitalists to build up his country for him as fast as possible and saving up the application of radicalism for a later date when he will be in a stronger economic position certainly the present policy is vigorously justified in theory asked on one occasion why the ivory coast last year a new ecothe ghanaian and nigerian marketing boards of produce the senegalese too have now introduced themm houphouetboigny replied simply we have a liberal economy we dont believe in that sort of thing however there are already signs that this economic laissez faire is coming to an endeven in the ivory coast last year a new economic and social council was appointed to supervise economic planning it is true that the chair man of this council m jean delafosse seemed when this correspondent met him determined to go slow and avoid radical change he was against increased state participation in industry because he said in my personal view an industry without a private boss tends to be inefficient but the appointment was a straw in the wind this year in his budget message president houphouetboigny outlined some changes which will bring his country more into line with the general trend he promised a bill which will acknowledge the state as the sole proprietor of all uncultivated land and henceforth it is the state that shall share out to all citizens all available land to ensure better production what this measure exactly means and how much uncultivated land exists is not clear nor is it certain that the proposal will be welcomed if government tries to implement it but if radicalism is what houphouetboignys detractors want here they have it the budget also demands sacrifices from both natives and foreigners at a time when further effort will be required from all farmers tho president said it is only fair that those of us who have been a rather privileged class in comparison with the peasantry should also make sacrifices the latter will include a national contribution or special levy of  per cent on all salaries and wages above  francs cfa a month abolition of free houses for civil servants abolition from  of most ministers and civil servants free cars and the introduction of controls on the repatriation of trading companies profits the minister of information m mathieu ekra recently announced that while there was a capital inflow of m last year m in profits was also repatriated to stop this financial hemorrhage all business will be required to pay an additional  per cent of their profits to government but these levies will be restored to the taxpayers when they show that they have reinvested twice this sum in industries approved by government this means that business houses must accept some sort of government control over investment in addition to these economies and controls however government has now reviewed its national accounting proceduresdividing the budget into current and capital accountsand from now on it is emphasised expenditure shall under no circumstances exceed the estimates as a further emphasis on the move towards planification the government is now preparing the first systematic plana tenyear plan in the meantime the budget has included a special budget for investment accounting for  m francs cfa which is quite distinct from the general and administration budgets an interim plan for  has also been approved involving m francs cfa   this apportions  per cent of total investment towards general development  towards increasing production  towards equipment for the administration research work receives  per cent cultural development  per cent and social development  per cent politically the presidents doctrine and methods appear to work well he is evidently popular in the country and the affair of the sanwi refugees who went over into ghana has been an exception his showmanship is today concentrated in abidjan with its superb new hotels its unique collection of palaces its elegant modernity and bustling prosperity photographs of all the brilliant goingson there are pinned weekly to the doors of sousprefets throughout the land two reforms since independence have had nationwide effect a major administrative reform aimed at decentralising local government divided the country into four departments and  sousprefetures this setup replaces the  subdivisions the other reform has been the introduction of national service consisting of six months military training and six months in civil works the french ambassador has handed over to the president the th naval infantry battalion which will become the first battalion of the new ivory coast army as well as the  men the ivory coast also receives the battalions armament and vehicles the army now amounts to well over  men including the  youths called up for national civilian service  in the mobile gendarmerie and  in the republican guard just after m houphouetboigny laid the foundation stone of the french embassy the ambassador handed over a patrol boat p which under the name of patience is the first vessel of the ivory coast national navy it would be wrong to dwell on the policy differences which have so far seemed to separate so spectacularly the ivory coast from such neighbours as mali and guinea these policy differences are now narrowing as are one hopes the political quarrels between the groups what really characterises the ivory coast is the beauty of its wellwooded naturally prosperous countryside the somewhat phlegmatic good nature of its peoples and obviously deeply held conviction of its government that it is set on the right path
in defense of negro intellectuals
hum an progress as generally conceived in £ america is like a horse race it always becomes most complicated and suspenseprovoking when it approaches the home stretch the challenges the confusions the need for timing the need for decision as to when to make the allout break for the tape the suspense of whether or not once the break is madethe horse has the stamina to sustain the drive to the end or the jockey has the skill and wisdom to make the right moves in the right lane all these are part of the drama of that moment of entry into the stretch  what compounds the emotion of the present american drive for human progress is the fact that everyone knows that one horse may leave the post and even enter the stretch well ahead and still wind up out of the money it is this single principle which is giving rise to so much study and scrutiny of negro peoples and negro leadership at this juncture in our nations history we find after three hundred years of being on this continent together and building this nation together that white intellectuals are seriously confessing to themselves that they havent really known the american negro and they must now painfully learn what kind of horse he is really like negroes on the other hand are impatiently concerned about their leadership and the timing of the final break for the tape of freedom and dignity this horserace symbolism will first appear to be an inept metaphor but close examination will reveal thatalthough we talk very much about equalityamerican social and economic mentality does not permit egalitarian realities to prevail very long it does not countenance dead heats so the egalitarian thinker like the horse must either gird himself for ascendancy or resign himself to decline the challenge this is the anxiety context which has provoked the increasingly vocal complaints from the white citizens councils and the conservative politicians that the naacp and  core are pushing too fast in too many directionsand causing too much confusion while on the other hand negroes are complaining that their leadership is too slow too quiet and too willing to choose the slow outside lane of judicial political and assimilation gravel both extremes expectone wishfully the other fearfullythat the race will be lost but perhaps the most penetrating form of scrutiny of the negro in contemporary america comes from serious negro scholars themselves who are examining their own leadership like  to stretch the metaphorhorses examining jockeys and jockeys examining trainers among the plethora of articles now appearing in many national magazines on the general topic of the negro in america one in particular addressed itself to the negro intellectual the significance of this article by the late professor e franklin frazier which appeared in the february  issue of negro digest is that the american negro intellectual has always conceived himself and his unique role in american culture in a mixture of practical and philosophical terms and he has made his great contribution to american culture only when this combination has been right he has constantly addressed himself and this nation to the basic meaning of the christian religion the declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights as philosophical and social  constructions transcending the vagaries and ironies of legislative law but he has always had to make his address through the machinery of law and social protest it is for this reason that his presence and his protestations have always served as a conscience to the nation and his modus operandi have sharply delineated between local law and constitutional jurisprudence this delineation has redounded to the ultimate benefit of this nation and yielded a clearer understanding of the particular meaning possible destiny and potential leadership role of this nation as the archetype of constitutional democratic government the pressing concern of professor frazier in this article which was titled the failure of the negro intellectual is that the present day intellectual unlike the historic negro intellectual who has always been the charismatic symbol for negro status and social mobility seems somehow now to be frittering away his time quoting and reciting great ideas enjoying the tinsel of middle class identification but abdicating his responsibility to produce leadership in these crucial times there is some validity to his point and indeed some cause to share and communicate his concern however to conceive the negro intellectual leadership role against the image of the traditional abstract philosopher is quite inadequate unless the analogy is highly selective and unless it alludes by comparison to men who related themselves to philosophical functions in the way of moses of socrates of jesus christ and more recently of mohandas k gandhi almost all contemporary professional philosophers generally have abdicated their responsibility to profound moral and ethical issues in their theoretical pursuit of the image of the physical sciences and the emulation of the technological model of mathematics the negro philosopher by contrast who begins as philosopher or theologian like dr martin_luther_king or rev fred shuttlesworth finds that he must release his creative genius as a socratic gadfly to pepper the conscience of the nation with practical demonstrations of how this nation must grow in the difficult learning of abstract and absolute truth but in this role he is neither conceived to be nor accorded the title philosophereven as socrates was not acclaimed philosopher by his contemporaries among academic scholars professor frazier did not intend to assert that men like dr howard thurman dr benjamin mays or dr martin_luther_king are not among the great philosophical minds of our nation he and we are disturbed by that species which comprise the large number of intellectuals for whom so many sacrifices have been made but who are so busy assimilatingnot integratingthat they spend their maximum energy trying to escape the responsibility to address themselves to their past and to their sacrificing forebears that they use the instrumentalities of education and knowledge to become jockeys and trainers in the race to produce a completely free nation and a better future for the generations which are to follow the fairer truth lies somewhere in between the scholar as a person and certain of these expectations the important philosophical contributions by negro scholars of this day are to be found in their address to the meaning of human dignity this address has none of the quality of abstractness which is generally characteristic of philosophical posture because the interpretations are bathed in practical problems and social action programs many negro scholars have awakened to the realization that mohandas k gandhi is no less a philosopher because his theory of human values was made explicit in a social action program they know that moses and jesus christ made their great spiritual gifts to the world through deeds and demonstrations from which succeeding generations inherited the great spiritual treasures of biblical literature and philosophy now unfortunately abused many college students and faculty members alike are demonstrating that relevance to life is a valid philosophical posture and a worthy objective for contemporary philosophical direction they intendin spite of the fritterersto achieve philosophical stature as doers of the word the serious negro intellectual as professor frazier was himself is a softsell moralist he is not temperamentally suited to the bombastics of hardsell moralism and righteous recrimination of the sort which does retributive violence to the offenders against dignity and decency and indeed this posture is frequently misinterpreted both by the conservative wishfulthinkers who hope that negroes will lose the race to freedom and by the anxietysyndromed liberals who want to collect quick bets so that they can luxuriate dont let either be fooled the negros apparent meekness and assimilationism is not to be confused with either weakness or abdication the negro intellectual has a program and he conceives his first responsibility to be to achieve freedom and dignity for this nation without vengeance or malice towards the present offenders against decency and underlying that surface assimilation is a hard core of pride and determination grounded in the realization that they are in the home stretch and thatafter three hundred degrading yearsthe tape of dignity and freedom is in sight 
three friends
there is a saying a v a  a friend is a person who knows all about you and still likes you three such persons have come into my life at different times and left a mark that can never be erased one saved my pride one saved my faith in human nature and the third saved my life they were all negro women i belong to the socalled white race far away and long ago in a suburb of boston i was trying my best to graduate from high school my marks in mathematics were very poor i just do not have the type of mentality that can fully grasp the science dealing with numbers one way or another i had managed to get by and graduate each year with my class but this time i knew i wouldnt graduate unless a miracle happened and the miracle happened in the person of dorothy a classmate dorothy was a whizbang when it came to numbers she could add subtract and multiply like nobodys business instead of going directly home that warm may afternoon i had gone to the basement of the school and thinking myself alone was indulging in a good cry suddenly i realized i was not alone and turning around saw dorothy a few feet away looking at me with great concern whats the matter rosie she asked and that was all i needed to make me cry louder between sobs i told her my life was ruined i wasnt going to graduate i had flunked in math i couldnt add two and two dorothy was silent for a few minutes but she seemed to have arrived at some conclusion lets walk home she said i have an idea ill tell you while were walking dorothy and i generally rode the street cars home as we lived quite a distance from the school but the threemile walk didnt seem long this time and this was dorothys plan she would tutor me every day for a couple of hours until the time came for exams that is if i didnt object   object who would object to manna from heaven for three weeks i went to her home after school and studied like mad she quickly detected my weak spots and hammered away at them when class was over her mother used to bring in a glass of milk and something to eat generally homemade cakes or cookies when the time came for exams dorothy sat two rows away i could just see the top of her head when i couldnt get the answer right away i would look across to her and as silly as it sounds id get the answer by just concentrating on her big blue hair ribbon i passed of course and my mother went with me to dorothys home while i thanked her and gave  her a small gift of gratitude dorothys mother served milk all around and the cakes were extra special with brightly colored frosting time passed as time will do and it was thanksgiving in boston just after the world war ii my husband had died overseas my parents had also died as had a daughter and a sister i had a good job in a large hospital but the thought of being thankful about anything never occurred to me i despised the human race then along came betty    betty was a nurses aide in the hospital where i worked she was the only fellow employe whom i bothered to speak to unless forced to do so in the line of duty betty and i went to lunch at the same time but not always together sometimes she would get to the dining room ahead of me and would turn up a chair next to her so that we could sit together i would do the same if i arrived first the day before thanksgiving she saw i was down in the dumps and did her best to cheer me up would i cheer not on your life i sulked all the more and finally told her in words of one syllable what i thought of thanksgiving it was for the birds she made no reply but walked away and left me that night the telephone rang as i sat alone in my little apartment on the ninth floor of a hotel overlooking the charles river it was betty my husband and i would like you to come to dinner tomorrow she said i hesitated perhaps too long for she was back on the line saying of course if you dont want to its perfectly all right   if i dont want to  if i dont want to i repeated why betty id love to and its wonderful of you to invite me that thanksgiving dinner and that thanksgiving day is one i will always remember i have never known such love from anyone as betty and her family showed me that day besides her husband there was a teenage son bettys mother bettys widowed sister and her two small children and a boston policeman a friend of the husband the policeman had recently lost his wife and they thought he would be lonesome eating alone when the time came to leave i kissed betty and her mother and her sister and they kissed me that little moment of love and understanding will last through eternity and then there was that horrible year of  a believer in astrology would say the stars were against me well something was i was jobless in ill health and scared to death my home if it could be called that was on the third floor back of a thirdrate hotel in a thirdrate western city the only bright spot in my life was vannie the elevator operator who was always good for a laugh no matter how depressing the circumstances she would say something to make her passengers laugh and how we needed that laugh i remember one night when it was raining hard and the wind was shrieking as if to say all hope was lost forever i rang for the elevator and vannie responded smiling as usual well she said as she opened the door to let me on this is a fine night to go up on a mountain and howl i who hadnt laughed for days broke out laughing and a sad face man who was already a passenger when i entered took off his hat in respect for something i hope it was vannies gallantry of soul but the time came when even vannie couldnt make me smile i was behind in the rent and was told to pay up by  pm the next day or else i started for the telegraph office to send a collect wire to a friend for helpa friend whom i felt sure could not respondwhen i suddenly burst out crying no bells were ringing for the car so vannie took it to the top floor stopped it then turned to me as dorothy long ago had asked me what was the matter so did vannie i told her i was going to be evicted and why aint you got no one you can go to for help she wanted to know the question and its obvious answer brought with it a decision on my part i knew then what i was going to do the cowards way out was it only a coward would continue to live under such circumstances take me down i said abruptly and when the car leveled off at my floor i left without saying good night i would say good morning in another world once in my room i sat down at the shabby inkstained cigaretteburned desk and started writing a letter to a loved one i wanted them to understand that what i was about to do wasnt because i was a coward no it was because    there was a knock on the door and right away i knew it was the manager he was going to put me out then he wasnt going to wait until morning i looked towards the window through which i had planned to jump and froze in my seat    then the knock came again and i heard vannies voice let us in mis kelly she said in her thick southern voice weall want to talk to you oh well what did it matter i got up and opened the door there was vannie and the housekeeper a redfaced irishwoman generally known as maime who sized me up at a glance and smiled encouragingly vannie here tells me youre kinda broke she said like we all are at times i can remember when i didnt have a nickel for a cuppa coffee but what i was going to say is i need a maid on the third floor doris the one i had quit yesterday said her boy friend doesnt want her working no more what i mean is if youd like the job i know the manager will let you stay until you get square he aint a bad sort he aint ill have a word with him whatdoyuh say i worked there six weeks when a job in my own line came along and i left for the far west maime and vannie walked to the bus terminal with me helping me with my baggage  as the hound pulled out for l a they waved frantically from the loading platform dorothy betty vannie and dear old maime how i would like to see them all again i thank the good lord i was worthy of their friendship

corinna
£ back door slid open j np £ slowly cautiously  jl £ quietly the little face kcscf p eered round wide eyed there was no one in the dirty littered kitchen that meant that mama and the man were still asleep the little girl eased into the kitchen pushing the door shut with both hands clasped tightly about the knob the child was dressed in a ragged uneven faded gingham skirt and a soiled blue sweater her pigtailed kinky hair was a ratsnest from her nights sleep and she wore runover oxfords on her skinny feet she wore also like a protective capelet a shrinking conciliatory man ner that people found quite irritating because it made them feel so guilty for she made them remember the many crimes they had committed against love harassed mothers seeing her idling timidly among their children would call her to them and comb her hair and give her slices of bread and peanutbutter then the little girl corinna her name was became whiny and clinging and the mothers would brusquely reject her for while it was a shame she wasnt really their problem and she did have a mother such as she was and they hardly had enough time for their own kids what with washing and cooking and ironing and gossiping it was a roundrobin kind of thing on this saturday morning mrs della somers a rather new neighbor had kindly told corinna to go along home and get herself cleaned up and if it was all right with corinnas mommy they could walk up to town together mrs della somers had only lived in the rancid neighborhood for a few weeks and she had taken a fancy to corinna being a childless elderly widow and the pattern was emerging once more but mrs della somers was not yet tired of corinnas perpetual hanging about with her big eyes beseeching with her incessant demands to go to the store for you or get you a glass of water sweep your floor help you wash mrs somers did what she could for the little girl mrs della somers was a thwarted  romantic not a realist poverty had not ever made her cynical and rendered her judgment harsh so corinna slid into the cold empty dirty kitchen and hesitantly crossed to her mothers closed bedroom door she knocked silence she knocked silence she knocked and said mamma timidly and gaining courage mamma she knocked her little knuckles making a little noise mamma faint stirrings and the rumble of a male voice corinna heartened called mamma what

removed her skirt and sweater and stepped out of her shoes her mother went to the tall old wardrobe that stood in one kitchen comer and opened the doors and peered inside she pulled out a plaid cotton

as her hands transformed corinnas hair into beautiful shining plaits there she said go warsh your face and put lotion on your laigs corinna went timidly into her mothers bedroom she passed the big rumpled bed with averted eyes but the man hailed her hello there sweetcakes goin byby hereheres a dime get you somethin to drink on me gettin to be a big ol gal aint you how old are you now corinnas reply was inaudible but the man laughed meaninglessly and leaning in the bed on one elbow he held out to corinna a shining silver coin she took it not looking at him and said thank you with a nod of her head and she fled from his mockery corinnas mother laid her daughters coat across a kitchen chair cmonthat lady aint gonna wait all day there was a gentle knock upon the back door corinnas mother ran the comb through her own hair pulled the bedroom door shut and cinched her bathrobe all in one fluid movement she flung a libelous look around the kitchen and opened the door mrs della somers

into her plump body holding the gentle woman tightly tightly in a grip of love and longing and fear holding the clean smell and the warmth within her skinny arms and she was quiet now silent and terrified of she knew not what only wishing to cling to this steady rock her childish reason overwhelmed mrs della somers horribly embarrassed by the show of naked emotion attempted to break the

toward the bedroom without answering the man and the door was shut behind her the little girl was left standing in the middle of the room she stood there shadowy wispy quiet her hands clasped together upon her flat breast she opened her hands a little and the dime fell to the floor and rolled about until it came to rest under the black oldfashioned stove corinnas mother found it there that afternoon when she swept the kitchen and she held it in her hand looking at it and suddenly she began to weep
chitterlings for breakfast
marge wheeled her shopping cart slowly along the aisles of the eknunuka air base commissary it was her first time there and she had no idea where to find the items she wanted but having to move slowly and look carefully worked no hardship on marge she rather enjoyed it because it gave her a sense of adventure not knowing exactly what she would see next she loved the excitement of discovering something new whether it was just groceries in an unfamiliar store or new people or even new places however this yen for excitement and surprises did not show on marges face she was a rather tall slender reservedlooking brown skinned woman who looked her age which was  she wasnt pretty by a long shot but neither was she unpleasant to look at marge was just average and knew it and never let it bother her she had been in alaska for only about two months having gone there with her soldier husband and their  year old twin boys actually her husband was in the army and they usually shopped at the army commissary but the apartment they rented was much closer to eknunuka air base and they had decided to try the air base commissary for a change frankie her husband a tall dark excitinglooking gi was busy talking to an airman he knew and marge hoped that they would talk for a long time so she could shop in peace when frankie went shopping with her he was always throwing things into the shopping cart that wrecked her food budget he believed in the large economy size he bought things like kingsize boxes of frozen crabs gallon cans of concentrated grape juice and  pound turkeys last week they had consumed so much grape juice until it seemed it was running out of their ears she shopped leisurely but finally she had everything she needed except meat this she always shopped for last no special reason it was just a habit she went to the meat section and picked up a five pound roast and put it in her cart it was pretty reasonable only  cents a pound as her eyes roved further over the meat counter she suddenly stiffened and ex claimed under her breath well ill be darned for there in front of her in the frozen meat section was a container that plainly said chitterlings she was completely flabbergasted for a moment because chitterlings was the last thing she had expected to see in alaska they seemed like such a backhome type of food seeing the container brought to her a rush of pleasant and unpleasant memories she thought first of her maternal grandmother one summer when marge was  years old her mother and father who lived in racine wisconsin but originally came from birmingham alabama had decided to send her there to visit her grandmother for two weeks marge had fallen in love with the gentle softspoken old lady at first sight grandma lewis as she was called lived in a beautiful but weatherbeaten old twostory frame house in the best colored section of town her own mother had migrated from a plantation in camp hill alabama when the slaves were freed during the civil war grandma lewis had been born in birmingham reared there married and had children there all of whom had migrated up north she kept marge fascinated by the hour telling her stories out of her own past and tales her mother had passed down to her of happenings during slavery times but best of all she was a superb cook and marge gained  pounds in the two weeks she was there grandma lewis filled her up on corn bread collard greens blackeyed peas and blackberry cobbler grandma lewis also introduced marge to chitterlings one day marge had gone to visit a girl she had met there and when she returned to her grandmothers house a highly obnoxious odor met her at the door it was chitterlings cooking but after they were done marge tasted them to please her grandmother and to her surprise found that like limburger cheese they tasted a whole lot better than they smelled as a matter of fact she liked them so well that her grandmother had to fix them for her three times before she left when marge returned to wisconsin she told her mother about the wonderful southern dishes she had tasted and especially about the chitterlings she asked her mother why didnt they ever have chitterlings sometimes her mother smiled grimly and said listen sweetie eating chitterlings is just as bad as if i were to sit out on our front porch with a big slice of bright red watermelon and eat it all the white folks passing by would see me and snicker about it they all think we cant afford to eat anything else but chitterlings collard greens and watermelons ill have to admit they taste pretty good but your father and i have been trying to get away from being stereotyped ever since we left alabama were determined to live dress and eat exactly like everyone else by everyone else you mean white folks dont you mother said marge dont be difficult marge said her mother testily after that marge didnt mention chitterlings again but when she went away to camp winnepeg the next summer and they served watermelon she found herself taking furtive glances at the white girls to see if they might be watching her in any peculiar way and the second time it was served she refused her portion saying she didnt care for it since that time in the circles in which she moved and the places her husband was stationed chitterlings were seldom seen or mentioned although they had bought watermelon several times but now seeing them sitting there in of all places alaska she smiled to herself and on the spur of the moment picked up a twopound container and thrust it into her shopping cart after all it was only  cents when she and frankie returned to the apartment and were unpacking the groceries he saw the container of chitterlings he stared at it with his mouth hanging open and finally said well where on earth did you pick that up us members sure will find our own wont we marge laughed and explained that she was surprised to see them herself then frankie looked at her and a little frown appeared on his forehead and marge knew right away that he wasnt amused he said now listen marge personally i like chitterlings although i havent eaten any since i was a little boy but dont you think theres a time and place to eat and cook them after all were the only colored family living in this apartment building right now and we have to sorta set the right example uh we dont want to give these people anything to criticize us about they already think that all we colored folks eat is chitterlingstype food and you must know that chitterlings smell like hell cookin we want them to smell the aroma of roast beef ham and roast pork and so forth cornin from this apartment not this mess marge felt guilty right away because she didnt know why she had bought the chitterlingsshe never had beforedidnt actually know how to cook themand it was true that she and frankie had to be on their best behavior especially since they were the only colored in the buildingbut gosh it was downright stupid to stop eating something just because somebody else looked down on it she asked frankie well what about the italians and their garlicky spaghetti and meat balls are they ashamed huh i dont see why we cant eat roast beef ham and chitterlings too there is no reason frankie exploded except its better to eat chitterlings in a chitterlings neighborhood furthermore i dont even want to smell them cooking  myself so youd better find some way of cooking them when im not here or else throw them to hell out then he stalked out of the door marge stuck the chitterlings in the refrigerator and put the other groceries away and sat down and wondered just how shed gotten involved in that silly hassle over chitterlings besides the other tenants in the building werent very friendly anywaythey probably didnt care whether she had chitterlings or didnt have chitterlings she had met most of the women downstairs in the washroom at one time or another when she went down to use the machines but aside from saying hello and asking her in an offhand way how she liked alaska and was she army or air force all of them were rather standoffish the woman across the hall who was obviously a real southerner judging from her accent spoke to her whenever they passed in the hall but she hadnt come over to welcome marge into the building she probably couldnt stand colored people anyway truthfully marge was so lonely sometimes until she could just bawl her loneliest moments were just after the twins left for school then the apartment seemed deadly quiet she muttered to herself now what am i going to do with those darn chitterlings gosh now that ive paid for them id hate like the dickens to throw them away then suddenly she had a bright idea i know what ill do thought marge ill wait until thursday night when frankie goes out to play poker with his friends and late when everybody is either asleep or out ill cook the chitterlings that way the smell wont interfere with anyone now if i remember right i think grandma just boiled them but come to think of it hers werent frozen maybe id better look in my cookbook and see if i can find anything about them marge got her cookbook and rapidly turned to the section on meat but couldnt find a thing on the preparation of chitterlings but she decided that boiling was the only way and thats exactly how she would fix them frankie said nothing more to her about the chitterlings and thursday night he went happily off to his poker game probably wondering why she didnt blow a fuse as usual the twins kept up a constant yakityyak until  when marge shooed them off to bed around  she looked in the hallcloset and took out the can of chlorophyll room deodorant and then cursed because it was empty she had forgotten that the twins were using it the other day when she went out of course the little monsters had used up the entire container well no matter she was going to use the fan in the kitchen anyway maybe it would suffice m at  she began her selfappointed task and when she finally had the chitterlings boiling on the stove she was ready to admit that they were highly perfumed to say the least after sticking a fork in them for the umpteenth time she was finally satisfied that they were cooked but for some reason she didnt have any desire to eat them she turned off the fire and pushed them to the back of the stove and went to bed but not before opening all the windows in the kitchen and living room to make sure the smell would all go out although with the fan going it wasnt as bad as she had expected when frankie finally arrived home and found all the windows open in the middle of december in alaska he thought marge had finally flipped her wig until he found out the purpose of it all at first he was pretty angry but then he finally saw the light or so he said to marge he told her honey i guess we can eat roast beef ham and chitterlings too but for gods sake make sure you have plenty of room deodorant next time marge knew that he probably said that only because he had arrived home so late and was fending off any kind of argument but when he left for work the next morning the chitterlings were still sitting on the back of the stove untouched marge gave the twins their breakfast and they went off to school after the twins left marge decided she would just have toast and jam for her own breakfast and was just clearing away the soiled dishes of the twins when the doorbell rang oh cripes said marge i wonder who that isand me in my housecoat who is it she said its lola the girl across the hall said a voice in a slow drawl oh god marge thought ill bet she was up late last night and smelled those chitterlings cooking and has come to complain she opened the door and there stood lola in her hat and coata tall slender pretty girl with a round face sparkling eyes and an unmistakable southern accent she looked to be about not far from marges own age may ah come in foah a minute ah jus drove mah younguns to school and befoah ah starts in to cleanin mah apartment ah thought ahd jus come ovah foah a second she said by all means do come in said marge and have a seat can i take your coat and hat

where is the church goin
on the sunday follow £ ing the brutal mob ac tions at the bus depots in anniston and birmingham alabama a dispirited episcopal communicant of the latter city wrote there is no condemnation of the riots from our pulpit today there was no moral guidance in a time when the eyes of the world were focused on our state and nation our churches really have become gymnasiums where we exercise with the reading of the book of common prayer neither sweating nor breathing hard in the stuffy air of sanctity in an eastern city last summer i had a pleasant visit with an able young newspaperman a negro and an episcopal communicant it developed that later in the afternoon he was meeting his son who was coming home from camp via bus you might be interested to know i said that the diocese of atlanta has just had its first integrated camp one negro boy aged  applied and promptly was accepted he proved to be a popular camper and had no difficulty at all his personality was such that he did not feel alone or an outsider and of course this personality was precisely why the other boys did not think of him in such terms the young newspapermans eyes widened you did that in georgia i nodded affirmatively we couldnt do that here he said i am grieved to say that here we do not have a very happy relationship between the white and negro episcopal churches there is little communication between us some feel there is a drawing apart there is a need for some positive action how did the atlanta diocese manage the camp it was explained that when the youngster applied for camp and was accepted the clergy and laymen on the camp committee informed by letter all parents of other boys who had been accepted they were told they could withdraw their son or sons if they wished but earnest hope was expressed they would not none did officials in the small city near the camp mikel quietly were informed the teenage counselors were briefed on their practical and christian duties all went well it was a happy rewarding experience each of us recognized the jarring contradictions in the drama of race in alabama brutal mobs were for some time unchecked by police in that time there were inflicted severe injuries to many for the crime of having ridden on a bus to which they had been sold a ticket in mississippi the jails were being filled with white and colored travelers young and middleaged who were testing what is an incredible denial in this last half of the twentieth centurythe right of a citizen of the united states freely to travel on common carriers and to use the public services in the depots it is a sad commentary that the episcopal churches in these states were largely sunday gymnasiums insofar as any leadership in the tremendous moral problem of our time was concerned nor were they alone the silence of all the churches was inescapable later there was a mild protest by some ministers against the inactivity of police but still there is no action only silence in georgia one small boy makes episcopal camping history by being accepted at the camp maintained by the diocese for the summer recreation and instruction of its young people in an eastern state a young negro doubted this could have been done in his diocese there is a third illustrationand a more damning one there came to atlanta university two brilliant young negro students graduates of mission schools in their native country maintained by one of the larger protestant southern denominations neither was ever called upon by members or officers of that denomination a distinguished member of nigerias high court who had been educated in elementary and secondary schools and colleges all maintained by one of the largest of us denominations visited four southern cities and four in the north and was never approached by any representative of the church which had given him all but his graduate education still another african visitor whose youth had been spent in schools supported by american missions had a similar experience i am glad i was ignored he said i have heard your joke about the african visitor who was finally admitted to a restaurant with the apology of the manageryou see i thought you were one of these american negroes i am afraid i would not have been happy talking with a pastor who would not admit american negroes to worship in his churcheven though the same church educated me there is more than one reason why christianity is not more of a force in the newly emergedand emergingcountries of africa but one of them is this inescapable gulf which the african intellectual quickly sees even though he has never been out of africa a visitor here of course experiences the harsh irony of it the episcopal church in america suffers equally with the others all are afflicted by those callous persons of christian affiliation who insist that the negro is an inferior person and that segregation is decreed by god nor may we episcopalians play the pharisee and pass on the other side from these the  ugly distorted even vicious publications of the more fanatic white citizens councils and the hateorganization pamphlets delight in printing sermons and statements from the three or four episcopal rectors in the southern states who lend their names and positions to the prejudices and passions of the extremists certain questions are posed is there any thoughtful person who does not understand why communism which also claims it can redeem and change the world is able to attract so much dedicated service especially though not exclusively in so many depressed areas of the world one must ask what sort of examples or alternatives are offered them missionaries all over the world have sent urgent pleas to their churches in america to put christianity to work in americas problem of race some churches clergymen and laymen have acted with vigor and courage but it still is true that  am on sunday is the most segregated hour of all the week that christianity in america cannot go on with this without disastrous results must be plain to all save the most stubbornly obtuse it is not easyand yet in fact it is if there is a will to act that we think in terms of images has become almost a trite truth but truth it is when confronted with something which radically alters the status quo we invent mental images to help us rationalize resistance to change in southern school cases the extremiststoo often assisted by the daily press members of the clergy the bar and the politiciansinvariably conjured up two false ones they first rubberstamped every negro as dirty illiterate criminal or dishonest that this reflected one of the worst evils of segregationa separation from truth and fact and acquaintance with the great body of educated cultured negroesnever occurred to these makers of false images they then pictured the children of such persons as overrunning the schools and then paradoxically they expressed unreasoned fear about intermarriage and the loss of racial purity that the us supreme court decisions plainly had said this overrunning was not the intent of the rulings and had declared placement laws to be constitutional when not used to discriminate was blithely ignored in a campaign to deceive people and create resistance defiance and mobs that most of the nations population had for a long time been operating without laws requiring segregation and without signs of the much feared raceruin also was bypassed the extremists were in fact insulting their own people by implying that only they of all americans were in need of such laws this obsession with false images can be as harmful to christianity as false gods common sense somehow becomes paralyzed it is utterly preposterous that in this period of history millions of americans should be most concerned with where a colored child shall sit in school and whether colored persons shall be welcomed to worship christianity cannot afford to be made to appear ridiculousand yet it is even christians must agree that the long history of foreign missions and the opposition of christians to acceptance of colored persons in their churches would be the subject of loud coarse laughter were it not for the byproduct of it a number of christian and judaic leaders in individual sermons in the past several months seriously have suggested that fewer and fewer persons are using religion as a yardstick for determining values all the evidence tends to sustain them the episcopal church which sensibly avoided any rupture at the time of the american civil war should be better able to act with common sense and christian conviction than those denominations which divided in acrimony and prejudice a decision to accept negro worshipers which results in years of budgets being unmet and building programs bankrupted is perhaps valid in a temporary and superficial manner it is unlikely that any diocese which planned prayed and educated its communicants would suffer any real losses but it may be that the christian churchnot merely the episcopalis at the point where it must face up to losing those persons who cannot entertain the idea of being in the same sanctuary or at the same communion rail with a colored person to compromise almost surely means a slow death as communicants with a prodding sense of conscience and morality drop out this would certainly be true of the young communicants the problem of race is not of course the only one facing christianity today there is the complex problem of growing urban populations the shifts to suburbs the abandonment of many city churches and the urgent need for christian leadership in the socalled asphalt jungles of the large cities but that of race is the most pressing of all many voices ask where is the church going only the church can answer
how to tell your child about
hildren observe many things for themselves they hear talk among other children and are aware of much more than we realize the parent with the attitude what my child doesnt know wont hurt him is burying her head in the sand children are naturally curious about sex matters and if they cant get the answers at home they get them elsewhere resulting in a welter of guiltladen fact and fallacy how do you handle your childs interest in sex matters here are some of the questions parents ask about the subject and some sugges tions for guidance remember its not merely the words you use in explaining sex to your child that matter but how you say them your expression and gestures your attitude toward sex in general the mother who snatches a childs hand away when he touches his genitals who acts disgusted when he displays interest in his bowel movements who is horrified when he shows curiosity concerning his body is teaching him that the body is dirty and that everything about it including sex is bad many children taught to feel this way grow up abnormal sexually or else they are unable to enjoy sex relations at what age should a child he told there is no right age questions should be answered when asked the younger the children the more wholesome and unashamed is their interest in sex some children begin asking at the age of three or four some at six or seven perhaps at the tender age of two a little girl may point to the genitals of a baby brother and ask whats that she should not be made ashamed of having asked an honest question and should receive an honest answer little boys and men all have that you might say its called a penis thats how they do weewee girls and women have a little opening for weewee its called a vagina you never know when a child will pop a question about sex at you and so you have to be prepared dont put your children off with ill tell you when youre older or you shouldnt bother about such things theyll get the feeling that their questions are bad they wont stop wondering but they may stop asking their parents and go underground for their answers some of which will be unwholesome some parents have the idea that the sex training of the child need not begin until adolescence but by that time his behavior patterns sexual and otherwise will be pretty much fixed for life at this point all you can do is try to correct faulty ideas acquired in childhood  and relieve anxieties arising from sexual maturation correcting faulty ideas isnt easy the sex superstitions picked up from other children and carried over into adulthood are difficult to eradicate that is why it is important to give your child the fundamentals early wont knowing the details make children over conscious of sex regardless sexual interests are bound to come to children anyway secrecy rather than honesty is likely to make them over sexconscious the more you surround the subject of sex with mystery and secrecy the more concerned children become with finding out what the secret is your child will discover the facts of life eventually what parents do when they talk to their children is to help them understand students of child development find that if children learn about sex simply and naturally and can ask questions freely they are less likely to go in for sex practices than children who have been made to feel that it is wrong to even think of such matters unsatisfied curiosity coupled with feelings of guilt and rejection account for most of the objectionable sex behavior in children of any age isnt it possible to tell children too much about sex yes when your child asks a specific question answer simply and briefly and then stop dont go into elaborate details when a child first asks where babies come from the simplest answers will satisfy himan elaborate explanation will only serve to confuse him mommie where did i come from in a special place inside mommy right here see at first you were just a tiny seed and then you grew into a beautiful baby was i happy to have you for my own where does the baby come out through the opening in the mothers body called the vagina it is between her thighs does it hurt to have a baby yes but the doctor knows how to make it easier for the mother and once she has her baby she is so happy she forgets all about the pain what about children who never ask questions should they be told anyway children are always curious about the body even if they dont appear to be perhaps theyre afraid to ask questions of their parents because they sense an embarrassment or perhaps they have the idea these things are bad or it may be theyve been told to wait till theyre older such children may have secret sex worries that could cause fear and nervousness its better to get them out in the open so for the child who never comments or asks questions a mother may divulge information in a casual way during toileting for example she may say you know boys and girls urinate differently the boy has a penis so he stands up for a girl because her body is different its easier to sit down or isnt it nice aunt loretta is going to have a baby its growing inside her right now thats why shes fatter than she used to be it is better for healthy sex development and adjustment if children feel free to wonder and ask questions what to do when a child shares the sex information youve given him with the neighborhood you might tell him these matters are a private family affair and its a matter of custom not to discuss them outside the home if your child expresses the urge to tell his friend jimmy how babies get born explain that its better for jimmys mother to tell him since she may want to explain it in her own way or may not want to tell him at all until hes old enough to understand this will give your child the good feeling of being pretty grownup for his age make all this a suggestion not a command since forbidden topics are always intriguing should we teach our children the correct names of the parts of the body and bodily functons even while theyre still young it is well for children to know that there are correct words for the parts of the body and its functions and that these words are not silly or dirty it makes it easier to answer their sex questions over a long period of time if you dont have to use baby substitute words by becoming accustomed to the correct words children take them so for granted that they never seem funny or personal but rather just plain natural another thing if your child knows the correct scientific terms for the anatomy hell be less likely to pick up the inevitable vocabulary of the streets should we allow our children to see us nude or let them undress in front of each other if very small children are allowed to wander naturally in and out of the bathroom when either parent is bathing or dressing bodily differences are noted gradually and accepted matteroffactly questions can be answered casually and information acquired so gradually that a child is hardly aware of having been told anything children need to know that there is a difference in sexes let two three and fouryearolds bathe and shower together without selfconsciousness and they will know and accept sex differences the youngster who has never seen a child of the opposite sex undressed is the one who will be most curious about the matter you might think that such early freedom will persist into the school years it doesnt gradually the child himself desires some privacy and acquires reserve is it a good idea to let a child watch his dog or cat give birth if it happens when the child is present it will be a natural lesson on birth for him from then on hell know how babies are bom he wont have to wonder  should we punish our children for using bad language dont act shocked or horrified let your child know youre familiar with the words and their meanings then explain that it is bad manners to use them like nosepicking in public and therefore offensive make it clear there are certain standards of politeness and decency which everyone should respect shouldnt a child be stopped from handling his genitals this is a normal thing for youngsters to do all babies explore their bodies and so discover the sensitivity of the genital organs dont punish the child or tell him hes bad or that it will make him sick especially dont tell him he will lose his penis or that someone will cut it off this results in fear and worry that could be injurious draw his attention away from his genitals by putting a toy or game into his hands by playing with him by giving him something to do most children outgrow such handling if it persists it may be that your child is seeking satisfactions that normally would result from warm human relationships with you or other children be more affectionate with him read to him spend time with him if the problem still persists consult your family doctor shouldnt sex play among children be stopped this is a more common occurrence than most people think youngsters will go with each other into the bathroom and discuss naughty words or giggle about toilet functions they ask to see each others genitals even touch and stimulate each other or they may play veiled sex games such as doctor or mother and father parents should see that children dont have too much opportunity for sex play it isnt wise to let children share a bed constantly or for brothers and sisters to share a room to prevent sex play tell your child that playing sexually is not a good thing to do answer any questions he may ask see that he has interesting work and play to keep him busy dont shame threaten or punish him keep your attitude friendly stress social custom rather than sin the following books are recommended a baby is born the story of how life begins by milton i levine and jean h seligmann simon and schuster for children seven to ten the wonder of life by same authors and publisher as

the girl on the bed j    £ writhed suddenly and  ii ii sweat gleamed in her contorted face in the guttering light from the coal oil lamp pinkpalmed hands clawed at her distended abdomen and she screamed shrilly the grayhaired negro woman rose from her splitcane chair beside the bed and shuffled hurriedly into the shadows of the kitchen leanto a butcher knife was in her knotted hand when she reappeared the blade was long thin from much sharpening and it gleamed evilly in the yellow glow from the lamp the girl on the bed looked at the knife and the grim face of her mother terror drove the pain from her eyes she struggled to sit up what you go do with that knife she whimpered you fixin to cut me the baby gonna come all right aint no need for no cuttin mamma nobody gonna cut you the old woman soothed she bent and slid the knife under the bed knife cuts the pain you is havin honey just like it done when you grandma hepped me have you such scenes are a thing of the past now on beaufort countys sea islands but  years ago they were common enough in the little whitewashed homes of the gullah negroes when the slave ships brought them here to work the indigo and cotton the wretched men and women who debarked had few if any of their personal possessions but they did bring their tribal superstitions and the medical lore of their native africa handing them down by wordofmouth to the generations that have tilled these fertile islands the old timers remember those remedies today although they go now to their family physician or to the county health dept on beauforts boundary street when sickness strikes the simple folk remedies are no longer needed now that bridges and modem roads link the sea islands and a car stands beside almost every gullah home it was a different story when the only way to get from island to island was by boat doctors were few here then and hospitals nonexistent in those days the old mother mightand probably didresort to several home remedies to ease her daughters childbirth pains she might have had the girl blow into a bottle and she probably rubbed her well with a mixture of sulphur and lard possibly she forced her to drink a tea made by boiling a dirtdaubers nest in water if the labor pains were slow in  starting the dirtdaubers tea might have been made with tanay to speed things up once the baby arrived the old woman probably slipped a thimbleful of salt under the mattress to relieve the pains of afterbirth those were timetested measures known to every gullah mother in the days when she was not only the housewife but the family doctor too with the child safely born there were other things that could be done for it and for the new mother to make teething easier a black beetle was sewn into a bag and hung around the infants neck if the child became feverish a large green leaf was placed on his head when the young mother returned to her work in the fields she tied a string around her babys wrist so she would know if he cried while she was away if the infant died everyone knew that needles threaded on a string and worn around the mothers neck would dry up her milk by no means all of the gullah remedies were intended for babies and their mothers people who make their living with hoe and ax sometimes get cut and there were special measures for such wounds cobwebs were spread on a cut to stop bleeding and it was common knowledge that soot was good for cuts ashes and salt rubbed in well were a fine healing mixture if those measures failed and the wound became infected they cut open a fowl or an animal took out the heart and pressed it to the wound when the heart turned green they knew it had drawn out the poison fever was a dread scourge of the sea islands but the gullahs were ready when it came they drank a tea brewed from horehound and water or from the long silver wisps of a plant known as life everlasting or rabbit tobacco this latter was good not only for fever but for many other diseases old people then as now had aches and pains for rheumatism and arthritis they drilled a hole in a copper penny and tied it to an ankle with a bit of string salt and sweat caused some of the copper to be absorbed by electrolysis and gave them some relief a salve of axle grease was another favorite remedy and the more desperate sufferers from rheumatism allowed a bee to sting them if all else failed they got a live bullfrog cooked it in boiling lard and rubbed the painful joints with the resulting mixture with no dentists handy they took a drop of lye and placed it in the cavity when a hollow tooth began to ache if a horse or mule had lampas the thing to do was slit the gums and rub salt into the cuts headaches must have been as common then as now for the gullahs had a long list of remedies that antedated the aspirin tablet one cure was to tie a string around the head others soaked a piece of brown paper in vinegar and salt and placed it on the sufferers forehead or they made a poultice of vinegar salt and pounded garlic and spread it on the back of the neck  for a real kingsize skull buster the remedy was to bathe the entire head in a tea brewed from mullen and of course everyone knew that a red flannel strap worn around the wrist would stop almost any type of pain for the sick the best painkiller was a smoothing iron slipped under the bed without the patient seeing it boils were a common affliction one heroic cure was a salve made from cow dung and vinegar heated together a poultice made from cactus roots was just the ticket to drain an abscess mumps would leave no serious after effects if the neck had been rubbed with sardine grease and smallpox was much less painful if one drank brown pea liquor or a mixture of lard and cassena a tallow plaster on the chest warded off pneumonia and garlic in whisky prevented influenza if you caught a cold a mixture of ashes and lemon juice would put you right as rain in no time dont think the old hands neglected other phases of preventive medicine to ward off disease in general they wore a bag of asafetida around the neck this might also ward off a few friends but good health was cheap at half the price there was also a way to stop bedwetting although how many were brave enough to try it history says not the bedwetter had to drink a tea made by brewing a rat in water some ills came from the spirit not the flesh therefore when the root doctor had conjured you about the only thing you could do to nullify the voodoo spell was to sip a tea of ground garlic and vinegar every morning when you arose how effective were these folk remedies not very probably although you have to concede that these and similar cures were the genesis of modem medicine with all its gadgets and wonder drugs possibly the sheer faith people had in the old remedies hastened many a cure scientists are still trying to determine the extent to which the mind rules the body the chances are that there was more than one hard kernel of scientific truth tucked away in the old african tribal lore one man who suspects this is somers pringle administrator of the beaufort county health dept he remembers a trip to isolated coosaw island years ago to see how many of the natives were suffering from fever about three out of four admitted recent chills aches and high temperatures but not one of them was in need of treatment that day they had made tea from tabbit tobacco and a few of them had gone by bateau to a store and brought back a bottle or two of  tonic mr pringle recalls something worked we couldnt find a single active case of fever at least one timehonored folk remedy works mr pringle insists although possibly not the way the oldsters thought its the old practices of dosing children each spring with sulphur and molasses mosquitoes will not bite a person who has sulphur in his blood the health official said whether they knew it or not mothers who gave their children that mixture were making them immune to feverbearing mosquitoes in the summer months but the old remedies are being discarded and forgotten the gullahs have shifted their allegiance to the pill and the needle you goes to the doctor and he stick you one time with that needle an island housewife said the next day you just as good as you ever was modern medicine has won its battle in the sea islands
maybe ill pitch forever
the rest of that winter they filled up those sports pages all over the country with stories about how i was still good enough to be in the majors but nothing happened when it didnt i went back to the kansas city monarchs only just mr baird was my boss there now mr wilkinsond decided to kind of retire but mr wilkinson being gone wasnt the biggest thing that was different that season what was different was that i was making a lot less money after jackie robinsond gotten into the major leagues folksd started forgetting all about negro baseball all those old fans were only watching the major league teams and jackie it kept getting worse every time the major league teams signed up another colored boy the worse it got the less i got since i usually was paid a percentage of the gate on top of my regular salary even with me going on fortytwo the way i was throwing i still felt i was too young to take any cut in pay you dont want to settle for less until you know for sure you just cant get that big money anymore and it began to look like the only way i could stay in that big money was to get in the majors i looked and looked but i couldnt see any doors open for me  the longer that old door stayed shut the more worried i got then it happened when the biggest thing in your life happens you aint got words big enough to say it so i guess you just say it happens id been barnstorming out of town id done a lot of that after mr wilkinson left the monarchs when i got back to town there was this letter from abe saperstein the guy who ran the harlem globetrotters bill veeck who headed up the cleveland indians had asked abe to scout around for some pitching help his ball club was trying for the pennant and they needed somebody to help out on the mound abe scouted around a lot and i guess he figured the negro leagues was the best place to find some quick help and as old as i was there still anybody in the negro that could throw better than me abe knew that he recommended me to the indians and mr veeck wanted me kept telling me to come up for a tryout abes letter asked me to call him and let him know when i could be there i called quick after twentytwo years of throwing i was going to get a crack at the major leagues lahoma and me danced all over the house youll do it satchel lahoma you know you can
i got to cleveland on july   that was my fortysecond birthday and i was about to get me the best birthday present id ever had mr veeck told me to go in the locker room and get on a uniform while he was getting lou boudreau the indians manager i didnt feel anything i was just numb i guess when i got out on the field lou boudreau was there in his uniform mr veeck and abe saperstein were there too can you still throw like you used to mr lou asked me i got as fast a ball as anybody pitchin now but i got to admit its not half as fast as it used to be but i can still pitch it where i want to can you do that against major leaguers mr lou asked dont you worry about that the plates the same size up here mr lou just grinned why dont you catch satch for about ten minutes and then bat against him mr veeck told mr lou mr lou nodded maybe you want to warm up first satch mr lou asked me yeah id like that why dont you take a lap around the gravel track maybe run about fifty paces and then walk fifty like my boys do i looked around that big ball park but if that was what mr lou wanted me to do id try it i ran about seventyfive yards and that ball park looked bigger than ever i stopped and went back you know mr lou this is an awful big ball park i said i guess i just wont run after all you think youre warmed up enough he asked me i sure am mr lou got him a catchers mitt and went behind the plate i just tossed a couple real easy and then i started firing i wasnt thinking i wasnt trying to get in the majors i wasnt doing anything except just pitching like id always done that was the one thing i really knew how to do finally mr lou told me id thrown enough and i walked up to home plate thats some control satch he told me you didnt miss the strike zone moren four times out of fifty those that missed were only an inch or two off the plate too lets see if you can do that good when i try hitting against you now you want me to shag the balls lou mr veeck said if you want to mr lou answered get over in right field after seeing satchs stuff i dont think im going to pull many balls to left he didnt either after we were done he told me to go in the clubhouse when i walked away mr lou and mr veeck were up close real close jawing away like everything a few minutes later mr veeck came in the locker room lou thinks you can help the club he told me lets go down to the office and sign a contract it was just like that just that easy as easy as itd been for me to pitch all those years i was in the major leagues the old mand made it i signed that contract real quick i was going to get a years salary for only a halfyear of ball after id signed up mr veeck grinned satch he told me im just sorry you didnt come up in your prime youd have been one of the greatest righthanders baseball has ever known if you had    not everybody was happy that id gotten into the major leagues most were but there were some who said it was just a cheap publicity stunt maybe mr veeck did want some publicity but he wanted a pitcher too there was only one guy around who could fill both orders that was ol satch some people wrote some mighty nice things after i signed like the story tom meany of new york wrote he said as far as im concerned the signing of satchel paige  to a cleveland contract is far more interesting than was the news when branch rickey broke the baseball color line by signing jackie robinson to a montreal contract it was inevitable that the bigotry which kept negroes out of organized ball would be beaten back but id never heard of robinson at that time with paige its different the satchmo has been a baseball legend for a long time a paul bunyan in technicolor more fabulous tales have been told of satchels pitching ability than of any pitcher in organized baseball    about a day after i signed mr veeck called a press conference we signed satchel in accordance with our policy of getting the best available material no matter the cost he said we are convinced he is the best available player who has a chance to help us win the pennant when mr veeck said he didnt care about the cost i guess he meant it i didnt get no bonus but i got that good contract and i think abe saperstein got fifteen thousand for finding me when i heard that i couldnt help thinking that mr wilkinson and mr baird ought to get something theyd sponsored me ever since my armd gone dead and i figured they ought to get something for that i told mr veeck how i felt and he agreed he was a mighty fair man he gave mr wilkinson and mr baird five thousand to split that was five thousand more than branch rickey gave them for jackie robinson when he took him from the monarchs     it wasnt until the day after i signed that i started feeling things i knew the indians werent the monarchs but id still be out there with a ball in my hand and the fellow at the plated have a bat in his hand maybe theyd knock me all over the place but i was going to have to see them do it i was starting my major league career with one thing in my favor anyway i wasnt afraid of anybody id see in that batters box id been around too long for that i wasnt as fast as i used to be but i was a better pitcher if i couldnt overpower them id outcute them i didnt feel bad about not having all my speed anymore i was happy over still being able to throw why guys i used to pitch against guys like waite hoyt lefty grove lonnie warneke dizzy dean and carl hubbell werent even around anymore but ol satch was i was just starting starting years after those guys hung up their gloves id waited a long time to pitch in the major leagues but i couldnt have asked for a better setting when i got my first chance it was on july  and the cleveland indians were playing the st louis browns in clevelands municipal stadium there were about thirtyfive thousand in those stands and lots of them were there just hoping theyd get to see me i didnt let them down bob lemon started for us and he didnt have it he got behind four to one after three and a half innings and they pinchhit for him in the last of the fourth a couple of the other boys and med been warming up out in the bullpen in the last half of the fourth and when we were ready to start the fifth lou boudreau signaled for me it seemed like a mighty long walk from the bullpen to the pitchers mound i didnt go fast no reason wearing myself out just walking i just shuffled along and every time i shuffled the stands busted loose like they never was so happy to see anyone in their life id pitched before a lot more than that a lot of times and id heard more noise but there still were a pretty good bunch of cheerers out there for just an old friday night game when i got to the infield out came all these photographers there must have been ten of them popping flashbulbs in my face they tried crawling over one another to get pictures of me it was such a mess i just dropped my mouth opep and stopped and stood there for a minute the chief um pire bill mcgowan didnt chase those photographers off the field like he was supposed to he must of thought history was being made so he just let them shoot away i guess maybe history was being made i was only about ten feet away from being the first negro ever to plant a spike on an american league pitching mound lou boudreau was on the mound waiting for me he handed me the ball and said something i dont know what it was i wasnt hearing too good i dont even think i heard those fans any more but folks tell me they were making even more noise now that id gotten to the mound i threw my first warmup pitch and all those flashbulbs popped again youd have thought i was the new president or something the photographer finally cleared out of the way and chuck stevens the browns first baseman stepped up to the plate to open the fifth this was it i felt those nerves they were jumping every which way i didnt feel loose at all i guess i wasnt i threw and stevens singled then the nerves were all gone i was pitching and id been doing that too long to be nervous in a game gerry priddy came up and i fired my hard one he bunted and stevens went to second while we were getting priddy out at first there was one out but the browns had a runner in scoring position whitey platt was up i gave him my overhand pitch and my  sidearmer and my underhander ana my hesitation he struck out when zack taylor the browns manager saw what i could do with that hesitation pitch he protested but mr mcgowan said it was legal a zarilla came up with two out and stevens still on second i just fired like id always been firing and got him to fly out to right field for the third out we didnt score in the last of the fifth in the top of the sixth dick kokos singled off me and went to second when one of my boys fumbled around with the ball roy partee was up next and cracked the ball good but right into a linedrive double play eddie pellagrini flied out to end the inning mr lou pinchhit for me in the last of the sixth i was through for the night i hadnt set no records but id done what the indians was paying me for id gotten the side out without giving up any runs in the fifth and sixth innings    it wasnt much after that game that will harridge president of the american league banned my hesitation pitch he said hed never seen a pitch like that he said i was tricking the batters and umpireshaving the batters swinging at balls when all the time i had the ball in my hand having the umpires calling strikes when the catcher thumped his glove making them lie the first time mr harridge saw that pitch of mine he must have grabbed a rule book and thumbed all through it but couldnt find anything in those rules against it but he didnt like those batters falling all over the plate swinging at nothing and he didnt like me making liars out of the umpires so he decided i couldnt use that hesitation any more man i almost got worried i was afraid if i showed any of my other tricks he might ban them too i figured id better not throw any of that trick stuff just throw that plain stuff like bobby feller and ewell blackwell and those other boys i guess mr harridge didnt want me to show up those boys who were young enough to be my sons i didnt mind though it was pretty tough on those boys having to play against somebody like me they hadnt had to get by like id had to theyd had expensive coaches and guys like that to teach them how to throw they didnt have to figure things out for themselves they had those trainers to rub them down all the time and theyd gotten plenty of rest between games they hadnt had to come up with those trick pitches just to rest their arms and work out the tiredness they never had to pitch every day for a month at a time or play the whole year round i guess that makes a difference and will harridge must have known i was a little too smart for those kids in the major leagues and he didnt want to see me fool them too much so even if it wasnt in the rule  book he called my hesitation illegal he didnt want to cause none of them kids who came up against me any hardships i figured id just have to get out there and confuse those kids with ordinary stuff    it was about a week before they banned my hesitation pitch that i got a chance to pitch in my second game it wasnt a regular game but an exhibition game against the brooklyn dodgers on july  and there were almost sixtyfive thousand in municipal stadium to see it i went in after the dodgers and we were all tied up three and three after six innings i needed only twelve pitches to get that side out i used my old corkscrew windup and it really floored them i whiffed gil hodges on four tosses fanned erv palica on three curves and struck out tom brown on five tosses i retired the side in order in the  eighth too and we finally won the game in the eleventh four to three after that i knew i was in i only wished lahomad been there to see it but the baby was keeping her busy and she wasnt going to be able to get up and see me until the end of the month    that next day after the exhibition game mr lou sent me in to pitch again if mr lou thought i was too old he sure didnt show it calling on me only a day after id pitched that exhibition game we were playing a doubleheader in philadelphia against the athletics and we won the first game six to one if we won the second game wed have us a league lead of two and a half games and we could use a little breathing room we pushed ahead four to two after five and a half innings in that second game but we couldnt stand that good living philadelphia started getting to bob lemon in the last of the sixth they got a run in and then mr lou decided it was time for ol satch i got us out of trouble quick and we went into the seventh still ahead four to three we got us another run in the top of the seventh and i was ready to just ride home and protect that win for bob lemon but you dont just ride in the majors not even if youre a walter johnson or a dizzy dean or a bob feller or a satchel paige ferris fain doubled off me in the last of the seventh and then hank majeski smashed my trouble ball on the left field roof that tied the score i just shook my head those things happen but they werent going to happen to me any more in that game i was going to make sure of that my boys got me a lead back right off the bat in the eighth ken  keltner belted out a home run and i was ahead six to five going into the last of the eighth i put down the as real fast then and in the ninth we got two more runs with that eight to five lead i just whipped right by the as in the last of the ninth id gotten my first major league win eight to five and id given up only one more hit after that home run the as had only three hits for those three and a third innings id pitched i was one and zero in the majors one and zero against guys who were in knee pants or werent even born when id started pitching i kept rolling too about a week later i got the call again we were playing before a capacity crowd of better than sixtyeight thousand in yankee stadium in new york we were still leading the league but that didnt scare the yankees going into the last of the sixth we were behind six to five thats when they sent me in to keep the yankees from getting farther ahead i didnt let them in the two innings i pitched i put them down with only one hit in the sixth and seventh innings and in the seventh i struck out joe dimaggio too joed belted a grand slam home run off bobby feller in the fifth but he only got air off me it wasnt enough though we didnt score anymore and the yankees won by that six to five score but id run my string to seven and a third innings against the major leaguers while giving up only two earned runs with those two innings of shutout balland lahoma saw it shed just gotten there that afternoon by plane she was going to spend the night visiting and then fly back to take care of our baby after the game we went out celebrating like we hadnt since the baby came it was our first chance to celebrate over me being in the majors the next morning lahoma and me got up early so we could have more time together before she had to leave when i looked out the window and saw all those clouds in the sky i knew wed have more time together than id figured i know about weather and those clouds say no game  i told lahoma then you can stay with me until i have to leave she said thats just what i did we just sat around talking and watching that rain come down it came down so hard they called off the ball game i heard it on the radio thats just what i told you i said to lahoma then it was time for lahoma to leave and i had to say goodbye to her again thats the way it is when youre a traveling man after i left her i headed for the train station the indians were leaving new york and heading for boston that rainedout game was the last one we were supposed to play in new york on that trip i guess i got kind of mixed up without my teammates with me anyway i went to the wrong station by the time i found that out and got over to the right one the indians traind left id just missed the old train but i caught me a bird over to boston and headed up to see mr lou its very nice of you to decide to join us was all hed say to me thats when i found out how they did things in the majors those boys just dont have heads of their own i guess even if its raining like everything they got to go out to the ball park and wait until somebody tells them to go home mr lou fined me for not coming out to the park and missing that train i didnt mind the fine thats the way they did it in the majors what made me kind of sore was they wouldnt pay me back for that ticket id bought for the airplane over to boston     it wasnt much after id missed that train that mr lou came up to me and asked me if i could start sure i can start i told him are you sure he asked me sure im sure i always started before i know that satch but all these boys are topnotchers up here thats what i always played against then old bill mckechnie one of our coaches came in on my side and that seemed to satisfy mr lou you want me to give you any advice on how to pace yourself mr lou asked me no ill just pitch it my way i always have you can lose it like you want to he told me and walked off i guess id upset him but he didnt change his mind about starting me on august  he told the papers id pitch the next day against the washington senators in municipal stadium going into that game id been used eight times in relief winning one and losing one id pitched eighteen innings against those major leaguers andd given up only four earned runs nine more innings against them wasnt anything to fret about everybody seemed to forget all about the pennant race when mr lou announced i was going to start but i didnt a win for us in our game with the senators and a loss for philadelphia in its game with chicago would move us into a firstplace tie in the league with the as boston and new york could tie too if they won their games we all were one game behind philadelphia it was a big game getting late in the season like it was every game was a big one you dont play around in the major leagues and i wasnt about to start the first time i got a chance to go all the way that first chance was something to see all right with everybody knowing i was going to pitch better than seventytwo thousand came out to the ball park that was the biggest night crowd in cleveland baseball history and it stood until i beat it myself a couple of weeks later for a few minutes out there it looked like i was going to let all these people down i got one out in the first inning but then my control left me flat i walked two batters and ed stewart slammed a triple off me and gave washington a two to nothing lead before wed even got to bat dont worry none i told mr lou after i got the side out that ol control aint gonna be missing anymore you just leave me in there thats just what mr lou did even if hed wanted to take me out i dont think hed have done it that earlynot with all those folks out there to see me i settled down pretty good after that we got back one run in the last of the fourth but washington squeezed across a run in the top of the fifth my boys tied it up three and three with two runs in the last of the fifth then in the last of the sixth we scored again and i was ahead four to three we got a rally going in the last of the seventh and mr lou sent in a pinchhitter for me that pinchhitter didnt do anything but we still got another run and were ahead five to three ed klieman relieved me and held the senators scoreless in the eighth and ninth and i had me my second win of the year five to three even if i hadnt gone all nine id given up seven hits and after walking those two in the first inning i walked only two more and got me six strikeouts and when i heard that philadelphiad lost to chicago i got a grin on me that didnt quit for a week id pitched us into first place in the american league even if we had to share it with philadelphia boston and new york that day bostond beat st louis and new yorkd beat detroit    that pennant race was really getting tough and we all felt it mr lou wasnt playing any of the amateurs because of the way it was going but he was playing ol satch plenty five days after i got that first start he called me in to relieve in the first game of a doubleheader against the new york yankees i went in to pitch the top of the eighth with the score tied six and six and held the yanks while we were getting two runs and got credit for my third win against one loss eight to six when we won the second game of that doubleheader that kept us in first place by six percentage points you dont have to be no pencil whiz to see how much every one of those games meant but op satch wasnt letting the pressure buckle him i was pushing pushing to show good my first chance in the major leagues but pitching that way wasnt any vacation my stomach troubles were getting to me real often sometimes it got so i thought i couldnt throw that ball i remember once we were playing washington and i was out on the mound my catcher jim hegan signaled for a fast ball and i shook him off i had to those pains was hurting so i couldnt throw the ball then jim signaled for a curve ball i still had to shake him off he signaled for my letup and i shook him off again i just had to wait until things quieted down inside me jim came stomping out from the batters box satch he said ive given you everything and you dont want them whats the matter man i got the miseries in my stomach and lefty weisman aint here to help me lefty was the cleveland trainer and he was out sick himself that day but jim called into the dugout and bob lemon came running out with leftys little black bag what does lefty usually give you satch bob asked me somethin white bob fished around in that bag and finally came up with one of those white pills for me i swallowed it down and it wasnt no time before my stomach got real peaceable and i was ready to pitch again course jim hegan called me a hypochondriac and told me that for all he knew that white pill could have been a cure for dandruff but i knew better that pill was white just like the ones lefty gave me and it quieted them pains didnt it    after that first start of mine it seemed like it was forever before they ever got around to starting me again but that was the way it was in the majors you just didnt pitch every day the year round like id done before that took a lot of getting used to for a long time just sitting around like that wore me out id get so tired just sitting id have to sneak into the locker room and take a little snooze i was in there one day stretched out on the rubbing table kind of dozing when my old buddy dizzy dean came in he shook me  awake whats the matter boy you tired from overwork he asked me diz im tired from underwork this is the first time in twenty years ive gone four or five days without pitching but that didnt last too long with the pennant race tightening up like it did mr lou started using me more and more wed dropped out of first place again and mr lou gave me the job  of getting us back in there on august  we were playing a night game in chicago at comiskey park that park held a lot of old memories for me and a lot of folksd seen me pitch there a big chunk of those same folk people whod seen me throw my best against negro leaguers came out to see how i threw against major leaguers they busted down a big gate trying to get in there to see me we had a crowd of about fiftyone thousand the largest ever to see a night game in chicago nobody could have given me any better news than that in my first start in the majors id drawn the largest night crowd ever in cleveland now for my second start id done the same thing in chicago ol satch could draw the fans and youd better believe it now all i had to do was show them i still could throw throw for nine innings but nine innings in this league was a long way id found that out against washington i went easy real easy not trying to burn that fast ball by the batters i just tried to put it where i figured itd do the most good the first four innings went by without us or chicago scoring that ball was flowing out of my hand just like it was some water and i wasnt wasting any pitches i hadnt walked a man in those first four innings i was bearing down i wanted that win just as bad as anybody itd put us back in first place larry doby our center fielder gave me a hand in the top of the fifth inning he tripled and scored a couple of minutes later when jim hegan my catcher hit a fly i had me a onetonothing lead i nursed that through the last of the fifth the sixth and the seventh we werent scoring anymore and i just kept praying my arm wouldnt tire out on me in the top of the eighth i got some breathing room ken keltner our third baseman singled and got sacrificed to second then dale mitchell our left fielder singled him home that gave me two runs to work on that mob watching went wild even though we were playing in the chicago ball park they were there for me that was for sure i didnt let them down in the eighth i set down those white sox again real quick id given up only three hits in the first eight innings dont worry boys we got them now i said when we got to the bench for the top of the ninth they werent worrying my boys picked up three more runs in the top of the ninth and i had me a five to nothing lead i figured i was as good as home i got the first man up real easy i had one out but i wasnt home luke appling singled and pat seerey singled there were men on first and third and only one out i wasnt real worried about losing but i didnt want to get taken out of there i wanted that complete game i walked back to the resin bag and dusted my hands i rubbed the ball i wasnt nervous id been in holes like this before i just wanted to get those next two batters to fidgeting i must have i got aaron robinson and ralph hodgin out real easy i had my first complete game and it was a shutouta shutout in only my second start wed won five to nothing and id given up only five hits i hadnt walked a man that put us back into the american league lead it looks like when they need that stopper need that big game to get back into first place youre the one satch a reporter told me after the game it sure was funny how serious that reporter was when he said that like nobodyd ever known it before what he didnt know was that for about twenty years reportersd been saying that but that reporter didnt bother me what bothered me was those guys who were saying that i was just lucky to get that shutout thats why my next startwhen i shut out those white sox again and gave cleveland a tie for the american league team record of four shutouts in a rowwas the game i thought was the biggest in my career and that covers a lot of ground that second shutout even convinced the umpires bill summers and art passarella hopped in my corner and stayed there how can you rate him bill told one reporter there are few better pitchers in baseball today maybe there arent any and there are few with more stuff he has a slider that cracks like a whip and a curve that explodes and he is plenty fast is there anything else and art told those writers theres a rocking chair if ever there was one that old boys around the plate all the time and calling balls and strikes for hims a breeze i was behind the plate in that shutout he worked in chicago and i never had an easier game in my life you could feel that pennant tension every time you went into our locker room those last few days in august itd been twentyeight years since clevelandd gotten in a world series when i first heard itd been twentyeight years i couldnt hardly believe it why that was even before i started playing professionally and the way most peopled always talked it didnt seem to me like baseballd even been invented before i began tossing my trouble ball i tried to help those boys out when the pressure was deep like it was but they were all so tied up they couldnt hear anybody i figured maybe my pitchingd snap them out of it and i got a chance on august  wed  dropped two games behind the boston red sox and we were in third place when mr lou sent me in there to straighten out the team thats just what i did i stopped the washington senators on seven hits and we won ten to one i had me a twohitter going into the eighth and gave up only one extrabase hit for my sixth win against one loss boston didnt play that night and we were only one and a half games out of first place that pennant race kept going like that right up to the wire then it endedended with us and boston tied for first place they set a playoff game and gene bearden went out to pitch it for us i was ready in the bullpen just in case gene got into any trouble against boston but gene didnt need my help that day we won the playoff and that gave us the american league pennant we were in the world series against the boston braves it was clevelands first pennant in twentyeight years and they hadnt done it until op satch came around and won them six games while losing only one down the stretch drive thats why they were saying id gotten more fame in three months than most pitchers do in ten years in the major leagues i got it because i won and because the fans wanted to see me when bill veeck signed me he knew what he was doing i showed he knew
