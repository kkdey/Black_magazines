in this time of national insecurity and perhaps because of it the status of the negro in american life is improving at a far faster rate than ever before integration even in t the notsosolid south is becoming a reality while political and economic and racial realism has resulted in greater acceptance of the negro by the majority american the problem of negro acceptance of himself has been neglected at the expense of full psychic benefit from his progress social scientists speak of a cultural lag between material and social progress by this is meant that man has devoted much attention to physical development with out the evolution of a philosophy to cope with the problems which yet remain and are in part a product of industrialization and scientific achievement in the same way there has been a lag between the advance of the minority american and his own selfimage so that as he reaches near equality with the majority american he continues to be the victim of his slaverybegun secondclasscitizenshipperpetuated feeling of physical and mental inferiority this ingrained inbred selfimage manifests itself daily in what i term the negros inhumanity to the negro his lack of confidence in and unwillingness to support and develop his own institutions and businesses and professions resulting in economic dependence to a greater extent than necessary upon the already established majority american the negros rejection of his business and professional class is rationalized in many ways that we must not ourselves discriminate against the majority group is the most popular we hear too that negro physicians for instance are not equally schooled that negro merchants charge more than white ones negro teachers cannot compete and negro lawyers are not respected in the courts all such expressions are only rationalizations and excuses to cover up the real motivating factor the deepseated feelings of inferiority and lack of confidence in themselves which plague the americans of color from the illiterate to the educated during the years of struggle between my graduation from high school and the time when i was able to begin the typically american unsubsidized and unaided college training i was an insurance salesman in various ohio and michigan cities nothing in my life has been more traumatic than this dawning realization of a sensitive young man not yet of majority of the strange loneliness occasioned by my own people literally slamming the door in my face because i was selling nigger insurance perhaps the psychology of the race is well summed up in the reputed statement of a negro woman asked why she did not buy her ice from a negro the white mans ice is colder i like to think that i have come a long way since those depressed years just before world war ii however i still suffer the same pain as a member of the legal profession at the rejection of colored members of my colleagues in preference to the man downtown when you know that the negro attorney has gone to the same schools passed the same examinations often specialized in school or practice and has successfully championed the civil_rights fight of his race from restrictive covenants to the school integration and sitin decisions you wonder what one has to do to convince the negro that his professional men are equal in ability with those of any other race if this race is ever going to find economic security full interracial acceptance and above all selfrespect we are going to have to change our philosophy straighten out our thinking in the first place we must not expect our business men to start out with the corporate capital now in the hands of the white business we must not for the purpose of discrimination but for that of equalization erect a kind of community tariff wall preferring goods and services of others of our race in much the same way that congress has had to erect tariffs to protect infant industries particularly at the beginning of this countrys industrial life when we could not compete with europes already developed economy any other policy is to make jobs with negro spending power for those of other races at a time when the latter have not adopted a policy of equality so that we are victims of a twoedged sword discrimination from within and from without even more important is the psychic effect the acceptance of racial inferiority status which selfrejection implies it is a little difficult to sell the idea of acceptance of the negro by others when he has not fully accepted himself this selfrejection is perhaps a natural consequence of living in a whiteoriented society a natural progression from childhoods white dolls a white santa claus even a white god to a belief that white is right generally but we must not surrender to this selfdefeating and not inevitable reaction the problem is one of racial selfeducation it is no justification to say that i feel inferior because the white man has taught me that i am we must mature become adults as a race and institute our own thinking on so vital a matter as racial equality we have spent so much time on converting the white man that we have closed our eyes to the fact that we have ourselves almost completely accepted white standards and prejudices even of physical attributes which distinguish race from race we must spend more time selling the negro to the negro we need a massed concerted effort which can include classroom discussions lectures editorials books magazine and newspaper articles sermons stories and plays to elevate our selfconception from the slough of inferiority and thus to see an end to the negros inhumanity to the negro
the father of negro history
mrcarter g  j ir r woodson closed the  m s book with a snap and threw it on the desk his dark eyes were the father of negro history by agnes behling o wmb stormy and his thin lips more compressed than usual as he arose strode over to the window and stared out over the college campus it is always the same he muttered to himself it is the white man who writes the history books to show that all major contributions to civilization have been made by various branches of the white race through the open window came the voices of negro students on their way to classes what incentive do these young people have to overcome their feelings of inferiority to rise above their handicaps to struggle to attain their rightful place in modem society it was the question to which for many years he had tried to find the answer for a time he stood in deep thought then with the clenched fist of his right hand he smartly struck the palm of his left and exclaimed i will do it today with that he hurriedly left the room to his associates it was inconceivable that at the height of his educational career dr woodson deliberately should decide to resign from his position as dean in order to devote the rest of his life if need be to help put the negro back into the history books to carter g woodson it was only another step in the long climb to rise above the limitations of his birth and early environment and in that struggle to lead the underprivileged to a realization of their hopes and ambitions to james and anne eliza woodson former slaves on december   was born a son whom they named carter godwin as a member of a large family he grew accustomed to the many privations due to poverty but only one seriously mattered to him the inability to attend even the poor schools provided when the little farm could no longer provide a living carter went to work in a coal mine in west virginia the work was hard the hours long the pay poor but through sheer determination he forced himself to master the fundamental subjects until at the age of twenty he entered his first school the douglass high school in huntington west virginia so intense was his interest and so untiring his efforts that he finished the four year course in less than two between  he earned the degree of litt b at berea college in kentucky just six years from the time he had entered douglass high school as a student he became its principal in the years which followed he served as supervisor of schools in the philippines a teacher of language and history in high schools in washington d c a dean of the school of liberal arts at howard university and finally at the college of west virginia in spite of heavy teaching duties and financial difficulties his relentless quest for more knowledge drove him on to earn the b a and m a degrees from the university of chicago to study abroad and at length in  to receive his ph d from harvard during the years of study teaching travel and other personal contacts he learned much that was of interest about his own people but little of it was to be found in books research convinced him that writers of history often distorted facts and either consciously or unconsciously misrepresented information about the contributions of his people to human progress history as it was taught gave the young negro an inferiority complex and left him restless and depressed not to know the stirring and significant events of the past which described his peoples continual struggle for improved living conditions better education and equal opportunities had left youth without a sense of appreciation for past achievements and thus had failed to provide incentive toward which to work for the future more than anything else in life carter g woodson wanted youngsters to grow up with this appreciation of their own possibilities which could be gained only through a knowledge of the contributions which black folk had made to history to this end by  he almost singlehandedly founded the association for the study of negro life and history whose objective was to fortify racial pride by supporting facts and knowledge concerning racial heritage this undertaking was soon followed by the journal of negro history which aimed to furnish the factual background necessary for the interpretation of problems related to the education of the negro occasionally dr woodson obtained small grants from foundations but usually he paid from his own modest salaries to support his research projects and the publication and circulation of valuable books about the negro  negro history week february  with its emphasis on the proud american was initiated by dr woodson because he believed that history is a record of the progress of mankind and in that sense negro history is a necessary part of both national and world history many admired carter g woodsons achievements but few became close friends for his singlemindedness of purpose and missionary zeal frequently did not attract the sympathetic understanding of those about him those who knew him best often described him as stubborn formidable and independent he seemed to begrudge the time and effort necessary to cultivate those personality traits and personal habits which might have drawn others to him and given him wider public acclaim to him these things were unimportant for there was so much to be done and he had begun so late in life when asked why he had no home of his own or had never married dr woodson would explain my work is my only wife modest circumstances necessitated his living in lodging houses and eating his meals in restaurants at times he could be genial but usually he was less at home with adults than children his associates described his life as spartan in its simplicity for he did not smoke or drink tennis was his only sport and about his only pastimes were the theater and the long soltary walks during which he planned future activities mary mcleod bethune a contemporary characterized him as living for decades among his books constantly searching collecting studying writing and editing when he died on april   there was no need to erect a memorial in his honor for during his busy lifetime he had built his own as tangible evidence of his achievements he left a legacy of sixteen books about the negro hundreds of articles and monographs in his chosen field and many reviews of books written about the negroes of other lands his journal of negro history and negro history bulletin still are an invaluable source of information for those research students who would study or write about the negro the negro in our history now in its eighth edition still is used by colleges throughout the nation and the story of the negro retold is read as eagerly by high school students as elementary school children learn about their heroes from the negro makers of history death came before he could complete his most ambitious undertaking a six volume encyclopedia africana however any such encyclopedia when published undoubtedly will contain many of the articles edited and published by dr woodson as well as the materials from those whom he inspired to help in his resurrection of the lost history of his people as a living if less tangible legacy he left behind the inspired leadership of those whose minds had become imbued with his principles and ideas perhaps even more significantly by his example dr carter woodson taught the youth of his own and of the present time not to give in or give up but to rise in spite of all handicaps to their highest potential by convincing them that neither the intelligence nor the capacity is lacking once their possibilities are realized in  the national association for the advancement of colored people awarded dr woodson the spingarn medal for outstanding achievements in  he received an honorary degree from virginia state college and a similar degree from howard university in  after his death his people showed the high esteem in which they held the father of negro history by naming him the third distinguished american in the ebony hall of fame
the american dilemma e v i s i d
as we can now look back over the era of reconstruction with the wisdom of hindsight we see clearly that the reason so much went wrong and why so little permanent improvement of the lot of the negroes in the south resulted was this that the political revolution was not backed up by economic and social reform as usual the leaders of that time tried to do great things too cheaply without paying the costs the slogan six acres and a mule was never taken seriously by those in powerjust as in most of the underdeveloped countries of the world today where land and tenancy reforms are proposed as programs and sometimes even enacted into law but frustrated and nullified by the resistance of the vested interests i draw this parallel between the fate of the negro people in america during reconstruction and that of the downtrodden masses in underdeveloped countries at the present time because i believe it has a lesson to teach us if we want to avert disaster today too a radical revolution has been carried out the liquidation of colonial domination but vicious economic and social systems which colonial governments had found it to their advantage not to disturb have largely been left intact in some countries inequalities are in fact increasing now history is repeating itself on a much bigger scale it is not now a matter of a small minority of a few millions in one single country as it was in post civil war time in america today huge majorities of many hundreds of millions in the greater part of the world outside the soviet orbit are affected the stage is international and not merely national and the problems it presents are immensely dangerous in the present tense state of international relations dominated by the cold war in america this type of reconstruction led to the great national compromise worked out in the late s the negro people were left again to the mercy of the white upper caste in the south now embittered by all that had followed their military defeat economically the south deteriorated to a colonial status in its relation to the north and as late as the thirties franklin roosevelt could still characterize the south as the nations problem number one in the north there was instead exceedingly rapid economic expansion though under rugged individualism and rampant corruption of government from which america as we know has still not entirely freed itself thereafter for more than half a centuryindeed until the end of the thirtiesthe status of the negro people remained on the whole about unchanged there were advances on some fronts but retreats on others twenty years ago this era of relative stagnation so far as the negroes position is concerned had so impressed itself on american thinking that even the social scientists had generally come to believe that it was the natural order of things progress was foredoomed to be very gradual and slow they believed and nothing very much could be done to speed it up in my study of the negro problem in america at that time i came to the contrary conclusion however that this period of stagnation was only a temporary balancing of forces which were just on the verge of being broken i saw big changes in the offing and as we know this actually happened these last twenty years have been filled with advances on all fronts in the labor market in education in the fields of social welfare and housing in the structure of law and law observance and generally in the enjoyment of more equal opportunities to do things to move in society to work produce and consume without meeting segregation and discrimination no historical trend of social change is a straight line and there have been occasional setbacks prejudice itself is also slow to disappear though its legal and institutional retaining walls are crumbling there is still a long road to travel before america becomes in fact the egalitarian country of its creed but in historical perspective the rapidity of progress is astonishing let us remember that practically all of this progress has taken place in the short period of the last twenty years following six decades of stagnationand that its coming was not anticipated by most students of the american scene i have found it not inappropriate to use this occasion for reminding us of some broad traits of the history of the negro people over the past century just as an individual for the sake of his sanity needs to maintain continuity with his earliest memories so also groups of people need to be clear about where they came from and how they have fared if they are to understand where they stand today and the direction in which they are moving the progressive achievements of recent years have not been won without efforts every individual advance on the whole broad front has had to be fought for sometimes against fierce resistance in the general advance unfortunate in cidents occur which deeply disturb the participants but we should not expect the uprooting of racial inequality in the face of inherited and emotionladen prejudices to be frictionless in a sense unpleasant incidents even have a function to fulfill in this process of advance in the last chapter of an american dilemma i quoted a remark once made to me by a prominent and conservative negro social scientist in the south i can now reveal that the man i characterized in this way was my late friend charles s johnson the great sociologist and the first negro president of fisk university he stated as his considered opinion that tensions are not necessarily bad and that under certain conditions even race riots may have wholesome effects in the long run he continued in about the following way they stir up peoples conscience people will have to think matters over they prevent things from becoming settled if the race situation should ever become fixed if the negro were really accommodated then and only then would i despair about a continued great improvement for negroes as long as there is friction and fighting there is hope in this light the little rock disturbances and the many other unfortunate incidents reported daily in the american press have their positive role to play in giving momentum to social advance i realize that it is much easier for an outsider to take this lofty philosophical view than it is for the american citizen who has a duty to take a part in pressing social advance as rapidly as possible and it must be particularly difficult for the young negro intellectual who bears scars in his soul from all that yet remains of segregation and discrimination in american life nevertheless i maintain that it is important to see clearly that the trend moves steeply upwards in order to avoid discouragement and to sustain the determination required in the skirmishing that may still be necessary in this new epoch the negro cause is a winning one i have not the slightest doubt that we shall continuously see great improvement in the negros status in american society and i even foresee that the rising trend of the past two decades will accelerate it would take me too far afield to explain all my reasons for this conviction but among them on the material side is the growing affluence of society which provides more elbow room for everybody and has little interest in pushing anybody into the ditch on the spiritual side there is the reality of the ideals enshrined in your constitution and rooted in the hearts of the american people with rising levels of education the hold of these ideals in america is continuously strengthened increasingly the false and derogatory be liefs about negroes whiih have filled the function of rationalizing prejudices can be expressed only by those willing to betray their own lack of culture as the white and negro people are increasingly mingling in work and pleasure all are discovering that they are the same sort of people with the same cultural moorings the same likes and dislikes and the same aspirations and ambitions for themselves and for america just as until women are completely emancipated every ambitious woman has also to stand for womens rights so even today every negro intellectual must feel called upon to supplement his work in his chosen vocation by being a race man this situation will remain until negroes are generally accepted everywhere on par with the whites it is for this reason that we find my friend and former collaborator ralph bunche who is working with so much distinction in the united nations peacebuilding efforts in the world taking off time now and then to speak out for the negroes but increasingly the  spokesmen for negroes are finding that there are white people championing the same cause the changes now underway have important implications    and they will require more radical adjustments than earlier generations    were called upon to make what we shall see happening and what has already happened to considerable extent is that the negro intellectual increasingly steps out of his spiritual isolation and becomes simply an american amongst other americans and a human being amongst us all the negro social scientist will less and less be preoccupied with research on the negro community and will strike out in other and broader fields the negro doctor and dentist and lawyer will increasingly serve white patients and clients this implies however that negroes also will go to white doctors dentists and lawyers similar changes in the activities of negro clergymen and teachers can also be expected i should not be fully candid with you if at this point i did not stress another implication of the integration of the negroes in the wider american society namely that the negro professional middle and upper class will have to surrender economic monopolies which they have held and are still holding on the basis of prejudice the future society of equality is a society of free competition and you will have to face it and prepare yourselves to deal with it successfully you cannot cry for the breaking down of the walls of segregation and discrimination while at the same time hoping to retain petty monopoly preserves among a negro clientele to give you a comfortable and uncontested economic safety you must have the courage to choose a harder life in which your abilities will be tested against  the norms established in the wider american society and indeed in the whole world    in the future america of our dreams not only all schools but also all institutions for higher education will stand open to all according to personal merit and independent of race and color this will ultimately happen also in the south in such an america there will be no place for a negro university i am therefore confidently looking forward to a day even if it is not tomorrow when howard and fisk and atlanta universities are not dissimilar in the composition of their faculties and student bodies from other universities in this country this of course impliesand indeed requires as a conditionthat all the other universities will have negro professors and negro students as a normal thing  as the integration process proceeds the problems of the negroes will gradually tend to disappear as separate problems for a long time yet there will undoubtedly be problems of breaking down segregation and discrimination against negro families in housing but the general problem of slum clearance in american cities is the bigger and more important one and the negros stake in that bigger problem is the greater as there is no hope for a satisfactory separate solution to the housing problems of negroes as long as slums remain a blot on american citiesthe schools most negro children attend are bad in the south and often in some parts of the north but many other schools are also bad and the best hope for negroes particularly in this period of desegregation is a campaign for improving the schools generally likewise negroes as members of the group still most disadvantaged in american society have a particular interest in the extention of social security an area in which america is still rather backward particularly in the field of health and hospitalization by comparison with the most advanced countries in this situation it is both natural and necessary that negroes should support and join those forces in american society which stand for general social and economic progress when narrower group interests are submerged and the pursuit of social advance for the whole community is brought to the fore a major step towards the complete integration of negroes in american society will have been taken it probably still is broadly true though less now than twenty or thirty years ago that the negroes are the last hired and the first fired and the incidence of unemployment on negro workers is disproportionately heavy the state of full employment created by the war and preserved in the immediate postwar years was of great importance on the economic side in supporting the rising trend of the negros status the relative economic stagnation in america and the high level of unemployment in the fifties is for the same reason particularly menacing for negro advance if continued stagnation should be the lasting condition for the american economy in the decades to come it will for america spell frustration internally and externally and it might even slow down the upward trend of negro advance i have talked about   to fight discrimination against negroes in the labor market remains naturally a task that cannot be relaxed but much more important is the recreation of the conditions for american economic progress as nothing is more effective in liquidating discrimination than full employment and a rising trend of incomes to all in this way the cause of raising the status of the negroes in america and stamping out the remnants of segregation and discrimination is bound up more closely than ever before with all the progressive causes in the country as american negroes you have no reason to have a split personality the integration of the negroes in american society has already proceeded so far that without any hesitation you can feel that what is good for america is good for the negroesand equally you can feel that what is good for the negroes is good for america

all this week i have y felt very conspicuous  everyone i have met s has seen the pearl primus show the smart cocktail party set the bright intellectuals the very important socialites theyve all been to the j k randle memorial hall in lagos who is miss primus if you havent heard of her i wouldnt blame you although if you take  my advice you shouldnt say it because she is publicized as the world famous exponent of african traditional dances and the smart sophisticated thing these days is to know all the world famous exponents of this or that miss primus is an american her nationality is a priceless asset in nigeria today as far as cultural art goes especially as her skin happens to be black  i havent seen miss primus dance how unsophisticated and thats what makes me so selfconscious yet if miss primus spent the rest of her life dancing in lagos there is one citizen shell never see at her showme if she packed out of nigeria tomorrow there is one citizen who and me would sing a song of joy breathe a great sigh of relief miss primus and the whole lot of them who are coming to sell african culture to the africans should get out of the continent we are fed up with being treated as children who must be humored and then the condescension the hypocrisy and the amateurishness sickens me i sent a reporter to interviewmiss primus when she arrived the reporter wrote a caption to the picture saying that   miss primus had come to teach nigerians how african traditional dances can be adapted to the modem stage afterwards she will return to the united states and dance for her degree i completely lost my temper with the reporter who i asked furiously is miss primus to teach africans their own dances well said the reporter she has been in africa four times now so what i raved miss primus can spend the rest of her life in africa it still doesnt make an exponent of her i made a solemn pledge a few months ago never again to see people like miss primus it was after the ams ac american society of african culture festival in lagos during which some leading american negro showbusiness people were invited from the united states my criticism of their performance did not go down too well with certain people who are only too ready to gloss and gush over anything foreign i was told that i didnt know a thing i was talking about besides the people concerned were worldfamous so who was i to so much as raise a query well you get that kind of people otherwise psychiatrists would be out of business  what makes miss primus world   famous it is the fact that she has done on broadway what few others have doneape african dances and anyway anyone who is known on broadway automatically is worldfamous even though you and i never heard of her what makes michael olatunji famous in america he started something new on broadway he brought a hoarse african voice to a showbusiness world used to the smooth and cultured voices of the bing crosbys the paul robesons olatunji combined his act with rowdy boisterous drumming and then of course at least the words he sang were authentic african he quickly became a curiosity and a star was born the other day amsac had the effrontery to bring olatunji over here and try to play him up lets face it olatunjis drumming is tenth grade stuff any pennyatune drummer in the streets of lagos given the same opportunity would humiliate him there was that fellow too at the amsac festivala man called geoffrey holder he was billed to do some voodoo dance or some other rubbish like that i felt sorry for him as this giant tried to writhe like a boa constrictor back and forth on the stage as far as he was concerned african dances were all writhing and crying hoa as the mood took him there was nothing african in his dance except the rafia kilt and the commercial beads oh yes the clowns jangling belts too then the message that constantly rings in our ears   now that you are independent we will do all we can to help you develop your culture how many times have i heard that since october   no one can help us develop our culture our culture exists if anyone wants to exploit it he is welcome provided he is man enough to admit his own limitations the culture of africa may yet suffer the same fate as our history we didnt have the education to write our own history and it fell to british officers to write inaccurate histories it is the same now with our culture we do not have the money to exploit it ourselves but there are people who have instead of them helping to exploit it by cooperation they are steadily imposing their own amateurish standards on us and like the mugs we are we turn out by the thousands to cheer them the underlining philosophy is so fundamentally wrong wrong  for the sponsors of these visits and wrong for us who patronize the shows i would gladly go and see a jazz concert tomorrow by any american showman visiting lagos i wouldnt mind sitting for three hours listening to odetta singing negro spirituals the people who infuriate me are the pearl primus kind and the geoffrey holders who have the nerve to come out to africa and bamboozle people and of course the other group of people who drive me crazy are the soppy intellectuals and socialites in our midst twice now samuel akpabot has organized a variety show in lagos were those knowalls who are supposed to love african art there not on your life ask them their impression on felix idubors latest carving and they will ask you if idubor is a russian ask them about emokpae and they turn up their noses and start a learned treatise on rembrandt if the people who imported the geoffrey holders and pearl primuses persist there is one nigerian who wont be buying their ticketme

after a number of years observing shouters i have come to the conclusion that todays shouters lack artistic means of utilizing to their best adother vantage movements that are calculated to bring the desired results shouting is an art it should not be undertaken without the basic understanding that unlike arts the spotlight is forever on the performer during its execution bad shouts attract just as much attention as good shouts a performance is only as good as the performer works to make it shouting is slowly passing off the scene and  the reason for its demise is that those who presently engage in this ecstatic spiritual pleasure of our forefathers or more accurately foremothers lack the inspirational techniques that would attract potential adherents to the shouting profession this should be corrected our churches are becoming dry there are times in which no verbal assent is forthcoming even when the minister boards the gravy train this has a tendency to make the minister look foolish while frankly he longs for others to share in his foolishness head shaking nodding and weak amens do little to compensate for his sweating statistics reveal that in times past every drop of sweat during the course of the gravy would produce a minimum of three shouts per hundred pew fillers the tragic consequence of this is that many churches are losing consecrated sweating clergymen to mass churches which guarantee shouts for every explosive truth this exodus on the part of the clergy has left many of our churches high and dry many of them finding that mere tears are not adequate expressions of mixing with the gravy are seeking other avenues of expressionssuch as rapidfanning neighbornudging approvals spikedheel tappings and quick snaps of the head in an up and down fashion consequently running the risk of a broken neck to accompany their broken spirits this will never do and many delta raised chicken lovers have voiced their dissatisfaction at annual state and national conventions where such matters between factional electional squabbles are the main order of the day integration has not helped matters shouters are guilty of appraising the level of listeners and responding in like manner many shouters have been seen cautiously peering behind them to view the ethnic makeup on given sundays and upon noticing the invasion of the service by others then refus to shout even though its mothers day such hypocrisy is unforgivable are honest welltrained shouters the only answer it is obvious that something should be done ministers are growing weak in their efforts to produce calculated calamity it has been discovered that climatic utterances such as early early early one sunday morning even when accompanied by pulling off of coats and throwing of the handkerchief produce only mild ejaculations from sleepy deacons the shouters have failed us aunt jane would turn over in her grave if she realized that our churches are depending upon the badly played organ to give us our shakes and quakes we must remember our heritage and arouse ourselves to the task of shouting integration or no integration our spirits must visibly express themselves on top of pews and up and down the aisles the times demand it somehow we must stir up the gifts that once put clapping in our hands and running in our feet the time is now we are fast losing our young people who find enjoyment in attending episcopalian book review services they are attending churches where the minister instead of praying please suh let love run from heart to heart and breast to breast is praying for such intangible commodities as world peace what is preventing this spirit from running from heart to heart and breast to breast could it be that the spirit is tired of running a heart to heart and breast to breast journey does not on the surface appear to be unnecessarily fatiguing the inability of aunt jane to fill her pulsating breast has left her high and dry in an extensive effort to get to the bottom of this problemthe demise of the artistic shouti have discovered several contributing factors that make for silent pews first of all shouts the few that remain are oftimes completely unplanned and illtimed the hate shout which at one time was as efficient as the atomic bomb has through the progression of love or some other inconsiderate shout preventerlost its delicate touch the hate shout as i recall had its beginning early in the service the hate shouting sister arriving at the door at  oclock would completely ignore the seating suggestion of the usher running her eyes over the congregation until she found sister petunia  with her head bowed down as the deacon prayed silently tipping down the aisle with a respectfully bowed head she counted the pews until she arrived at her destination with a quick move to the right she gracefully plopped beside sister petunia sister petunia interrupting her meditation sneaked a quick glance to her left she viewed with consternation the hate shouting sister whom she had succeeded as president of the chitterling dinner committee it was not petunias fault that the members of the committee found out that the hate shouting sister had been taking more chitterlings home to her twelve children and lazy husband than the church law allowed it had been an honest election and petunia had won although now viewing the shouting muscles of the expresident she prayerfully wished she had lost as the deacon finished his prayer asking for a place somewhere in the kingdom all upraised heads quickly appraised the situation and from the pulpit to the pews it was silently concurred that some good shouting would take place this morning it was no accident that the hate shouting sister had chosen this morning to wear an outlandish charm bracelet this bracelet had large gilded gold links mementoes of her husbands days on the chain gang lethal perhaps but one had to admit they were pretty even though they were hanging looser than usual sister petunia seeking some avenue of escape from the shout that was sure to come was dismayed to discover that to her right sat big lucy  pounds of contrary obstinancy clasping in her arms a sniveling yearold infant resigning herself to the inevitable she sat back to await her thrashing her only hope it appeared was that the preacher would not board the gravy train her hopes were in vain at the conclusion of his message he boarded that train it was between the stations of closing up hymnbooks and bibles and one of these ole days that the hate shouting sister got happy today sister petunia unhappily displays a face that has been marked by the spirit of course loving ones neighbor in spite of chitterling misunderstanding would have prevented the above from occurring but it can be plainly seen that more love would eliminate the hate shout entirely we must refine this type of shout to workable and acceptable proportions let us examine a few artistic means of accomplishing this worthwhile aim first why does not the hate shouter combine her strategy with the art of the running shout the running shout allows its executor more freedom more targets and less chance of being churched this packaged bargain in shouting must not be overlooked let us examine its highlights the execution is simple it allows  the shouter to sit where she pleases and at the appropriate moment dash out into the aisle and traverse at will will of course moves out of her way for he knows what is forthcoming with a running start the hate shouter could have flung her arms with deadly aim petunia and the entire committee would have fallen before her happiness what glorious opportunities the hate shouter misses when she fails to utilize the running shout think also of the shouts that will take place the following sunday the prospects of such a high time in the spirit will fill the pews to capacity i think it of sufficient import however to sound a warning there is a danger in the running shout that should be pointed out the direction traversed should be in the direction of pulpittorear and not from walltowall walltowall runners have discovered that the shortened distance can be miscalculated while in the throes of happy hate and the walls can be formidable obstacles that refuse to yield to the runner testimonials are on record that walltowall hate shouters would rather be hate shout receivers than to meet a hard cold unchristian wall admittedly some have not survived to testify at all building committees should bear this in mind when planning the new church many churches have eliminated walls altogether illtimed shouts are those that occur sometimes during offeringthe solemnity of the moment does not lend itself to the dignity of the shouter falling out at a time like this only increases suspicions of dodging of dues likewise during the announcements granted that some church announcements should cause us to fall out we should save these shouts for when they are able to create the most distraction at the most opportune time the meditation period has been experimented on by manyand reports are very effectively those who would desire more and better shouting would do well to learn a few of the techniques and responsive chords that must be struck prior to the eruption one principle that must never be forgotten is that of selfprotection the shouter should not rock from sidetoside while building up emotions such movements only give forewarning to innocent bysitters they do not deserve such warning neither should one slide down the pews church pews are more than often made of solid oak and splinters of this type are difficult to extract glasses should unobtrusively be removed as soon as the shouting target is spotted unless of course you yearn to attract more attention in the future by being known as the blind shouting sister admittedly it might enhance your shouting prestige but all shouters should intelligently weigh the pros and cons of the issues involved now that we have dealt with self protection let us move on to key words that will allow us to shout with trained proficiency shouting requires the utmost discipline and we must train ourselves to this end what are these key words first you must choose the words that fit your makeup good shouts vary j with the tastes and the moods of the i shouter since new words are be i ing discovered every sunday that i bring about emotional responses let us deal only with those words that we know are tried and true mother is effective only if she is gone normally permission is granted for unusual shouting on mothers day born again a word of caution here do not shout on this word unless you really are really born again again a word of caution shouting on really bom again is normally reserved for members of the mothers board jesus shout here only if the word is repeated ten times in succession and the preacher is sweating it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the minister is appealing to your intellect or your emotions be certain which one you respond todont mix them up hes all right there are no restrictions here this has been a timetested shoutgetting expression shout as often as you like on this one heaven statistical analysis has discovered that heaven today is entitled only to a short grunt do not exert yourself to reach this goal for you probably wont the susceptibility of any given shouter to the key words mentioned unfortunately depend upon the hard times and tribulations experienced during the week and herein lies the answer to the dilemma of the vanishing shouter if a really hard time has been experienced one may safely shout after hearing the word jesus one time if a really hard time has been experienced during the week this same word should authenticate a screaming yell upon its second rendition let us face facts because of the lack of hard times shouting is disappearing from our churches we can blame this on the welfare poor relief and reciprocal child support laws prosperity has left the shouter speechless miracle drugs have taken us off our beds of affliction consequently taking away good shouting material penicillin vitamins and other enemies have invaded the sacred territory of our once happily decaying bodies divorces are freeing us from unhappy shouting gems of trouble those who shout now must be really sick
the emergence of negro college stars and teams in integrated competition is one of the great but unheralded sports stories of our times there are several aspects of significance the success of the ralph bostons willie galimores wilma rudolphs tennessee states and florida a  m universities prove that negro coaches too are talented it proves that when trained properly and properlyequipped negro athletes can overcome the vast handicaps imposed upon them in southern states to compete on even terms with others who are more fortunate it proves that segregated  white schools make themselves appear ludicrous when they go chasing white athletes all over the country in a mad quest of wins when right there in their own territories are to be found untapped goldmines of athletic talent it proves that slowly but surely times are changing everybody agrees that times are changing for the better everybody that is except the segregationist soreheads and people who would like to see the clock run counterclockwise for a while the only basic reason why the allnegro college exists is racial prejudice and racial segregation which is perhaps being attacked by a slowlycreeping death in the  south which is not to say however that the nowallnegro college will soon disappear except such schools as lincoln university in pennsylvania lincoln university in missouri possibly west virginia state central state college in wilberforce ohio and howard university in washington no major allnegro or once allnegro college exists outside the south a certain amount of integration principally involving children of caucasian teachers and exchange students has existed in a few of the allnegro schools for years in recent years the two lincolns howard central state and west virginia state have increased their own integration process and to some extent this has been reflected on their athletic squads pennsylvanias lincoln university listed a caucasian lineman on its football team roster in the late s or early s but the original purpose of these schools dating back to  miners teachers college washington d c and  lincoln university pennsylvania was to provide college or university education for negro students who otherwise never would have been beneficiaries of this vastlyimportant privilege booker t washington and his students at tuskegee institute in alabama founded  were so hungry and thirsty for knowledge that they built their own college up from the ground with their own hands manufacturing bricks mortar cement beds chairs benches mattresses raising their own food making their own clothes in each case where men were enrolled in sufficient numbers in these schools sports entered the picture as a part of an aimedfor wellrounded educational program often there was but one coachin some cases a volunteer in others a graduate of the big white northern universitiesand he taught classes coached all sports set up schedules laid out athletic fields scrounged for equipment handled his own secretarial affairs and was just about it and all on the job working for a pittance but determined to do a job and dedicated to an ideal those negro college coaches were heroesas heroic as any fullback or guard or homerun hitter they ever developed into stardom and fan adulation this obtains even until this day in the south for a s jake gaither is no less a heroic figure in florida a  m university annuals than is their prided football graduate willie galimore of the chicago bears no amount of praise is too lavish for the early negro college coaches or for that matter for the jake gaithers over the years they have developed more outstanding negro athletesthough many of them were never heard of outside the negro press and negro communitiesthan any other agency they provided an opportunity for healthy competition for play for athletic development in the face of common official disinterest and lethargy one famed negro college president whose school received hundreds of thousands of dollars annually was so callous to football that he refused to provide a training table for the athletes and other difficulties which would have broken the strength of a fullhaired samson one scans the negro college coaching ranks and finds supercoaches among them coaches whose records match or surpass those of rockne rupp leahy brown among those supercoaches were or are little eddie hurt of morgan state college baltimore cleve abbott of tuskegee henry kean of tennessee state harry jefferson of virginia state and other schools jake gaither of florida a  m and johnny mclendon of tennessee state north carolina college hampton et al in this context it is interesting to note that william h lewis and w t s jackson attended a negro schoolvirginia normal and collegiate institutebefore migrating to amherst johnson c smith university and livingstone college played the first negro college football game on thanksgiving day  j c smiththen called biddle collegewon the game  to  lincoln howard tuskegee began playing football with hampton shaw of north carolina and virginia union football quickly spread to negro colleges throughout the south and the fables told about the roughandtough roc em sockem negro stars of that era are no less fantastic and bloodcurdling and unbelievable today than similar feats credited to fielding yosts pointaminute boys bronko nagurski pudge heffelfinger et al football of course was merely one sport the negro colleges played all of the popular games baseball basketball boxing track and field adding as time passed tennis swimming a bit of golf but no known polo often particularly in the early days equipment was inferior and the depth of onfield talent and coaching was no match for that of the caucasian schools but the zeal was there the players had a ball and so did the fans arkansas baptist college and tuskegee were early greats in baseball arkansas baptist was undefeated during the  season during  tuskegee won  games and lost only three not a few negro baseball as well as football and basketball stars moved from college into semiprofessional and professional games satchel paige claims to have matriculated at tuskegee a few weeks he is also credited with having attended knoxville college or months wherehe has saidhe sang with the quartet tuskegee also pioneered a good grade of tennis in the early days and the negro colleges even in our time play an important role in the development of this game althea gibson attended florida a  m university as financial conditions improved negro colleges built gymnasiums football stadiums tennis courts baseball diamonds and a few installed swimming facilities hampton students were blessed with a waterfront campus in recent years particularly since  when the supreme court outlawed segregation in southern education statesupported negro colleges have built physical education plants equal or superior to those of similarsized caucasian colleges of the south and north grambling in louisiana tennessee state florida a  mto cite threeare excellent examples of this trend negro colleges have played a leading role in womens sports particularly in track and field which is generally downgraded by american caucasians tuskegee again was a leader here and the world is now familiar with wilma rudolph and the tigerbelles of tennessee state the tuskegee team won the national aau womens track and field championship in  the athletic world was just beginning to become accustomed to the onslaught of male negro athletes on records and to negro champions in  sports says edwin henderson when the tuskegee girls bolted up from the south it is conservative to say that press dispatches created a sensation the first athletic association among negro schools was organized in  in washington d c it was called the interscholastic athletic association of the middle atlantic states members were an unusual combination of colleges and high schools their first event a track and field meetwas held at howard university on may   a few years later several negro college conferences sprouted among them the colored intercollegiate athletic association southern intercollegiate athletic conference midwestern athletic association and southwestern athletic conference these conferences established rules of control and conduct arranged schedules and in other ways gave the negro college athletic programs a form of organization never before evident among the leading organizers of negro college conferences were charles h williams of hampton ciaa e m walker of haven miss teachers college south central athletic conference organized in  j c williams of cheyney pa teachers college middle atlantic athletic association  r b atwood of kentucky state college mwaa  w b metcalf and e c silsby of talladega in alabama and b t harvey of morehouse si a a  and d c fowler of texas college swaa  these organizations inaugurated and stimulated interconference competition as well as increased intraconference competition established a system of maintaining records and sparked the citing of national champions americas second oldest postseason football bowl gamethe prairie view bowl game started by prairie view college of texas was first played in  but the biggest bowl game in the history of negro colleges is the orange blossom classic sponsored each year by florida a  m and played annually in miamis orange bowl stadium the organization of conferences brought another important development tournaments and championships both regional and national public interest in negro college play was whetted by negro newspapers the first permanent negro newspaper sports section was founded by frank a fay young and the chicago defender through the years all substantial negro newspapers have developed sports sections among the most sportsconscious publications were or are the defender pittsburgh courier afroamerican kansas city call cleveland callpost michigan chronicle norfolk va journal and guide new york amsterdam news houston informer atlanta daily world founder also of the wideawake progressive  wrong fan club and the los angeles sentinel prominent negro magazinesparticularly ebony and jethave devoted much space to the reporting or featuring of negro sports activities during the s jet magazine became the first negro publication to promote an interracial allamerica team including the best negro and white players in both negro and caucasian schools without regard to race or region among the most appreciative athletes honored by jet were caucasian gridders from southern schools in order to develop relations with the press negro colleges too have hired sports publicists fewif any college sports publicists in the nation surpass the talent or production of florida a  ms charles j smith gramblings collie nicholson and tennessee states earl s clanton in negro america of late many racial organizations have formed the habit of removing the words negro or colored from their organizational titlesthe controversial theory being that racialtagging lessens the worth and effectiveness of these groups in democratic society the colored intercollegiate athletic association following this trend became the central intercollegiate athletic association from the ciaas th anniversary brochure one learns a great deal about how sports began and grew not only in ciaa schools but in all negro colleges the early history of the central intercollegiate athletic association was tempered by a conscious effort to control athletics and intercollegiate competition says frank w render ii in an article allen washington and c h williams of hampton institute earnest j marshall of howard university george johnson of lincoln university w e atkins charles r fraser and h p hargrave of shaw university and j w barco and j w pierce of virginia union university met at hampton in  creating the genesis of the association which was then known as the colored intercollegiate athletic association in addition to the original colleges virginia seminary and college lynchburg and virginia normal and industrial

resolute leadership in the founders and w a rogers va normal w r brown hampton l l watson howard f j rogers shaw and t l puryear va normal athletic buffs of the midtwenties will not forget the realization of the firm unquestionable establishment of the ciaa when the conference proved that it was  stronger than any one member institution and would not fold the  howardlincoln controversy with the ciaa which resulted in the withdrawal of howard from the league until  gave evidence to the strength of the association which by this time had admitted st pauls a  t and j s smith to membership    virginia seminary and livingstone college salisbury n c resigned from the conference in  the latter having been admitted only a year earlier north carolina state now north carolina college at durham bluefield w va state teachers college and morgan state baltimore were admitted during this period when the country was troubled with the beginnings of farreaching financial problems creating the great depression the ciaa survived the nationwide monetary decline and before it was over st augustines college had come into the fold    the bitter mixed with the sweet a historic session of ciaa officials meeting at virginia state college voted for the suspension of lincoln university pa in february  for violating a conference regulation the institution was reinstated in september of the same year the field of sports broadened for ciaa schools although football basketball and track have almost unwavering popularity baseball and tennis were in their heyday while boxing and wrestling were relatively new sports the conference became affiliated with the american olympic association in  having joined the national collegiate athletic association in  still the ciaa exercised its aim to keep its members in line and when in  morgan state was found guilty of not honoring a league regulation the college was suspended    war was the issue in the early forties when west virginia state  was admitted as the ciaa extended to its western limit the second great worldencompassing conflict depleted the athletic ranks of all colleges and particularly some of the colleges with limited enrollment a special meeting of ciaa representatives convened at morgan in may and september  after which league rules were modified so that colleges could use all available men in their respective athletic programs after the war ended in  the original regulations were again enforced    delaware state  and winstonsalem  entered the ciaa and athletes became more plentiful during the postwar period    in current history racial integration helped the west virginia members move into their state college league west virginia state left the ciaa in  after producing nearlyunbeatable basketball teams and bluefield slipped out in  leaving a history of rockhewn football powerhouses but not before fayetteville n c state and maryland state entered in  to give the ciaa its greatest number of members  extending  miles northsouth from and just west of philadelphia almost to south carolina and  miles eastwest from the atlantic coast to the heart of the west virginia coal region lincoln one of the original five dropped intercollegiate football and resigned from the conference in  with the most recent addition elizabeth n c city  the ciaa sustains a membership of  colleges and universities the conference is operated through its officers and the newlyestablished office of the commissioner former coaching great harry jefferson located at hampton institute as founder williams stated probably the ciaas greatest contribution has been its pioneer work in promoting clean vigorous amateur athletics and high standards of sportsmanship this work has been in a field fraught with wonderful possibilities not only has it helped to give the public a finer appreciation of young men and women giving them some elementary conception of the fundamental truth that the great results in this world are attained only when men work loyally and heartily together for the attainment of a common end the history of the ciaafirst and oldest of the major college athletic conferences among negroesspans a most significant eraof sports development among negroes at the beginning this conference or association and all others like it experienced hunger pangs as it sought to survive it overcame personality and political problems as it sought to build soundly it worked without the advantages of unlimited budgets great press mills in all the handicaps of discrimination andor segregation yet today the ciaa like virtually all the negro conferencesboasts notable success in integrated competition including olympic games and ciaa officials watch proudly as negro college athletes star in professional sports among the ciaa graduates are johnny sample of maryland state college and the pittsburgh steelers roosevelt brown of morgan state college and the new york giants and john baker of north carolina college and the philadelphia eagles these athletes and fellow graduates and many more like them from other negro college campuses have perhaps done more than any other group to familiarize the general american public with the basic existence at least of the negro schools some schoolssuch as morgan state tennessee state florida a  m have achieved general public recognition on the strength of their performance within purely conference competition but more important these three schools and many more are today recognized and respected throughout the nation if not the world because of their notable athletic achievements outside the restricted world of jim crow competition grambling college which rode to popular recognition on the sturdy shoulders of former los angeles rams fullback paul tank younger is now a must stop on the itinerary of many professional scouts the college baseball squadscoached by the president himself dr r w e jones have sent many players into organized professional competition in the summer of  three grambling players signed bonus contracts totaling more than  grambling football and basketball teams also are quite productive of starring pros florida a  m is another negro school productive of great pros no longer do caucasian daily newspaper writers blink their puzzled eyes and ask wheres that when a negro athlete says he hails from famu or grambling or prairie view or morgan or maryland state or any one of the other schools which are today prominent in athletics negro college athletes are getting around and theyre making their presence felt all the way from the naia to rome and on to tokyo
im glad im not color crazy
anyone who has t f been aware of color  all his life in one way or another the idea of living without knowledge that color other than ones own exists no doubt is difficult to imagine yet that is how my life started until well into my school years i was unaware that all humans were not more or less the same color as myself before i went to school i learned to believe the bible including that wonderful piece god who made of one blood all peoples of the earth   although my schooling was designed to instill the supremacy of the british race whatever that is it was not very successful according to that schooling niggers or natives were the inhabitants of far countries that worked at a lower living standard than we did and helped maintain ours when white men first landed in africa the natives called them paleface but all this was like learning the battle of hastings it didnt convey anything very real we had never seen niggers the most i could gather was that they were people with black faces nigger meant black and we were whiteskinned that puzzled me because i thought we looked more pink but when color was discussed we were always white how black is black i always wondered to us black man nigger or negro all meant the same nigger was derived from nigerthe river where most niggers originatedor thats how we learned it negro was the spanish form we were english so we said nigger as simple as that sometimes we saw nigger minstrel shows but these were mostly white men made up with theatrical grease paint to look like negroes wed never heard them called negro minstrels we enjoyed the music though any one who knew real negro music would have thought the imitation rather poor but to us it was good occasionally we glimpsed colored people but never had any close acquaintance with them our first real contact was when we made our first trip to america we  needed someone to look after our house while we were gone and my wife met a colored woman just arrived from jamaica who was looking for somewhere to live she was grateful to accept the opportunity of living in our home until we came back while she could look for permanent living quarters for herself and her family and it solved our problem she seemed a nice enough person and she looked after the house very well but shortly after we got back i mentioned that my only previous knowledge of people with color different from my own had been nigger minstrel shows to have said negro minstrel would have seemed quite unnatural but because i said nigger minstrel that was the end of what could have continued a happy relationship to her the word nigger could only be coupled with the word hate we could not convince her that we dont hate anyone least of all because of their skin color that taught us one important lesson avoid the word nigger not everyone learned it the way we did the next contact was much happier theodore had married a white girl my wife was talking to his wife about religion and it came out that theodore believed that god was going to use communism to work out his will for mankind my wife talked to him without much success so she took me to see them all the communists i had ever talked to had no place for god theodore was on the wrong track if he thought god would use godless communism to serve him not only was theodore mixed up about this he had been reading literature put out by an african in britain league purporting to protest against color discrimination true color discrimination did exist but this literature had to trump up some situations that werent discrimination just to make colored people mad which annoyed me cases like the railway worker who came from jamaica and couldnt get a job because he didnt have the right union ticket when i pointed this out theodore realized that a white man could not have gotten the job either without the ticket it had nothing to do with color there were many more cases quite similar union rules werent formulated to keep colored people out they were formulated to keep anyone out who wasnt a union member on the communism issue theodore had views more difficult to dislodge in a very short time both of us had forgotten there was any color difference between us i am sure each of us recognized in the other an earnestness born of wanting to know the truth we argued strongly at times because each of us felt he was right and had to convince the other but each of us was also prepared to back down if really proven wrong the battle went on for weeks during which we developed quite an affection for one another sincere people can appreciate one another even if they differ and even if their skins have different colors theodore was a handsome man as dark a brown as ive ever seen i remember thinking that whites who are antinegro must be that way because theyre jealous i still think that is a big part of it deep down theodore conceded point after point first that god didnt need to use communism and finally that communism is antigod and a force that is out to exploit the masses of people in a way far worse than any capitalist system has ever done i was no capitalist supporter i know capitalism has its faults but these are nothing compared to what a totalitarian state can bring in the way of exploitation today many years later theodore is the worst enemy communism has he can smell out communists he knows all the arguments he snatches the rug right from under he must turn away more members from communism than ten communists working full time can convert not long before my wife and i emigrated to america we volunteered our home to accommodate a family of colored missionaries who had been working in nigeria for over twenty years they  brought messages from many people back in nigeria who had relatives and friends in london working or going through college they asked our permission to invite all these people to our home one evening quite a party it wasone well never forget as long as we live our own friends in the same situation would have got on with delivering messages exchanging gossip and forgotten all about their hostsit was none of their business anyway these people were not just courteous because they met in our home they didnt want us to feel left out with every piece of news they took time to explain all the details so we would know what it was all about just as if we had known them all their lives that evening we got a picture of the life and the people in nigeria that i wish many of our neighbors could have hada warm living picture that made us feel it was part of our world not something strange and remote everyone present except my wife and i had skin some shade of brown but this was quickly forgotten in the interest of the conversation some had musical instruments with them and we were treated to some real african music we quickly realized how phony were the whiteman imitationsand these people werent even professionals the strangest moment for me that evening was when i went to  the bathroom and caught sight of my own face in the mirror after talking to people all with skins some shade of brown my own face suddenly seemed so pale i remember leaning toward my reflection and muttering paleface later the neighborhood had quite an argument among themselves about us some even wanted to make representations to the town hall about us entertainingniggers we solved the matter for themand made their lives dull again by emigrating with white people we often get into a discussion about the segregationintegration issue we meet a proportion who think the nigger needs keeping in his place when a man has expressed himself that way i keep him in his placeout of my company i have no ambition to travel in the south i would not trust myself not to start something by getting mad at those idiotic whites down there who believe niggers are an inferior race there are so many decent people that weve come to hate segregation of any sortnot only of color but of religion nationality or anything else whenever i have to fill in a form with a space to check white or colored i wince i do whats expected check white but i hate it im not a lepermy skin is pink pale but pink im not proud of its color and i dont think it matters but that word white looks as if a segregationist prepared the form when i tell people im not for integration because i dont think there should ever have been segregation to want integrating they often dont get my point theyll go on to ask what i think about intermarriages if there never had been segregation there never would have been an intermarriage question naturally men marry women and women marry menif this is intermarriage im in favor of it but since there is segregation the question of intermarriage does arise i think its a personal one i happened to marry a pinkskinned girl before id met one of darker color that i liked well enough to give it a thought so i dont have to answer the question for myself but i know this if i had met a girl who was what i expect of the girl who would be my wife and she had dark skin it wouldnt bother me in the least id have to know my pink skin didnt bother her either then if we were married and some people wanted to exclude me from their circle of friends or wanted to accept me without my wife that would suit me fine it would save me the trouble of excluding them from my circle of friends there are enough decent people in the world that i dont have to bother about the friendship of the other kind in fact we have in our circle of acquaintance quite a few mixed couples theres nothing mixed about them to us how about working with colored people well my work has brought me in contact with many over recent years the ones i like best are the ones who do a good days work and forget about skin color and let me do the same i hope they get the same pay anyone would get for the job if they dont ill do anything to help put that matter right it was in new york i saw another side to this a colored man who couldnt let me forget his color he was a good tool maker and i needed a tool made i knew because he made tools for me before that he could do a good precision fast dependable job but this time we were depending on him and like the transport workers union when people are depending on transport to do their christmas shopping this man chose just that time to make an issue pay wasnt the issue the job was urgent and we would have met any reasonable demand that would have gotten the job done no we needed the job done and that was his reason to highjack us because of his color he wanted to prove we couldnt fire him new york city has an ordinance to prevent discrimination of any kind so he was right about that and nobody wanted to argue it with him anyway but he lost the job his tardiness lost the company an important contract and all of us were out of a job he called me discriminatory because i would not give him a reference conscientiously i could have recommended himhis work was good when hed do it but he refused to see that his action had not only cost him his job but ours as well if hed conceded that and given me hope that he might have learned his lesson id have given him a reference with a clear conscience color had nothing to do with itexcept as he made it another colored man who worked with me felt his color was against him he was no slower at learning than anyone who is just beginning a new job my boss wanted me to let him go i knew the main trouble was that the man was discouraged with himself let him go and hed stay that way for life most likely you dont have to be colored for that to happen he stayed and became another good worker he learned to forget about skin colorin his work anyway but at the beginning there he was convinced his color made him slow he had done what many doaccepted the false evaluation that a few whites put on coloreds often i encounter this a colored person talks to me as if because im white i think myself superior then hes out to show me hes as good as i am he doesnt have to this whole business of superior and inferior makes me sick everyone is different men are different from women thank goodnesshow dull it would be otherwise lets accept it that way without having to try and prove women are equal to men men will never have the babies they are neither superior nor inferior just different people are different and there are certain racial traits or tendencies that mark a general difference between people with pink or brown skins the negro race has a culture that many whites would give their eye teeth for but they just werent born to it so were different why cant we just enjoy one another 
patriarch undaunted
last spring bulldozers l g and other heavy equip ment approached an l d universi y  camp us like a small army marching out to meet a foe but this was a march of progress a part of the kansas city kansas urban renewal plan western university buildings are coming down and a much needed old folks home will rise in its place something of the schools history i walked about its grounds last fall the wind made an eerie sound blowing through the windowless dormitories but the scarlet oaks and the statue of john brown seemed as undaunted as john walker the little snowyhaired man who planted them years ago on the porch of walkers home across the street he rested momentarily then went back to raking leaves with his usual vigor despite the fact that he is  years old here almost in the shadow of the school john walker has spent most of his life always seeking improvements for quindaro community and its people a son of former slaves he came to kansas city from mississippi in  then a child of nine barefooted and hungry but with visions of real freedom he came with his father and cousin traveling up the mississippi by steamboat to st louis and by freight to kansas slavery had ended but its memories were fresh johns father had been a shoe maker on a large plantation a trade that proved very useful he opened a repair shop in old quindaro and prospered preceding the war in its proximity to the missouri river and parkville old quindaro was a well known link in the underground railroad which slaves traveled to freedom at about the time john arrived eban blachley a presbyterian minister came also with the farseeing wisdom that recognized the need to educate the recently freed negro john at tended this oneroom stone school some eighty years ago when blachley died the rev w t vernon took his place rev vernon was afterwards registrar of the u s treasury and bishop of the ame church in a political campaign in  he rendered valiant service on the stump for governor w e standley and it was decided that something should be done for vernons school out of this came western university fifteen acres were deeded to the state on which to construct buildings for the operation of a state industrial school the cornerstone was laid by the colored masonic lodge where john then a postman was a member hundreds of students poured in from every state in the union aside from a liberal education they were trained in wood work mechanics carpentry stenography tailoring music theology and cooking and sewing john walker kept a close eye on the school when he delivered mail he was pleased with the curriculum but it bothered him that the grounds surrounding the school continued to have a look of squalor not green and wellkept like other campuses one day he told his wife and children it will mean a cut in salary but i am going to work for the school i am going to teach our people the value of beauty and orderliness and he told me that was but one of the reasons i wanted to work at the school my own schooling was very limited in my youth it wasnt unusual to see grown men and women learning to read and cipher but i have always had a hunger for learning and the greatest respect for schools where ever i was employed i tried to learn as much as possible for instance at swift packing co i persuaded an engineer to teach me to read blueprints from my father i learned to repair shoes and to cut hair and i figured i could learn a lot more at western i am sure john was right about this for during the years between  and  when the institution thrived with an enrollment of  students he rose from caretaker to general overseer and advisor and according to many of the students this man used all his accumulated knowledge for the betterment of the school flowers and trees were planted and grass and scrubs took shape said mrs kanzetta burnell former student and principal of the public school which finally replaced the university but he taught us more important things than this most of the students were poor and the school had to get by on insufficient funds to offset some of this john cut the students hair repaired shoes and raised vegetables for our tables on part of the land when it became necessary that a new wing be added to the girls dormitory he went to topeka for additional funds and when it was granted he laid the brick with the help of the  young men after awhile no matter what one was looking for or what one wanted to know all inquiries led to the same answer see john walker  no wonder he is dear to the heart of this woman for it was john that brought her to the attention of dean alexander jones when she arrived to attend western in  desiring to complete my schooling she said i worked and saved for three years prior to my coming here at the end of those three years i had saved the unbelievable sum of  and some change with the encouragement of two friends who promised me free room and board near the school i mustered up the nerve to go out to western with trembling fingers i laid my seven dollars before the principal for a few minutes he was so shocked he couldnt speak then he said dear heart is this what you plan to pay your tuition with if so i must inform you that this wouldnt keep you here a week just when my knees felt as though they had turned to butter john walker appeared now dont you worry he told me hurrying off to find dean jones the dean then arranged tutoring jobs that enabled me to graduate with certificates for completion of high school normal school and one in domestic arts john watched these young men and women going out into every state to teach and become all sorts of leaders in their communities  this and with the schools background it seemed fitting to him thatif a monument to john brown were

tress past the window
the white chrysler  given him by his congregation bushnells first car with power steering and it handled beautifully a splen np l  i did token of recognition to commemorate ten smoothly running was dr years during which under his leadership the church mortgage had been burned the new car responded readily to his touch like the power of god he thought instantly available to all who call upon it dr bushnell remembered the first car he had driven it was sold for junk he remembered his first church and the stamping of feet on the rough oiled boards as the congregation filed in now his welldressed congregation glided in soundlessly reverently over the thick pile of carpeting he had a nice home too at his first church he and mary were treated like natives on a mission field their home furnished with handmedown odds and ends from the attics of all the church members he remembered how bravely mary thanked the ladies aid society for the living room curtains exactly what i would have chosen myself she said as trees flying past the window indicated speed so did fleeting recollections give dr bushnell a sense of progress a feeling that he had come a long way he did not relish the call he was to make now but the service of the lord sometimes includes distasteful details dr bushnell had always managed to dispose of them quickly and move on to more constructive things he could still see peter randolph redfaced as he came banging into the ministers study just before the morning service it was just like peter who once had the audacity the complete lack of taste to get up at a meeting of the deacons and offer to pay for a year of church bulletins in return for a  small commercial announcement on the bottom of page three then  when one of the deacons objected peter randolph went ahead goodnaturedly and donated the cost of a years church bulletins anyway no strings attached you had to respect a man like that it would have to be peter randolph who would come bursting into the ministers study others may have whispered anxiously to each other but only peter acted standing there feet well apart as though bracing himself for a fight peter demanded did you know there are two colored boys in the sunday school somehow the subtler points of religion had always been lost on peter but he was a loyal and hardworking member for all that a fine fund raiser they are gods children too dr bushnell pointed out gods children or not either you get them out of the sunday school or ill leave mr randolph threatened and dont think ill go alone when i go ill take half the congregation with me this church will be split apart as youve never seen it split before as shepherd i will protect my flock from harm dr bushnell replied when a lion threatened his fathers flocks young david rose up and slew the lion the comparison was a bit melodramatic dr bushnell realized why did peter have to get so excited everything could be handled simply its just a little detail ive smoothed out other awkward situations dr bushnell reminded him self as he turned his car off the main road and down a narrow lane hedged by a thick growth of untrimmed trees they made him think of other trees the tree in the garden of eden the great oak on whose branches the vain absaloms hair became entangled the fig tree that would not bear fruit and was cursed the tree from which the cross was hewn though near his church the area was unfamiliar to him and he slowed the car twice before he found haddock road a lean dog roused itself from the middle of the road as the car approached dr bushnell stopped in front of a shack just like a big box he thought he checked his watch placing his bible inconspicuously under one arm he started up a dirt path through a lawn that was mostly weeds then he paused retraced his steps and locked the car doors in front of the small house he hesitated a moment there was no doorbell and he wondered where to knock before he could decide a young negro woman opened the door for him her appearance slight and frail was somehow not at all what he had anticipated and he felt vaguely resentful at having been surprised reverend bushnell we did not expect you to visit us she said he sat on a chair and she sat on an upholstered crate opposite him she did the upholstering herself he thought and wondered if he should compliment her on her ingenuity he decided it was safer not to notice the furnishings he ran his fingers over the gilt edges of his bible there were marked passages in it he could read if the conversation became too awkward but most of all the worn wellread bible gave him something to do with his nervous restless hands your two boys have been at my sunday school he began and was surprised that his voice sounded sharp yes they liked it so much and they already have their memory work completed they told me  i am very glad to hear that they profited from their visit dr bushnell said at divinity school he had always gotten along well with the cook he was the one the other students picked to wheedle betweenthemeal snacks there was a formula for getting along with such people treat them very politely put them at ease and they will be forever grateful but this woman seemed already at ease and his courteous manner did not impress her the cook had averted her eyes from his this woman sat her slender body very straight her eyes focused directly on his incidentally how did you happen to send your boys to our sunday school he asked i dont know reverend bushnell i guess its just that its so close they can walk walk it seems a long way to walk much too far they should trips to the colored church with your boys and may god bless you the mother of the two boys sat motionless her face showing no expression he held the paper money out at arms length obviously the woman needed money badly the poorly furnished room was evidence of this surely she would soon lift one of those limp hands and accept it the whole room spun about the ten dollar bill was its vortex he did not mean to be waving the money in front of her nose but his hand was unsteady she did not stir i insist he said we will call it a scholarship a reward for the outstanding work your two fine sons have completed in our sunday school the woman shook her head slowly i cannot accept it rev bushnell i just couldnt cannot accept dr bushnell did not see how she could possibly refuse if your prefer instead of the money we could arrange for passes on the local bus the woman still shook her head dr bushnell had preached on false pride now he saw it before his eyes a woman who put her own pride before the needs of her children you should consider your boys he said their spiritual welfare i do she said i sent them to sunday school for a long moment dr bushnell could say nothing he searched his mind for some note of conciliation  i do admire your spirit he said finally and was surprised to realize that this was true for a horrible instant he had a fantastic image of himself standing up to peter randolph and saying i cannot accept your money he put his wallet away and fumbled for his bible let us close this meeting with a prayer he said it was his custom to pray before leaving any home a custom he had not broken for years this time the familiar words that had flowed forth freely so often simply did not come he saw himself as he must look to this woman the glimpse vanished and could not be recalled but suddenly it was desperately important to be understood he wanted to cry out im not what i seem to be he had to explain instead he found himself saying its later than i realized i have another call to make he was outside the door if there is anything i can ever do to help    he turned to say more but the door had closed he raised a fist to knock on the door to call back the moment his hand dropped he knew there was nothing he could say he walked to his car unlocked the door and slid into the seat his hands trembled at first on the wheel but as the new car sped away he had a sense of power and wellbeing while trees like sudden insights flashed past the window and were gone forever
the night of the senior ball
 graduation of course i remember  how i felt it was thirty years ago ive made thirty million dollars since then but graduating from highschool is the big one sonny and i remember it all there is something tragic and magnificent about a highschool graduation do you know that youth balancing upon the brink of the abyss of maturity all of them eager some of them afraid and you and i know that growing up is a hard scuffle at best and the ones who will acquire all of the lovely and beautiful things that they have always dreamed about will be few and oh god you want to warn them just because you are older and watching them is like reliving ancient pain do you remember when the old folks tried to tell us but living is a substance that must be handled daily and alone and none of us ever realize how heroic we have been    did you ever lay down your life flat and try to see the entire flatness with the little hills of pain and love and pleasure and joy buttoning it all together seeing it with wonder and a funny kind of amused dismay you think why did i ever want this so badly and how did i ever stand up under that but you did and you face the rest of it quietly a bit warily with your inner emotions more firmly established but i digress you are not interested in my philosophical whimseys  you were sent up here to ask me what i remembered about my own graduation graduation it was we had had our picnic we had been given our legal cut day we had paid our dues we wandered about look ing nonchalant we clad in somber robes and wearing clipboard caps formed that fantastic line and walked forth into the lighted ritual of graduation night and afterward we had our ball when i got out of college i was a man grown with four years of hard work behind me both in the social and the academic fields and i was merely impatient to go on with what i had started but when i was seventeen it was all so new do you know what i mean i was new gallant shining cleareyed neither my body nor my soul had picked up fat i was a boy wonder my god i was on the board of control i was a rally boy i was busy with track and a little baseball i knew the pretty girls i was the boy that one reads about in adolescent novels i remember feeling very very capable and it was easy to move about in those days i felt in control of everything i never gave war and panic and death a thought my world was limited you see and my parents happily married    the senior ball the girls who looked so different in their flimsy gowns with their hair all up and their ears all decorated and those delicate slippers on their feet the boys on their best behavior in bladelike black and starched white with slickered hair and new watchbands gleaming the feel of the evening air and the lights and the muted music and the sound of frailly slender smelling of soap and appleblossoms we danced so formally i could hear the voices i could feel the eyes i had brought something to life in the room and when cora and i finished dancing i knew that this act was an impetus there was nothing that i could not do    when i call my wife and tell her that i will not be home for dinner on our anniversary or if i must manipulate the market a bit in order to sweeten a stock or if i intend to enrage the president of the united states or if i thumbdown a twentymillion dollar deal well then i simply recall that intimate important lovely occurrence and i realize that nothing in this world has ever proved to be as difficult to perform as the dance that i danced with cora cora herself why shes a writer she has six great strapping sons you fool dont you realize that it took just as much guts for her to get up and dance with me 
do american negroes have what africa needs
slnce world war ii there has been much talk about the  contributions which american negroes could or might make to the social development of africa this is natural since though american negroes were stripped of their african cultural heritage and have become a biologically mixed group the fact of their african origin has not been erased from their minds american negroes have been sent to africa as missionaries especially by negro churches to help in the christianization of the african moreover negro religious organizations have established and helped to support schools in africa many of the africans who have come to the united states to receive an education have studied in negro schools in fact two of the outstanding african leaderskwame nkrumah and nnamdi azikiwereceived most of their advanced education in negro institutions in the united states more recently american negroes have been sent to africa by the american government as technical assistants and as members of commissions concerned with economic and social reconstruction in africa nevertheless much of the talk about the contributions of american negroes to the development of africa rests upon sentimental grounds or represents a type of wishful thinking it is for this reason that i shall undertake a critical analysis and an evaluation of the potential contributions which american negroes could or might make to the social development of africa i let us begin with the contributions which american negroes could or might make within the general field of economics the various territories of africa like the other nonindustrialized countries of the world need capital in order to lay the foundation for modern states in order to secure the necessary capital africa must turn to the industrialized european nations or to the united nations if a fund is ever set up to aid the industrialization of the noneuropean areas of the world to what extent one may ask are the american negroes able to provide any capital for the development of africa the answer is negative and the reasons why this is true are clear the negroes of the united states are poor and they do not occupy positions of influence in the financial institutions which could supply the capital which africa needs during the past decade or so there has been much fanfare about the economic wellbeing of american negroes and the wealth which they have accumulated but upon examination it turns out that the claim that negroes are economically welloff or have accumulated wealth is a myth cherished by negroes and fostered as a part of the propaganda designed to show that negroes have not fared badly in the united states only during the past two decades has a class of negroes emerged in the united states with incomes sufficient to maintain middle class standards of living the new negro middle class is composed almost entirely of professional and technical workers who are selfemployed or salaried whitecollar workers and the more highly paid skilled workers this class includes also a sprinkling of persons engaged for the most part in small businesses in the south about an eighth of the negro population is able to maintain middle class standards while in the north and west where negroes enjoy greater economic and social freedom a fourth of the negro population can be included in the middle class although in the north the average income of negroes is  per cent higher than the average income of negroes in the south their average income in the north is only twothirds that of whites moreover negro business enterprises both in the north and in the south are on the whole oneman businesses conducted with a small amount of capital in fact negro businesses are no more important in the american economy and to the employment and income of negroes than they were in  when the myth of negro business as a means to economic and social salvation was institutionalized in the national negro business league negroes are neither captains of industry nor holders of any important positions in the management of the industrial and the financial institutions in the united states they are not even owners of stocks and bonds of the great american enterprises therefore negroes as a group are poor and unable to provide africa with the capital which is needed there although all this is true it still may be asked can american negroes provide the managerial ability and the technical skills which africa needs in building a modem economy the answer to this question has been partly given in what was said about the negros position in the american economy the managerial experience of negroes has been limited almost entirely to small negro businesses this experience has been narrow and restricted even in the largest negro enterprises the negro insurance companies and negro newspapers at the present time negroes are beginning to get some experience for example in the sales division of corporations which manufacture and distribute cigarettes and whiskey but this experience has been too brief and restricted to make any contribution to the problem of management which africans are facing in assuming control of their economical life in fact the africans themselves have gained a larger experience with their marketing boards and cooperatives on the west coast of africa than american negroes have had in their small businesses with reference to technical skill the answer to the question posed above requires more attention especially if scientific methods of agriculture are included in technical skills american negroes have been engaged in teaching scientific methods of agriculture in some parts of africa they have succeeded very well in making available to africans new techniques of agriculture and in helping africans to solve some of their agricultural problems on the other hand their contribution in providing and teaching industrial skills has not been of much consequence there are a number of reasons for this first american negroes have only recently begun to acquire technical skills required by modern industry they have been excluded from working in many industries from becoming members of the labor unions and from attending technical schools where they could acquire technical skills for example even today negroes do not have access to any technical schoofs in the south comparable to those provided for whites moreover negroes are as completely excluded from working in the textile industry in the south today as they were when the textile industry was first established in the south in fact in tropical africa the africans are employed in more of the skilled occupations than negroes are in the united states in the united states there are practically no negroes employed as engineers conductors and brakemen on trains and the employment of negroes as firemen on locomotives has been increasingly restricted it is a rare sight to see a negro employed as a telegrapher in the united states it appears therefore that during the process of industrialization of africa africans have outstripped the american negro in the acquisition of industrial skills ii we turn next to consider the contributions which american negroes may make to the political development of africa here again one must evaluate the potential contribution of american negroes in terms of their knowledge experience and skills despite the fact that negroes have lived in a socalled democratic society their experience with political matters has been extremely limited during the short reconstruction period in the south negroes gained considerable experience from participation in politics and produced some astute political leaders twentytwo negro congressmen and two senators were elected to the congress of the united states but after less than a decade of participation in southern politics negroes were largely eliminated from politics and beginning in  they were completely disfranchised participation on the part of negroes in american politics was not resumed on a large scale until after the mass migrations to northern cities during and following the first world war as the result of the new political position of negroes in the north there are three negro members of the national congress not to mention the negro judges members of city councils and northern state legislatures moreover since the supreme court of the united states has outlawed the white democratic primary in the south the number of registered negro voters has more than doubled during the past decade primarily however in the nonplantation areas even during their greatest participation in american politics negroes did not sit in the highest councils of the nation where policies are determined booker t washington was consulted by the presidents and other high officials of the united states but this was a sort of system of indirect rule since the negroes were politically disfranchised even under the new deal when many negroes were brought into the government they were simply advisers to whites who formulated the policies concerning negroes even today when negroes are playing an increasingly important role in politics especially in northern cities they do not occupy seats in the highest councils of the nation thus it becomes clear that american negroes do not have the experience and contacts which the african members of the french parliament have what is even more important is that american negroes have not had the experience of africans in those territories where africans have struggled to gain political power moreover american negroes have never had to assume the responsibilities which west african leaders are assuming as heads of new states the lack of education in political leadership has been due to the fact that negroes have been segregated in american life and have lacked real political power negroes have been regarded and treated as wards of the nation sometimes under the control of private philanthropic organizations and at other times under governmental agencies most of their political activities have been within the segregated negro communities and in such institutions and associations as the independent negro church organizations and the fraternal organizations as negroes have migrated to the cities of the north and have begun to participate in the political life of the american community they have become a part of the political machines which are dominated by white politicians thus they have become very adept in the devious ways of local politics in the united states but this experience has not prepared them for the statesmanship which is needed in africa today moreover negroes lack any political philosophy except a narrow opportunism which is more or less effective in local situations where they exercise a limited power this will be considered in more detail in the next section where the question of the contribution of intellectual leadership by american negroes to the social development of africa will be analyzed ill under the heading of intellectual leadership we shall consider american negroes with professional and scientific training as well as leaders of thought in the arts philosophy and the social sciences in dealing with this subject it is necessary to consider first the nature of the education of the socalled intellectual class after emancipation was the result of missionary efforts on the part of whites principally from new england who were fired by an idealistic faith in the intellectual capacity of negroes they met with stubborn opposition on the part of southern whites but through the support of northern philanthropy which represented the triumphant industrial capitalism of the north they were able to carry on their work northern philanthropy was not however inspired by the same idealistic fervor which inspired many of the missionaries who set up schools for negroes in the south they were more concerned with coming to terms with southern whites and having a peaceful environment for their investments within the ranks of the whites who were interested in the education of negroes there developed a sharp cleavage between those who advocated industrial education and those who stood for higher education for the negro the conflict between the two schools of thought was not simply over the question of negro education the conflict went deeper because it was really concerned with conflicting ideas over the status of the negro in the new south booker t washington who built tuskegee institute and became the chief proponent of industrial education was supported by most of the white philanthropists of the north the program of industrial education for negroes involved much more than technical education as a matter of fact the socalled industrial education of negroes was never designed to equip them to compete with white workers in the industrial south the opposition of w e b du bois the foremost champion of the  higher education of negroes to the socalled industrial education of the negro was based upon the fact that this industrial education was only a symbolic expression of a policy of racial segregation and subordination of the negro in the south negro schools that continued to offer higher education were generally denied support by northern white philanthropists and foundations until the second decade of the twentieth century when the northward migration of negroes changed their relation to american life nevertheless the majority of negro intellectuals received their college education in the negro schools that were devoted to higher education this is still largely true despite the increasing numbers of negroes who are attending colleges and universities in the north the fact that the majority of negro intellectuals have received their college education in the segregated schools of the south has not failed to leave its mark upon the outlook of negro intellectuals it is only since negroes have been attending northern colleges and universities in large numbers that they have acquired the type of scientific knowledge and professional competence that could be of service in the social development of africa for example one highly trained american negro in the field of tropical medicine dr hildrus poindexter has rendered distinguished service in africa but the number of such trained men is smaller than africans of similar training then too american negroes with firstrate scientific training are being utilized by the united states besides being academically inferior to the colleges and universities of the north the segregated negro college has been dominated by a narrow religious tradition and a puritanical outlook that have restricted the intellectual development of negroes moreover these schools have tended to foster a type of respectability and snobbishness that has alienated negro intellectuals from the masses the emphasis has been upon the uncritical imitation of white standards of behavior and the surviving values of the slaveholding aristocracy and more recently upon the values of the white middle classes however since the negro intellectuals are rejected by the white middle classes and are forced to share many of the disabilities of the negro masses they have developed an ambivalent attitude towards negroes even negro intellectuals who have received a broader education in the north and have gained a more cosmopolitan outlook exhibit the same ambivalent attitude towards negroes in the united states and towards africans negro intellectuals are extremely sensitive to any disparagement of negroes or africans but on the other hand they are eager to claim that they themselves are not africans or negroes but americans they place great value upon being accepted by white americans especially when the latter claim that they are unconscious that negro intellectuals are negroes or of african origin the ambivalence of the negro intellectual is intensified by the fact that a large proportion of them are of mixed blood and enjoy passing for white or being accepted as nearwhite during the negro renaissance in the s it appeared that negro intellectuals had achieved a new orientation towards their negro or african origin the negro renaissance was supposed to hail the emergence of the new negro in the literary and artistic creations of negro artists and intellectuals the new negro was new in the sense that he accepted his racial identification without apologies that he accepted the culture of the negro folk in the united states and that he faced the world with the confidence that the negro or african had the right to a role in creating a new world but as the new negro and negro intellectual were swallowed up by the new middle classes which were growing in size and importance the new orientation of the negro was lost and negro intellectuals sought only acceptance by the white world the ambivalent attitude of negro intellectuals and artists towards their negro or african background is revealed by the question which they constantly pose for themselves should the negro scientists or scholar study the negro should the negro write novels or short stories about negroes should negro painters use negro subjects after all is there any such person as a negro poet or painter generally the answers to these questions are in the negative and negro writers and artists generally protest that they are only american writers and artists and that they have no special concern with negroes there are a few exceptions of course such as langston hughes and richard wright as a result on the whole the negro intellectual and artist is sterilized by the dilemma in which he finds himself by cutting himself off from his negro or african background the negro intellectuals in the united states have never developed a philosophy as to the meaning of human existence or a social philosophy concerning the world they have naturally rejected the philosophy of resignation and submission implicit in the spirituals of the negro folk but they have failed to develop any new philosophy or meaning of existence this has been due partly to the inferior education of negro intellectuals and partly to their mental and social isolation in american life they are touched only in a superficial way by the philosophical currents in the modern world these various philosophies and schools of thought which stir men in the modem world have little or no meaning for the negro intellectual who lives in a world where the exigencies of daily living absorb his energies negro intellectuals have developed a crude philosophy of opportunism which seems to satisfy their segregated existence in the white mans world they seem to have scarcely reflected upon the great revolution which is occurring in the modem world except as it may affect their social status in the united states when one african intellectual was asked what he thought of a group of american negro intellectuals he answered that he thought they were asleep iv we come finally to the question what spiritual or moral leadership can american negroes provide africans or what cultural contributions can they make to the social development of africa the answer to this question is crucial because it conditions the possibility and quality of all other contributions any contribution which american negroes may make in the field of economics or politics is conditioned by their orientation in regard to the changes which are occurring in the modem world likewise any intellectual or professional leadership which they might provide africans is conditioned by their own interests and identification with certain systems of values it is for this reason that in our attempt to answer the questions proposed above we come to the heart of the subject of the possible contribution of american negroes to the social development of africa at the outset it was pointed out that although american negroes had been stripped of their african cultural heritage and had become a biologically mixed group the fact of their african origin had never been erased from their minds the latter part of this statement needs to be qualified for two reasons first it implies that historical memories of africa have been transmitted in the traditions of negroes and their families but this is not true the meaning intended here is that the negro has never been permitted to forget his african origin this leads us to the second reason why this statement at the beginning needs qualification one must take into account the manner in which the fact of their african origin has been communicated to negroes the first fact of importance in the heritage of the american negro is that he has never been taken seriously he has been treated as member of a child race this has been evident not only in american literature but in serious studies of negroes since as it is said negroes are a childlike race they have been shunted from the main currents of american life even the education that was provided them except as we have seen that of some idealistic missionaries was designed for an inferior human being these conditions have influenced the character of american negroes they have not been permitted to become dignified human beings and in the south especially they were expected to play the role of a fool or clown the whites would tolerate them only in this role and negroes played this role in order to surviveone might even go so far as to say that in the united states especially in the south there has been a process of dysgenesic selection from the standpoint of character building the negro who was dignified and courageous and possessed integrity was eliminated in favor of the negro who was sly cowardly and clownish foreign observers and some more thoughtful white americans who did not expect negroes to play clownish and childish roles have been puzzled by the playfulness and immaturity of negroes they have often contrasted the dignified and mature behavior of africans with the immature and childish behavior of american negroes how then would one expect american negroes to contribute to the spiritual or moral development of africans the truth of the matter is that american negroes have never been free physically or psychologically despite all the fanfare over the new status of negroes in american life they are still far from enjoying the freedom which other americans enjoy in the united states it is not necessary to recount all the limitations upon their freedom in the south where they are still segregated and where they are still the objects of physical violence there is an even more important lack of freedom  which affects the contribution of american negroes to the social development of africa i refer to the lack of intellectual or spiritual freedom the schooling negroes have received in american civilization has prevented them from developing the spiritual freedom that would enable them to contribute to the social development of africans the entire separate institutional life under which negroes have lived has discouraged or prevented the development of a free and independent spiritual life the intellectual leaders of the negroes as i have pointed out have been the beneficiaries of the philanthropy of the whites but there have been other important reasons which have discouraged a free and independent spirit the two chief separate institutions in the negro community the church and the school have been organized on an authoritarian basis even the baptist churches with their local autonomy have been dominated by strong leaders of groups that have permitted little selfdirection and selfexpression on the part of their members the methodist churches with their hierarchical organizations have been dominated by bishops who were more autocratic than the russian czars the negro colleges have likewise been dominated by presidents who were backed by the absolute authority of the white community or by the autocratic authority of negro church leaders the rise of the new negro middle classes to power and importance has brought into sharp relief the conflict and confusion which result from the anomalous position of negroes in american society and seriously limit the possibility of contributions by american negroes to the social  development of africa the new negro middle classes as we have already seen have a small stake in the american economy this class is composed of salaried white collar workers and professionals nevertheless the new negro middle classes have taken over the values of the wealthy white propertied classes in the united states they indulge in all forms of conspicuous consumptionexpensive homes and automobiles and luxurious forms of entertainmentall beyond their economic resources the negro press which provides a mirror of the outlook and values of the new negro middle classes has helped to create the world of makebelieve in which the middle class seeks to escape from its feeling of inferiority this feeling of inferiority is intensified because of their attempt to make themselves over into the image of whites by insisting that they are only americans while rejecting identification with negroes or africans although the negro middle classes would not openly admit their rejection of negro or african identification it is nevertheless true it was revealed for example when the editor of a leading negro newspaper stated patronizingly that negroes could now be proud of africa since ghana had become free it is also revealed when all other ethnic and racial groups in the united states on parade identify themselves with their racial or ethnic backgrounds through dress insignia etc but american negroes object to a comparable identification as negroes or as descendants of africans thus by insisting upon being only americans they become nobody there are reasons of course why american negroes insist upon being considered only americans some of these reasons have been suggested in the discussion so far we have seen for example the manner in which the negro or african has been represented in america moreover the important fact can not be overlooked that negroes in american society are a sort of ethnic wastebasket into which all persons who are not white and have no other racial or ethnic identification are dumped the census report of the united states has a category nonwhite into which all persons who are not white are placed american negroes who are largely a mixed race constitute about  per cent of this negatively designated group but instead of seeking a positive identification in the traditional culture of the negro folk in the united states or in their african origin the middle classes seek to escape from their negative identification by becoming pure american the middle class intellectuals can not deceive themselves so easily as the middle classes generally therefore they exhibit considerable ambivalence in coming to terms with the world about them we have already noted how the ambivalence of the american negro has tended to sterilize him as a thinker and as an artist it is interesting to note in this connection that it is more often the white man than the negro who digs up the negros past and interprets the negros experience in the united states in a new frame of reference or in a new artistic dimension on the other hand as the result of his psychological and social isolation and his acceptance of the smugness and cheap values of the middle classes american negro intellectuals and artists seem to be ignorant or unconscious of the cultural problems which concern artists and intellectuals in the modem world they have become mere parrots or phonograph records repeating the ideas of reactionary and conservative white people there are rare exceptions like w e b du bois and paul robeson but they are considered dangerous by white people therefore middle class negroes regard them as dangerous africa is demanding an intellectual and spiritual leadership that has caught a vision of a new worlda world freed from racism colonialism and human exploitation but the new negro middle classes in the united states appear only to seek an opportunity to share in the exploitation from which they have been excluded and continue to be excluded except on an insignificant scale therefore it becomes evident that the aims and aspirations of africans in creating a new world can not be limited by the narrow aims and aspirations of the leaders of american negroes who are merely seeking acceptance in the white mans world as it is the american negro is willing to pay the terrific price of the most servile conformity to the ideas and values of white americans in order to be accepted by them but of course there is no assurance that negroes will be completely accepted in american society even if they conform with every new advance they make towards integration into american society they feel more keenly the frustration and insecurity which result from incomplete acceptance and restricted social mobility it is conceivable that in an attempt to escape from their frustration and the emptiness which they experience upon the attainment of middle class status they will turn to africa for spiritual and cultural roots the publication of this volume might be interpreted as evidence of a new orientation towards africa however there are economic and social forces which are transforming american society and the negros relation to it and which render this unlikely the integration of the negro into american society results in the increasing disintegration of the negro community and its institutions thus the very basis of a really effective cultural awakening in which negroes would find identification with africans is being destroyed an increasing number of american negroes may go to africa as advisers and specialists but they will go as americans representing american interests not african interests in fact there is  evidence that middle class negroes in such positions are deriving great satisfaction from what they regard as a new status and acceptance in american society conclusion in concluding this essay i shall attempt to bring together the main points i have attempted to formulate in analyzing the factors involved in a realistic appraisal of the possible contributions of american negroes to the social development of africa first it seems clear that american negroes can not make any contribution to the economic development of africa because they lack the necessary capital and do not have positions of influence in the large financial institutions that could provide capital american negroes lack the managerial experience and skills needed in the modernization of the african economy moreover american negroes are only beginning to acquire the technical skills required in modem industry a fact which places them behind the africans in those industries dependent almost entirely upon skilled african workers likewise in the field of politics american negroes have scarcely anything to contribute to africans who have a long experience of political struggle and are assuming positions of responsibility not open to negroes in the united states but can american negroes make a contribution in the field of intellectual and professional leadership here again if one looks at the facts of the situation one must conclude that american negro intellectuals have been limited in their education and in their general outlook and therefore they have nothing to contribute to the intellectual leadership needed in the development of africa although some prefessionally trained american negroes could offer a type of knowledge which africa needs they are needed in the united states where there is an increasing demand for their skills and services the limitations of american negro intellectuals and professionals become apparent when one considers them from the standpoint of their possible contribution to the spiritual and cultural needs of africa their general outlook is dominated by the provincial and spurious values of the new negro middle classes they live in a world of makebelieve and reject identification with the cultural traditions of american negroes as well as with their african origin they seek acceptance by white americans at the price of losing all their racial and cultural identity and of being swallowed up in white america their attitude towards the future is that of the gladiators and slaves in the roman arena who cried hail caesar we who are about to die salute you on the other hand the african has a future in this world and has a place in shaping a new world as an african
perhaps dr e franky lin fraziers position  that there is nothing  of importance which american negroes can contribute to social development in africa can be attributed to his genuine concern for africa and his chagrin that american negroes cannot contribute more be that as it may his paper while serving to bring the claims of the overzealous into focus represents a considerable overstatement of his case inadvertently it also gives support to those officials in america who for so long refused to use negroes in the foreign missions of the united states on the grounds that negroes had nothing to contribute it is true as frazier says that negroes in america are not a major source of investment either in terms of the management or possession of large amounts of capital the fact is however that one of the major sources of capital in america for investment both at home and abroad is the united states government negroes who have considerable political power in the election of the president in the united states can certainly expect that government capital will flow to the countries of their origin just as it has flowed to the countries from which other americans originated provided the national interest of the united states is involved    there is moreover a growing though small negro experience in big corporations in america in the new york area alone one can name negroes who hold important positions with the leading corporations in the fields of electronics communications atomic physics chemistry mathematics publishing investment drugs engineering of many types etc the united states has changed more rapidly than frazier has realized moreover it cannot be said that such men as bunche hastie wilkins white brown weaver lloyd knox aggrey dawson wharton and wright are without political skills of a high order it should be remembered that another social scientist said in his an american dilemma  that he was impressed with the political and diplomatic skills of a considerable number of trained negroes whom he met in the united states he specifically said that america was wasting a good amount of talent by not utilizing such skills in its government service and specifically in its diplomatic service in spite of what frazier says the negro college in america has produced its share of distinguished intellectuals although white northern schools have taken only those negroes with the highest secondary achievement who in addition had the resources to pay for expensive education the negro colleges have produced more negro scholars than white northern institutions frazier himself a leading american human ecologist and a past president of the american sociological association received his ab from howard university poindexter re ceived his undergraduate degree from lincoln university other distinguished scholars from similar origins include john hope franklin abram l harris kenneth clark horace mann bond leroy williams william fontaine and a host of others some of whom can be noted in the biographical data provided in this volume what is more important is that these negro colleges have produced practically all of the fighting and effective negro leadership in america w e b dubois walter white thurgood marshall robert l carter martin_luther_king ben azikiwe kwame nkrumah to name only a few frazier is of the opinion that american negro artists and writers generally protest that they are only american writers and have no special concern with negroes without exception all of the important american negro writers and artists are greatly concerned with negroes an attitude which frazier also quixotically objects to as for example augusta savage richmond barthe langston hughes richard wright ama bontemps claude mckay sterling brown bruce wright gwendolyn brooks saunders redding james baldwin ralph ellison w e b du bois ann petry and chester himes in sculpture painting poetry the novel and the essay these artists have told all humanity what it means to live under a caste system because one is black two other assertions of frazier deserve comment his statement that american negroes are of mixed descent and therefore not negroes ignores the reality of being a negro in america as well as the obvious negroid appearance of practically all negroamericans it also assumes that all the mixing occurred in america and not any of it in africa his position that american negroes have no expertness to give africa has already been refuted we have already sent engineers dieticians doctors teachers economists sociologists accountants public administrators parisitologists atomic scientists and other experts not only to africa and southeast asia but on occasion even to europe in this volume dr poindexters careful description of the nature and cause of tropical diseases and delineation of the methods of treatment and control are in part an answer to dr fraziers contention dr poindexter has served the people of the world in africa and southeast asia and is at present serving them in latin america e franklin frazier is a distinguished american sociologist but his position in this volume is certainly more personal opinion than it is objective science since there is no paper in this issue that gives a different view of the picture frazier presents i have used a portion of this introduction to challenge him
similar sociological changes between the two world wars was the presence of the automobile industry the early negro migrants from the south had been among the first ford employees and they had made good use of their aday and upwards wages at a time when that much money seemed lucrative to other workers they bought homes and property started businesses and most important educated their children there existed in detroit then a very large group of educated negroes with an appetite for the cultural contacts which were not always open to them they early took up the practice of journeying to less restricted citiessuch as montreal and new yorkto enjoy facilities closed to them at home and more important they began to create within their own community the climate of culture for which they hungered the communitys reputation for refinement spread over the nation in the years before and after world war ii detroit attracted an uncommon number of brilliant and talented young people who together with the nativebred raised the level of civic political and social awareness to a level unmatched by any other major city many of these young people now occupy positions of local state and national authority posts they were more than ready to fill when the barriers finally fell locally they include damon keith william patrick and broadus n butler statewide they include otis smith and wade mccree and nationally they include hobart taylor jr charles wartman and eddie sylvester racial separation remainsfar too frequentlyan integral part of the detroit scene and therefore it is not very surprising that a white reporter writing for a white magazine did not bother to look outside the establishment for evidence of cultural activity and leadership this is an inescapable aspect of the racial realities and yet by any objective standards it is apparent that there is an extraordinary level of cultural activity and awareness in the detroit negro community on page  there appear three photographs of detroiters whoover the past  yearshave figured importantly in the cultural development of the community they are top to bottom  dr broadus n butler assistant dean of the college of liberal arts wayne state university and chairman of the research committee of the association for the study of negro life and history nellie watts retired schoolteacher and founder of the nellie watts concert series and the patrons of the arts and the late fred hart williams initiator of the e azalea hackley memorial collection in the main library and a mainspring of cultural interest until his death in  in the following pages a general survey of the arts in detroitpast and presentwill shed some light on some of the principal organizations activities and individuals who make the pursuit of art and excellence a vital part of life in detroit art in terms of ascendancy painting is the newest of the arts in detroit in the old days of course there were painters of talent and some renown but none ever attained the repute and possibly the technical brilliance of the current crop of artists fifty years ago there were no leroy mitchells ernest hardmans or leroy fosters no arts extended group nor any plans to build a  permanent gallery and studio as the contemporary studio group is determined to do by  paintings rise to preeminence may be said to have begun with the old pen and palette art club which flourished under john dancys patronage at the urban league back in the forties most of the painters in this group were quite young then and some of them are stilunder  perhaps the most representative artist of this group is henri king a driving force of the dynamic contemporary studio and director of the groups gallery one of the most outstanding artists of that period was myrtle hall who doubled as star model at both cranbrook academy and the society of arts and crafts after winning prizes and considerable acclaim mrs hall deserted painting for ceramics in the late forties and now is one of the most accomplished ceramists in the midwest her studio and workshop on erskine are among the most professional in the city some of the former members of the old pen and palette art club reorganized as the arts extended groupe in the late forties among them were mrs hall architectpainter rodney warren teacherpainters charles and leverne finger mae morris alice lightfoot james wilson cledie taylor and richard kenny in  the group opened a studiogallery on warren just east of woodward in the heart of the rapidly expanding university center it marked the first time a local group of negro artists had undertaken the task of maintaining a gallery the group had been holding regular exhibitions in such places as the federated womens clubhouse but now it had its own center in due course classes were added and a sustained effort was made to interest the community at large in the artists work the gallery flourished with immediate beneficial results one of which was the organization of the second negrooperated gallery it was perhaps inevitable that the success of the arts extended groupes gallery would lead to the opening of at least another one in the first place there were far too many exceptional artists to be absorbed as members in the arts extended groupe and in the second place the first gallery was too small to service all the artists who deserved exposure and now were sure to demand it in  henri king and harold neal conceived the idea of the contemporary studio becausein kings wordsit was felt that detroit had no cohesive art movement headquarters or location offering unlimited opportunity for local artists to show their work meet the public and gain recognition the  artists who met to draw up plans for the studio included some of the bestknown and most talented detroit artists names long familiar to art patrons and connoisseurs these included leroy foster charles mcgee and ernest hardman all veterans of the annual michigan artists exhibitions at art institute and all former students at the highly respected society of arts and crafts the group leased a secondfloor fiveroom flat on the john c lodge expressway and converted the apartment into a studiogallery in the succeeding four years more than  shows have been held at the gallery along with art auctions art discussion programs art classes and seminars all the detroit newspapers and critics have heaped praise on the group and its work and the visitors to the gallery have included persons from europe africa and south america the contemporary studio currently is searching for larger quarters in order to expand its program and provide more exhibition space the advent of this group signaled the beginning of a revolutionary era for art in detroit the detroit negro artist with farthest reaching famehughie leesmithis a detroiter only during the summers now having moved his permanent address to the washington square neighborhood of new yorks greenwich village several years ago leesmith a painter of surpassing grace and lyricism remains the darling of art enthusiasts in the wealthy suburbs and he returns each season to teach in bloomfield hills and birmingham during the past summer leesmiths star pupil was mrs henry ford ii wife of the auto magnate and the one cultural leader singled out by show magazines chronicler of the detroit cultural scene prior to his departure to new york leesmith maintained his own studio and was one of the few local artists of any race who earned a living solely from his work like leesmith painter leroy foster supports himself through his art foster is a brilliant portraitist and one of several artists who have studied abroadat the academie de la grande chaumiere in paris and at the heatherly school of art in london he has won four prizes in the annual art institute competition and sold more than  paintings in the past  years no mention of art in detroit would be complete unless the names of sarkis sarkisian and guy palozzola were included for these  two excellent artists exerted great influence on most detroit negro artists indeed only a few of the topranking artists did not study under sarkisian and palozzola at the society of arts and crafts theater the local theatrical tradition is closely allied with the musical arts which have a very long history in detroit two uncles of the late fred hart williams back in the s regularly held amateur and professional shows in the old merrill hall fred hart ball one of these enterprising gentlemen also was the grandfather of herb jeffries the detroitborn balladeer such oldtime favorites as sisseretta black patti jones and zoe ball fred hart williams aunt enlivened the local theatrical scene with their performances in creole belles some time later from the sarnia area richard harrison emerged as an actor of power and he eventually won immortality as de lawd in marc connellys allegory green pastures in the thirties and forties a series of paradise valleycentered theatrical groups briefly flourished and then perished some of them succeeding in inspiring local actors to go on to new york or hollywood of these perhaps bill walker is the best known after world war ii the paul robeson theatre group provided a showcase for young people of talent it was succeeded by the detroit actors guild which was sparked by alma forrest parks one of the several anna lucastas and a youthful veteran of the old american negro theatre in harlem the actress came to detroit as the bride of singer benjamin parks from this group anna whitsitt english went on to broadway as the saucy zarita in langston hughes simply heavenly perhaps the most successful product of local theatre is lloyd richards the actordirector who is a teacher at the paul mann workshop in new york and the director of a raisin in the sun like richards walter mason and karl farrar received early training with the wayne state university theatre and went on to roles in the professional theatre in new york although there have been the usual number of small theatre groups in the fifties and early sixties the new emphasis on raciallyintegrated theatrical groupssuch as the unstabled make it unlikely that negro theatre as such will achieve much more of a record in the future than it did in the past while none of the local theatrical groups racked up any outstanding accomplishment a detroit playwright scored great personal success in the forties demonstrating more guts and ability than any local writer before him and since arthur coar both wrote and produced two plays which drew nearcapacity audiences to the art institute auditorium the first dual flame which also was the better of the two remains a challenge for young playwrights of the present or future in young ron milner winner of a john hay whitney fellowship and woodie king jr there is considerable promise milners life agony recently was performed before a coffee house audience by actors sylvia king and woodie king jr the dance as is true with the theatre the dance was always closely tied to music in detroit and perhaps subordinated to it detroit has produced no great dancers in the mold of dunham or primus or ailey but it consistently develops extraordinarily good ones scores of exceptional dancers have been turned out under the aegis of laclair knox the dance teacher who was responsible for much of the vitality of the old delta sigma theta jabberwock extravaganzas under the direction of gladys mills johnson and clem mills mrs knoxs school still holds its own in competition with the schools of such relative newcomers as joe ziggy johnson and toni lewis the beautiful clemons sisters gained brief fame in the fifties but the most successful detroit dancer is eddie robinson a former dunham dancer who now operates a school in paris and trains stars for movie and tv roles bernard johnson who was discovered by josephine baker on the fox theatre stage works on broadway and clifford fears is in las vegas and hollywood the two dancers now holding local laurels are vera embree and jimi hunt the latter a dunham alumnus who also works in ceramics literature the literary scene in the detroit negro community is at its brightest currently a total of three john hay whitney fellowship winners are working on projects and generally generating literary enthusiasm the youngest of the three yearold ron milner has produced a play life agony and is writing a novel rogie clark who is a music teacher and folklorist as well as a writer is polishing a series of articles on negro folklore margaret danner a chicagoan transplanted to detroit is in the process of publishing her first book of poems the resurgence of local literary interest has had the effect of arousing to action poet dudley randall poetscuptor oliver legrone and playwright arthur coar the renaissance also has  turned the spotlight on poet edward simpkins poethistorian harold lawrence and the previously mentioned woodie king jr for many years in detroit the mainspring of creative writing was fred hart williams the genial and lovable community leader who contributed so much to the citys cultural life williams concentrated his efforts on negro history and over the years wrote for every local negro newspaper and for many white dailies throughout michigan when williams died in  detroit lost a great and beloved leader but fortunately he left behind a fully capable heir the mantle of leadership fell to dr broadus n butler who has indicated that he might undertake to complete the book on the history of negroes in detroit which williams left unpublished this fall appropriately under the direction of dr butler detroit writers will be represented in a special issue of the negro history bulletin dedicated to the memory of fred hart williams sculpture one of the most promising of detroits sculptors abandoned her studies in midcareer and focused her energies on the one of her several talents which most interested her florence pate sampson a poet actress and singer as well as sculptor gave up all her other interests for concert singing a pursuit she shares with her pianist composer husband leroy however several of mrs sampsons worksincluding the stunning yom and the poetic les enfantsremain highpoints in creativity the exquisite work of cledie taylor deserves far more attention than it has ever received possibly because her sculpture has taken a back seat to her jewelry oliver legrone fashioned busts of great power during his most creative period at the same time incidentally that his first book of poems was published locally of the current sculptors perhaps the two most prominent are robert weil and oscar graves weil a member of the arts extended groupe is a former john hay whitney fellow and a winner of the albert kahn prize in the annual michigan artists exhibition he is a sculpture instructor at michigan state university at lansing graves a member of the contemporary studio studied at the famed cranbrook academy in bloomfield hills and at wayne state university he has been employed for the past eight years with marshall fredericks the internationally known sculptor and producer of the spirit of detroit sculpture adorning the citycounty building and the opening page of this feature music if painting can be said to be the newest of the creative arts in detroit then music must be termed the oldest in the years when slavery still was an accepted institution in the south music played an important cultural role in the life of the detroit negro community the lambert family one of the citys first negro families made musical performances the principal form of entertainment during the prewar social functions the family sponsored in later years henry and fred hart ball made their barber shop at gratiot and beaubien the center of musical interest and activity they sponsored amateur and professional musical events in the old merrill hall and played hosts to visiting minstrels the most important musical performers of that period the names of zoe ball and sisseretta jones already have been mentioned and these singers were followed by e azalea hackley and the worldfamous maggie porter coles the advent of the automobile revolutionized the total structure of detroit life in the years before world war i and correspondingly profound changes occurred in the negro community as thousands of negroes arrived from the south there were inevitable dislocations and transformations in community leadership for a number of years new leadership was slow in evolving partly because of the serious economic crises of the postworld war i era then during the height of the depression a new leader emerged in the person of a schoolteacher named nellie watts despairing of waiting for the es tablished impresarios to bring in top musical talent to masonic temple miss watts undertook to do so herself in  using her own funds miss watts initiated a concert series with the contralto marian anderson the first concert proved an overwhelming success and the annual nellie watts concert series became a detroit tradition in its  years of existence the series has presented virtually every topranking negro musical personality from miss anderson to detroits own metropolitan opera star george shirley in  in an effort to broaden the participation of the community in her concerts and to cut her frequent financial losses miss watts organized the patrons of the arts apart from helping to assure a larger audience for the concerts patrons of the arts was designed to offer encouragement to young artists singers and musicians significantly miss watts was one of the newcomers to detroit being a native of atlanta ga most of the cultural leaders who followed miss watts had their roots in other localities but were quick to recognize the wealth of possibility in the community and to seize upon it celeste cole a texasborn soprano who studied in russia helped to make excellence a standard of musicality in detroit a singer of extraordinary precision and power she instilled in her many students the drive for perfec tion among her students were florence pate sampson soprano vivian martin pianist leroy sampson and contralto ollie macfarland miss coles opera workshop is unique in its quality and conception last year her presentation of the pearl fishers at art institute employed members of the detroit symphony orchestra for accompaniment this season in commemoration of the centennial of the emancipation proclamation the opera workshop will do excerpts from hiawatha and the kubla khan by the english negro composer samuel taylor coleridge and also excerpts from boris godunov an opera based on a story by the russian negro poet alexandre pushkin miss cole is an instructor in applied music at wayne state university as well as one of the most soughtafter independent music teachers like miss cole robert nolan served as instructor in applied music at wayne state university and is a teacher who has launched some of the citys ablest musicians on professional careers a native of cleveland ohio nolan has spent more than  years in detroit and his name is virtually synonymous with local musical activity his school of music sponsors annual musical scholarships and arranges recitals for promising young musicians graduates of the robert nolan school of music include charles coleman founder and director of the northwestern school of music and dance brazeal dennard and concert pianist arthur lebrew winner of a scholarship to the mozarteum in vienna austria nolan is music critic for the michigan chronicle a pioneer in detroits music circles is jerene macklin a graduate of the detroit conservatory of music and founder of the detroit civic opera mrs macklin has worked diligently and quietly for decades to discover and develop musical talent in the community and she was among those promoting opera long before negroes broke through into the ranks of international opera the names of cole nolan and macklin are best known in the field of music but there are many others whose talent and efforts help to make detroit a leading musical center in the nation among those who should be mentioned are carlotta franzell canadianbom concert singer who first scored as cindy lou in the broadway production of carmen jones composer rogie clark whose opera ti yette was performed by celeste coles opera workshop last season and whose new opera the stranger is scheduled for the coming season teachers ollie macfarland louise sargent and katherine ellis baritone james harkless jr bassist russell greene and pianistcomposer william mann
christening of an african baby is observed with an equal excitement and joy as the birth itself the ceremony is one of many reunions in an african society that seal strong family ties an african family means more than the parents and their issues it implies the patriarch and his descendants the patriarch is the symbol of the familys pride tradition and customs families of a ghanaian clan have two main sets of traditional names for their issues the names are meaningful they identify the clans of the children easily and give a synoptic background information of the children themselves mere names can inform one for example of a childs seniority in the family whether a child is the only one with a particular name in the family whether the child is the second or third son or daughter in the family or even reveal the circumstances of the childs birth christening of an african child falls on the seventh day after birth the long wait is traditional to determine the chances of survival of the newlyborn baby at dawn of the seventh day members of the family assemble in the courtyard a senior member with an exemplary reputation is nominated godfather great importance is attached to the nomination because of the role the godfather plays in the  father or godmother officiating at the initiation has a powerful spiritual influence on the baby a godmothershe is a likely choice usually for her known sensitivity to spiritual forcefaces the east holding the baby in her arms thrice she raises it high to the heavens and down to the earth thrice she feeds it drops of water and liquor while performing these acts she invokes the blessings guidance and guardianship of the universal mind for the baby the baby is then christened and corn beverage is served the guests as a token for witnessing the ceremonyceremony the reunion is ceremonial to hail the new born it also has an esoteric significance to initiate the baby into society it is therefore assumed that a virtuous goda birthday name can be added to a formal family name to help differentiate first cousins with the same name tettey born on tuesday will be tettey kwabla and the other tettey born on friday will be tettey kofi strong family pride is attached to these names grandfathers granduncles and grandaunts look forward with anxiety to the christening of their grandchildren grandnephews and grandnieces respectively after them a fathers failure to follow tradition in naming his baby because of enmity or obvious reasons could spark a lifelong quarrel between the offended grandparent and the babys father the father under such circumstances has two choices one is to name his baby after the day on which it was born or to give it a proverbial name these proverbial names narrate family history or refer to wise sayings of the society a child born out of wedlock whose father has disclaimed it is named obetsebi fatherless a father who continuously loses his babies can name a new born baby obaya i will lose you soon or esefuo there is an end the beauty in these meaningful names is another example in african culture to enshrine knowledge of the secrets of nature in symbols festivals music and songs names of africans are therefore something more than mere proper names they are microscopic biographies which are recalled to mind whenever their names are pronounced
