the query why would h rrp a big ten couple send  i their son to a negro allege has been tossed at me so often since my son matriculated at fisk that it occurred to me that perhaps the true reasons might bear reanalyzing i have abs degree from state university of iowa and an ma degree from the university of michigan while my wife holds a bs degree from kansas state and an ma degree from the university of michigan first maybe i should point out the relationship that exists between my son and me for years we have been fishing buddies he hooks the big ones and ole dad handles the net for him it is my intent here to convey the idea that butch and i are about as close as possible for a fatherson team plans for his future have been sifted and resifted between us with him making the final decisions his high school career was studded with such honors as class president junior achievement club president boys state gubernatorial candidate and national honor society these honors are cited merely to point out the fact that the boy ran up against a minimum number of those situations normally confronting a youngster in a student body in which he was a member of a very small five per cent minority may i insert at this point that not all of his frustrating experiences were brought about by members of the majority white group however minimal as those situations were they occurred frequently enough to convince both my son and me that his educational and social experiences as a minority member even in a very liberal high school left much to be desired in a youngster destined to be a minority member for life with this thought in mind ole dad began a little retrospection my high school days under strikingly similar circumstances my undergraduate days at iowa and my graduate days at michigan were brought into focus and analyzed what i saw under my retrospective microscope did not exactly please my experience over the past  years as a teacher in a system where the prime requisite for promotion is to be a member of the majority group also undoubtedly had an effect upon my thoughts this is all incidental thinking however i feel these background thoughts are necessary if one is to understand the final outcome my sons matriculation at fisk we started our search for a college when butch entered his freshman year in high school upon request we received catalogs from a half dozen of the better small liberal arts colleges liberal arts because my wife and i advised butch to steer clear of the large university campus for undergraduate work as we feel the campus of the small liberal arts college is where the real educative process takes place as we browsed these catalogs the name of fisk as an exchange school was frequently mentioned thus the initial stimulus in our thinking of fisk was planted we then became more aware of the frequency with which fisk was mentioned in the daily press as the alma mater of recently appointed local state and even federal officials so we sent for and received a fisk catalog a thorough examination readily pointed out the excellent reasons fisk appeared in the other catalogs as an exchange school we became enthused and began to 
five years ago my work  took me to swaziland  where i had a bad motor accident i ¦  was nursed by harriet dhlamini a niece of sobuza ii paramount chief of swaziland f   i l  from the age of three harriet had spent most of her life in durban training there as a nurse she had only recently returned to swaziland when i met her she was  she is goodlooking vivacious with a quick sense of humour softhearted and sympathetic to those she was nursing and yet herself strong and selfconfident i had never before met anyone like her regardless of colour and at  i fell in love with her and she with me i determined somehow to make her my wife it was going to be one of the most difficult things to achieve my work was in publishing in south africa but how could i return there and continue my association with harriet apartheid has been responsible for two acts which affected us under the immorality act any association of any kind between opposite sexes where one party is white and the other is coloured is construed as an attempt to have carnal intercourse the act makes this a criminal offense punishable by up to seven years imprisonment and for a man under  to whipping in addition the maximum being eight lashes the mixed marriages act not only prohibits mixed marriages but also stipulates that those contracted elsewhere are not recognized in south africa if we were to live in south africa marriage was therefore out of the question i suggested to harriet that she accompany me to durban we would have to wait to marry until we could see our way clear to leaving south africa for good in the meantime she would be my housekeeperour only chance of being together because she knew that i was genuinely in love with her she agreed in the hope that one day our difficulties would be resolved we took a flat in durban each night harriet had to leave me and sleep in the location slum at cato manor to comply with the apar theid laws cato manor about halfanhours ride in an overcrowded african bus is the filthy hideout of every kind of durban african from respectable working people to thieves dope peddlers prostitutes and murderers on a sunday in february  we took a run in the car down the natal south coast harriet of course sitting in the back and wearing an overall like a real servant at scottburgh some  miles south of durban we had trouble with the car and as it was sunday and no mechanics were on duty at the garages i had to try to put it right myself harriet helped me by passing tools and so on soon we had onlookerstwo boer youths who spoke very pleasantly to me one went away for five minutes or so and returned almost immediately they were joined by a third youth also a boer he announced that he was a policeman and so were the other two and that we were under arrest for attempting to contravene the immorality act by enticing each other to have carnal intercourse we were marched off to the police station where they kept us waiting for three hours whilst the charge against us was being prepared eventually we were called into a sergeant detective who said that sworn statements had been given by members of the public and that we were being formally charged there was no question of bail but they agreed that i could telephone a lawyer however every time the trunk call came through they cut me off on the switchboard after the third attempt i was told that they couldnt be fed about all night and that we were to be locked up the police said that there were no cells for europeans at scottburgh and that i would be taken to umzinto nine miles away harriet was locked up where she was in a crowded cell where she was made to sleep on the bare cement with one ragged blanket that stank of urine and excrement the whole place was crawling with fleas bugs and lice i was put into a scrupulously clean cell with new blankets the next day we were brought before the magistrate at umzinto court and remanded in custody for two weeks harriet was locked up in umzinto goals which was so overcrowded that the women had to sleep on top of one another i was put into a small cell usually used for africans who had been sentenced to solitary confinement it was only just big enough to lie down in they gave me a new sisal mat to lie on and two new blankets i was allowed out only to wash and shave i was not permitted to read or to smoke no one spoke to me when we came before the court again we were charged with attempting to commit an immoral act the police had three fake witnessesan unemployed african and two unemployed indians who i found out later had been bribed with s each before the court  adjourned for the day i informed the court that i should require the petrol boy at the garage to be called as a defense witness next morning the prosecutor handed me a packet of cigarettes i knew then that he had thrown in the towel at the end of the case for the state i asked for our discharge and the magistrate granted it back at the garage the petrol boy described how he had been beaten by the police and threatened with the loss of his job in an effort to get him to tell lies after the publicity of the trial it was impossible to return to the flat so using a different name we took a acre farm midway between durban and pietermaritzburg i could continue with my work while harriet looked after the farm we were happy the farm was fairly isolated but a regular visitor was the sergeant of the local police one day he told harriet that she should not share one bedroom with me he said that police both european and african frequently came around in the night and had reported to him we had been there about three months when we paid off one of the african farm laborers who was idling he went to the police to report that harriet and i were living as man and wife the sergeant came again and said he was sorry but the complaint appeared officially in the occurrence book and he would have to make a report to his superiors in pietermaritzburg he advised us to leave the farm within a week before we found ourselves in serious trouble after a couple of temporary moves we bought a house at escombe some  miles from durban this was a lovely little house built on the top of a hill my bedroom was at the front and under it with no access from inside the house was a large cellar which was harriets bedroom the large garden was surrounded by a high stone wall except along the nextdoor garden boundary where there was a wire dividing fence with our past experience to guide us we bought two great danes one of which was most vicious we frequently found pieces of uniform and civilian clothes in the morning tom from african and sometimes european policemen and detectives the africans told harriet they hated trying to spy but were under orders eventually the police began to watch from the nextdoor garden causing the dogs to bark most of the night after a yearour longest time in one placeour nerves could stand it no more and we decided to live in basutoland a british protectorate my idea was that i would work in south africa all week and come home to harriet at the week end i transferred my business activities to bloemfontein in the orange free state travelling over  miles every weekend but the roads were shocking the house primitive and the cost too high we stuck it out for four months and then moved to swaziland another british protectorate where we rented a small farm while i travelled each week to south africa after three months we again realized we could not afford it there was no other course but to do what we hated doingmove back to south africa this time we took a flat in barberton in the eastern transvaal it had a servants room outside to which harriet had to go soon after dinner usually at about  pm the old troubles again beset us detectives were round the house all night one night harriet crept out on three african detectives and threw a bucket of hot water over them we had a bit of quiet for a week or two after that by the end of may  we thought johannesburg might be a better bet i went to live with my sister in the hope that nobody would suspect that harriet was anything other than a real servant but one night after we had been there a few veeks harriet and i were awakened by the bedclothes being roughly pulled off us it was the police we were taken to the district surgeon who tried to find evidence of sexual intercoursean examination i shall never forget after we had been twice before the court we were granted bail on september  we decided to push off to rhodesia by train through bechuanaland we stopped at francistown and got a travelling pass for harriet since she had no passport we caught the night train which was boarded by federal rhodesian immigration officials just before plumtree the border post as we were travelling together they quickly realized the position and demanded a deposit of £  in cash from each of us as a condition of entry we did not have that sum so returned on the next train some  miles back to tsessebe but the federal rhodesian immigration official had been in touch with francistown and told them that as we were obviously man and wife we were not wanted in rhodesia the francistown immigration officials came out in a truck took us to francistown and told us we were not wanted in bechuanaland either we were ordered on to the next train to return  miles to south africa african police travelled with us there had also been a telephone call to the border post so that police were waiting back in johannesburg we were held in custody until trial we did not go on defense since we did not want our history to come out under crossexamination on october  last year we were sentenced to six months imprisonment each this meant release on february  allowing for remission my main concern in prison was that as i was a united kingdom subject i might be deported on completion of sentence and have no chance of seeing harriet again to defeat this possibility i wrote to the south african immigration authorities a real bulldust letter stressing how i supported apartheid and so on as february  drew near i realized there was only one solutionto take harriet to england as quickly as possible we cleared up what we could in a week and travelled separately to lobatsi in bechuanaland we were granted a special license and married by the district commissioner on march the first mixed couple to be married in the bechuanaland protectorate after a couple of weeks together we went separately to cape town and stayed in different hotelsharriet in a coloured one and i in a white harriet got a passport from the british embassy after being registered as a citizen of the uk we caught the ship on which i am writing this with  minutes to spare now we have little left with which to make a new start in england except our love and our freedom to us the most valuable things in the world
from the time she could toddle a little  colored girl bom in   went up and down among the rows on a south carolina cotton plantation picking cotton she wore a coarse cotton dress her feet were bare little did she dream that nearly a hundred years later beautiful ladies in rich silken ball gowns would attend a gala ball in washington in honor of her memory but just that happened the ball held in  was called the international debutante cotillion it was a colorful affair with women from many lands making a brilliant showing in their native costumes it was sponsored by the members of the national council of negro women an organization founded when she became a woman by the little girl from the cotton patch the money raised at the ball was to be used by the council to help in erecting a monument to its founder mary mcleod bethune the monument the first one in the nations capital to honor an american negro was authorized by the congress and by the president in sponsoring it in the senate senator kenneth b keating of new york said mary bethune has earned her monument it is significant that the memorial honoring mrs bethune will also commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the signing of the emancipation proclamation thanks to that proclamation mary mcleod was bom a free child although her parents sam and patsy had been slaves they had enjoyed twelve years of freedom when mary was bom however being bom free did not necessarily mean that a poor little negro girl could do whatever she wanted to while she was very young mary learned that the hard and painful way two arrogant little white girls taunted her with not being able to read as they could that hurt there was nothing she wanted so much to do as to be able to read but there was slim chance for a little negro girl to learn reading in mayesville south carolina in fact there was no school within many miles and if there had been sam and patsy  could hardly have spared even one child from work in the cotton fields least of all could they have let mary go she was their prize picker but as she made her way up and down the rows mary kept hoping hoping hoping that some way some day she could manage to go to school she prayed that she might unexpectedly her prayers were answeredanswered by an unknown presbyterian mission board in the north miss wilson a teacher sent to the south by them managed to persuade sam and patsy to send one of their seventeen children to the little school she had been commissioned to start in mayesville after thinking it over marys parents decided that she should be the one to go shes homely but shes smart yes she is smart sam said so the elevenyearold little girl swishing her bright gingham dress skipped five miles to school each morning and trudged the distance home at night never had she been so happy the day of her graduation came all too soon when she was fifteen after that no further education was in sight for her the cotton fields seemed to stretch endlessly through life for mary mcleod then just as unexpectedly as her first chance for going to school had come to her a second opportunity came again miss wilson brought it a faraway northern seamstress whose father had instilled into her mind the realization of the need for negro education in the south had offered a scholarship to some promising negro girl at scotia seminary in concord north carolina miss wilson herself a graduate of scotia was to select the girl she chose mary even her train fare was provided she started off alone on her first train trip to scotia seminary two hundred miles away in  she finished her studies there with credit to miss wilson to her parents and to the unknown seamstress during marys years at the school she developed a great interest in africa and the missionary work done there and still needed there she decided she wanted to go to darkest africa as a missionary after she left scotia she talked this idea over with the principal who helped her get a scholarship at moody institute in chicago he felt that in that school she would get the best possible training for her desired lifework mary made an excellent record in her two years at moody after which she went to new york to apply to the presbyterian board of foreign missions for an assignment in africa from that board she received her first big disappointment they said no she was too young fortunately youth has ideals and determination marys ideal  was education for all colored young people her determination was to use her strength her talents and her life to help them get it if she couldnt help negroes in africa she would do her utmost in america from that determination she never wavered as long as she lived years later she wrote in her spiritual biography i give my best at all times and accept without complaint the results i expect the best she went home after her disappointment about africa and did her best in the cotton fields sometimes she even outpicked her father gathering in  pounds a day her neighbors were glad to have mary back at home she worked among themespecially among the children she had an exceptionally fine contralto voice well trained at scotia and on sundays she invited everybody to come and sing with her at her fathers cabin door all this time however her dearest hope was for a teaching position finally in answer to her application the board of missions assigned her to a school in augusta georgia it was called haines normal institute the school was in a poor district of the city called for some unexplained reason the terry the streets were swarming with the juvenile delinquents of that day who made walking there a hazard here mary saw a chance to do her best to expect the best from these hoodlums seemed like looking for a miracle but she tried she persuaded the principal of the school to let her invite the young street arabs to come to the school on sunday afternoons walking up and down the dangerous streets of the terry she told each child he would be welcome the next sunday one imagines that the first little rascals who came did so with tongues in cheeks it must have looked to them like a heavensent opening for more and different mischief to their surprise they liked what they were offeredstories singing and no sermons the first comers spread the word that it was fun to sing along with mary and more and more children came as the weeks went by before long the terry became a better and a safer place no doubt mary learned a useful lesson herethat a singing child is a happy child and a betterbehaved child at any rate singing was always part of her program in all her later association with children and young people by  mary had married albertus bethune like herself a teacher while they lived in savannah marys only child a son was born while the child was a little boy the bethunes moved to palatka florida education for negroes in florida as elsewhere in the south was in a sad state mrs bethune was consumed by a desire to do something about it it made her boil to see grown men and women unable to read she remembered what that was like herself and she knew how much her own mother patsy wished she had learned to read although patsy was descended from tribal rulers in africa and carried herself like an aristocrat she could not read mary could not rest until she had made a supreme effort to give colored children the chances she felt they should have she learned that daytona florida to which many negro families had come to work on flaglers new railroad lacked schools would that be a place to open her own school she wondered she talked it over with her husband who was skeptical about her ability to help the situation in daytona youve only got a dollar and a half he pointed out to her that will hardly start a school that and faith will answered mary albertus probably said something like well itll be your baby and went about his own teaching in palatka mary however would not be dissuaded from her purpose she set his house in palatka in order took little albert by the hand and accepted a ride to daytona concerning marys daytona venture mrs arabella denniston in later years mrs bethunes private secretary has said i have never met a person who possessed more faith in god and in humanity eventually with a prayer and a promise of future payment to the landlord mary opened her school in a rickety little shack on the edge of a snakeinfested dump she stretched her dollar and a half beyond belief and on opening day welcomed her entire student body five little girls in some way she managed to pay her first months rent eleven dollars soon she had a regular income from an unusual source sweet potato pies she excelled in making that wholesome delicacy which sold like the proverbial hotcakes laborers families loved them and wealthy winter visitors found them a pleasant change from hotel fare as she had proved in the terry mary bethune was an expert at making children sing and sing well as her school grew she trained a chorus which sang at daytonas resort hotels they were at one time taken in a boat to the home of john d rockefeller at nearby ormond beach not only were they paid for their concerts but wealthy men and women down from the north for the winter sent generous gifts to the school it was in  that marys school opened now nearly sixty years later the tiny school has grown to be a large accredited fouryear college like other colleges it confers not only earned degrees but honorary degrees at one commencement after she had retired as president mary was privileged to confer an honorary degree on a friend and helper of early days he was a grayhaired negro minister from virginia in her citation she reminded him of how they had gone together to the city dump as scavengers they had picked out bits of broken furniture and discarded packing boxes remember she said how we patched these up glued them together and made desks and chairs for the little girls and for me the old gentleman smiled and nodded he remembered throughout her years as president of bethunecookman college no less than eight other colleges conferred honorary degrees on mary she treasured particularly the one given to her in  by rollins college in winter park florida it was the first honorary degree ever conferred on a person of her race by a white college in the south in presenting her to president hamilton holt the public orator spoke of her triumphant struggle against almost insuperable odds president holt in his citation said to her you have in your own person again demonstrated that from the humblest beginnings and through most adverse circumstances it is still possible for one who has the will the intelligence the courage and the neverfailing faith in god and in your fellow man to rise from the humblest cabin in the land to a place of honor and influence among the worlds eminent as she walked down the aisle of the beautiful chapel of rollins college wearing her cap and gown and with the rollins doctors hood of blue and gold over her shoulders perhaps she felt as dressed up as did the gayly clad women at the later cotillion in her honor how any little fivefoot woman accomplished all she did for her college and her country is hard to understand her secretary mrs denniston has written each days work began with a few moments of meditation and prayer with her entire staff for recreation on quiet evenings we would enjoy a few games of checkers she usually came out best there perhaps was part of the secret of her accomplishment days begun peacefully with prayer and ended in quiet relaxation possibly too the fact that she usually came out best buoyed her spirits her students loved her although she had a wholesomely restraining influence on them possibly she remembered when she had had to be threatened with demerits while she was a toolively girl at scotia the students seemed to feel about her as james barrie did about his mother you never knew where she was unless you took hold of her if mary appeared on the campus in a white dress beware she was wearing her inspection uniform any students who had left their rooms in disorder might well quake dusty corners and carelessly made beds never escaped her attention as she made her rounds  in  mary came to an agreement with the methodist church whereby her girls school and their boys school in jacksonville were amalgamated under the name of bethunecookman college the church assumed all financial responsibility mary as president kept control of the courses of study in the nineteen thirties the nation suffered a crippling depression banks closed and unemployment was widespread it was an especially hard time for negroes so many of them were out of work mary felt that she must help her best was needed by her country as she went up and down and to and fro in the land urging help for her people an inspired idea came to her she thought she would be more convincing if she could say she was speaking as the voice of all negro women not just as mary bethune following out this conviction she organized a group which was named the national council of negro women soon it was  strong quite a voice mary was seeking nothing that she was not ready to give herself let her secretary illustrate that she wrote she had a way of talking with people and reestablishing their confidence in themselves a young womanhungry jobless almost at her wits endcame in to see her one day she had no appointment and when she came mrs bethune was in conference she waited more than two hours she went into the room in tears but came out smiling she still had no money no job and was hungry but she knew mrs bethune would help her in a couple of days she was at work she kept in touch with mrs bethune and mrs bethune urged her not to give up her desire for higher education she worked went to school at night finally went into the womens army corps after discharge she completed her law course at howard and today is one of the most able lawyers in washington as the depression became worse president roosevelt created an organization to help young people it was called the national youth administration nya he asked mary to be on the board and assigned her to work among negro youth mary worked very hard but by the end of a year she felt that not enough had been accomplished as she sat down to discuss it with the president her feelings overcame her discretion and she shook her fist under his nose mr president she ordered as though she were talking to the youngest member of her faculty youve got to do better than that for my people she recoiled in horror what am i doing she gasped mr roosevelt only laughed he thought too highly of her to be offended in fact he once said to her you never ask anything for yourself always for others as her responsibilities in the nya increased so did her efforts at last she was so tired and so sick that she was hospitalized then came pearl harbor and world war ii mary sprang into action as though she singlehanded had to win it she was made assistant director of the womens army corps wac her work was naturally among the colored girls she fought for their privileges she wrote regularly to her girls overseas she comforted them she loved them as she was carrying on in texas word came to her of the death of president roosevelt she felt as though life had gone out of her too but she couldnt mourn very long within two weeks she was in san francisco witnessing the birth of the united nations soon after that she came back to the home she loved so dearly on the campus of her college she was over seventy years old she was tired and often sick when she walked among her students she leaned upon a goldheaded cane which had belonged to her friend president roosevelt it was a gift from his wife in  when she was  years old she was jubiliant over the supreme court decision on antisegregation old and tired though she was she led her students on the campus in grateful thanksgiving yes she was happy but she was also experienced and wise concerning the slowness of change she warned that changes could not bexpected overnight there was still much persuasive work to be done almost exactly a year after that happy day mary bethune died she is buried on her campus behind her little white home mrs denniston her devoted secretary has told the story of her final resting place in these words a former student of bethunecookman asked her for a loan of  to complete his tuition i objectedlooking over the long list of borrowers who never paid back she thought about it for a couple of hours called me and asked how much money do we have in the bank do we have enough to send my boy i assured her we did the money was sent the boy completed his course paid back every cent one of the few who did and is now a successful mortician at her death he contributed a bronze metal vault for the preservation of her body another lesson for me in faith
will parets ghost ruin griffiths career 
what does the future q nst q hold for emile grif vv fith can the brilliant   young champion go on to take his place among the great welterweights of boxing or will the sickening memory of the night he sent benny kid paret to his grave haunt him for the rest of his career and detract from his remarkable skills gil clancy his manager and the man who is closer to him than anybody else admits even he doesnt know nobody can predict what effect a tragedy like that will have on a boxer clancy said we all know that he is one of the most talented men in boxing today and that he is a dedicated fighter who will always enter the ring in excellent physical condition but wondered clancy it is a question whether he will ever be  able to function at  per cent efficiency again we wont have the answer until we see him in the ring against strong competition griffith who savagely demolished paret at  of the th round of their march  title bout has overcome the first hurdle in his inner struggle to continue in his cruel trade when paret died emile thought seriously of quitting the ring clancy said he had a terrible guilt complex it was unreasonable inasmuch as everybody knew emile never intended to hurt paret seriously but it was there nevertheless he was very distraught and he even indicated to some newspapermen that he might quit in his moments of agonizing doubt griffith holed up in a new york state resort for two weeks of solitude and then returned to his native virgin islands to think it over finally he made up his mind two things did it for him clancy revealed he recognized his responsibility to his family and he responded to hundreds of letters of encouragement griffith  is one of eight children his ring earnings have been supporting them and his mother he realized said clancy that he couldnt let them down as for the letters they came from priests rabbis ministers doctors lawyers and just plain fans and they all urged him to continue    told him not to blame himself and reminded him to think first of his family most important to emile were the letters sent by the men of religion i think they were decisive in making up his mind clancy wants griffith to be a fighting champion but he has yet to decide on an immediate course of action  there are two schools of thought some say when you fall off a horse get right back on another and others say go slow i dont know which is right for emile im going to watch him very closely for the next few months and then ill make up my mind clancy a lean sharpfeatured man who has treated griffith like his own son shook his head and said softly but the big question will come when emile climbs through the ropes again will he always see paret standing there and will the vision cause him to pull back on his punches will it rob him of his knockout instinct and paralyze his reflexes i dont know nobody in the world can answer that question except emile himself if its any consolation for griffith boxing history suggests that his career will not be ruined the rec  ords show that most of the ring killers were able to shake off the effects of their horrible experience go back to dec  the night jimmy barry knocked out walter croot in the th round of their bantamweight bout croot died shortly after the beating but barry was back fighting the following march he fought two more years before retiring as undefeated bantamweight champ of the world former heavyweight champion max baer survived the same ordeal max hammered frankie campbell into submission in five rounds on aug   and campbell died a few days later max was back in the ring the following january and fought  more times that year he went on to win the heavyweight title and didnt hang up his gloves until  when the gigantic primo carnera knocked out ernie schaaf in madison square garden on feb   there was serious doubt whether he was really responsible schaaf had been previously mauled by baer but it was the pound italian who had to live with the tragedy big primo however won the heavyweight crown in his very next bout by kayoing jack sharkey in six rounds and he continued fighting for four more years schaaf was carried out in the th round after a spiritless bout that had the fans yelling for action as a matter of fact when camera unleashed the left jab that put ernie away the spectators cried fake fake but for ernie it was the blow that capped the savage beatings he had received not only from baer but also from tubby tony galento and paolino uzcudum in the previous eight months jimmy doyle died in  after absorbing a terrific beating from sugar ray robinson even then the question was raised whether robinsons career would suffer but sugar ray was back in the ring two months later he scored knockouts in his next five bouts and has fought no fewer than  bouts since the tragedy doyle hit the canvas in the eighth round of his june  boutbut he had been washed up long before he met the sugar percy bassett returned to the ring less than a month after his  bout with sonny boy west ended in a tragedy and scored five kayoes in his next eight bouts sonny boy was certainly in no condition to fight after the three beatings he had received at the hands of ike williams ko sammy angott and george dunn georgie small snapped back after laveme roach died at his hands on feb   he continued fighting although he never rose to championship class roach should never have been allowed in the ring after his murderous ko by rockfisted marcel cerdan and bennie gordon whose fists killed tommy pacheco in a preliminary bout on june   continued to campaign until recently so for what its worth history says that griffith will shake off the effects of the tragedy and go on to a magnificent career that will place him alongside ring idols of the past nobody can bring back benny kid paret but nobody wants to see the life of emile griffith ruined too one tragedy is enough
no nat hentoff definitions in jazz are chronically imprecise and perhaps the most fluid term of all has been the term jazz singer through the years vehement claims have been made for peggy lee chris connor frank sinatra rosemary clooney and even eileen farrell as candidates for membership in the club moreover judy garland considers herself fully capable of singing jazz and if asked sophie tucker would very likely respond that she is not only hot but swinging the case of ella fitzgerald is particularly enigmatic if her relationship to jazz singing can be clarified it may be possible to come closer to constructing a measuring rod for borderline cases like sinatra and peggy lee we may even begin to arrive at a definition of a jazz singer that will not crumble at its first collision with the next new set of qualifications as proclaimed in a record companys publicity release by my criteria ella fitzgerald is an aboveaverage pop vocalist but a minor jazz singer an explanation of my scale of values requires a check list of the essential qualities of jazz singing it is possible for many vocalists to have one or more of these in varying degrees on this basis of partial qualifications i would call frank sinatra and peggy lee for example jazzinfluenced but a complete fullstrength jazz singer like billie holiday louis armstrong or jack teagarden must have them all swinging and phrasing a flowing pulsation which can vary from the powerful and deeply personal thrust of louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie to the surfaceskimming of maynard ferguson and ahmad jamal is basic to any jazz performance ella swings smoothly and is an expert at play ing with rhythm while keeping the meter accurate but while her facility with the beat often approaches virtuosity she seldom applies it with any great relevance to particular songs as billie holiday did in this respect ella resembles a fleet instrumentalist whose timing never stumbles but who appears unconcerned with the meaning of a songs lyrics this tendency to ignore the original meaning of a song is understandable among jazz instrumentalists because they often use only the harmonic skeleton of a piece to create a new structure and mood of their own a singer however must deal with words and if the way she shapes her phrasing is at variance with the story she tells she has broken a key rule of jazz singing tell a story and tell it from the heart for example when ella sings love for sale she cannot be faulted musically but she communicates little of the aching weariness that is in the song similarly her phrasing of the more urbane cole porter and lorenz hart lyrics indicates an inadequate comprehension of the nuances involved ella in short always swings but she too frequently swings in an emotional and intellectual vacuum she neither remains faithful to the original nor creates a new story just as improvisation alone is not enough to characterize a performance as being jazz pointless swinging is not a certain guarantee of an illuminating jazz interpretation instrumental singing it has be come a commonplace to insist that a jazz singer should approximate the work of an instrumentalist in phrasing and even timbre this requirement is often oversimplified ella does indeed approach a song as if she were using her voice as a horn dom cerulli has accurately noted on up tunes particularly the scat songs she improvises in a steady flow much as a tenor would she jumps octaves and adds little breathy afterthoughts to phrases much as a tenor and she builds vocal riffs exactly the way a tenor would but a singer after all is not simply an instrument being able to imitate the habits of a tenor saxophone is not enough to ensure striking jazz vocalizing there are many timesespecially in wordless scat singingwhen she sounds like an extraordinarily fluent but dehumanized horn the human being with flesh and bones is absent technically these acrobatics are brilliantly sustained but they have less to do with selfexpression than with mechanics billie holiday never approached ellas instrumentlike facility but there was not the slightest doubt about the complex nature and uniqueness of a human personality when billie sang a similar contrast is that between the wry poignant individuality of everything pee wee russell plays and the more fluent but basically characterless clarinet of buddy defranco accordingly defranco is relatively a minor player while the durable russell has made and continues to make a singular and compelling contribution to jazz music timbre the timbre of ellas voice is naturally rather thin and lacking in intensity it is difficult for her to produce as wide and subtle a range of colors as sarah vaughan or anita oday still mildred bailey had an even smaller spectrum to work with yet through the intimacy of her phrasing and the quality of her improvisations she personalized everything she sang like the early blues shouters like the later more sophisticated jazz vocalists holiday lee wiley oday like carmen mcrae and ray charles today mildred bailey brought to her singing a strong sense of life of adult experience had her voice been richer she might have been even more effective but there was no question that mildred bailey communicated basic emotions hopes and frustrations by contrast ella too often sounds like a child and although much popular music is based on the fantasies of actual or arrested adolescents the essence of jazz has certainly never been for children what is jazz the veteran bassist milt hinton once asked rhetorically what makes a great jazzman is experience unless youve had experience and lived what could you have to say a person has to have lived to play great jazz charlie parker put it even more concisely if you dont live it it wont come out of your horn imagine if you will ella fitz gerald singing god bless the child or good morning heartache and then compare billie holidays approach to the same songs the difference is rather like that between paintings by norman rockwell and ben shahn at one end of the nonclassical vocal scale are the shallow mechanical teenage favoritespaul anka chubby checker ricky nelson at the other are ray charles carmen mcrae jack teagarden who are aware in chaucers words that the lyfe is short the craft so long to leme the assay so hard so sharp the conquering in between are accomplished stylists like frank sinatra and peggy lee who use jazz techniques for greater expressivity but who usually stop short of going down to the bedrock of their feelings it is to this camp that ella fitzgerald bem longs a major jazz singer must swing improvise imaginatively and phrase instrumentally but a major jazz singer must also make each song reflect what he has lived and experienced musicianship however skillful is not enough and ella technically brilliant as she is is not emotionally open enough in her singing to merit a place in the first rank of jazz singers after all these years do we know yet just who ella fitzgerald is and if she has indeed revealed all there is to tell there is not enough there for the best of jazz
yes leonard feather very well ella fitzgerald is not really a jazz singer segovia is not really a guitarist carl sandburg is not really a poet barry goldwater is not really a republican let us first state our terms eligibility as a jazz singer involves four basic factors musical context musical content timbre and innate rhythmic feeling nurtured by jazz associationthe impact of context is often stronger on the listener than on the artist a singer who would otherwise be ignored or passed off as belonging to the world of pop music may be accepted in some jazz circles through chance association helen ward helen forrest dick haymes and many others who happened to sing with jazz orchestras during the swing era or through their love for jazz and bookings before jazz audiences billy eckstine nina simone on the other hand singers like roberta sherwood and kay starr because they move in the las vegasmiami copacabana orbit peopled by unhip bands and audiences are ignored by most jazz fans and critics although they qualify as jazz singers by every test except that of context ella of course moves with grace and consummate ease from jazz to nonjazz settings at home in a jazz concert with oscar peterson or against a plush background flanked by strings at the hollywood bowl jazz content too involves psychological overtones if the material dealt with has a builtin jazz identificationan ellington standard say or a bop instrumentalthe singer gains an advantage with the critic who subconsciously thinks in terms of jazz vs nonjazz but nowadays ella leans as heavily on broadway and hollywood as on basin street and birdland for her repertoire the matter of vocal timbre in the definition of jazz singing has generally been associated with the jagged throaty quality found in the singing of louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie billie holiday and anita oday but if the presence or absence of this quality were in itself defining louis prima and frances faye would deserve entry to the jazz elite ahead of the softervoiced ella most important of all is a natural rhythmic sense for a singer may have such an overwhelming feeling for the jazz beat that the other factors become unimportant ella a professional singer almost from childhood grew up completely in the jazz tradition singing from the age of sixteen with the unique chick webb band leading it herself for two years after his death and later touring for many years with norman granzs alljazz concert group under such conditions even kirsten flagstad would probably have wound up swinging that ella does not spill her guts before her audience and that she lacks a guttural tone no more militates against her competence as a jazz singer than her failure to acquire a police record psychiatrists couches and stateowned institutions are not mandatory training grounds for a jazz musician mildred bailey jimmy rushing jack teagarden and many others can be cited whose lives were never scarred by traumatic experiences such as billie holiday endured whatever bearing this lack may have on the character of their singing it has none on their emotional honesty and intensity or on their ability to communicate by means of a natural jazz beat seven tracks of ellas lullabies of birdland on decca and eleven tracks of ella sings the duke ellington song book on verve consist partly or wholly of scat or bop singingthat wordless brand of vocal adlibbing entirely indigenous to jazz because of her mastery of this art jazzmen have compared her with legendary instrumentalists as cannonball adderley observed no girl living can sound more like a jazz soloist than ella but even in the more conventional songs with lyrics ella uses every delicately oblique device of syncopation of shading and phrasing that marks the work of a nonpareil jazz singer there is no direct relationship between jazz singing and personal maturity or depth of emotional experience a performer who has lived in shallow spiritual waters may it is true become a shallow jazz singer but a jazz singer nonetheless another performer may endure psychic agonies and grow up to be a judy garland but this does not give the garlandtype singer a passport to birdland i have observed however in the course of listening to hundreds of singers during the past twentyfive years that it is possible for a nonjazz singer to become a jazz singer certainly peggy lees roots were not in jazz and her early records had very little to do with the idiom yet during the past decade she has matured in emotion delivery phrasing has constantly surrounded herself with a rhythm section of firstclass jazz musicians and today ranks as one of the finest living jazz singers as quincy jones lou levy and dozens of other jazzmen who have worked with her will testify but the reverse of this process never takes place it is impossible for a jazz singer ever to become a nonjazz singer the qualities that were ingrained in ella during the years with webb will remain with her always in these times of planned nonconformity i suppose i should be ashamed to admit that my view of ella is shared by the vast majority of her fellowartists in fact she is held in esteem to a degree without parallel in jazz history it would be tedious and of little purpose even to begin a list of the jazz musicians who respect ella as a jazz artist but in a poll i once took among a hundred jazz players and singers she received sixtysix votes as the greatest female jazz singer of all time followed by billie holiday with twentythree and sarah vaughan with twentyone votes incidentally a comparison between ella and billie holiday serves no more constructive purpose than asking a winetaster to compare champagne and vodka to my mind no greater jazz singer than billie holiday has ever lived there was in her work a bitter beauty that is not to be compared with anything contributed by any other jazz singer but ella fitzgerald is peerless in jazz on another level she has virtues that are not to be sought and certainly not to be found in billie or anyone else hers is a different vitality a different not a lesser range of emotions emotions that reach most listeners as completely as billies emotions reached hers to suggest that comparative measures must be used in evaluating the contribution of either artist is to suggest that only one means may be used to reach an artistically perfect end  in conclusion it may be apt to summon as evidence one of the most illuminating attempts to separate the jazz from the nonjazz singers undertaken some years ago by a jazz expert who voted in the down beat international critics poll i dig sinatra but i dont consider him a jazz singer stated the critic and for this reason stood sinatra in the comer and refused to vote for him but the same critic in the same poll voted for ella fitzgerald and billie holiday as the worlds greatest female jazz singers in the light of the present discussion this has a special interest for the name of the voter in question was nat hentoff
free transportation out of the south to ne r groes who are unhappy here recenty was fferej hy the white citizens councils of the southland negroes professing unhappiness were given a oneway ticket out five dollars expense money and the telephone numbers of their friends in the norththe naacp the urban league and the welfare department within two days after the project was underway the council reportedly had enriched chicago with  unhappy negroes this reminded me of a question i sometimes am asked by whites is it true that negroes are happy the inquirer approaches usually with a face of friendly naive curiosity once however in a seminar on consumer behavior at the university of chicago a white fellow of wealthy texas parentage bitterly declared that although negroes are chronic bellyachers the fact is that they are happier by far than whites he was basing his conclusion he said on personal observations along sin strip the name white newsmen gave chicagos  rd street between cottage grove and stony island avenues i asked him why since he thought negroes so much happier than himself he did not go down to live on sin strip give the negroes there his money to worry over and accordingly increase his own happiness that response was borrowed from an english professor i once had at oklahomas langston university an allnegro college in the allnegro town of langston the professor who was mayor of the town used to tell us of his escapades among whites in his travels and kid us that the declaration of independence had given us life liberty and the pursuit of happiness with no guarantee that we would ever catch up with it to what extent has the negro caught up with happiness a happy individual the dictionary tells us in part is one favored by hap chance luck or fortune fortunate prosperous such adjectives obviously refer to few negroes i know but the dictionary goes on to say that a person may be labeled happy if he is addicted to the exhibition of joy or gaiety is joyous it is this i think that leads to the controversy revolving around two main concerns in the first place there is lacking an official gauge of the negros relative bliss then comes the inconsistency of the negros outcast state and his jocular public demeanor i have looked for the answers in the stockpile of facts and figures on the negros struggle taking pains at the same time to scrutinize typical specimen chancing to come before me for a firsthand  picture or mosaic of the negros inner mood for one important indication i compared the incidence of misery among whites and negroes although much of that contrast is now wellknown i was struck by several interesting contradictions one is the negros disdain for ending his own life during the depression when whites departed this earth in voluntary droves negroes in birmingham alabama for example were less than onetenth as likely to take their own lives in fort worth texas only ten negroes in twenty years  to compared to  whites chose to end it all recently two sociologists out at the university of washington combed through suicide statistics for the years  to  and found negroes less than half as prone to suicide in seattle as the negros situation becomes more equal his suicide score along with other social characteristics becomes more similar to those of whites do not conclude however that the negros past and present distaste for voluntary death is proof that he is less fed up with life the seattle study also found that he is more likely on the other hand to attempt suicide without completing it some people sayerroneously i believethat negroes today are very much like those depicted on the plantation in the movie wild river when things go wrong they simply shrug and say let the white folks worry about it anyway contrary to popular fallacy it is not true that whenever a negro starts to worry instead of worrying himself to death he simply falls asleep mental derangement for example which may accompany emotional distress is higher among negroes than whites available figures for  revealed that negro admissions to insane asylums in northern states containing large numbers of negroesnew york illinois chicago and californiamore than doubled admissions for whites bear in mind however that most of the insane were migrants from the south more than two million colored refugees between  and  alone having left the south forever they sought a rainbows end in the north often to their tragic disappointment many never made the adjustment or quite got over the disillusionment however the higher rate of psychosis among negroes is partly due to the lower prevalence of persons of the middle class and above among them sociologist august hollingshead has found that the higher the social class the fewer the psychotics but the more the neurotics persons financially well off can better afford psychiatric help for mending psychotic dispositions they also are more able and prone to shield psychotic relatives from public commitment and common knowledge more the feelings of personal inadequacy infused in the negro individual from the age of four or five onward psychologists say may be too much for some of them to bear negro parents have yet to solve the problem of what and how to tell their tots about racial matters in order to make their egos shockproof enough for the brutal deprivations and humiliating insults to human dignity they will suffer in later life many parents in the middle class go to extreme ends to guard their children from unfortunate racial experiences slum children on the other hand are more impelled to fall back on the juvenile gang for security and acceptance writing in his book slums and suburbs james b conant formerly president of harvard university reported recently that  per cent of the young negroes from  to  years old in a typical slum are both out of school and out of work out of work because of slim chances for employment out of school in large part due to a sense of defeatism or a lack of incentive developed by dim prospects for them in the job market yet many such youths have internalized the american cultural goal of success and plenty while thwarted in their own access to legitimate means of achieving the goal sociologists among them robert k merton of columbia university know this has the capacity for making a man a criminal denied the routine legitimate means to success many individuals cannot resist the temptation to substitute whatever means are available some take out their frustrations on one another by way of switchblade brawls amid the dilapidated squalor of their neglected environment most continue to suffer in adult life from extreme and unfair policies of occupational discrimination quite often this leads to desertion by fathers and to general family disorganization not surprisingly many are driven to drink as a means of dousing their troubles the average negro family vance packard points out in the status seekers spends twice as much for liquor as the average white family does although this is no indication that whites have an aversion for such beverages negroes farthest down of all turn typically to religious enthusiasm in search of a way out wandering from one cult to the next hoping for a brighter day by and by in deserting conventional religions they are rejecting those they have found unrewarding and the god and his followers they feel have rejected them black muslims for instance counter their sense of rejection and abuse by whites with a passionate rejection of whites they say this is sufficient to cure colored alcoholics en masse because it gives them a sense of selfrespect many middleclass negroes on the other hand who according to  the muslims are growing fat satisfied and greasy develop an insouciant frame of mind as a mechanism of ego defense i just dont let it bother me they frequently declare and you see in their faces that they are hoping to convince themselves as well as the listener others spurred by a history and personal background of hard labor and the increasing preeminence of the knob and the handle in american culture confuse mere idleness particularly freedom from productive activities with general wellbeing then finding that ease alone does not bring happiness they are led quite like the lower class to compensate through chronic dissipation they hang after ecstasy in pursuit of the happiness that eludes them i found that much of the negros glee is a function of his low general circumstances in most cases his predominantly lower class origins in others persons of middle class and beyond in their groping for social approval typically place proper deportment above the expression of their own inner tastes and emotions lowerclass codes of conduct regardless of race are much less governed by the rigors of social constraint puerto ricans in the slums of new york and chicago for example also are given to a jocular disposition although i have heard it said that this represents the nigger in them i believe their behavior is due to class and culture  like negroes they possess the chance to pursue happiness but hampered in the acquirement of it they overindulge in the pursuit too often the mechanisms of pursuit become ends in themselves masks of glee are publicly worn but often as camouflages for private sorrows and frustrations some scholars go back to the slavemaster relationship for an explanation of this tracing the anachronistic grin many negroes exhibit from the yassuhboss front they were forced to present to whites down through the dictates of racial etiquette under the souths system of intimidation subsequent to civil war reconstruction others like john dollard a sociologist at yale university and coauthor with allison davis of children of bondage give a freudian explanation dollard recently conducted research on the preoccupation of many negroes with playing the dozens and came up with the conclusion that they do so and also kid one another a good deal as a socially approved means of releasing racial frustration this suggests that the gleeful negro is not twofaced after all but is acting unconsciously often without knowing why he does so himself freud had explained in his jokes and the unconscious that funmaking is derived from human social relations and a joke will allow us to exploit something ridiculous in our enemy which we could not on account of the obstacles in the way bring forward openly or consciously perhaps many negroes themselves are way ahead of freud when they realize as the song goes that they are laughing to keep from crying i have concluded that the negro is not so happy as he is joyous joyous says the dictionary refers to the emotion excited by the acquisition or expectation of good although the negros joy is far more in the expectation than the acquisition and he has been expecting a fair chance merely to pursue happiness for quite some time he now can see more clearly the impending demise of jim crow barriers the more his access to true happiness the less he will need to drug himself with compensatory ecstasy
for six years i worked f   as reporter for a chijj cago newspaper that thrived on stories  about sex crime and racial discrimination during those years i witnessed a great many murders accompanied police on bookie joint raids rode a taxi into the midst of a race riot at trumbull park and watched a young man who shot to death a theater cashier during a robbery die in the electric chair among the people i find difficult to forget if i could forget any of them at all are the countless narcotics addicts i have seen and still see today in increasing numbers they are without exaggeration among the most miserable people i have known and the pity of it is that too few people care about them at all i say too few people care about narcotics addicts because i have continuously noticed how the average citizen relentlessly criticizes him for being addicted while doing nothingor very littleto relieve him of his plight people are more apt to want to institutionalize him  for life separating him from the rest of society than they are to see the necessity of rehabilitating him in hopes that he will become a useful and productive member of society i believe however that while the bulk of the blame for the degrading and primitive status of the narcotics problem in america can certainly be laid to the lack of adequate state and municipal facilities for handling addicts and enforcing laws against peddling the stuff the christian church must share the  blame for turning its back on these socalled social outcasts there are a few individual churches that are attempting to help but in the main the church as a whole is not doing all it can to give addicts the fellowship spiritual guidance and understanding they so desperately need narcotics addiction is a lingering living death that is sold on the streets of hundreds of american cities towns and villages its victims teenagers and adults men and women people of all races and religions who live in unbelievable torment and anguish no one knows for sure how many addicts are in the united states estimates of known addicts have ranged from a low of  to a high of  conservative estimates place the number around  to  with about  being youths under  almost half of this countrys addicts can be found in new york illinois ranks second with  to  percent practically all of them in chicago california is third with about  to  percent and michigan fourth with six to eight per cent the problem is big there is the need for a larger budget so that the u s bureau of narcotics can strengthen its undermanned staff of agents who are fighting a losing battle in trying to keep narcotics from being smuggled into the country there also is the need for stronger laws and better enforcement of laws that already exist to rid society of suppliers and peddlers of narcotics a bigger problem some think however is what to do with the scores of thousands of unfortunates who are now addicted can society afford to continue to treat them as criminals rather than as medical cases can state and city governments continue in their reluctance to formulate and put into operation adequate medical and clinical programs that could possibly lead to the cure and rehabilitation of addicts can churches continue to refuse to recognize responsibility admittedly what is being done is not enough this is pointed out periodically by large metropolitan newspapers that find sensational articles about narcotics good circulation builders they usually highlight what cities and states are failing to do how law enforcement is not what is should be and how peddlers are treated better than addicts when they are hauled into court but one area which is often overlooked or completely ignored is the responsibility of the church in regard to the total treatment and rehabilitation of the addict it is time the church took a hard look at the problem and translated its pronouncements against narcotics into concrete programs that will benefit those who need help the mostthe addicts like the mentally ill the tubercular the blindthey too are people of special need no longer a problem exclusive to big cities narcotics addiction is now spreading to smaller cities and towns that for years were relatively free of the dope traffic while new york los angeles and chicago still have the bulk of all u s addicts narcotics addiction has been found to flourish wherever there exists wide slum areas and large segments of frustrated minorities at least  per cent of the addicts use heroin a yellowishwhite powder of overwhelming addicting qualities powerful potency and strong euphoric effects other drugs used but in lesser demand are morphine a painkiller with great danger of addiction cocaine a stimulant that is most dangerous when the user has a maladjusted personality and marijuana a cheap narcotic that often leads to insanity after prolonged use always in great demand by addicts heroin a derivative of opium is the backbone of a vicious and illegal racket controlled by the underworld despite tight federal and strong international control it  i manages to smuggle enough drugs into the country to realize a  million annual profit by supplying organized mobsters of big east coast midwest and west coast cities most heroin smuggled into the u s comes from italy other major illicit sources include communist china frequently accused of flooding western countries with drugs to create moral and physical weaknesses as a prelude to war burma malaya india japan turkey thailand iran syria and lebanon since world war i when there was one addict for every  persons in america the narcotics problem has continually sparked an increasingly bitter controversy particularly over how best to treat addicts hospitals refused them treatment states and cities declined to pay for rehabilitation centers and often threatened to close the few clinics that existed with state and city governments failing to measure up to the immense and growing task of coping with dope addiction the federal government in  was forced to open a public health service hospital at lexington kentucky the first of its kind in the world for treating and although to a very limited degree rehabilitating drug victims in  a smaller hospital was opened at fort worth texas none have been opened since for the most part circumstances for addicts have not improved much in the last fifteen years hospitals still refuse them treatment  and cities and states still refuse to establish rehabilitation centers many of the clinics that were open have been shut down even in new york where there are some  known addicts and possibly thousands of others who go undetected fewer than  beds have been made available to addicts wanting to withdraw from drugs however since  the state has established addict treatment facilities at three hospitals and as recently as march   governor nelson a rockefeller signed a bill providing for treatment of addicts as medical cases rather than criminals the law finally establishes a new central narcotics office in the state mental hygiene department to direct expanding programs in narcotics research treatment and aftercare addiction is a vastly complicated physiological and psychological problem it is complicated by the publics general assumption that addiction is criminal in reality many addicts are much more sick than criminal there is a need many experts feel to ferret out and objectively classify addicts in order to discover whether all addicts are really alike whether all are criminal instead of sticking to the point of view that they are alike because they are essentially bad or because they offend society historically the same was at one time felt about the leper they were either bad or just dirty or the same was felt concerning venereal diseases and alcoholics these narrow points of view have been mastered now with a more enlightened attitude toward these diseases they have responded favorably to treatment addiction can be found in all classes the wealthy upper class the conservative middle class and the lower classes all have their share of addicts the masses however are found in the subculture of the lower classes and in congested slum areas where large numbers of minority groups as negroes and puerto ricans are clustered together and frustrated by the innumerable discriminatory social and economic problems that are heaped upon them one of the nations few narcotics clinics is located in new yorks east harlem protestant parish directed by the rev norman c eddy a congregationalist who has dedicated himself for almost twenty years to an unyielding battle against narcotics the clinic is a rare place where the church is fighting on the firing line it concentrates part of its limited facilities and budget to which four protestant churches contribute a meager amount on helping adult addicts withdraw but out of the scores who come to the clinic for help it can only help a handful mostly neighborhood residents when men and women come in off the street and say they want to end the narcotics habit declares reverend eddy we have to tell them there is no place for them to go right now for treatment we are in a sense saying go out and steal or commit prostitution so you can get the drugs you need this is a vicious position for us to be in the parish was established in  to alleviate suffering among the addicted and their families its budget is about  a year and because it cannot always prick the conscience of society enough to raise the money needed to continue operating the parish faces a crisis that pushes it near its final days two other churchsponsored programs in new york face the same possibility judson memorial church which set up a narcotics center and proposed treatment plan in  in almost two years its active case load is about  addicts about  addict patients have come in contact with the center and approximately  psychotherapy interviews have been carried out with  patients the center averages  to  patient contacts per week the other is the quaker committee on social rehabilitation inc affiliated with the religious society of friends it concentrates mostly on women addicts since the start of their program in   women have been interviewed  have been helped and  referred for jobs during the early s the rev robert t jenks then pastor of st marks episcopal church on chicagos south side established a narcotics anonymous group on the belief that drug addicts could be rehabilitated for two years his  small interracial parish with limited facilities was relatively successful in treating addicts with the help of new tranquilizing drugs testifying before the illinois state legislatures narcotics investigation commission in  the rev james w mack then the assistant pastor said the parish started its work as a community problem finding the heaviest illegal drug traffic existed in its own neighborhood it used pastoral counseling tranquilizing drugs group therapy and job placement tranquilizing drugs were administered only by physicians after clinical experiments in the police lockup demonstrated that tranquilizers were ninety per cent effective in eliminating the vicious withdrawal symptoms that afflict addicts when deprived of narcotics reverend mack cited cases of twentyone addicts helped at their mission clinic their average age he said was  and they had been addicted an average of four years after four days of taking a tranquilizer and nonbarbiturate sleeping pills  reported back completely withdrawn jobs were found for them and after a twomonth period ten of them were still known to be clean father jenks was in constant contact with some  junkies to whom religious counsel was given nevertheless the program soon failed for lack of funds and community interest there are innumerable aids the christian church can give in help ing to eliminate the narcotics traffic and to cure and rehabilitate those addicted to drugs for one there is a need for closer cooperation and more clearly defined relationships between the probation department the narcotics court and medical counseling clinics which need to be established in greater number churchrelated hospitals which do not now admit addicts can support the establishment of these clinics and even make available a limited number of beds for the treatment of addicts hospitals should have shortterm detoxification facilities to treat addicts wanting immediate withdrawal and then refer them to neighborhood clinics which the church should be operating for their rehabilitation and aftercare there is a need to stress community education most addicts are dependent not grown up the public should learn that the addict feels inferior allies himself with a gang to bolster his masculine feelings but ambivalently takes the drug to satisfy his passive dependent cravings churches can help the withdrawn addict get involved in a nondrug centered society this is one of the addicts greatest stumbling blocks to rehabilitation once he has been institutionalized treated and released he will need a new environment a new set of values he will need additional therapy and rehabilitation perhaps a trade and employment any addict can be taken off drugs once he is institutionalized but once he is released he is strictly on his own and the tide of frustrations and narrowminded social attitudes that engulfed him and drove him to narcotics in the first place will be waiting for him on his doorstep the church can offer narcotics addicts consolation and understanding and encouragement the church can get them involved in churchcentered activities and afford them opportunities to meet other youth who can help them abstain from further use of narcotics few addicts are religious most of them have been reared in families where religion was not a part of family life and have rebelled against the church this is very well pointed out by new york judge john m murtagh and sociologist sara lou harris in their book on narcotics who live in shadow mcgrawhill  the church has a superb opportunity to reach addicts but it has thus far failed to do so the church should accept them not shun them as so many other agencies do it can work with parents to make them know that addiction is a disease and not a crime and it can see to it that its young peoples groups offer addicts who are attempting to kick their habits encouragement and normal social associations most addicts cannot ordinarily be reached through religion in their early contacts with the church they claim to be atheists or agnostics and only come to church in the first place because clergymen and counselors reveal warmth toward them and yet despite addicts general lack of religion some members of the clergy report great satisfaction in their contacts with them the hands that are held out to addicts are so few that they become dependent on any that are thus some addicts who begin coming to church out of no more than their need for comradeship may eventually acquire faith and belief society is irritated by the problem of addiction and is anxious for a solution with cooperative efforts of the church federal state city authorities and private agencies effective plans can be put into operation almost immediately if there is a slowness to act on the part of others however it is the responsibility of the church to supply the impetus for actionas it does in so many other areas of life 
he heat was oppresy    sive it quivered from ii » the corrugated iron y roofs of the houses t he middle distance was distorted by the waves as they silently rose toward the brassy sky dust devils swirled aimlessly by picking at loose debris as they passed the cloudless sky seemed to press downward compressing the heat into a vast weight until all movement became an effort nothing stirred even

before it was no different from a hundred others a few stores a post office government liquor store garage and ubiquitous barclays bank all these were spread along the main street which led north and south only hunters and africans went east or west there was nothing out there except bush and beyond that more bush nobody wanted to go into the bush this weather or did they sweat coursed down the

position boy he called an african dressed in white with red sash worn around the body bandolier fashion moved from the doorway in which he had been lounging he had in his hand a small looseleaf book and a stub of pencil which he held out to the man who took it and wrote slowly hurry back eh he said handing the book and pencil together with a silver coin to the other the african waiter left his

then well be off the man handed mumba some money  rascal or rogue a term of endearment be back here at four oclock the man turned and climbed the steps back into the hotel where heaving a sigh he sank into his chair again as he sat drinking his beer the man reviewed the events of the past few days last wednesday a runner had come with news of a leopard near kafulata mumba had sent for him to come

devising any scheme to kill other than by the conventional trap or shooting method well he would see this animal was old or lame or it would not be so bold several goats and a dog had been taken right out of the village and numerous attempts to catch the leopard had failed hence the call of the white man he knew mumba wanted to play to the gallery so  here was a chance to put nicholas in his place the man rose to his feet and entered the main part of the hotel he walked down a wide corridor and opened the door of a room wherein a man lay sleeping on a bed sweat rolled off his bare torso as his chest heaved his hair matted with dampness nicholas the man shook the sleeping figure nicholas wake up mumbas here were off at four nicholas grunted yawned and stretched opening his eyes he asked what time is it just after two time to get a bath ill be back in about half an hour must get the jeep filled up some thirty minutes later the man returned with the jeep two water bags hung on either side of the front seat a rifle pointed skywards its blueblack barrel glistening in the sun a canvas covered box was propped in one comer of the back seat and a red jerry can lay on the floor all right mumba well be off in a few minutes the man addressed the waiting african time meant little to anyone in this town even less to mumba he settled down to wait in the shade and soon slept it was well past four oclock when the two white men appeared each carrying a roll of blankets and a waterproof groundsheet both wore toupees on the back of their heads and nicholas carried a khaki bush jacket the three climbed into the jeep mumba in the back the other two in front the engine rumbled into life and they moved out of the town leaving a cloud of dust hovering in the still hot air the road unpaved and corrugated made travelling uncomfortable the vehicle was not built for comfort and was inclined to dance a little on the uneven surface but nevertheless a steady fifty miles an hour soon brought them to a fairly wide bush path into which they turned their progress was slowed now owing to the narrowness of the track which twisted and turned among the trees it was cooler here in the shade but the oppressive air was in no way diminished and all three were eager to reach their journeys end after travelling some twelve miles along this twisting track they crossed a dambo topped a small steep rise in the ground and there on the edge of the bush was the village a cluster of huts low entrances set in low mud walls topped by grass thatched roofs cooking fires smoked as the women tended their pots children played their games as do children all over the world men smoked and drank beer brewed by the women it was a scene typical of africa the queer pungent smell that is prevalent throughout the country was very evident multicolored dogs of varying degrees of thinness greeted the newcomers with yelps a dry river bed and barks scrawny fowls fluttered this way and that scurrying to get out of the way of the dogs the children stopped their play to gaze at the men fingers in mouths little potbellies bulging over their ragged short pants the jeep pulled over to a vacant hut and the men alighted each stretched the kinks out of his legs and then began to unload the bedding from the rear seat a large tree with wide spreading branches stood some thirty yards from the cluster of huts the earth beneath it was loose and sandy churned up by hundreds of playing feet around the trunk fibre baskets of leaves were stacked it was to these leaves that mumba turned his attention after seeing the others were settled in their quarters calling several loungers over to him mumba proceeded to scatter the leaves quickly under the tree until an area of some fifty square feet was covered next he and two others walked over to one of the huts and presently returned with a large piece of dripping meat tied within a fibre net tossing a rope over a sturdy lowhanging branch of the tree the men fastened one end to the net and hauled the meat into the air until it was suspended some fifteen feet above the ground there it was secured by tying the other end of the rope to the tree trunk after some deliberation the men next returned to the hut and brought out calabashes full of honey golden brown liquid which they proceeded to pour out over the leaves starting in the centre each walked backwards pouring as he went presently it was done to their satisfaction and returning the calabashes to the hut the men went back to their various homes where their daily meal was awaiting them the two white men prepared their own meal and as they ate the sun began to sink they watched the sun drop down like a ball of flaming brass orange and reds merging with yellows and gold steel grey deepening pale blue turning to purple and then to black darkness fell soon after sunset and fires flickered near the homes the men saw an occasional firefly flash his light and huge moths dance around the fires before plunging to their death in the flames tonight the fires were allowed to die early the moon rose like a huge lantern swinging in the sky spreading its pale light across the clearing casting sharply etched shadows from the trees there was an air of expectancy about the village as the people waited mumba sat with the two white men a shorthandled stabbing spear across his knees no one spoke the voices of insects and small creatures broke the stillness of the air an occasional night bird wheeled past on muted wings searching for food  a faint cough in the distance sent a thrill down the spines of all who heard it and knew it for what it was a leopard somewhere out there in the shadows the spotted cat was on the move perhaps he would come into the village again in his search for easy pickings dogs goats or even a chicken were his prey now the eyes of all were on the tree in the clearing children kept close to their mothers sides fathers gripped their spears waiting alert to every sound and movement it seemed hours before any other sound of the leopard was heard  perhaps it had gone the other way hoping to find food near the waterhole beyond the dambo everyone waited hoping it would come each one dreading its appearance and yet knowing that unless it came tonight the hopes of destroying it would perhaps be lost forever and all the preparation be of no avail a brief moving shadow flickered maybe it was a passing breeze brushing the leaves of the bushes perhaps it was the imaginings of a taut mind there it was again nearer this time suddenly the leopard was in full view its body slung low to the earth tail waving slightly as it gazed toward the silent huts its head lifted as it scented the air the stench of the dripping meat touched its nostrils slowly the cat advanced until it reached the area where the drip had wet the leaves cautiously the beast examined the wetness suddenly its whole being sprang into violent eruption like the abrupt loosing of a tightly coiled spring it leaped snarling into the air teeth grinning upward eyes flashing claws unsheathed ready to rend anything within reach for almost thirty seconds this poise was held nothing moved gradually the tension died and the cat looked upwards seeing the meat hanging there it began to pace the area slowly padding in a circle its face turned up for several minutes this continued until it became aware of  the leaves adhering to its paws lifting first one and then the other the leopard tried to bite off the leaves but only succeeded in sticking them to its face the more it tried the worse the situation became the cat became infuriated at its failure to remove the torment gradually its eyes became fully covered and in desperation it rolled over on its back mumba rose to his feet gripping his spear the white man picked up his rifle and released the safety catch pulling the bolt back he gently eased a round into the breech raising his hand he gripped mumbas arm in a brief clasp each knew the others thoughts there was no need for words the black man stepped out into the open and approached the maddened beast somehow the animal semed to sense the approach of the man despite its blinded condition it turned to face the newcomer ready to give battle mumba picked up a stick of wood as he walked deliberately toward the great cat when he was within three yards of the waiting beast he threw the wood to the right front whereupon hearing it strike the ground the leopard leaped toward it as it left the ground mumba struck with his spear his whole weight behind the blow it took the cat through the ribs piercing the heart the beast fell without a sound its leafmatted body still mumba stood his hand on the knife at his belt waiting for what might come next the villagers rushed out crying joyfully stopping short of the fallen beast half afraid it might suddenly spring to life again the white men each of whom had sat with bated breath through it all expelled the air from tortured lungs white tensed muscles eased from the rifle sweat ran unheeded from the faces of both satisfied now nicholas nodded my god the nerve of the man ill never doubt them again they walked over to where the leopard lay picking up one foreleg mumba pointed to the joint of the leg and chest two black dots were clearly visible porcupine he said thats why he was hanging around couldnt get around so good the white man replied must have jumped a porcupine and got shot full of quills lame wonder he didnt get them in his heart nasty things those spikes work their way in and never come out he looked at mumba pushed his clenched fist gently against mumbas bare chest and turned away there was no need for anything to be said mumba knew his friend was proud of him watching him return to the darkness of the hut he breathed deeply then speaking rapidly in order to hide his emotion mumba ordered the men to pick up the carcass and move it out of reach of the ants which were already thick among the leaves attracted by the honey fires were soon blazing merrily once more native beer was brought forth a drum began to beat rhythmically feet began to tap and the village came to life mumbas praises were sung songs of his prowess would be sung for many days the story of the slaying of the leopard would be told to all who would care to hear the deed becoming more hazardous with every tellling the celebration carried on until the small hours of the morning and it was two weary white men who rose at daylight to prepare for their homeward journey mumba was on hand to help them load their belongings and after a leisurely breakfast they left the sun was hot already as they entered the shade of the trees the heat was dancing from the road and shimmering above the rooftops when they reached the  town nothing moved it was just another african day in a typical african town what caused that cat to jump after it smelled the meat asked nicholas oh that well it was standing directly underneath the meat and a drip must have landed on it from above i never thought of that nich  olas said but it did seem strange at the time i suppose you must be off thanks for everything you were right it certainly opened my eyes oh thats alright remember that the african is just as coura  geous and just as resourceful in his own environment as the white man is in his the man walked out into the heat and climbed into the jeep the dust trailed behind as the dancing air distorted and swallowed up the retreating vehicle soon there was nothing left but silence nicholas looked out to the east where the trees stretched endlessly it seemed he was beginning to understand the respect the other man had for the african maybe their sense of values was different from his but one thing was sure the baubles the white man held so precious could avail him nothing in the life and death struggle which continually raged around out there in the shimmering heat money could not buy courage nor diamonds the faith in ones ability to meet death on its own terms and come out victorious this was a mans country where weaklings could not survive from somewhere behind him he heard a white mans voice calling boy he smiled crookedly

five years ago f g when arthur spingarn t fresh from the arms of sptkix a sociay prominent and wealthy family was doing his fathers bidding by practicing law he was asked to try a civil_rights case the details of the case have long since escaped his memory but the effect of it has not to spingarn it was a simple matter of indecency and injustice which he says hes never forgotten today he says the fact that  hours after our naacp branch in a tennessee town printed the names of their local members the members were fired from their jobs couldnt get credit and couldnt even buy food so that we are now sending milk to their babiesthats something that even with  years experience you dont get used to spingarn is a little rolypoly white man of  who for the past  years has been president of the national association for the advancement of colored people having served it earlier for  years as vice president and chairman of the national legal committee he can recall the times when newspapers described the early interracial meetings as sex orgies when he and his negro friends toured city saloons breaking every glass of beer they were served if charged a dollar a beeronce a bartenders habit to discourage negro patronage he also recalls the many times clients left him because they thought he was a nut    not all is well now but some things have changed through the years if saloons charge a dollar for a beer it is now levied against white as well as negro as for spingarns clients they seldom leave these days regarding him as more of a celebrity than a nut they talk about the new negro  says spingarn but theres no new negro the difference is that now a negro has the courage to tell the truth to a white man fifty years ago negroes wanted their rights as a woman wants a mink coat now theyre ready to die for them today a leader has to be militant and willing to suffer or hes out spingarn has been in this movement for a long time and if when he talks about the young leaders he does so with a hint that they are whippersnappers who somehow got around their elders it is not the most heinous of sins officially and personally his commitment is to them including the rev martin_luther_king and the freedom riders but he wants  it understood that these are people who though they travel the south in groups under the auspices of core are members of the naacp and whose energy and purpose were inculcated in them by the naacp for spingarn the dynasty is due some respect a lot of these people like the sitins think they lit the torch he says at the last naacp convention some young kids reminded me that i had led a picket line in st paul last year why i was leading picket lines in  in memphis against the assn of social workers none of this is new to me or the naacp we lit the torch and theyre carrying it now we may not be running the freedom riders but weve been trying their cases all along for once they land in jail they turn to us continues spingarn torn as he is between pride and irritation frankly i dont think anything is served by their staying in jail the way to stop segregation is through court action the protest in montgomery over bus segregation wasnt won by the marchers but by a supreme court decision it was magnificent for those people to suffer for their rights but they finally got their rights by court decision    the south is playing a waiting game the southern lawyers tell us frankly that their segregation laws are unconstitutional but they know it will take four years before they get to the supreme court and are set aside the young people just dont want to wait i wish they were better organized but i cant blame them after all weve been waiting for almost one hundred years for what were legally entitled to before joining the naacp spingarns late brother col joel spingarn was one of the original signers of the lincoln day call from which the organization grew spingarn a native new yorker studied law at columbia university he was graduated in  with an lld and began an extensive collection of negro literature which he presented to howard university in  not long after joining the naacp he tried his first case before the supreme courta white primary caseand won establishing the right of negroes to vote in primaries in texas the legal aspect has always been fun he says here you are a snip of a person you try a case and all of a sudden you make history spingarn made history  times from  to  with supreme court civil right victories there is one place he doesnt like and one place he doesnt go the south twentyfive years ago spingarn and his wife who died three years ago spent some time in the south he has rarely been back since
the prejudice northem ir  ers feel toward south erners is roughly parallel to that felt by english people toward americans and is compounded of many of the same ingredientsa thoroughgoing dislike of their public policies contempt for their level of education and culture and a sort of instinctive recoil at the sound of the accentlarded in both cases it must be said with a thick layer of that particular form of snobbishness that sneers at the provincial it is distasteful to the northerner that a human being should have the name of lady bird it grates on the northern ear to hear an educated person say sumpn and prolly or speak of a mess of fried chicken pronounced maiss of frad chickn the photographs that appear so regularly in the newspapers of white faces caught in the act of hate outside some school or drugstore fill the northerner with uneasiness and almost incredulity for when the northerner segregates and discriminates he does it on the whole slyly rather than overtly and without passion thus the white south comes to be pictured in the northern mind as an undifferentiated arid wasteland of the human intellect and spirit incongruously smeared over with a sticky coating of sugary politeness and sentimentality all the same there are hints that changes may be on the way a high school students appeal for reason in little rock a white minister leading his child past hostile mobs to school in new orleans white college kids extending the hand of  friendship to three negro classmates at georgia tech my point in going to the south was as a certain kind of tourist will often put it to see how the people really live to slide into the daily lives of people to soak up their ordinary conversation to savor their manner and manners to achieve an oblique rather than a direct look was my plan slightly easier said than done i found people are always shoving you off to talk to community leaders or to meetings where the problem is under discussion trip notes on the train through kentucky theres already a marked change of atmosphere the women on the train seem to travel in sears catalogue dreamy date dresses one is wearing a beige silk sheath spangled

will tell you they have colored friends even though they generally mean their maids but although theres abstract agreement about the inevitability of desegregation theres no agreement about implementation the when and how the editor asked me if id like to meet some women who were going to do the testing he explained in the wake of a successful sitin movement by students the year before some two hundred eating places had agreed to desegregate and now their good faith was being tested the testers a group of welldressed negro women gathered at the negro ywca for instructions and assignments there were the usual asides so familiar to anyone who has worked in pta girl scouts the usual civic organizations cant work beyond two oclock my jimmy gets back from school then sorry i couldnt come tuesday miz brown but my kids all came down with the flu efficientlooking mimeographed forms were handed out with spaces for place tested time tested environment check one low medium high attitude of waitress or manager check one poor fair good the trouble is you have to drink so much coffee before the days over confided one woman a complaint i had further occasion to hear during my travels for another view of louisville i accepted an invitation to dinner at the country club this was for me a little like being shown around a steel factory behind the iron curtain never having seen the inside of one at home i had no basis for comparison nevertheless a certain amount of southern life revolves around these country clubs and i thought it would be a good thing to have a look we were a party of five two couples and myself rather to my surprise conversation centered for a time on the servant problem i have of course heard and read of such discussions but had never before been actually present at one the subject was first broached by one of the guests a middleaged man whom i shall call mr mitchell he related the sad story of his experience with life magazine which had run a series of articles on domestic servants a life editor had called mr mitchell about his old uncle mo who has been with the mitchell family for thirtyfive years then just when mr mitchell figured the story was all set life dropped him and uncle mo and picked a servant who had been with his white folks a year longer with life many are called but few are chosen  i murmured but the other couple now chimed in along these lines why wilfred youall certainly have it easy why our chorine shes simple terrible i mean shes just awful simply ruined the best silver by pouring bleach all over it weve rechristened her chlorine  just as i was being overcome with prickly embarrassment mrs mitchell came to my rescue and turned the conversation to books mrs mitchell jerst lerves to read in fact the local branch of the public library simply cant keep up with her she just gobbles up books five or six of em a week why books are just bread and meat to her    mr mitchell demurred he never reads anything unless it has first been digested by the readers digest hes a vey vey slow reader always has been cant git through these long long books of threefour hundred pages thats asking too much of a man he means he likes reading but why drag it out so mmm youve got a point i said i felt that time was staggering on and we were somehow missing the crux of life in the south today and undertook to change the subject myself what do you think of the sitins i asked of the general assemblage mr mitchell undertook to propound the position for the group he explained that it was like this inegration may be in evitable but its gotta be fought because just as sure as night and day it will lead eventually to the mongrelization of the race using bits of tableware he illustrated here youve got a racehorse producing a fork and heres a cart horse marshaling a sugar bowl that did look a little bit like a fat plodding old nag mix em and what have you got since reader you have heard this one before i will cut it short youve got sumpn that aint fit for running and aint fit for haulinga crossbreed a misfit and what oh what have you got if you breed a slow reader with a fast reader i asked anxiously but answer came there none fortunately there are other viewpoints to be found among louisville whites louisville is the home of barry bingham publisher and owner of the liberal courierjournal bingham impressed me as one who would be more at home in london or paris than in this provincial setting a cosmopolitan in outlook and by preference yet he works conscientiously with the locals for the liberalization of racial attitudes in his hometown trip notes last day in louisville no fair using taxi drivers for copy but this ones an exception shes a rugged stronglooking woman build of marie dressier i ask her what she thinks of the sitins all for them she calls out gaily goes on to tell me about her sons elementaryschool picnic last year there were about sixty white people kids and parents and one negro boy the park custodian refused to admit the negro child upon which the whites by common agreement decided to chuck the whole thing surprising because tm not at all sure this would necessarily have been the outcome had a parallel incident happened at home in california    on to nashville tm told it is known by its inhabitants as the athens of  the south  leads one to speculate for a fanciful moment on whether athenians ever think of their city as the nashville of greece in nashville i drove to a shady road on the outskirts of town one of those roads bathed in the luminous green that is the hallmark of a southern spring you feel almost as though you were swimming through the weeds of a sunny overgrown pond so exuberant is the vegetation the large tidy house at the end of the circular drive was of the vintage of its inhabitants perhaps a little older and furnished in the style of their youth with lots of leather varnished maps flowery chintz and fringed lamps several ladies were gathered for tea which was shortly served by a prim negro maid the sweet soft voices twittered away i declare francielou these brownies are just mouth watering and i never did get my ramblers to bloom just right last spring but then the weather was downright unseasonable touches of lace rose and fell on dimity bosoms old fingers groped in purses for photographs of grandchildren one might have stumbled into a scene from a mary petty drawing soon enough as often happens in a gathering of the leisured elderly the conversation turned to good works the particular form of good works practiced by these ladies for the past several months was being observers at the negro sitins the role of an observer they explained to me was merely to sit at the lunch counter or in the theatre where negroes were seeking accommodation and in silence to lend moral support to the effort there was no contact between observer and sitin demonstrator and no words were ever exchanged nevertheless by some sort of mental telepathy as one expressed it the friendly intent of the observer was usually somehow transmitted to the negro group looking round at these particular observers i felt it wouldnt require much detective work to divine that a woolworths lunch counter was not their customary eating place nor son of tarzan their preferred form of entertainment i dont think miz beardsley ever set foot in a woolworths before in all her bom days confided one because she turned to me real surprised and said why whod have thought they serve coffee in these places  mrs beardsley had good cause to find out that they not only serve coffee but ply the customers with free refills for after two hours during which because of a temporary breakdown of organization no negroes showed up she was heard to complain in an agonized stage whisper where in the world are they i simply cant drink any more colfeeand i must find the ladies room coffee drinking seems to loom large in this struggle with a hundred or more white observers involved mostly women with free daytime hours to devote a few minor hitches were bound to develop one lady sailed angrily up to an acquaintance who had merely stopped at a lunch counter for a bite to eat after a hot afternoon of shopping and snapped what are you doing here this place is reserved for the unitarians integration of the movie theatres presented yet another problem informal agreement was finally reached with some of the theatre managers that negroes would be admitted but to smooth the initial stages of the change they would be expected to walk directly to their seats and not to stand in the lobby patronize the candy stand or use the restrooms a white lady observer seeing a negro patron in front of her move as though to rise from his seat reached forward and grabbed him saying loudly youre not supposed to go to the restroom what early experience or sudden turn in life had prompted the missionary zeal of the observers this was hard to discover i guess ive always felt this way ever since i was a child said one its just  that there was never any opportunity to do anything about it until the sitins started i was to get the same sort of answer from many another southern white i spent an afternoon with an elderly intellectual one of those rare women whose entire life is spent in the realm of scholarly endeavor she was a leading authority on boswell and johnson a translator of eighteenthcentury french poetry a student of modern thought from freud to sartreand an alert interesting conversationalist at one point i asked her what she thought the outcome of the segregation problem would be she became exceedingly ruffled and answered quite crossly to tell you the truth i never give it a thought evidently to think about this particular problem would be disturbing and in an area in which she had no wish to be disturbed if one stayed long enough in the company of people like the observer ladies it might be possible to get the wrong impression it would not be difficult to travel through the south entirely in such company for today they exist to one extent or another in every state even in the deep southand like all minority thinkers they tend to hang together they are for the most part a deeply dedicated lot in the north there are countless numbers of white people who contribute occasionally to core or naacp go once in a while to a meeting or lecture on race problems and vote for a local negro candidate but these activities are on the periphery of their lives among the southerners i met who have taken a stand for integration it seems to have swallowed them whole and to occupy their every waking moment once you start out with the integrationists they are likely to pass you from hand to hand and from town to town without giving you much chance to peer at the other side i mentioned this to a young attorney originally from jackson whom i met in nashville he laughed and said you should tra meetin kissin jim folsom thatd open yo ass for a moment i was frozen with astonishmentuntil i realized he was saying eyes trip notes atlanta so far everywhere vve been louisville nashville and now atlanta people keep saying this isnt the real south or its more of a border city yet they look like southerners they talk like southerners they act like southerners i gather what they really mean is that atlanta nashville and louisville have better newspapers better colleges more enlightened leadership and consequently better race relations than other southern communities therefore to say they are not the real south seems vaguely unfair i met a couple of southern belles  models the first was a senior at a womens college on the outskirts of atlanta academically the best school in the south she told me she had the delicate look of a spring floweryet a certain bounciness of mannerand that special softness and highness of voice often encountered in southern women what made me join the sitins i dont know i always wanted to do something about discrimination when i saw them there i felt i had no choice but to join in she said she had not known any of the negro participants one day she was downtown shopping and came across a negro picket line i just started picketing with them but the tears were rolling down my cheeks the second southern belle conventionally honeyhaired and blueeyed was introduced to me by her mother who said i want you to meet my lil ole jailbird daughter shes just been in and out of those jails since the sitins started havent you lambchop and now shes on her way to jackson with the freedom riders lambchop an honor student at her southern college is jeopardizing a coveted junior year abroad by making the dangerous journey to jackson but with her as with a growing number of her generation the mewvement as they all pronounce it must come first the little old jailbirds attractive and delightful mother took me to some meetings where i met the men and women of goodwill who were busily organizing for ddaythat day toward the end of summer when the schools would be desegregated for the first time dont ever say integration we like to call it desegregationit sounds so much more palatable somehow a network of committees and subcommittees with their cleverly contrived nameshope for help our public education oasis for organizations assisting schools in septemberwere meeting almost daily often to the background whir of a mimeograph machine grinding out the latest mailing from the toplevel planners including y leaders churchmen schoolboard people to the neighborhood groups and youth committees hundreds were involved in this huge humanitarian enterprise i heard the superintendent of schools tell a gathering that police protection for the entering students would be as carefully planned as the invasion of japan it was all thrilling and heartwarming and inspiringwith one tragiccomic aspect this great outpouring of bestintentioned energy was directed to the very modest end that nine negro children out of a hundred thirtyeight applicants should be allowed peacefully to take their rightful places at high school these nine had survived a barrage of tests academically they had to be above the fiftieth percentile of the school to which they sought transfer their behavior record had to be blameless their personalities had to be declared outstanding no such interpretation of the tests was made for their white classmates which leads one to speculate whether the old phrase separate but equal is  being supplanted for the negroes by the concept together but vastly superior trip notes montgomery at last people have stopped saying this isnt the real south my favorite sort of houses everywhere white frame two or more stories most with nineteenthcentury gingerbread trim even in the better suburbs none of this splitlevel streamlined modern that gets so tiresome in wealthy california    everything half hidden by the rampaging vegetation of a corotmonetmanet land  the frescoes round the walls of the rotunda in the state capitol incredibly like the worst examples of soviet art depicting scenes of montgomery history one titled the golden years shows a group of happy slaves toting bales of something each with delighted smile on face no postcards of this available to my sorrow as i should have liked to tease my friends at home with them  the elite cafe fine food pronounced eelight cafe fan fude    weeds pushing up all over the tennis courts in the immense public park a couple of years ago negroes won a court decision granting them use of the park so the city authorities closed it up for everybody    noses and faces being respectively cut off and spited all over    they disbanded the zoo too and now if you want to take the kids to the zoo you have to go all the way to birmingham where the zoo is integrated social gatherings in montgomery are full of echoes of the past the food in private houses tends to be in the shape of thingsicecream boats or hearts fishshaped aspic saladsand almost everything is creamed not only creamed but served with cream sauce the fare is as mild and gentle as the ladies themselves no bitter or pungent taste to offset the bland no crisp consistency to contrast with the soft the very form of conversation seems more nineteenth century than contemporary at ladies lunches the talk proceeds like a croquet game with three standard opening moves  the weather well is it hot enough for you  the food about which someone is bound to declare pretty near the beginning that rosiebelles whateveritis is just simply out of this world  the frontalassault type of compliment where somebody declares that my you get younger looking every day and how in the world do you manage it and goes on to bet your husband doesnt like to let you out of his sight for one single minute this sort of remark may as well be delivered to a matron of fifty as to the latest bride and trips off the tongue as readily exaggeration as a way of life may confuse the auslander my hostess answers the telephone and is heard to say why janie thats just about the nicest thing i ever heard in my whole life upon being asked later what the call was about it turns out that janie has invited us over for a drink no use to comment that my hostess must have had a rather thin time if that was really just about the nicest thing she ever heard in her whole life she merely stares uncomprehendingly as conversation warms up which of course it does eventually the sense of the past is intensified for so much of it deals with endless ramifications of family history and gossip about old times one thing leading to another the longago romances of aunts williejo and sarahmarie cousins robbielou and marigold are brought out for examination and speculation anecdotes often end and the thing of it was he simply up and took a shotgun and blew his brains out and of course she was found in the river we all felt so bad and no one ever did exactly get the right of what happened the poor feller just actually took to the bottle well you know he did and of course its in the family his father died an alcoholic and well anyway i declare one day they found him in the garage hanging from a belt    of course nothing was ever proved about it but they do say her death was not accidental few seem to have died in their beds all this in surprising contrast to the peachycreamy surface of life in montgomery the montgomery country club is much like the one in louisville spacious oldfashioned with french windows giving onto a long outdoor terrace presumably for gonewiththewindish occasions  as in louisville good whiskey and terrible food are served by old familyretainer types of negroes in white coats there were a lot of young people in the crowd girls in diaphanous evening dresses boys in white dinner jackets their talk was all but incomprehensible their yalls rang out like rebel yells i found myself talking to a middleaged man introduced to me as a member of the school board so we discussed education in its noncontroversial aspects for i was a guest and on my best behavior the topic was the difficult situation of the unusually bright child whether he should be skipped or handled otherwise it is a safe and wellplotted subject with enough on the one hands and on the other hands to keep one going for a while my interlocutor explained that in his district the problem is being tackled by grouping the children within each grade according to ability i rejoined that the same system obtains in oakland californiaand could not help adding that in our grammar school there is a fifthgrade group of six children with iqs of over two whites two orientals and two negroes with genuine foreheadwrinkling puzzlement and no apparent rancor the schoolboard member drawled is that so it dont seem possible no nigra could have an iq of  do it now i started to say to me it do    when our hostess hurriedly bore me off to talk to someone else  for a breath of fresh air i went to the mass meeting in the negro community where reverend martin_luther_king jr was to speak with the freedom riders actually the air was disturbingly filled with tear gas at one point and no one quite knew if wed get out of there alive the hostile white crowd outside which had been gathering for some time before the meeting was suitably attired i noted with approval in the latest thing in mob wear in faded cotton frocks revealing insectbitten bare legs or dirty shirts and jeans they might have been movie extras assembled by a rather unimaginative director to do a corny mob scene a wellread lot they appeared to be too versed in the literature of their region surely that halfbeatendown halfsavage look that casualyetbrutal slouch that mean glitter in the eye could only be achieved by one with at least a passing acquaintance with the works of faulkner tennessee williams and eudora welty there was only a handful of police and a squad of very nervouslooking us marshals to achieve the church i parked my borrowed car nearby and walked past the extras with all deliberate speed as the supreme court would sayfor being hatted gloved and stockinged i felt more than a little conspicuous inside the church was a loud m sweetsinging haven warmly enveloping it was filled far beyond its normal seating capacity with people of all ages darksuited men women in best dresses and flowered hats little girls in party shoes little boys wriggling in their stiff collars as the evening wore on its nightmare quality began to unfold first there was the tear gas an alien and threatening odor next incredibly reverend king was telling us in matteroffact tones that the mob outside was completely out of control they had injured some of the us marshals and had overturned and burned a car the implication was rather strong that the church might be next more incredibly the vast packed audience was taking it in stride there was not a sign of panic not a shriek not a fainting fit just murmurs of yes lord thats right lots of singing lots of patient confidence it seemed to go on forever and ever later it was announced by a general of the alabama national guard that no one could leave the church until morning because of the danger outside the atmosphere became positively jollylike an impromptu camping expedition i thought as we prepared to make ourselves as comfortable as possible for the long hours of confinement searching that sea of calm determined faces i felt as though id stumbled on the very source of strength that would brace a young girl to exchange a year in paris for a stretch in the jackson prison or a provincial gentlewoman to brave the scorn of her set by publicly giving a hand to the negro sitins some time after five oclock in the morning having learned that my borrowed car was the unlucky one that had been demolished earlier i was driven home in an alabama national guard jeep it was a morning of startling beauty a soft warm breezy dawn in which the lovely town looked its best trip notes montgomery after the freedom riders the fire marshal came round to see me about the burnedup car i was rather hoping he might be interested in finding the vandals who had destroyed it but he asked whether i was connected with core or naacp whether i had made other stops in the south or had come directly to montgomery from california whether l had attended regular church that sunday morning whether i knew anyone else who was at the meeting why  went whether my friends had lent me the car of their own free will  an editorial in the montgomery journal deplores the view that mob violence will chase industry from montgomery it points out that atlanta had the greatest race riot in history in  six hundred negroes killed and carted off in trucks and look at flourishing industrial atlanta today  a twentytwoyearold english student here is in trouble she was quoted in a maninthestreet interview as saying negroes should be allowed to go any place they wish i am for integration of the races a hundred per cent since when for some reason she has been dropped from of all things the englishspeaking union  the country clubbers have vanished from my life like summer snow since the carburning one of them called me sounding absolutely terrified to say a rumor was spreading that she had accompanied me to the meeting that her husband and inlaws are furious with her for even knowing me that it wouldnt be safe for us to meet again    twentytwo students from auburn university signed a letter which appeared in the montgomery advertiser first sane thing to appear locally theyve since been hanged in effigy on campus by counterstudents  a local white couple fred and ann gach have been tried and fined for disturbing the peace they saw a negro freedom rider being stopped by a mob asked three policemen to stop the beating to no avail finally the gaches were arrested when a policeman was assigned to escort them home and they refused to accompany him on the basis that one policeman could not protect them just before i left i was smuggled into one last drawing room for tea by now there was virtually only one topic of conversation in montgomery the freedom riders and for comic relief the case of the young english girl versus the englishspeaking union after the usual preliminary comments on the weather the strawberry cream cake and the youth and beauty of all present our hostess patiently undertook to put me wise to the basic objection to the freedom riders integration of the busstation facilities would surely lead to intermarriage but does one usually marry a person because one sits next to him at a bus stop she answered with glint in eye and scarlett ohara toss of head honey when ah sit next to a man any manah jest cant help thinkin jest how hed be you know to make love to ah might jest as well come right out and say itin baid now you know

visitors to the beautiful city of seattle of which there will be throngs this worlds fair year will blink no eye to see the stars and stripes floating over the tall buildings nor give any particular thought to the  wonderful addition western washington makes to our country they do not realize how it might have been otherwise how our northern boundary line which runs straight to the pacific shore once threatened to loop down around that lovely northwest corner and draw it into british territory had that happened the union jack would now be flying over the canadian waters of puget sound and some southern british columbia metropolis would reign where seattle stands in this connection there is a story which deserves attention but has never been completely and forthrightly told it concerns the impact made on the outcome of the boundary dispute by the personality of a remarkable negro george washington bush details about bushs early years are sketchy and contradictory but best information indicates that he was born in pennsylvania in  his parents were servants to a shipping magnate named stevenson with whose household they moved to tennessee when the bushes remained faithful retainers to the end caring for their master and his wife in their declining years they were left the stevenson fortune george their only child was educated among the quakers of philadelphia and though some of their gentle peaceloving philosophy rubbed off on him he nevertheless joined the army during the war of  he fought under general andrew jackson at the battle of new orleans and is sometimes credited with having made important suggestions to jackson in connection with the barricades which helped to win the engagement not yet through with adventure george bush became a voyageur with the furtrading companies sometime in the s employed first by robidou of st louis and later by the hudsons bay company for two years he traveled widely over the plains and mountains of the wilderness west and even made a visit to the pacific coastan experience which was to influence the most important decision of his later life undoubtedly the stevenson inherited money helped to stake him to a start in life when he was ready to settle down and he became a farmer stockraiser and nurseryman but it was due to his own intelligence and industry that he prospered possibly he farmed in illinois before his furtrading travels afterwards he settled in missouri first in boone county later moving westward into clay county having remained a bachelor until he was past  in  bush took as his wife isabella james a twentyyearold girl of germanamerican extraction to the couple five sons were born in rapid succession meantime in faraway oregon the historic situation was building up in which george bush was to play his part this was the international quarrel over the spoils of discovery along the north pacific coast at first four nations were involved but when in  spain gave up her claim north of the nd parallel of latitude the oregoncalifornia line of today and in  russia agreed to stop her southern advance at ° the approximate middle of the present province of british columbia the united states and great britain were left to quarrel over the intervening territorya strip  miles wide stretching from the rocky mountains to the pacific ocean then generally known as oregon from the beginning the american government was loud and belligerent in its demand for all the territory north to the  th parallel which was the westward extension of the northern boundary of the louisiana purchase this would have given the united states roughly twothirds of the disputed territory whereas the most the british felt impelled to yield up was onethird the u s did have an excellent claim to the columbia river and in  after the russian position was stablized at ° the british government offered the columbia as the boundary line from the th parallel to the sea this offer reduced the territory in dispute to about twothirds of the present state of washington including the okanogan valley the kittitas and yakima valleys the washington cascades the fertile western lowlands the puget sound country and the beautiful olympic peninsula the u s unwilling to modify its claim to this extent haughtily refused the offer with the matter thus in stalemate the two govern ments agreed in  to continue to occupy the territory jointly which they had been doing by treaty since  for the next fifteen years the situation remained virtually unchanged a few american missionaries furtraders and settlers were attracted to the region but these took land to the south and east of the columbia in territory already understood to be american through the last british offer meantime the hudsons bay company had established the trading posts of fort vancouver on the north bank of the columbia fort nisqually near puget sound and fort langley on the fraser river as well as agricultural colonies on the cowlitz and nisqually prairies which strengthened the british position north of the river then in the early s a new force rolled westward over the plains waves of american emigrants boiling with oregon fever bringing wives children and possessions in covered wagons as families descended the columbia it became the duty of dr john mcloughlin chief factor at fort vancouver to direct the settlers into the rich willamette valley to the south and keep them out of the disputed territory to the british the columbia river was still the dividing line and they meant to keep it after a couple of years in which only small parties traveled westward a great migration took place in  wagons  people  head of oxen and cattle early the next year talk drifted back to missouri of rich lands to be had in oregon for the taking of cattle and grain selling there at four times their price in the midwest some of bushs white friends and neighbors were determined to move to oregon to better themselves bushs knowledge of the west gained in his voyageur days would be an asset on the trip and they urged bush to join them george bush was by then a wealthy man but that circumstance had not kept his family from suffering the indignities of race prejudice bush felt that his sons would have a better opportunity in free oregon than in the slave state of missouri which was already growing bitter with the ferments which were to lead to the civil war and where feelings against free negroes were growing virulent so bush decided to go and thus became the wealthiest man to migrate to oregon in pioneer days he took with him seeds nursery trees implements and herds of stock and the story is also told how he carried one hundred pounds of silver nailed under a false bottom in his wagon but unlike many wealthy men he was kind and generous and he furnished teams and money out of his own pocket for some of his neighbors who started west with him the party as made up consisted of george bush michael t simmons david kindred james mcallister gabriel jones their wives and children and three single men  mike simmons was a tall resolute kentuckian who was genial generous and strong in his attachment he and bush were very close friends and they complimented each other very well for simmons impulsiveness sometimes needed the temper of bushs sage counsel while simmons was more aggressive in fighting for his friends rights than the forgiving quakerraised farmer the wagons of the bush party joined with others until a train of some  wagons was formed the train traveled forward in the spring of  under a quasimilitary organization of which mike simmons was elected colonel a position which put him second in command when the general who was in command spent most of his time galloping after buffalo the real leadership fell on simmons shoulders and simmons in turn relied greatly on bushs shrewdness resourcefulness and knowledge of the country the spring proved tremendously rainy rivers were so swollen with flood that the wagons were delayed and the train reached the western slopes behind schedule and with many of its members desperately short of provisions in the emergency bush helped at least twenty destitute families out of his own stores and pocket a nd then on reaching the dalles on the columbia river the ax fell even while the simmonsled party toiled westward that spring settlers from missouri who had reached oregon the fall before had been busy putting their race intolerance to work the organic law adopted by the provisional government set up by willamette valley settlers in  included an antislavery ordinance to which in june  the slavestate missourians were able to force a harsh amendment the amendment forbade the settlement of free negroes in oregon on pain of a lashing not less than  nor more than  stripes if any should remain longer than two years thus the bushes after giving up their old missouri home after traveling two thousand miles through the wilderness seeking tolerance reached oregon to find the door slammed in their faces a not wanted sign affixed by means of a stilettopointed whip handle the feelings of the bushes at this point cannot be described their companions reacted in outraged indignation with deep disappointment for themselves for they were too deeply indebted to george bush too fond of him and his family to abandon them and if the bushes could not settle south of the columbia neither would they the willamette valley was out and also the rogue river valley farther south which they had been considering they soon discovered that the jurisdiction of the provisional government did not extend into british territory on the north side of the columbia and on going  down the river they camped twenty miles east of fort vancouver on the washougal river where they remained for nearly a year during the winter the men of the party cut shakes which simmons and bush took to fort vancouver to exchange for provisions meantime the party was casting about for a place where bush could settle permanently in the fall simmons had become interested in reports of the inland sea of puget sound to the north and had made an exploring trip in that direction but was forced to turn back before reaching his goal even had he been successful he and his friends could hardly have defied dr mcloughlin they like most of the other american immigrants who reached the lower columbia arrived so short of provisions as to find themselves dependent upon the hudsons bay company the only source of supply the overland migration of american citizens had put dr mcloughlin in a compromising position if some of the american parties should starve after reaching the promised land it would certainly discourage others from starting and mcloughlins superiors desired him to deny the resources of the hudsons bay company to the arriving americans but mcloughlin possessed too humanitarian a heart to let women and children suffer he lent the necessary aidwhich only encouraged more families to come so now here was george bush and his party with a need to escape north from the negro whipping law both bush and simmons were outstanding intelligent men of the type to gain the chief factors regard and the good doctor was a tolerant man who himself knew the stings of race prejudice who had once caned a man for insulting his indian wife so dr mcloughlins sympathies were aroused by bushs plight and sometime during the spring of  he found his humanitarian inclinations again running counter to the policy of his company and to british interests in july  mike simmons again went north to explore puget sound this time successfully it seems sure that a private understanding with the chief factor had already been arrived at and in october when simmons led the rest of his party to a permanent settlement on the sound he carried with him a letter from dr mcloughlin to dr william f tolmie the superintendent of the agricultural company at nisqually asking tolmie to cooperate with the americans by providing them with supplies bush simmons and their friends spent fifteen days in cutting a road north from cowlitz landing for their wagons on arriving at the south end of the sound simmons took a claim at the falls in the deschutes river bush on the adjacent prairie afterwards known as bush prairie and the others on land nearby all within a radius of six miles this little colony represented the first definite breach in the britishheld line true one american john r jackson had settled in the cowlitz valley earlier that same year but whereas one man made little impression a party of thirtytwo men women and children carried real weight meantime a shift in the american position on the boundary question had been loudly trumpeted during his campaign for the presidency in  james k polk had whipped up oregon emotionalism and promised if elected to demand the end of joint occupancy and to go to war with great britain if necessary to win the whole of the disputed territoryyes clear to the russian line this brash threat gained popular support and the cry fiftyfour forty or fight helped put polk in the white house though there was no new basis for this northward shift in american demands which resulted from sheer yankee bluster the development was an alarming one to the british american settlers were pouring into the willamette valley so fast as to have doubled their numbers and now that an american colony was established on puget sound it would be impossible to keep other emigrants in check south of the columbia should they surge on north of the th parallel the american government might find good grounds for its new demand for all of oregon this unhappy possibility caused the british to yield suddenly and in  after thirty years of refusal they agreed to adopt the th parallel as international boundary to puget sound there to dip down to the strait of juan de fuca to give the british the whole of vancouver island the treaty which was concluded on june   filled out the northwest corner of the united states as we see it on maps today historians assess in differing measures the reasons for this dramatic british capitulation but an important factor was the pressure of american immigration and fear of its northward trenda fear aggravated by dr mcloughlins failure to restrain the bush party south of the columbia river so it cannot be denied that the bush partys invasion of the forbidden field helped to tip the scales in uncle sams favor nor that this sequence of events resulted directly from george bushs worth of character had he not proved kind and neighborly in missouri and charitable and responsible during the westward trek his companions would have marched off to the rogue river valley without him even then had he not won the sympathy of dr mcloughlin the way to puget sound probably would have remained barred bush may never have been fully cognizant of the influence exerted on the outcome of the boundary dispute by his decision to go north  to puget sound to find a free home if he did understand it the results must have seemed ironic with the signing of the oregon treaty the organic law of the provisional government was extended to the th parallel in this way the odious ordnance followed him north and within one year fell on him and his family in their new home but bush had staunch white friends who had seen him through before mike simmons who was appointed a justice of the peace under the provisional government traveled to oregon city where he pleaded bushs case so earnestly that he succeeded in having a special act passed removing bushs race disability but though bush could now reside in the territory legally he still endured other forms of discrimination ezra meeker pioneer washington historian has dwelt on bushs difficult position he was a true american and yet without a country he owed allegiance to the flag and yet the flag would not own him he was firmly held to obey the law and yet the law would not protect him he could not hold landed property and his oath would not be taken in a court of law not being able to hold landed property was the worst feature of this injustice for bush with his characteristic energy and intelligence had immediately set out to make his  acre homestead a model farm he grew wonderful garden produce raised fat stock harvested manybushelled acres of wheat and other grains and set out an orchard he helped others with seeds and nursery stock he supplied the money to buy the mill irons for the first sawmill erected on puget sound built in  by a group of settlers led by mike simmons the bush pioneer home on the prairie became a way station on the route between cowlitz landing and the sound where travelers were welcomed with unhesitating hospitality all who met bush were forced to admire him then during the winter of  a time of near famine the fame of the negro pioneer spread more widely bush proved to be the only man on the sound with surplus stores of wheat and seattle speculators offered him a fortune for the supply but he refused to profit from the misfortunes of his fellow citizens he kept his wheat and apportioned it out fairly and charitably in april  washington territory was divided off from oregon territory olympia only a few miles from the bush homestead became the capital within a month of the first meeting of the new territorial legislature in  friends of simmons and bush among the lawmakers succeeded in having a memorial passed asking the u s congress to grant bush title to the section of land on which he had lived for nearly ten years in this memorial bushs white champions said of him his habits of life during said time have been exemplary and industrious and that by constant and laborious cultivation of said claim and by an accommodating and and charitable disposal of his produce to immigrants he had contributed much toward the settlement of this territory the suffering and needy never having applied to him in vain for succor and assistance and that at the present time the said george bush has a large portion of the said claim under a high state of cultivation and has upon it a good frame house and convenient outhouses in all amounting to several hundred dollars and in view of the premises aforesaid your memorialists are of the opinion that the case is of such meritorious nature that congress ought to pass a special law donating to him his said claim congress complied with the request granting george w bush the title to his homestead on january   after that he continued to farm for eight more years and brought the first reaper and mower to the sound he died in  his wife in  one more boy had been born to the couple after they reached puget sound and their six sons carried on the tradition of their father they were among the  most industrious and enterprising citizens in thurston county according to historian george h himes william owen bush the oldest son raised wheat which was awarded first premium at the philadelphia exposition of  over all other wheat in the world and also medals at the buffalo and chicago worlds fairs descendants of george bush continued to live on the old homestead for one hundred years and the bush name has become so outstanding it will even be found in family records of washington pioneers compiled by the dar of washington statethe irony being that none of the information given reveals that bush was a negro recent newspaper articles about bush simmons and the early colony on the deschutes river also carefully omit this fact but the identity of george washington bush must not be denied he was a negro an ornament to his race who through sheer goodness won through to puget sound where the american flag followed and in the end extended its privileges to him
