inside nigeria
many foreigners have often seen nigeria with her  million people living in   square miles of territory not only as a large and exciting country but also as a selfconfident democratic and stable country in which freedom and moderation are the chief determinants of national life no doubt there is some truth in this evaluation although the political stability has often hidden the lacklustre political leadership and venality within a countrys maturity nehru has said is measured by the questions it poses to itself and its failure is often due to its posing the wrong questions just now nigeria politicians talk of tribes chieftaincies and religion while the basic socioeconomic problems of the dayfull employment and social reconstruction for instanceinterest but a few moneybags appeal to them more than lofty thinkers yet the spiritual life of europe today belongs to christ and marx not croesus or charlemagne of asia to buddha rather than famenane or genghis khan and without the creators of vision to guide them the people are doomed to decay the federal government of the northern peoples congress npc and the national council of nigeria and the cameroons ncnc has all the virtues and vices of coalitions especially one between a feudal and a socialdemocratic party there is caution and there is confidence but speed and imagination are often iacidng while the npc is shedding some of the worst excesses of its feudal philosophytribalism and class demarcationat the national level the ncnc has had to abandon much of its socialist dreams of the agitational days before independence for both sir abubakar balewa the npc prime minister and dr nnamdi azikiwe expresident of the ncnc and now nigerias governor general want to see the ni gerian constitution work and therefore they use their influence to dampen the eagerness of their more extreme supporters who want a change in the status quo although their regional colleagues feel themselves free to experiment along feudal or socialist lines as they wish in their sphere of influence ironically the conservative orientation of the federal government has driven the fascistinclined action group opposition more and more to the left so that today the party which in  abjured any consorting with foreign ideologies and five years later saw republicanism as the daydream of a lunatic fringe of the nationalist movement has become a great champion of socialist nationalisation and now advocates a republican constitution for nigeria and a union of african states the ag which in the  federal election campaign advocated a prowestern foreign policy for nigeria is today urging for a positive neutralist line and friendly relations with the communist states the party is committed to a policy of creating three more states out of the existing regions three in number and it therefore sees the recent decision by the nigerian parliament to establish a fourth midwest region as a triumph of its policy curiously enough it was the ncnc which under dr azikiwes leadership spearheaded the struggle for nigerian freedom and laid the foundations of its socialist and republican traditions but under the necessities of office today finds itself fighting a rearguard action against the forces of political radicalism in the country like the social democratic parties of western europe the british labour party french socialist party the german spd etc whose dilemma it is facing todaya choice between the old capitalist enemy and the new communist ogre the ncnc is now fighting shy of nationalization of the basic industries and the establishment of a republic what with its recurrent internal crises and lack of clarity as to objectives it has ceased to enjoy that overwhelming mass appeal which made it the truly national organization in the heyday of its struggle for national freedoma fate that has met the pakistan muslim league and the sudanese umma party whose ineptitude and corruption invited a military dictatorship in their country a few years after independence to recapture the massive popular support of its agitational days the ncnc must needs establish high standards of integrity and austerity such as dr nkrumah is currently imposing on his cpp colleagues in ghana in place of the acquisitive and exhibitionist propensities of the leaders the party must no longer mistake mediocrity for moderation and must ensure that its standardbearers are not men of thermidor little men of great inheritance who are not seasoned in the struggle or attuned to the powerful forces now moving the continent of africa today many nigerians and their foreign admirers have often pointed to the size of the country as a criterion for its leadership of africa but size alone is not enough and to advance nigerias claim to african leadership she must not only have something to give to others in the sphere of goods and ideas but also she must produce great leaders frances greatness was once focussed on a louis xiv or a napoleon as indias contemporary influence in world affairs can be attributed to the greatness of her nehru in africa the struggle for independence has thrown up a number of towering personalities nassar in egypt houghuetboigny in ivory coast sekou toure in guinea jomo kenyatta in kenya nkrumah in ghana and so on has nigeria produced a dominant national figure who can be said to exceed these in greatness or who with her vast national resources behind him can assert the nigerian personality on the world stage to the extent for instance that an nkrumah has done for ghana or a mao tse tung for china many nigerians will say that dr azikiwe is the man and at one time there could have been no doubt as to the greatest african of them all but when in nigeria the people reflect their uncertainty in the multiplicity of their national leadership prime minister balewa is always mentioned along with governor general azikiwe and northern premier ahmadu bello leader of balewas party the northern peoples congress while opposition leader obafemi awolowo and the other regional premiers michael okpara for the eastern region and samuel akintola for the western region closely trail behind with diverse followerships and ideologies on top of this a sizable number of extreme radicals reject the leadership of all six and so africa does not know nigerias man of destiny just because nigerians themselves do not know him to lead people one must be able to reflect their inmost moods and interests in all parts of africa today there is an irresistible demand for independence for selfexpression for developmentan instinctive desire which some englishspeaking nationalists have described as the assertion of the african personality and the frenchspeaking africans see in terms of negritudeand it follows that no nation will be accepted as leader of contemporary africa which does not reflect this moving desire of africans everywhere to assert themselves after many centuries of imperialist degradation this mystic faith in independence has also an important corollary for many african nationalists the unity of africa and breaking down of the arbitrary barriers imposed by the th century scramble for africa by european powers it does not matter if this desire for union is seen by the realists as a mere daydream for dreams are the stuff out of which great realities are woven and in our lifetime we have seen idealist dreams about socialism and the freedom of afroasian nations realised to a marvellous degree what is more regional groupings are sprouting forth in both east and west of the continent and recent conferences in tunis monrovia addis ababa and cassablanca indicate that the idea of african unity is gaining ground all over the continent the question now is has nigeria this strong mystic faith in african unity and independence i am not sure that she does as yet at least to the degree necessary to inspire others to dare for these great ideals the popularity which countries like ghana and the united arab republic enjoy among many africans derive from their pulsating faith in the cause of african unity and independence even of african socialism thus when egypt challenged successfully the might of anglofrench imperialism over the suez canal in  or ghana rushed aid to distressed guinea congo and south african nationalists she elicited the admiration of ardent nationalists everywhere who wish quickly to redress the wrongs which theoretical oppositional elements are being systematically repressed in all three regions through the agency of the customary courts and denial of state patronage while the freedom of speech is nullified by the men of means who can fool and mislead the people through their control of the organs of public opinion moreover the big monopolies have made nonsense of personal freedom by their control of the organs of employment and entertainment fixing their own prices and influencing the law in their sole interest it is true that independence has brought increased prosperity to the governmentariansthe ministers contractors senior civil servants and their dependentsbut the vast majority of the people live in a background of dismal and abject poverty born to a regime of endless night this squandering of national values has had the worst effect among the youth who forever see promise mocked by performance and look in vain for any systematic revival of national culture or for the rationalisation of foreign techniques in order to usher increased wellbeing for the people yet nigerialarge rich radianthas a great destiny for in its illimitable space thought and things can develop and this slumbering giant is likely some day to startle the world in an age in which the problems of africa dominate international politics
rupture in labors ranks
much of the civil_rights progress that has been achieved in recent years can be attributed to the effective cooperation of jewish and negro antidiscrimination agencies these groups together with the support of key trade union officials are largely responsible for the passage of fair employment legislation in eighteen states they are the effective force behind the drive for open occupancy in housing they have backed attempts to implement the u s supreme courts school desegregation decision and they have given their time money and moral support to the students involved in the movement yet the fact is that the negro jewish civil_rights coalition now faces disruption a dissolution that seems symptomatic of the worsening relations between white and negro liberals in general the winds of change sweeping africa are also stirring the surfaces of negro life in america they are setting events in motion which seem to be taking the american negro into increasingly militant and uncharted courses of action what white liberals often regard as progress negroes increasingly have come to reject as mere tokenism and correspondingly many white liberals have begun to regard negro militancy as racist selfseekingthe first cracks in the negrojewish civil_rights coalition appeared after the formation of the negro american labor council an organization of negro trade unionists founded two years ago by a philip randolph president of the brotherhood of sleeping car porters and sole negro member of the aflcio executive council the nalc has emerged as a most outspoken critic of token progress in race relations within the labor movement while several jewish trade union leaders and two important jewish labor agenciesthe jewish labor committee and the american jewish committees national labor servicemore and more have been placed in the position of defending the official line of organized labor that the unions have made substantial progress in civil_rights job equality and related issues thus to the comfort and cheer of many conservative elements within the unions the creation of the nalc has served to divide longtime allies in the struggle for civil_rights on july   seventyfive negro trade unionists met in new york city at the request of a philip randolph to discuss the problems which confront negroes in the labor movement and those which face the negro union leaders within the negro community in the course of his long career randolph had made several previous attempts to build a mass organization rooted in the negro  working class the most notable of which was the famed march on washington movement that resulted in an executive order from president franklin d roosevelt in  to establish the wartime fepc he was unsuccessful however along with frank crosswaith and othersin developing a more permanent organization under the name of the negro labor committee the principal difficulty being the lack in that period of a sizable and firm base of negro union members but as herbert northrup among others has shown large numbers of negroes entered unions through the world war ii labor shortages and the postwar economic boom the result is that today any negro labor organization has as a potential base some  million negroes who are now members of the aflcio moreover a growing number of negroes hold posts in labor organizations both large and small and participate regularly in union conventions ironicallyin the light of subsequent eventsthe committee of seventyfive summoned in  by randolph decided that what the present situation required was a permanent organization patterned after the jewish labor committee the nalc would speak for organized labor in the negro community just as the jewish labor committee did in the jewish community and in carrying on its fight for equality within the labor movement the new organization would ally itself as its jewish counterpart had done with other civil_rights organizations the committee of seventyfive called for a founding convention in a declaration which foreshadowed the tone and style of the nalc established some ten months after this first meeting we resent jim crow locals we deplore the freezeout against negroes in labor apprenticeship and training programs we disclaim the lack of upgrading and promotional opportunities for negroes we repudiate the lockout against negroes by some unions we above all reject tokenism that thin veneer of acceptance masquerading as democracy since hundreds of thousands of negroes are the victims of this hypocrisy we ourselves must seek the cure in terms of hundreds of thousands in the dimensions of a mass organization randolphs reasons for helping to establish the negro american labor council are as he presents them clearcut and logical he argues that since the trade unions are essentially urban organizations and since negroes are moving to cities in large numbers it thus follows that labors future is tied up with the future of the negro randolph emphasizes that aflcio president george meany is not a racist yet meany hasnt a sense of the urgency of the question that is necessary in the th century randolph doubts in fact if anyone except a negro can have that sense the new organization over which randolph presides is then a response to the basic need of the negro masses to have a voice of their own and as randolph firmly adds the voice of black labor is not going to be consonant with those voices that come from nonnegro sources or from negroes themselves that are nonlabor there is another side to the activities of the nalc randolph believes that his group represents the last chance of preserving the  influence of organized labor in negro affairs the negro community possesses two principal mass organizations other than the political machine james z wilson notes in his important new book negro politics the labor unions and the churches in recent years however the unions have come under attack because of their discriminatory practices and organized labor has come to be viewed less as an instrument of negro militancy than as a proper object of it under these circumstances the officers of the nalc as veteran trade unionists think that their organization can save labors standing within the negro community insofar as the nalc was created by negro union staffersand not by negro workers or by rank and file union membersit might be called a middleclass organization however the most serious economic consideration behind its existence is the plight of the negro worker economists are given to treating unemployment in the united states as troublesome pockets of an expanding economy but to negro workers these pockets are a sea of quicksand sucking them down to extinction according to official labor department figures nonwhites comprise a full  per cent of all the currently unemployed this figure includes puerto ricans as well as negroes but the departments statistics for the past winter also show that the negro unemployment rate is almost twice as high as the rate of white unemployment per cent as against  per cent for whites further an urban league survey of unemployment among negroes in  cities reveals that the percentage of the negro work force unemployed is frequently twice to three times that of the total unemployment rate thus in chicago where the total unemployment rate is  per cent the percentage of negro jobless is  in louisville kentucky the total is  per cent while the corresponding figure for negroes is  per cent in pittsburgh the figures are  as against  per cent in new york city  as against  per cent these statistics also suggest why with much less urgency by the white american community than by the negro in st louis there  are  unemployed negroes out of a total of  jobless in gary indianamore strikingly  out of a total of  in detroit  out of a total of  but even when he has a job the black workers position is far from enviable in  the median wage of the negro male worker was only  per cent as much as that of the white worker as against  randolph comments wryly when a negro worker goes into the market as a consumer he cannot presume to pay only  per cent for comparable goods and services    purchased by white workers the fact is negroes pay relatively much higher prices similarly white women averaged  a year while negro women who it should be added are more often the breadwinners of the familyonly earned  various staff members of the urban league all believe discrimination to be the main cause of negro unemployment and they all feel that trade unions have a lot to answer for in this regard shelton granger executive director of the leagues cleveland branch puts it succinctly rate of unemployment high rate of discrimination higher major offenders are banks insurance companies retail outlets and building trades unions marvin e jones vocational services secretary of the baltimore urban league insists that until unions and employers cease to discriminate by race thus presenting the opportunity for negroes to participate in apprenticeable trades management training programs etc permanent relief is inevitable for the unskilled worker though this last point may be overstated the fact remains that the position of the negro worker is steadily deteriorating in manufacturing negroes have been confined by and large to the semiskilled and unskilled jobs often these were dirty jobs that white workers did not want yet now because of the drop in the number of manufacturing jobs due in turn to the recession and the encroachment of automation competition for all kinds of workincluding semi and unskilled jobsis considerably more intense than it has been for some time in this situation the negro competes at a great disadvantage take for example the building tradesone of the few areas where the work force is expanding secretary of labor arthur j goldberg recently advocated that the aflcios building and construction trades department develop a steppedup apprenticeship training program he pointed out that if we are to fulfill our needs in the construction field during the next ten years we will have to produce about  million additional skilled craftsmen here assuredly is a potential field of employment for negro workers yet under present practices they are all but barred from it the naacp estimates that less than one per cent of the apprentices in the construction industry throughout the united states are negro even in the relatively liberal state of new york the proportion of negroes in the building trades apprenticeship programs during the last ten years has gone up exactlyfrom  to  per cent julius thomas urban league director of industrial relations reports that in  out of  major cities the league did not find a single negro apprentice there was one negro apprentice electrician in each of four cities and one plumbing apprentice in five throughout the  cities surveyed the urban league found a total of roughly  negro apprenticesamong all fields its difficult says thomas to encourage a negro youngster to take an interest in apprenticeship training when it takes us three years to get one negro electrician hired in the nations capital roy wilkins of the naacp has remarked that given a continuation of present rates of advance it will take negroes  years or until the year  to secure equal participation in skilledcraft training and employment but thomas adds unless we get that training were in for becoming permanent wards of the richest country in the world the merger of the afl and the cio in  achieved very little to alleviate these conditionsor so many negroes believewe have not realized says dr james m nabrit jr president of howard university in this combination of the afl and the cio what we had hoped for in the labor movement randolph expresses the feelings of many negroes when he says that unless the aflcio can be shaken loose from the position it now holds negro youth has no future the question is can the nalc do the job perhaps this question is best answered by illustrating the power which the nalc seems able to wield secretary goldberg in february of this year accepted an invitation to speak at a washington d c conference sponsored by the nalc the day he was scheduled to speak turned out to be an extremely busy one for the secretary so he suggested that william wirtz his undersecretary and a former law partner of adlai stevenson would be happy to substitute nalc leaders however said that they would have the secretary of labor or no one goldberg showed up president kennedy was also careful enough of the sensibilities involved to send the conference his greetings although by normal political standards such as attendance the meeting was not a success in contrast the aflcio not only did not send greetings or a representative but pointedly refused to send even an observer from its civil_rights department  it cannot be said however that the nalc has won widespread support among negro workers its growth so far has failed to match the expectations of randolph and his followers the organization claims a membership of  and a rundown of the various unions to which nalc vice presidents ber longmost of them are paid functionariesindicates that these members are drawn from the auto workers the steelworkers international union of electrical workers hotel  restaurant retail clerks district  of the retail wholesale  department store union the brotherhood of sleeping car porters the longshoremen and the teamsters nalc chapters have been established in most of the major industrial centers of the north chicago new york pittsburgh youngstown these chapters function in a variety of ways which again serves to illustrate certain of the nalcs strengths and weaknesses the detroit chapter called the trade union leadership council is with  members the largest and most active group in the nalc it is almost exclusively political and as one might expect largely concerned with the affairs of the united auto workers one of the tulc critics declares when a slate for union offices is drawn up especially in the uaw its just about got to be cleared with the tulc but there hasnt been any action aimed at discrimination or any effort made to bust through barriers erected by the building trades to negro employment the chicago nalc a chapter of some  which is less fully oriented toward the activity of a single union has tried mainly to get a few negro youngsters out of the vocational schools trained in buildingtrade skills training is obtained outside the building trades regularly endorsed washburn school for apprentices negro nonunion skilled tradesmen do the teaching then if youngsters are rejected because of color we build up the record mobilize public opinion and prepare the way for a breakinwe hope the new york city groupanother chapter that draws from a wide variety of unionsengages mainly in fundraising activities the nalc has bypassed the usual union structure to recruit members and to ask for support it cannot or feels that it cannot appeal to union executive organs for support financial or otherwise as both the jewish civil_rights agencies and the naacp do it has turned instead to the negro churcheswith what response it is difficult to determine one thing however is clear the nalc cannot as yet mount the kind of communitywide offensive against job discrimination that a group of ministers recently did in philadelphia by conducting selective boycotts to force companies to open up hiring and upgrade negro workers why has the nalc failed to achieve the status and power that its founders were so confident it could have according to one active member of the organization it has been bugged from the start by confusion as to its role the labor secretary of the naacp for example vigorously performs many of the functions that might be thought to be the special province of a group like the nalc randolph however argues that the trouble stems from a lack of funds to carry on a nationwide systematic organizing campaign and from the intimidation of negro unionists by white leaders still others believe that the fault has been the lack of guidance from the national office the absence of program and direction one white opponent of the nalc says that it doesnt fight cases doesnt try to break in and doesnt send in complaints to the aflcio civil_rights department many other criticisms have been made of the nalc on the one hand its leaders have been called uncle toms one labor leader asserts that the nalc is a creature of functionaries appointed by white elected leaders to placate or to serve as channels to negro members and on the other hand george meany has told randolph at the february aflcio executive council meeting youve been doing a job outside the labor movement not in cooperation with us it has also been charged that the nalc is a racist caucus and that one of its prime goals is the election and appointment of negroes to union posts if its leaders succeed in building a powerful and militant mass organization presumably they will be able to maintain their position of power within the rapidly changing negro community the nalcs answer to its critics is perhaps best summarized by herbert hill labor secretary of the naacp who has worked closely with the new organization since its inception hill argues that the nalc had a choice of degenerating into an apologist for the labor movement within the negro community or of pursuing a vigorous role  it did not want to compete with other organizations to give more awards to george meany it is this vigor hill feels that is resented by aflcio leaders and by the spokesmen of the jewish labor committee and the national labor service of the american jewish committee the dispute between the nalc on the one side and these two jewish labor agencies on the other has many ramifications the jlc was originally founded in long after jews had won recognition for their important role in the building of the american la bor movementand first served as a rescuerelief operation to aid jewish trade unionists and socialists in escaping from nazism and stalinism from the beginning the jlc has eschewed internal union politics altogether except possibly in predominantly jewish unions and only after world war ii did it become really active in the field of civil_rights like other jewish defense agencies the jlc operates on the assumption that the problem of bigotry and inequality is indivisible its technique is to place its staff people in key cities where they organize local labor committees to combat discrimination today the jlc has ten field representatives heading various state and city labor council antidiscrimination efforts william becker for example the jlc official in san francisco is generally credited with being the prime mover in californias adoption of a state fep law two years ago the american jewish committees national labor service also voids internal union politics but operates in a slightly different fashion from the jlc it was for example instrumental in getting both the afl and cio to develop their own fulltime civil_rights departments the ajcs national labor service also performs an educational function providing unions with civil_rights literature and advice in time the jlc and the national labor servicedespite their protests to the contrarycame to be considered by many white unionists as the voice of pronegro labor within the aflcio one source of the current conflict between the nalc and these two jewish agencies can be found in this confusion but a more immediate cause was an accident of history the appointment of charles zimmerman the jlcs chief civil_rights spokesman as chairman of the aflcio civil_rights committee just at a time when negro militancy was on the rise one jewish civil_rights professional explains this particular development in the following way among professionals in intergroup relations the jews are the longest in the field the most skilled and most experienced negro professionals resent this negroes have developed their own leadership and they dont want whitesjews or anybody elseto be in the forefront of the civil_rights fight deep bitterness now exists on both sides negro unionists have criticized the aflcio civil_rights department for inviting leaders of the jlc and the director of the ajcs national labor service harry fleischman to participate in trade union civil_rights conferences while not inviting either the nalc or the naacp in the past fleischman zimmerman who recently resigned from his post with the aflcio after serving four years and emmanuel muravchik field director of the jlcs antidiscrimination department have worked closely with randolph on civil_rights matters and jlc staff members in some instances even helped to organize nalc chapters but this cooperation broke down within the nalcs first year the jlc says one nalc activist is too eager to see progress where it aint he cites a press release based on a jlc survey hailing  as a year of race relations progress within the unions there was no survey and not much progress he believesand he is not alone in this beliefthat the two jewish agencies are more interested in protecting their relationship with aflcios top leaders than they are in furthering civil_rights within the labor movement many jewish trade unionists are antagonizedand somewhat puzzledby the point frequently made in nalc statements that only negroes are entitled and able to speak for the negroes this puts off many jewish unionists who otherwise might be sympathetic to the nalc theyll tell me about discrimination asks a jewish trade union leader yet the jewish labor committee is most frequently cited by nalc spokesmen as a comparable organization and as a justification for the negros right to organize a committee of his own though many outside observers believe that both the jlc and the i ajcs national labor service have defended labors record of progress in combating discrimination much  more vigorously than is necessary muravchik and fleischman argue that more can be done to promote the cause of civil_rights in the un ions by combining praise with crit icism this attitude exposes them to attack herbert hill for example calls them apologists for racism fleischman replies that hills approach discourages good guys from pushing civil_rights why do it at all if all youre going to get is blame for tokenism anyway they ought to get credit for things done i dont see this as a whitewash of labor racists one wonders if this growing antagonism between the jewish and negro labor camps is a precursor of strained relations between the larger jewish and negro defense agencies and ultimately between the two minority communities in general the deterioration in negrojewish relations can be found in many areas beyond the narrow confines of labors civil_rights circle negro ghettoes are spilling over into older jewish neighborhoods negro small businessmen are competing with jewish businessmen for the same customers aspiring negro politicians are striving against jewish politicians for leadership in minority group areas  though conflict seems inevitable and natural as the urban scene changes some jews have been guilty of racial bias that has been newly precipitated in the white community even among people who were previously convinced of their freedom from it by aggressive negro demands for full equality and there has also been a revival of antisemitism among negroes enough to cause some of the negro press to cater to it occasionally it may well be that what james baldwin has called the negros naked and unanswerable hatred of all whites will come in this difficult period to center on the jew whatever its ramifications the split between the jewish and negro elements in labor is likely to widen until the position of the negro worker dramatically improves such improvement depends of course upon a number of external factors one is the effectiveness of the kennedy administration in enforcing the nodiscrimination clause in government contracts in this connection the immediate response of the administration to naacp demands for investigation into discrimination at the marietta georgia plant of republic aviation is clearly a good sign but even administration support will not be adequate unless drastic action alleviates chronic unemployment and prevents discriminatory unemployment generally there is also a pressing need on the part of organized labor for strong and imaginative action against discriminationparticularly against barriers in the building trades george meanys offer personally to recruit qualified negro apprentices in order to break discrimination among the washington d c construction unions was a gesture in this direction but so far it has proved to be no more than that another social consequence of continued discrimination is certain the further spread of the black nationalism bewailed by white and negro civil_rights spokesmen alike randolph attacks the chauvinist aspects of black nationalism in nearly all of his speeches but his statements also emphasize the conditions which give rise to such chauvinism the basic remedy for black nationalismwhich can become a danger to social peace as white nationalism is a danger to social peaceis the abolition of white nationalism which expresses itself in lynchings mob law disenfranchisement segregation and discrimination randolph does not believe that negro trade unionists are under the influence of the black muslims the current extreme exponents of black nationalism within the negro community but it is clear that the movement already wields its strongest appeal among the unorganized and voiceless negro masses there are signs that the muslims have already begun to exert strong pressure on the nalc and its leadership this pressure in turn partly explains the intensity of the nalcs attack against the unions for in any confrontation with the muslims the nalc will be at a great disadvantage until such time as it can defend trade unionism without having to apologize for the adverse effect on some union practices on negro life in america
the world and a threeyearold 
there is a little boy of my acquaintance who is very happy and very friendly hes the normal type threeyearold with all the afflictions common to that age group he is deaf when he doesnt want to hear an order he sometimes sasses his mother and occasionally throws temper tantrums that last until broken up by several smart slaps to the rear he delights in daredevil stunts that make his mother quake with terror  but all these things are normal for little boys and not to be taken too seriously the important things are that he is very normal and very dear to his parents and like the little girl in the nursery rhyme when hes good hes very very good he will sometimes stop in the middle of a game to say i love you mommy he loves an audience and will entertain them with several catchy tunes from a tv nursery school by counting from  to  saying his a b cs up to f and pledging allegiance to the flag he drops everything to watch the tv commercials many of which he knows by heart he loves to brush his teeth but usually eats most of the toothpaste and he makes you think of cherubim when he sings jesus loves me even though a few moments before he pierced all ears in the vicinity with an unearthly shriek for no apparent reason all very normal and as i said very friendly when his mother or grandmother takes him to the supermarket he says hi to everyone and everything on the street people dogs and trees the reactions of the humans are varied and interesting most even those in a great hurry pause smile and say hi gently some speak vaguely as though its an interruption they dont exactly resent but dont exactly relish either others look down for he isnt very tall suck in their mouths and hurry past when this happens the little boy looks puzzled for a few seconds but being three years old quickly forgets in saying the next hi because hes curious about everything one day he will ask why those people dont speak and his mother will have to try as best she can to explain shell have to tell him that he represents in miniature a minority group hated by some for the color   of their skins and the size makes no difference that the people who wont speak to him here are representative of those in other parts of the country who throw eggs at sixyearolds for the crime of wanting the education their parents pay taxes for but she wont tell him the way these things affect her she wont tell him that the sight of children and old people mistreated by mobs fills her with a helpless rage that breeds hate and the desire to hurt them as they hurt these innocents who are aspiring to be treated as free and equal humans but she knows that these people should be pitied more than those with the most dreadful ailments known to medical science for the disease of bigotry corrodes the soul and so she is ashamed to hate so much and profess to be a christian for she must be able to guide herself before trying to direct another life she wont tell him these things instead shell tell him they are fortunate to live in a section of the country where any person with intelligence has a good chance of being able to use it shell tell him of the fine school she attended that he will soon attend where all students are given the same opportunities to learn and the same punishments when they dont try hard enough where they all eat in the same cafeteria and use the same water fountains and rest rooms where the qualified members of his race turn up on

school took a business course at tennessee ai state university and worked for  years for two doctors who shared a downtown office eventually both of her employers died and she was out of a job when sheriff leslie jett was elected and started shuffling personnel some of genevas friends in the courthouse put in a word for her and she was hired she went to work last sept  at first i was afraid to come up here she says id never been around a jail before i had no idea what it would be like but i found out it is altogether different from what i thought it would be already she has glimpsed the tragic and the sordid sides of life behind bars we had one boy who had a new baby he had never seen and he was going to prison his wife brought the baby to jail he sat on a bench and said i want to hold the baby she put it in his arms he held the baby and cried this same prisoner she adds had engaged in a socalled kangaroo court in jail which involved brutality and sexual perversion among a small group of prisoners sometimes there are a dozen women in jail charged with all sorts of crimes from drunkenness and vagrancy to forgery bouncing checks assault and murder the drunks are usually repeaters margaret is an example she turns up about once a month one day recently she sat at the long metal table in the cell for white women dragging on a cigaret and bemoaning the injustice of it

hostile and demanding preferential treatment i went out of my way to be nice says the matron in about a week we were getting along just fine i think it shamed her last christmas the male prisoners chipped in and presented her with a fivepound box of candy and one of the women knitted her a white stole i like my job she says thoughtfully i feel like im helping people who need help
henry armstrong
ii t was friday night and a few pugilistic hopefuls were working out in the ringside athletic club at a easton avenue upstairs over a good will industries store a punching bag made a thunderous noise a muscular youth rhythmically skipped rope a traditional exercise for training fighters in a foot roped square an agile young fellow with wide shoulders shadow boxed cutting an imaginary foe to ribbons with his fancy footwork feinting and darting punches he stopped abruptly hi champ he said with awesome respect to the man in the white sport shirt who walked up and leaned against the ropes appraisingly the man in the white sport shirt was henry armstrong who was serving gratuitously as athletic director of the ringside club a little over  years ago he was one of the great fighters of the modern era and the only man ever to hold three world championships at the same time he grew up in st louis henry armstrong was now  though he didnt look nearly that old he weighed around  which was a good  pounds over his fighting weight it was  years since he had crawled through the ropes to face an opponent his fair weather friends and the good time charleys and the crowds that cheered him were gone and so was the  he had made in the ring when he was a conquering hero to the faithful oldtimers who knew him in his prime and to the youngsters who have heard or read about his legendary ring prowess he is still the champ but there is another designation which is much more important to him now he is the rev henry armstrong ten years ago long after his fighting days were over he turned to god and was ordained a baptist minister of the gospel since then he has preached from hundreds of pulpits has addressed numberless organizations in his evangelism he has been particularly interested in building youth physically and spiritually believing that god has his hand in many things henry armstrong feels that his great record in winning three boxing crowns may have been part of his longrange planning it made him an idol gave him great influence with youth ergo the triple championship set up a platform for his evangelism among the young henry armstrong was a youth himself just on the threshold of his amazing career when he left st louis more than  years ago the decades that followed were turbulent and epic and he did not come home again to stay until about a year and a half ago his return then was almost unnoticed and just as quiet has been his sojourn with mrs velma armstrong a st louisan who is his second wife they live in a modest duplex at a penrose underway right now at the ringside athletic club on easton avenue is a unique experiment in the combined religious and athletic approach to youth the gymnasium was dedicated as a church  it will be a gymnasium with the usual bag punching rope skipping sparring and such during the week but on sunday the spacious gymnasium is filled with folding chairs and services are held it is my own idea said henry armstrong and much good may come of it i am a sports figure and i am trying to exert a good influence on youth in the sports field there is nothing more appropriate than that there should be a church in a gymnasium for this purpose it could develop into a great work for christ though okley clark owner of the ringside club and the rev mr armstrong are both baptists the gymnasium services are open to all creeds and colors it was in the cotton country near columbus miss that henry armstrong got his first look at the world on dec   he was the eleventh of  children in a sharecropper family named jackson he was called henry jackson after his father he was little but powerful durable and determined the boll weevil and the flood waters of the tom bigbee river discouraged the jacksons and sent them migrating north to st louis when henry was  they settled around the papin and chouteau sector west of jefferson and henry went to the toussaint louverture school the main recreation of the neighborhood kids was fighting and though henry was inclined toward peace and nonaggression he had to do more than his share of scrapping because he was little he compensated by going in for body building and in his basement on josephine street accumulated an assortment of exercising machines as he grew up he worked as a bowling alley pinboy haunted the gym of the old pine street ymca which turned out many a fine boxer he later attended vashon high school graduated in  l i years was poet laureate of his class an excellent student with ambition he wanted to go to college and amount to something he had notions of being a doctor but his mother and grandmother always wanted him to be a preacher when he graduated from high school in  he got a job with a railroad section gang laying tracks at carondelet and then one day a wayward wind blew a sports page his way with a headline that announced kid chocolate had received a  purse for defeating a singer in  rounds what fabulous pay for  minutes work thats for me henry announced im going away and become a champion and when i come back here ill be riding in a big shiny limousine just like kid chocolate he went to pittsburgh a good boxing town with a couple of fighter friends but he soon came rolling back in a beatenup old nash amid the jeers of his acquaintances he had been knocked out in his first professional fight when he entered the ring underfed and exhausted it was the only time in his whole career that he was put down for the count he won a second fight but the pittsburgh campaign which he fought under the name of melody jackson was an economic and artistic flop humiliated he and an older fighter friend harry armstrong sneaked off hopped a freight hoboed their way eventually to los angeles then regarded as the land of milk and honey by okies and other hardup folks henry started all over again as an amateur which meant he had to change his name to keep his oro record in pittsburgh from being detected so henry melody jackson became henry armstrong he took the last name from his longtime pal and sometime trainer and fellow adventurer harry armstrong he learned fighting could be a hungry unremunerative vocation he also learned what it was like to be a human chattel his first manager tom cox paid  for his contract sold him later to wirt ross for  ross in a few years sold him to eddie mead for   the money being put up by actors a jolson and george raft henry got none of the profits of his sale after  amateur fights of which he won  he turned pro in  and rapidly became one of the great fighters of modern times he was a formidable fighting machine a paragon of endurance he delivered a ripping storm of blows an incessant barrage from the time a bout started until it ended sports writers soon gave him such nicknames as hammering henry hurricane hank the human buzz saw the human dynamo perpetual motion and homicide henry he scored  knockouts in his professional career alone between  and  he won  straight fights he fought over  times altogether and  were title bouts he earned more than  in  he was elected to boxings exclusive hall of fame he started out in the featherweight  pounds class and then successfully invaded the lightweight  and welterweight  divisions he had to knock over petey sarron oct   and a couple of others before he got clear claim to the featherweight title he won the welterweight title from barney ross on may   and the lightweight title from lou ambers on august  henry armstrong was at the peak he was the unprecedented triple crown holder the toast of fightdom he remembered his mothers prediction at the time ot his birth that he would some day be the big cheese of the family that the whole world would know her boy and she also had said some day hell be a preacher yes he would be a preacher some day but not yet first he had to go through an agonizing or deal that would make him humble and suppliant he had hardly reached the top of the mountain he had hardly glimpsed the world at his feet when he began going down the other side in a return match lou ambers turned the tables won a slashing victory over armstrong on august   and regained his title young and strong fritzie zivic of pittsburgh on october   defeated armstrong and snatched the welter title from his faltering hands zivic beat him even worse scoring a technical knockout in the th in a second bout january   henry armstrong was washed up after one of the most dazzling of all ring careers because his eyes had been gashed badly he was warned not to fight any more but he had been prodigal he needed money he hit the comeback trail and made a good chunk of dough but there were still too many parties there were bad investments too and he didnt have it any more  he could lick secondraters yes  but the old speed was gone the boys at the top were too good for him now on february   he got a pounding from a palooka named chester slider he knew that he was through it had happened to many another idolized champion the fame the fortune were too much henry armstrong reached bottom in  and then in a mom ment of despair began reading the bible and turned to god here was another kind of comeback a better kind he was invited to preach in a pulpit and he did he preached again and again and then one day he was ordained a minister of the gospel in the morning star baptist church of los angeles from then on some called him the champ and some the rev henry armstrong
the stormiest protestants
the negro and his whole baptist fellowship had their beginnp £ nings in america in stormy weather the forceful wind of  ii £ exploitation lifted him out of a benighted environment in africa and brought him against his will to this land of cultural disparity the colonists found the labor of the american indian unprofitable and that of the white indentured servants inadequate much cheap labor was needed here for the american virgin soil was looked upon as the land of promise for raw materials to produce new commodities of commerce negroes made their appearance in america in   years before the first baptist church was organized by roger williams the controversy over slavery was already at fever heat and the colonies were debating as to whether it should be sanctioned rhode island began to regulate the importation of negroes and define their rights in  in that same year the first baptist church had a division vedder states that complete records of the fellowship are lacking and all that is i certain is the controversy began and continued until it reached the acute stage in  thus baptists from the very beginning seem to have multiplied by dividing the people called baptists also set sail in america on rough seas nowhere else in the world has negro slavery exercised such a large influence upon the christian church as in the united states all of the great american churches grew up in more or less intimate contact with the institution of slavery and all of them were of necessity greatly affected by it the most important of the many schisms which have occurred among the american churches were those growing out of negro slavery while some of the most difficult problems facing the churches today are due to the negro and the bitter conflicts which have arisen in the churches because of him coupled with these superimposed conflicts were cross currents within the free fellowship of the churches the early historical local independency of baptist churches in america tended to impede the formation of any general organization until in  a general missionary convention was formed to permit baptists to express themselvs in terms of missionary activities in  the state conventions in the south withdrew to organize the southern baptist convention in  the northern baptist convention was organized a delegated body under whose direction the many agencies of the baptists in the north and west now operate tossed and driven it is understandable that a slave people should be caught in the middle of every vicious circle without much voice or power of decision during the early years of baptist history in america it was after the baptists had spread to virginia that negroes won consideration as part of this movement that had experienced slow growth up to the beginning of the  eighteenth century in general the negroes were followers of the baptists in virginia and after a while as they permitted colored men to preach the great majority of them went to hear preachers of their own color george liele the earliest negro baptist preacher in georgia was brought from virginia by his master henry sharp around  presumably he was associated with the church in which sharp was a deacon  and matthew moore was pastor the church gave liele the liberty to preach and his master gave him the time he was later freed and gave full time to preaching up and down the savannah river and in south carolina liele was known to have preached in the first negro baptist  church in america at silver bluff s c this church was given support by sharp and a planter by the name george galpin when the british came to savannah the silver bluff church seems to have been abandoned but it was revived after peace came in  under the direction of reverend jesse peter who as a slave had remained in south carolina during the period of the revolution jesse peter and a white minister abraham marshall organized what was probably the first negro church in georgia in a barn near brampton where andrew bryan won through lieles influence had been preaching in  this congregation began building a church in the suburbs of savannah in  in the meantime baptist churches were being established in virginia north carolina and south carolina the owners of slaves were beginning to discover that their slaves were of increasing value to them after becoming religious it is difficult for many to accept the fact that josiah bishop and william lemon performed duties as pastors of white baptist churches in virginia and joseph willis a negro minister licensed in  became the organizer of the white and colored baptist association in louisiana in  it was in the baptist churches especially that the negroes shared with the white men the fellowship of the gospel the reasons for the close relationship in this church were the same as those which prevailed in the methodist denomination with the added attraction of free congregational polity the latter feature permitted the negroes to organize and govern their own churches and so provided them with a practical equality in religious affairs    even in natchez miss a baptist church had  members of whom only  were white with many exceptions to the general rule prior to the great rift in  over the slave issue the slaves as a part of the household of their masters worshiped in the same churches after the rift between the northern and southern elements of the baptist denomination nobody was sure what to do with the negroes and they were too handicapped to do much for themselves the negro churches were certainly shaped in iniquity if not conceived in sin confused and rejected by the proclaimers of their faith negro christians could not be too sure of the rock upon which their church was built to this day many leaders refer to the negro churches as a protest movement and others refer to it as a sore on the body of christ to relieve their plight the board of missions of the triennial convention continued to send missionaries and established for the training of leadership among negroes such schools as morehouse and spelman in atlanta ga shaw in raleigh n c leland in louisiana benedict in columbia s c virginia union in richmond va and jackson college in jackson miss the last is now a state school southern baptists continued to give aid to negroes and it was customary in all of their annual meetings to hear reports on the instruction of the colored population even during the civil war their efforts have not ceased until this day they support many training institutes contribute more than negroes themselves to the american baptist seminary in nashville and within the last decade have begun admitting negroes to southern baptist seminaries a new unit evolves there had been organized missions among negroes as early as  when the african baptist missionary society was inaugurated at richmond virginia it sent lott carey to africa with a regularly organized baptist church of which he was pastor it contributed its means through the american baptist union a northern white organization until  from  to  it contributed through the southern baptist convention white because white southern baptists divided from white northern baptists in  on account of the slavery question solomon cosby and w w colly were sent out by the african baptist missionary society of richmond virginia through the southern baptist convention that was the taproot of the historic tendency of negro baptists which has persisted for more than a hundred years in  national negro baptists consciousness expressed itself in organizing the american baptist missionary convention it was organized in the abyssinian baptist church of new york it was composed of the colored baptists from new england and the middle west it could not operate in slave states like the african baptist missionary society of richmond virginia which functioned through southern whites but the atmosphere was full of hope for emancipation or emigration in  three years after the last meeting of the american baptist missionary convention of which we have any account he negro baptists of the south took the leading part in organizing the baptist foreign missionarv convention of the united states of america which was the first unit of the national baptist convention to avoid a volume of details regarding the mushrooming and splintering of negro baptists between  and  we move on to the historic background given in the preamble of the constitution of the national baptist convention usa incorporated three negro baptist organizations claiming national status exsited in the united states prior to  these three organizations in their separate conventions voted to meet in atlanta georgia september   and form one body for the purpose of more effectively carrying on the benevolent activities for which baptists stand the organizations so uniting were as follows  the baptist foreign mission convention which up to that time had been doing missionary work on the west coast of africa  the national baptist convention which had done its missionary work in the united states up to this time  the national baptist educational convention which was directing its efforts in christian education among negroes in the united states from this point began the major negro bodies as we know them today rocked by internal struggles the organized activities of negro baptists were hardly launched before divisions and rebellion arose the foreign mission board had been located at richmond virginia doing business for the whole colored baptist group since its authorization by the foreign mission convention of usa in  the changing of the domicile of the board from richmond va to louisville ky was the first battle on board the new baptist vessel insult was added to injury by changing also the personnel of the board the brethren in richmond refused to communicate and would not turn over deeds contracts or records in  the disgruntled exmembers of the foreign mission board led in organizing the lott carey foreign missionarv convention one of their contentions was that the national baptist convention was drawing the color line although the lott carey convention was reunited to the national convention by compact in  it continues to function as a separate entity most of its support is from the eastern seaboard and a few states in the midwest the majority of the pastors and most of the presidents of that body have been members of one or the other of the larger national conventions while negro baptists were seriously threatened because of the relocation of their most active board the question of convention control was pressing hard for attention if the national baptist convention of usa had been incorporated before it changed the foreign misson board fom richmond virginia to louisville kentucky the old richmond board never would have defied the parent body nor taken the lead in organizing the lott carey foreign mission convention in  generally the new denomination was set up along the lines followed by the two white conventions structures were set uo and empty portfolios granted to the key personnel of the various boards in  the home mission board began publishing sunday school literature later the publishing board of the national baptist convention usa was incorporated under the laws of the state of tennessee in a crisis the incorporated publishing board refused to obey the orders of the unincorporated convention which created it the courts sustained the rights of the selfperpetuating publishing board because the unincorporated convention died each time it adjourned the convention realized that all of the boards whose charters were like the publishing boards could defy the parent body and do as the board had done the convention prepared to incorporate itself in order to control its boards and retain its property the publishing board forthwith attempted to split the national baptist convention of usa to retain a group which would furnish patronage to support the selfperpetuating independent publishing board the cause of the confusion manifested at the national baptist convention is the attempt and purpose of the convention to control its publishing board located at nashville tennessee by reason of the peculiarity of the laws of tennessee this board elects its own members although for years the convention thought that by electing members in open session they really became members of the board to its great surprise in the course of time it became known that no one is a member of the publishing board unless elected by the board itself baptists left chicago in  with two camps one led by r h boyd secretary of the publishing board and the other by the convention president e c morris the latter group gained charter in the district of columbia and became the incorporated baptist convention commonly today older ministers use the names boyd and morris to distinguish between the two major conventions the national baptist convention of the usa and the national baptist convention usa inc these are the grand divisions of negro baptists although the lott carey missionary society is also chartered all boards of the incorporated convention except the publishing board remained loyal however there have been minor controversies over the national training school for women and girls in lincoln heights washington d c the founder of the school the late miss nannie helen burroughs was also president of the womans auxiliary to the national baptist convention usa inc she was favorable toward permitting the convention majority control on the board managing the school which also has members from both the american and southern baptist conventions the issue has been relegated of late to low priority because of other matters involving the establishment of tenure and regulating board operations within the last twelve years the convention has added a bath house sanitarium hospital board to manage the bath house in hot springs ark now leased to a private group immediately after his election in miami fla in september  j h jackson added thirteen new departments and commissions to the nine divisions already provided by the convention naturally there has been confusion as to areas of responsibility caused by the inevitable overlapping assignments recently a small committee was sent to africa to do an investigation with regard to the purchase of land this special committee is separate and distinct from the foreign mission board the oldest and most virile unit of the denomination which is directed by c c adams corresponding secretary of philadelphia pa where the home office is now located the current deadlock in the incorporated body is due to differences over administrative policy and the tenure of the convention president section iv article  of the constitution as revised in  reads a president of this convention shall not be eligible for reelection after he has served four consecutive terms until at least one year has elapsedthis constitution was declared null and void on the opening day of the seventyseventh annual session in louisville ky in september  before the messengers were enrolled marchers invaded the auditorium from the streets to the tune of music men were jailed opposing officers kicked out and litigants who contested the action in court expelled the resulting unrest was the basis of the groundswell that produced the taylor team and the spectacle at the philadelphia convention in  a letter was sent out on august   over the signature of m l king sr pastor of the ebenezer baptist church atlanta ga father of martin_luther_king jr we are engaged in a mighty crusade in our national baptist convention this crusade through our candidate dr gardner taylor looks forward to  restoring our denominations harmony  unifying our parentbody and auxiliaries behind kingdom objectives  committing the convention to real leadership in civil_rights struggle  providing regular itemized financial accounting to all pastors  reestablishing a system of tenure after open refusal to permit an election by roll call of states the delegates remained in convention hall in philadelphia on september   and a fair election was conducted with  for the incumbent j h jackson pastor of olivet baptist church chicago ill and  votes for gardner c taylor pastor of concord baptist church brooklyn n y what is the present state of affairs philadelphia courts have disclaimed jurisdiction in the matter because the convention is chartered in the district of columbia on january   in hot springs ark jacksons group issued a declaration of the independence of the national taylor team the national baptist convention usa incorporated and its board of directors will accept the fact of the independence of the national taylor team the real deadlock is over the source of authority whether the board of directors or the messengers enrolled in any annual session make the decisions for the convention this problem is aggravated by the fact that any member who says he is a baptist can register and vote in annual sessions for the fee of ten dollars big battles swell the messenger roll and help the exchequer unfortunately the struggle for office seeps down through state conventions district associations and local churches many states have two conventions enrolled annually because every state president enrolling with two hundred dollars is automatically a member of the board of directors mississippi enrolls four state conventions regularly the state conven tion presidents are also concerned about tenure and even local pastors fear that their churches may rejoice to find a method of rotation millions on board according to the listings in the yearbook of a merican churches the national baptist convention of america has  members and the incorporated convention has five million these figures are based upon reports for  and  as of today these bodies easily boast of more than eight million souls it is widely accepted that seventy per cent of all churched negroes are baptists onethird of the baptists of the world are negroes the third largest protestant group in america is the baptist denomination among negroes being outnumbered only by the methodist church and the south baptist convention to be the largest bloc of colored protestants in america and in the world in these times when nationalism is emerging in africa kindles in negro baptist bosoms a new sense of destiny and worth being the largest group in the negro structure the titular head becomes a towering figure within and without the group hence there are no expresidents of the parent body nor of most of the auxiliaries added to the egocentricities that are common in human circles is the element of negrocentricity that is sweeping america through the kneelins sitins standins wadeins and the like many negro baptists are so busy with race that little place is left for redeeming grace stuck in midocean and casting eyes about other members of the baptist fleet are noticeable out there in the mist and foam national baptists have working relations with all of them educational projects the baptist jubilee advance the baptist world alliance and the national and world councils of churches with one exception the southern baptists who do not affiliate with national or world councils these relationships are more nominal than vital as to the national baptist convention of america preachers of the incorporated convention cross lines in accepting churches and vice versa without strife but neither is there any sign of union in the near future as to the american and southern baptist bodies we seem to pair off against each other american baptists and negro baptists agree that southern baptists are highly bigoted negro baptists and southern baptists tend to label american baptists as being spiritually barren and american baptists and southern baptists would agree that negro baptists are sadly belated many of our large national baptist churches do affiliate with the american baptist convention since local independence is the baptist pattern only pressure from local churches will make for true progress in the direction of improved organizational procedures and wider coopthe crying need of negro baptist churches is for recruits to the christian ministry with dedication and training to keep the constituency stabbed awake at the local level yet there is some anxiety that we may lose our most promising young people en masse by too long delay heaped upon our inner contentions and the need for leadership are the multitude of new problems incidental to integration and urbanization we may keep looking within rather than without for much longer than we would like to admit in the meantime negro baptists can look forward to more sailing on a stormy sea
have a future in politics
leitmotiv of southern politics for some decades has been the lament that dixie has lost its voice in national party councils the prayers for deliverance from this obscurity follow ancient rituals of imprecation and gesture like a rain dance now in one of those twists which make politics ever unpredictable the prayers are about to be answeredafter a fashion the south is likely soon to return to political prominence and a southerner may well become a decisive influence in national affairs but the manner in which all this is to come about may send the southern shamans scrambling to their altars to dispatch amended petitions to the almighty for the potential savior of southern political influencealbeit not southern politicsis not a lone knight but is colored and some five million strong the souths negroes are the largest single untapped reservoir of voting strength in the nation registered and voting cohesively they can alter the course of events not only below the masondixon line but throughout the nation they can force a realignment of politics along more clearly defined liberalconservative lines and they can shatter decisively the tottering dinosaurdemocrat pterodactylrepublican coalition in congress needless to say any man who could unite and guide these potential voters would become a powerful arbiter of party platforms patronage and legislation it is too early to say that the rev martin_luther_king jr has become such a leader or even wants to but it is already certain that he is the fulcrum of the coming upheaval in southern politics it may be that he will decide as he clearly has not decided yet to enter the party hustings openly rather than to prompt from the wings or it may be that the souths white politicians many of whom are far more flexible and far less committed to the eighteenth century than is generally realized in the north will seize the initiative and provide their own leadership whoever the leader or leaders though the change is coming and the new political body will not remain headless for long the potency of an organized negro voting bloc is no untested theory of course it has been preached for years by the naacp it has been demonstrated time and again in fiercely competitive twoparty races in industrial states and even in a few southern cities such as atlanta and memphis without the negro vote in key states last fall john kennedy would not now be wearing his paperthin mantle of victory the negro vote has made scores of senators congressmen and governors vociferously civilrights conscious and it has won an amount of attention far beyond its proportionate size but not since reconstruction days when it was cynically manipulated has the negro vote counted for much in statewide races in dixie for decades its impotence could be blamed on white primaries kukluxism and lack of education even today in some of the rural southparticularly in the black belt countiesthreats violence and official footdragging present serious physical obstacles to voting by negro citizensyet the plain truth is that negroes themselves are in no small part to blame for their failure to realize their voting potential whereas the number of negroes on the souths voting lists surged dramatically in the first years after the demise of the white primary in georgia alone some  registered within a few months time it soon reached a virtual plateau the net increase since  is little more than  this is true even though more and more of the souths negroes live in cities where they encounter little or no official opposition to registering a recent premayoralty primary registration drive in atlanta sponsored jointly by longstanding negro voter organizations and dr_kings southern christian leadership conferance fell far short of its goal despite an enormous pool of qualified negroes and the complete cooperation of the fulton county registrar in spite of this pessimistic current history there are signs that the most spectacular and significant gains in negro voting in history are in the offing for one thing the negro leadership is learning the hard lesson of organization we were naive enough one negro leader summed it up to believe that with the increased interest in civil_rights negroes would just go out and register on their own without any prodding the atlanta registration drive for instance might well have succeeded had it started earlier only after the drive was publicly announced did its leadership settle to the grinding task of setting up a block organization where it was needed most in the lower and lowermiddle income neighborhoods despite its weight in atlanta elections the negro vote thus far has been concentrated in the uppermiddle income groupswhat one negro critic labeled leading negroes as distinguished from negro leaders the experience will not be wasted however the new organization plans to remain semimobilized throughout the year and hopes to build from its newly established base this awareness of the importance of organization probably will receive more concrete recognition in the near future through a concerted southwide voterregistration drive involving dr_kings sclc the naacp and other humanrights groups a second reason for believing in a coming new wave of negro voting is the attention now being paid to the question no responsible negro leader has ever denied the value of the ballot although some perhaps have been suspicious of their more conservative white friends urgings to concentrate on voting in any case it is true that other activities have at times obscured the issue since the  brown decision the naacp has been involved in a deluge of antisegregation litigation the energies of the sclc and the student movements have been drained by the timeconsuming planning and execution of nonviolent protests from lunchcounter sitins to freedom rides i have always said dr_king explained in an interview that i think one of the most significant steps the negro can take is the short walk to the voting booth yet its not a substitute for other things its not an eitheror proposition but a bothand in fact dr_king maintained that the other things have made it easier to interest the negro in the ballot box they have helped to overcome the my vote doesnt count psychology which exists among negroes because of the legacy of discrimination and slavery and segregation according to dr_king another evidence of the coming voting breakthrough is perhaps barely discernible outside the south itself where one comes over the years to appreciate the various nuances of southern oratory to the outsider current southern political speeches may sound the same as those of ten or twenty years ago but to the native they sound more moderate more flexible for instance senator herman talmadge of georgia whose reputation on the race issue was once little different from his late fathers is now being accused in some extreme quarters of selling out to the niggers for his refusal to use the filibuster in obviously hopeless legislative fights and for failing to insist that georgia close down its publicschool system to prevent desegregation senator talmadge like many another southern congressman is clever enough to read the handwriting on the wall and politician enough not to talk himself into a corner if the handwriting were not already large enough the justice department has been engraving it in sixfoot letters several times as many votingrights suits against southern registrars have been filed during the first eight months of the kennedy administration as were instituted in the three previous years of the  voting laws existence only the most intransigent southern politician can fail to be impressed by this a man who is any politician at all is already planning how to survive when the negro vote becomes important perhaps decisive in his constituency legal or moral arguments aside there is cold logic on the side of the administrations energy the pure mathematics of the  squeaker requires the democratic party not only to hold on to as much of its previous vote as possible but also to expand its support to provide a cushion for the inevitable dropoff if the administration is after new voters it can find no greater unexplored territory than in the south in last falls election the voter turnout by state ranged from idahos  per cent of the civilian population of voting age to mississippis  per cent the eleven beyond his immediate sphere of action in june for instance he addressed a freedom rally at the sports arena in los angeles sponsors were hoping for an attendance of  fifteen minutes before the rally was scheduled to begin the fire department ordered the doors closed after  had jammed inside another  showed up of whom at least half remained outside listening to the fourhour proceedings on the publicaddress system a close associate recently said when they the kennedy administration want to know how negroes feel about something they call martin this may be an oversimplification but it is true that dr_kings influence with his own race is highly respected by white politicians the dignitaries on the platform of the los angeles rally included californias governor edmund brown new yorks governor nelson rockefeller after declaring at the national governors conference in honolulu that civil_rights was the paramount moral issue in american politics met with dr_king to discuss the issue at length and of course the political benefits which flowed to john kennedy last november as a result of dr_kings temporary imprisonment in georgia are well known the nonviolent movement of which dr_king has become the symbol has achieved considerable progress and influence thus far without becoming directly aligned with either party dr_king himself  endorsed no candidate in  and he is clearly undecided whether to become identified with either party in the future for the time being his political activity will be limited largely to voter registration the major emphasis will be in cities where tangible gains are possible but the nonviolent techniquein the form of registrationoffice standinswill be utilized to dramatize the plight of negroes in rural areas dr_king is not worried that negroes will be at a loss to know without overt guidance which candidates to support theyre going to vote for the candidates who stand most forthrightly for human rights he said neither is he concerned as are some writers that even if negroes register in large numbers in the south they will have no one to vote for in state races registration will inevitably have an impact he contended and either incumbents will see the light or new candidates with better vision will come forward i have followed a nonpartisan course dr_king concluded this doesnt mean that i am not interested in politics i am intensely interested in politics and maybe i will have to change some day but i feel that someone must remain in the position of nonalignment so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of bothnot the servant or master of either if civil_rights is destined as governor rockefeller contends to become the nations paramount moral issue then dr_kings cause probably can best be served if he remains nonaligned as a speaker he is superb as an articulator of nonviolent direct action his effectiveness cannot be challenged but his philosophical bent and his gentleness of nature make him not the best of administrators and he has tended to leave the work of organization to others the best guess at this time is that he will remain the conscience of both not the servant or master of either
a gutter full of dreams
he didnt eat much breakfast he sat around and tried to read but finally he gave that up and went out into the back yard the alley smelled like rotten eggs and fat maggots swam in the garbage cans some had lids some didnt hosea douglas picked up some pebbles and began tossing them around every time he hit a can the flies buzzed off in a black spiraling cloud he watched the flies return and swarm over the dead rat smashed into a red tirerutted pulp by a passing truck milk colored water trickled between the brick paved alleyway and formed a puddle where the alley dipped flies found that too everybody accused him of being a dreamer nobody he knew could see any reason in the world for his going out that afternoon and trying to get a job playing ball for a professional football team like the cougars he watched the flies buzzing around in the alley that was reason enough for him hey boy you looking for something that was how they greeted him when he got out to the camp id like to try out for the team he said to one of the fat guys who seemed to be in charge you what aint this the tryout camp of the cougars the two fat guys looked at each other well boy now look yeh youre kind of light for a linesman the other fat guy told him i dont play on the line i play in the backfield you what give him a suit luke a short baldheaded guy with a cigar told them yeh but give him a suit okay the man called luke shrugged come on you after hosea got his equipment luke took him to the dugout there was a lot of nervous talk going on in there hey youse luke said in his high nasal twang and the talking stopped this boy heres gone try out for the team luke grinned and left all of the players began to test their equipment seeing what kind of shape it was in then one after the other they filed out and left him in there alone with his dreams on the way out he bumped into a huge blond guy scuse me the guy said thats all right the blond guys eyes followed hosea out the door hey youse luke said when he spotted hosea coming over to join the group gathered around him run back in there and get that other guy to hurry up and get his butt over here i aint got all day it turned out the blond guy wasnt in any hurry and took his time dressing so that by the time they got outside the gathering had broken up and the backfield was passing footballs while the linemen charged each other where the hell youse guys been luke wanted to know you messed around and missed defensive and offensive instructions well thats just too bad for you cause i aint bout to repeat them the blond guy shrugged hey youse whats your name luke asked him elmer jabloski yeh well youse and your buddy better watch out attitude counts on making this team too the blond guy looked at luke and laughed luke turned red youse guys might just as well turn in your suits now he said what you play jabloski asked hosea quarterback jabloski didnt bat an eye come on lets go over with the backfield coach blakey invited me to the tryouts not ole lard ass hosea started to say no one had invited him but he didnt know what would be the point in saying that they had trouble breaking in the circle at least hosea did so jablo ski took a ball and he and hosea started throwing it at each other then the baldheaded guy blew a whistle all you guys who came to try out come around front so i can get a look at you he said there were twelve of them ill consider myself a lucky sonofabuck if i find at least one good player among you he said and ill be even luckier if the one i find can last over two seasons in this league he looked them over like they had leprosy in case anybody dont know it im leon blakey and i run the show now this here is mike cassares and this is craig luke my assistants the way it wound up everyone was on a team except some veterans the coach was sure of and hosea jabloski cassares said the coach said to put you in as linebacker think you can play that i play football jabloski said he did too like he was bom into a pair of shoulder pads and football cleats he could sense what hole a play was being run through and bottle it up before it got started good he could get knocked flat on his back and he would get up and still make the tackle he practically crippled both the rookie quarterback and his hopeful tryout replacement blakey sent in his veteran but not before moving jabloski over on offense the first time jabloski got the ball he ripped through the secondary and ran over the safety man without even breaking stride that would have probably been good for a touchdown if blakey hadnt blown the whistle luke started bawling out the defense really giving them hell until blakey told him to shut up blakey called the defense into a huddle and told them what he wanted them to do whatever he told them didnt work too well because on the next play jabloski went ten yards with half the secondary riding him blakey rubbed his chin and frowned jesus christ cassares said aw that hams just lucky luke said with that smile i wonder how much its gonna cost us to sign him up blakey said he dismissed two tryout hopefuls playing guard they didnt argue with him they just limped off the field and went into the locker room hey kid blakey said no sense in you hanging round if all youre going to do is loaf get over there and take mursons place at safety hosea pointed a finger at his chest me yeh you murson looked up and saw him coming he left without saying a word taking it easy on his left knee they finally got some guards and a linebacker in the game who could bottle jabloski up at the line of scrimmage so the quarterback opened them up with a couple of end runs by his two halfs then with the defense honest he faked a handoff and faded back a long lanky end got behind hosea and hauled one in he was off to the races but hosea reversed and managed to get him fifteen yards out from the goal line the whole defensive unit turned and looked at hosea without saying a word jabloski caught a short hard one in the flats and headed down the sidelines he was by the secondary before they even realized what had happened and hosea had to come all the way from the far side to get him he had a good angle on him and went into him low driving with his shoulder as hard as he could jabloski seemed to take off and fly hosea stopped him though two yards out from the goal line jabloskis momentum carried him five yards after his feet had been knocked from beneath him hey luke how bout sending us a safety man somebody yelled you dont like him blakey said chewing on his cigar the linebacker kicked the dirt out of his cleats you dont like him naw i sure as hell dont blakey shrugged and sent in another guy to take hoseas place hey you he yelled as hosea headed for the sidelines get over there and take the right halfs slot  on offense the offensive quarterback looked up and saw hosea heading his way hey coach what the hell you trying to do ruin me you can play right half cant you kid well to tell the truth i really play quarterback now that was too much for both teams but blakey just nodded his head okay kelly i dont want to make you look bad so you rest a while and let the kid take over for a spell kelly fired the ball at hosea blakey looked over the defense and smiled okay cry babies whats your excuse now st louis in august the hottest month in the year the center overshot hosea and he barely had time to catch up with the ball before the whole defensive line smothered him whats the matter boys blakey said you forgot how to block he was grinning when he said it but on the next play the line held the center overshot hosea again though and the ends caught him as soon as he picked up the ball blakey blew out a couple of oversized smoke rings and sent in a new center the new center found hosea with the ball all right but the left guard crashed the line and caught him before he could pivot around hosea got up slowly all he could think about were the curbs over the gutters where he used to  sit with the other kids when he was a child and plan all the big things they were going to do when they were grown hey boy luke shouted from the sidelines a big lopsided grin ballooning out all over his face what kind of quarterbacking you call that losing thirty yards on three plays the offensive team began to grumble in agreement hosea wiped his sweaty hands off on his pants he didnt hurry getting back to the huddle on the next play the left guard crashed again only this time hosea was rolling out to pass so it didnt matter he couldnt find a receiver anywhere though and that really got his goat but he didnt give up hell no he reversed his field and left half the defensive line strung out behind him he headed for the sidelines and got back up to the line of scrimmage only to find two guys from the secondary set and waiting then he got his first break since he had been out there jabloski came up from nowhere and nailed one of them with a block from the blind side that must have knocked him five feet in the air hosea gritted his teeth and stiffarmed the other guy so hard it felt as though his elbow was pushing up through his armpit his only chance was walking that chalk line and he knew it and he took off into high but the linebacker managed to get over there and block his path hosea broke stride and the linebacker grinned hosea got his head down and his knees up high that was the way you ran over a man that made the linebacker grin all the more the linebacker weighed twohundredandthirty pounds only he didnt try running over him at the last split second he straightened up and gave the linebacker his left leg the linebacker shifted in to take it and thats when hosea pivoted on his right spinning in a circle like a basketball center playing the key and while the surprised linebacker went sprawling after a left leg that was no longer there hosea shifted back into high and went into the end zone standing up it got quiet as hell out there st louis in august hot enough to mangle boy i like you  jaboski said putting his arm around him you play football youre in the wrong place boy they told him cant you tell when you aint wanted yeh go home black boy fore you get your neck broke they tried to break it too only he caught them at their own game faked a pass down field and handed off to jabloski who went sixty yards down the middle of the field without anybody touching him jabloski threw the football over the goal line in contempt and blakey had to call the scrimmage off to prevent a freeforall blakey thought all the tryouts except jabloski should go home jeez i dont see how he can let you go jabloski told him while they were mounting the steps after dressing yeh st louis in august hot enough to kill see you jabloski told him and headed for the parking lot hosea headed for the streetcar line hey you hey kid hosea turned around whats your name hosea told him guess you realize what youll be up against in this league that was just a small sample of it out there hosea didnt say anything blakey puffed on his cigar jesus you got a great pair of hands kid i sure would like to use you what you think of that hosea didnt say anything he felt too thunderstruck to ever say anything again

have you ever seen any real indians asked my sevenyearold son richard when he came home from school for lunch one day of course i replied you probably have too there may be some at school with youi havent noticed his eyes widened but they dont wear feathers on their heads no most indians now dress just about the way you and i do they used to wear feathers and sometimes now some of them dress up in costume for special parades he thought for a moment i guess maybe johnny brown is an indian no johnny is a negro i said dont you know what a negro is no do we know any negroes if it had not been for his serious honest little face i could have thought he was joking then i remembered another time when he had made a similarly surprising remark he had been telling his grandmother about one of his little playmates and she had asked him is he white or colored he had replied i dont know i had thought then that he had just failed to notice and i was glad that it was unimportant to him but with this question today i knew he did not know what a negro was why of course dear i replied we know johnny brown and his family and many others i mentioned the names of several of his friends who are negroes his eager little face registered surprise are they he pondered but bob the man who used to work for us said negroes have black faces now i was beginning to understand richards bewilderment yes i said people often say they have black faces but they are not really black some are very light tan and others dark brown we are said to have white skins but we are not white like this tablecloth are we negroes he then asked no i answered we are white if we are in the sun a lot and get our skins tanned then will we be negroes he wondered no we stay what we are bom i tried to explain then he began to think of the children in his schoolroom the idea of classifying children by race was a new one to him he had thought of them as boys and girls those he liked or those he didnt like but he had never thought of them as belonging to different races he mentioned several names remarking that he thought they might be negroes not knowing these children i could not tell him i said i had seen some chinese or japanese children at school too and tried to describe them i think maybe mary is chinese he said i like maryshe isnt a tattletale like sally i do not know to what race mary or sally belongs and richard is only guessing aside from this momentary curiosity about races probably started by some history story at school he doesnt care to him the important thing about people is not their skin color or eye structure but their behavior the subject was dropped a little later but when his nineyearold brother came home richard asked danny did you know johnny brown is a negro danny assumed the knowing attitude that a nineyearold is apt to take toward a sevenyearold sure and his family are all negroes too he told his younger brother after talking a little more about the subject danny said well what i dont understand is what race is this was said in a tone of dismissing the subject rather than of further inquiry he would leave this illogical complexity to the adults his statement rang in my mind for some time and i felt how good it would be if adults too could admit that they do not know what race is

twentysix years ago when i started in the advertising business neg r annual income ©« was rougmy  iobillion today it is billion and growing rapidly taking stock of our economic importance is timely and pertinent to the whole of the american negros struggle for firstclass citizenship in the fight to eliminate discrimination and segregation we might give thought to the effectiveness of our individual application of the economic technique along with our freedomrides sitins prayins wadeins we suggest the investin counterattack the power of the almighty dollar to change minds and to create acceptance can be illustrated by the story of the minister of a church located in a neighborhood where the winos found it a convenient and comfortable place for sleeping one sunday morning the church had its usual number of smelly alcoholics as one was leaving he grabbed the ministers hand and loudly said rev that was the damndest sermon i ever heard you really had a hell of a message today now brother you mustnt use that kind of language here all of you are welcome to come here but i cant have you insulting my members and contributors with your foul language and profanity excuse me rev i didnt mean any harm but that was such a hell of a good sermon i put  in the collection today the ministers eyes lit up as he forgot himself fifty dollars well ill be damn twentysix years ago advertisers and sellers generally considered negro families only as submarginal consumers bargain basement buyers and a convenient target for the disposal of irregulars markeddown nondurable goods and the happyhunting ground for the sale of questionable mailorder products those were the years when the mass communication mediums were effectively projecting an image of the negro stereotype today the economic strength of i the negro consumer is realized it is a market that is recognized as important to many industries vital to the success of many advertising campaigns and essential to the very existence of some  major corporations don connell of the giant market research company of america an outfit that provides statistical data for the formulation of product manufacturing and selling strategy for many of the top us corporations recently pointed out industrys new approach to the negro market ten years ago marketing men had a great deal of curiosity interest and desire for information about the negro market    but no compelling need to act on it today marketing men approach information on the negro market as a prelude to action it is a marketing fact of life that can only be ignored at the expense of profits donald i rogers writing in the n y herald tribune says the american businessmans needs for profits will bring equality to the negro where common sense and common decency have failed the negro market amounts to  billion annually smart businessmen are cultivating it with utmost care the gross national product of the  negroes in the us will total more than billion this year nobody is going to segregate that much money the wall street journal in a june  article the negro consumer says never before have they been courted so assiduously by people with something to sell what is this negro market and what is our economic strength the negro market as i view it is not a market to be measured by color alone we are consumers with ambitions and aspirations that are limited and restricted by ethnic mores as a result we develop a different set of motivations and a purchasing pattern that varies considerably from those of nonnegro consumers with otherwise comparable characteristics advertising men have come to realize that there is no longer any single mass market sociological psychological and economic factors influence buying decisions there are many markets made up of individuals with similar buying patterns to reach them admen have gerrymandered us consumers into dozens of markets and submarkets each with its own preferences status symbols and standards of conformity we have the youth market career womens market house  garden interest market group and leisure market consumers the largest most clearcut and distinct market of all says newsweek is the negro market our economic strength today is important to industry onethird of all of us live in the cityzone of the  major markets of the us white families are shifting to the suburbs of major markets and only  of the total now live in the  largest cities our economic strength is vital to the success of many advertising campaigns because negro urban families tend to spend more for certain products than white families in the same income group in a city survey of families with comparable incomes we found that negro families spent an average  per year for soft drinks while white families spend  negro market families annually spend  for cosmetics and toiletries compared with   spent by equalincome white families the average expenditure of negro households is almost  times larger than white households for hair preparations  and vi times larger for phonograph records and  times larger for candy we spend  more for movie attendanceand some giant corporations must continue to marshal our economic strength in order to maintain the relative position of their brand among competition a major cigarette brand a premiumpriced mens shoe a popular brand of blended whiskey are a few examples of the many product types that are vitally dependent upon our continued purchases and preference for that matter total scotch whisky sales in the us would drop  if overnite we decided to go on the wagon the travel industry is just beginning to recognize that we spend  more than the average spent by comparable income white persons for travel our economic strength to this industry is some  million this year the negro market will buy  of detroits new auto production and will spend  million for automobiles the average negro family will spend  for clothing this year for a total of nearly billion we spend proportionately more for food clothing and housefurnishings per household than comparable income whites in practically all sections of the country these figures impressive as they are are only a small index of our economic strength the potential of the future is even greater what about the future will the negro market continue to grow will negro families earn a larger percentage than the  of the nations   billion consumer income markets of the sixties a book by the publishers of fortune magazine predicts that the consumer markets of the s will be shaped by teenagers who will demand vast amounts of foods and will enter massively in the market for secondsa second car a second tv two telephones etc this emphasis on the purchasing importance of young families are additional reasons why the future looks bright for us new employment opportunities are more likely than ever a study of population trends seems to bear this out in  the us census showed a decline of twomillion in the white population in the  age group white males of this age group in the population declined  this is the group that is now  years of age and the age group most preferred by employers already these statistics are being translated into future planning by industry and government in baltimore for example the twintrends of the white migration to the suburbs and the concentration of negro families in centralcity has resulted in a  loss in total city population between  in the same period the percentage of negro population to the total increased from less than  to more than  a breakdown of the population also revealed that  of the citys white population is  years old or over compared with  for the nonwhites in the city dr matthew l tayback assistant commissioner of health for the city of baltimore has said it is safe to characterize the baltimore negro population as a young one and the white population as an elderly one this is essentially the whitenegro characteristic of many american cities since the negro population is young and at the age of new family formations and product acquisitions the negro is the manufacturers best consumer potential for food clothing home furnishings drug and personal cares products and automobiles industry should know that the negro consumer wants recognition our studies indicate that negro readers of a dozen or more different magazines find high class negro models in a negro magazine more appealing and interesting than white models these industrialists are responsive to your opinions your preference for negro or white models to demonstrate illustrate or recommend brands that are soliciting your business is important to marketing and sales experts industry is also interested in knowing your preferences in magazine reading large sums are spent in media research to study reading audience characteristics the daniel starch research organization provides a measurement of the percentage of negroes and whites in the audience of  magazines generally magazines that are oriented primarily to reflect the  interests and participation of a particular reader group have heavy concentrations of readers of that group for example all of the home service mens and weekly magazines have  to  white readeraudiences ebony magazine with beautiful negro models in ads and feature pictures has  negro families in its reading audience life magazine has  negro families in its  circulation look magazine covers  negro households and saturday evening post    reassessing our economic strength we find that the negro market is  million population with  billion to spend onehalf of the negro population is strategically located in  major markets and comprises over  of the total population for those cities national advertisers striving mightily to get a toehold are vitally interested in favorably influencing negro consumer acceptance manufacturers are concerned about the local policies of downtown department stores where their brands must be sold these retail outlets now have up to   negro customers the negro market is big and will probably increase to  of the gross national product a possible increase of about billion more as negro family income goes up purchases of homefurnishings are planned first following this the negro family plans a trip abroad ranking third on his priority list is home improvement the growth and importance of our economic strength can best be summed up by a quote of excerpts of a letter from the secretary of labor to the president of the united states dear mr president he wrote for your interest and consideration i am forwarding a special study the economic progress of negroes in the us a notable development in recent years has been the steady improvement on the social and economic status of negroes in education type of work income housing and other areas for which measures are available the historic differentials between whites and negroes have narrowed this report while measuring progress permits satisfaction with past achievement only as a prelude to a determination to forge ahead with vigor in opening doors of opportunity even wider the secretary concludes as i would restate our own evaluation of the negro market potential it is not a basis for complacency but a spur to continued action
my countryman my enemy
ten per cent or so of the american servicemen on okinawa were negroes very occasionally they ran amok especially in an area known as koza four corners the four corners consisted of some five hundred gaudy bars with names like cotton club and new york jump the bars were monopolized by the negroes and whites who entered the area ran the risk of being beat en up sometimes young negroes marched up the hill from the four comers towards the business section of koza fighting and wrecking bars as they went the negroes in turn complained that some of the nco clubs and other places on the island were virtually off limits to them a negro air force staff sergeant said in his big deep voice it just about takes an act of congress for a negro serviceman to get in those clubs or some of them if an okinawan waitress in a club that has white southerners on its committee dates a negro or is even seen talking with a negro she gets fired i asked a white staff sergeant what he thought of that the white serviceman has just as much right to want his recreation spots for himself and his friends without having negroes around as the negroes have to want them integrated he said judiciously about negroes and okinawan girls he said its considered fashionable here for white and yellow to mix but its kind of taboo for white and black to mix he concluded anyway you dont gain acceptance for yourself and your friends by mob violence not long ago about a hundred of those young negro hoodlums marched up from four corners and tried to take the town a negro from texas a marine sergeant said gloomily that the four corners was just like being across the tracks in any mississippi town he added you know it was set up to be like that about six years back or more they just kind of gave the four corners to the negroes to keep us quiet and to try to cut down whiteblack fights on his first pass being unaware of all this he strolled into the white area of koza a white mp walked up to me and tapped me on the shoulder keep moving boy he said i beg your pardon i said dont get wise with me nigger he said you heard me tar baby  the sergeants jaw muscles tightened at the memory  now look here i said to him he continued im a sergeant in the marines heres my pass damn your pass he said up here youre nothin but another loudmouthed nigger the thing is said the sergeant earnestly that the peking radio reports all this you know some americans think we ought to keep quiet about it and never tell anyone like you cornin in from outside but the peking radio talks about it the okinawans know all about it just our own folk back home in the states they don know about it the okinawans to whom i talked seemed surprisingly placid about any whiteblack tension in their midst before the war the japanese soldiers on okinawa also committed criminal acts a policeman said    but when it was suggested that indigenous law enforcers should carry firearms for the protection of themselves and other okinawans only okinawans guarding american bungalows and american military installations had gunshe smiled and shook his head that might only provoke the foreigners against us now they fight each other he said but this was an official view another okinawan said more bitingly white americans who treat black americans as inferiors are hardly likely to think of asians as equals    
how negroes escaped slavery in the revolutionary war
in the revolutionary war the american negro was a pari ticipant and a symbol he was active on the battlefronts and behind the lines in his expectations and in the gains he registered during the war he personified the goal of that freedom in whose name the struggle was waged the negros role in the revolution can best be understood by realizing that his major loyalty was not to a place nor to a people but to a principle insofar as he had freedom of choice he was likely to join the side that made him the quickest and best offer in terms of those unalienable rights of which mr jefferson had spoken whoever invoked the image of liberty be he american or british could count on a ready response from the blacks on the american side the negro saw only limited military service until the war dragged on into its third year this negative attitude toward enlisting the colored man sprang from a reluctance to deprive a master of his apprenticed servant or chattel slave and from the fear of putting guns in the hands of a class of persons most of whom were not free in the main the negro was thought of as a servile laborer rather than as a potential warrior but when manpower needs became acute whether in the volunteer forces the militia or the continental troops hesitancies and fears were put into the background and the negro was mustered in this procedure typified an attitude toward negro enlistment that would prevail in americas future wars from colonial times until the twentieth century the negro would be bypassed in the early stages of conflict but as the struggle grew arduous civilian authorities and military commanders would turn to the one great remaining manpower pool and the negro would emerge from his status as a rejected inferior to become a comrade in arms some twenty months after the war broke out between england and her former coloniesby the close of grim necessity forced the states to reconsider the decision to exclude negroes from their armies bound by the necessity of conciliating southern views congress still refused to sanction negro enlistments but the states went ahead early in  massachusetts included negroes in the list of draft eligibles and the legislature of rhode island at its february  session voted to raise two battalions of slaves the substitute system encouraged the enlistment of negroes a man summoned to service was permitted to get someone to take his place and to procure a negro was easier and less expensive than to procure anyone else in virginia and in maryland the change in attitude toward negro soldiers was a consequence initially of the difficulty of mobilizing white manpower and later of the southward shift of the main theatre of war unlike their sister states south carolina and georgia steadfastly refused to legalize slave enlistments south carolinas heavy negro population made her fearful of such a step and georgia shared these misgivings when these states remained adamant even after the fall of savannah late in  congress recommended that they raise  negro troops but these two states declined to reverse their stand and maintained it to the end
the negro welcomed the resort to arms although not very strong on theory he fulfilled the pragmatic requirements of a revolutionary he had little to lose in goods or lands and he lacked a sentimental or blood tie with england at any rate black americans quickly caught the spirit of  in the words of frederick douglass the most prominent colored american of the nineteenth century the revolutionary war announced to negroes the advent of a nation based upon human brotherhood and the selfevident truths of liberty and equality there were portents of a new era individual slaves petitioned for their manumission groups of slaves memorialized state legislatures to abolish slavery for the first time a gallery of distinguished negroes made their appearance among them phillis wheatley precocious poet prince hall founder of negro masonry and benjamin banneker mathematician and astronomer negro soldiers served in the minutemen companies of massachusetts in the early weeks of the war in the state militia of the northern states and in the state and continental forces they saw action in the continental army at monmouth the last major battle in the north at yorktown where on july   the continental army passed in review baron von closen an aidedecamp to general rochambeau made note that threequarters of the rhode island regiment consists of negroes and that regiment is the most neatly dressed the best under arms and the most precise in its maneuvers negroes served on sea as well as land in the chesapeake waters of virginia and maryland the use of negro pilots often impressed slaves was not uncommon and the massachusetts legislature ordered that captured slaves be made to serve on state vessels negroes were numbered among the more than twenty thousand seamen aboard the armada of american privateers it is not possible to give accurate figures as to the number of blacks in the american armies not more than a third of the negroes who bore arms were racially labelled moreover colored combatants were interspersed with whites in what today might be called unsegregated units it has been estimated however that  negro soldiers served in the patriot forces a respectable figure particularly since so many were not free to act although man power shortage was the paramount factor the changed american sentiment toward drawing negroes into the war effort and thus conceding them a higher status was in part a reflection of the humanitarian impulse which inspired the revolution and was engendered by it antislavery sentiment mounted rapidly and action was taken on both continental and state levels above the potomac public opinion turned strongly against slavery by march  pennsylvania was ready to lead the way by passing an act for its gradual abolitionwars end brought further gain to the negro to the slave soldier who had borne the responsibilities of citizenship before he could enjoy its rights it brought freedom and in some instances a land bounty in new jersey slaves belonging to tories were freed by act of the legislature waged in the name of liberty the war caused many americans to give a hard look at their own domestic practices abolitionist societies multiplied often under quaker sponsorship northern states following pennsylvanias lead took action to abolish or circumscribe the slave trade and slavery in the south the wartime decline of the staple crops tobacco indigo and ricedecreased both the value of the slave and the reluctance to give him his freedom thousands of negroes gained their freedom by joining his majestys forces faced like their opponents by a manpower shortage the british were receptive to the use of blacks and in  commanderinchief sir henry clinton issued a proclamation offering freedom to negroes who would join the royal standard the british move was countered by the americans who exercised closer vigilance over their slaves removed the ablebodied to interior places far from the scene of war and threatened with dire punishment all who sought to join the enemy to negroes attempting to flee to the british the alternatives liberty or death took on an almost literal meaning nevertheless by land and by sea they made their way to the british forces in the south the british employed hundreds of runaways as shock troops others served as guides and spies it was as military laborers however that they found their widest use negro carpenters hostlers blacksmiths axmen and miners markedly increased the striking power of his majestys armed forces the british discovered as had the americans that a negro laborer could perform a service that otherwise would have to be done by a white soldier when the war ended hundreds of negroes were evacuated from savannah charleston and new york with the departing british forces the establishment of american independence did not bring all that many negroes had hoped for the idealism of the declaration of independence gave way to the conservatism of the constitutional era but if the negro felt that the cause of liberty had lost momentum his mood was somewhat brightened by the conviction that the revolutionary era in which he lived had marked out an irreversible path toward freedom that henceforth there could be no turning back even if there was a slowing down   
evacuation with the british
if they have a sufficient number of transports they will carry with them about twelve thousand negroes which they have now in charles town and which they have stolen in their various expeditions into the country ralph izard to mrs izard october   the chief concern of americans about negroes in the thirty months after yorktown was their disappearance whenever the defeated british made their final withdrawals whether by land or sea thousands of slaves went with them take what precautions they would the americans could not prevent mass exodus of their black bondmen which began immediately after cornwalliss defeat the articles of capitulation at yorktown stated that any american property held by the british garrison was subject to recovery the surrender terms were silent however about slaves who would try to escape by going aboard the departing warships of the royal navy americans did not need to be told that prompt action was necessary to forestall the flight of slaves on the very day of the yorktown surrender general george weedon placed sentinels all along the beach to prevent them from reaching the vessels of the royal navy prompt as was his action he feared that many runaways had already secreted themselves on board the ships on the next day weedon sent a letter to governor nelson apprising him of the situation virginias chief executive had not been idle within twentyfour hours after the surrender he had written to cornwallis asking him to prevent negroes from making their escape by boarding the sloop of war bonetta which was allowed to sail to new york with news of the capitulation these negroes cautioned the governor would endeavor to lie concealed from your lordships notice till the vessel sails general washington lent his support to the effort to keep negroes from leaving the state he was disturbed about the number of slaves who attached themselves to the british or posed as free men in order to deceive american commanders to put a stop to such irregularities washington on october  ordered officers of the allied armies to deliver all negroes who came into their hands to a guard to be established at yorktown and gloucester under the superintendency of david ross virginias commercial agent negroes who could prove they were not escaped slaves would be released slaves whose masters lived in the vicinity would be issued a pass enabling them to make their way home unmolested slaves whose owners were not virginians would be advertised in newspapers of their home states while waiting for their masters to claim them they would be sent into the country to work for their victuals and cloathes washingtons order seems to have placed a check on slaveseizing by american and french officers as well as those of the enemy doubtless this was what he intended for he was fully aware that some american commanders had a weakness for acquiring property in blacks ten days before cornwalliss capitulation washington requested american army officers to report any negroes they had who have come out of york henceforth if any officer kept such a person in his service he would be called to the strictest account washingtons order also applied to officers of the state militia civilians did not come under military regulations and to prevent them from retaining other peoples slaves the virginia legislature in may  ordered all holders of runaways to deliver them to their masters if known if the master was not known an advertisement seeking him was to be placed in the virginia gazette any person who could prove his right to a slave lost during the cornwallis invasion might apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant of recovery to compel americans to give slaves back to their owners was a trying task but it was nothing compared to getting the french to give up their negroes in dealing with an ally whose assistance at yorktown had been almost invaluable a delicate touch was essential washington used a personal approach in writing to the count de grasse on behalf of a maryland master who had lost upwards of forty slaves five of whom had been taken in the bay by a french ship and carried to the west indies i will take it as a very great favor if your excellency will direct them to be sent back by any vessel coming either to virginia or maryland the expenses of their return trip would be paid by colonel william fitzhugh their master the difficulties of negotiating with the french were tvpified by an incident which occurred when the french troops were stationed in charlotte county in southeastern virginia an american militia officer colonel thomas read sent a sergeant and a guard to the french camp to apprehend runaways and return them to their owners the french commander the marquis de choisy informed read that he considered his application unnecessary insisting that he had already come to an agreement with the governor respecting slaves the rebuked read dismissed the guard but he informed governor harrison that unless the negroes who had deserted to the french were quickly reclaimed those who have property of that kind in the vicinity of the camps will suffer by their going off with such complaints mounting governor harrison took the matter up with general count rochambeau expressing his reluctance to trouble the french commander harrison nevertheless found it necessary to mention that reports were coming in every day about negroes harbored by the french troops and that there was no way in which masters could recover their property except through your justice he asked rochambeau to issue orders to hold all negroes within his lines simultaneously the governor ordered the virginia commissioner of war to order a detail to receive the slaves supposed to be with the french army two days later rochambeau explained his position he and many other french officers owned negroes but these had come from rhode island having either been captured there by the french fleet or purchased from rhode islanders moreover some of the negroes with the french were hired others were free he was ready said rochambeau to help the virginians recover slaves but not at the sacrifice of the rights of his fellow frenchmen rochambeaus response was hardly satisfactory to the state authorities the governor notified virginias delegates to congress a week later that the french troops were moving northward with many negroes since some of these belonged to north and south carolina masters he thought that the congressional delegates from those states should be notified in order to recover the negroes when the french reached philadelphia the exasperated governor then unburdened himself to george washington declaring that he had written so many protests to the french authorities about loss of slaves that i am wearied out without being able to procure them some indeed had been returned but most of them had been kept by the french either for want of their owners having any proof at hand or the negroes declaring themselves free little could be done about runaways who passed themselves off to the french as free men except to put notices in the press a baltimore master advertised for ned who was skulking in the neighborhood of this town in order to join the french they would likely welcome him as a refugee according to the advertisement because he was very capable of being a waiter or hostler to any officer having been a waiter and coachman to colonel white of the state of georgia ever since the war commenced for some months after the surrender at yorktown the british appeared unable to carry on the war and too proud to make peace but by april  his majestys ministers had decided to evacuate their troops using three of the major seaports the first of these departures took place at savannah in the summer of  a week before the date set for the evacuation the georgia assembly urged governor john martin to request of the british commandant of savannah that no negroes or other property belonging to americans be carried off the legislators also asked governor martin to grant permission to citizens having property in british hands to lodge a formal claim realizing that georgia needed all its manpower resources to rebuild the states economy the lower house also tried to persuade departing tories to leave their slaves behind the commissioners for the sales of forfeited estates were empowered to purchase negroes from evacuees and sell them to residents on condition that the purchasers would not carry them out of the state for at least eighteen months british military forces formally withdrew from savannah in july  evacuating loyalists with their slaves as well as troops on july  general leslie ordered the royal navy to provide shipping accommodations for  whites and  negroes an embarkation return of august   lists six ships as having carried  negroes to jamaica by december   an additional  negroes had been taken to st augustine seven months later this figure had reached  of whom  were men  women and  children    another problem which leslie laid before his superiors was the british obligation to the negro when leslie learned that charleston was to be evacuated he asked the commanderinchief for instructions as to the disposition of the negroes under commissioner cruden and those employed in the different departments there are many negroes who have been very useful both at the siege of savannah and here he wrote some of them have been guides and for their loyalty have been promised their freedom he pointed out that no matter how the sequestered negroes were disposed of there was an obligation to those who had voluntarily joined the british something was owed them because of the promises made to them and because of their past services they could not in justice be abandoned to the merciless resentment of their former masters carleton supported leslie in refusing to give up negroes who had borne arms for the king or had otherwise incurred the resentment of american patriots leslie therefore appointed a commission composed largely of military officers to hear the appeals of negroes who had served with the british army or who claimed to have fled to the british in response to proclamations offering them their freedom the responsibility which he felt to the negroes aggravated his major problem in the evacuationthat of trying to assure the south carolinians that their property would not be carried off masters were already sufficiently alarmed by the difficulty of recovering slaves by legal process they had to prove ownership and in establishing such proof they could not employ the testimony of the slaves themselves or of other negroesa law which the south carolinians themselves had enacted    the british evacuated charleston without any supervision of their shipments when on december   they finally left the city they took  negroes of whom onehalf were destined for jamaica of the remainder all but  went to east florida with a few finding their way to st lucia halifax england and new york the last american port to be evacuated was new york by november   when the last of his majestys troops boarded their transports the final peace treaty had been signed since this treaty included a statement relating to negroes the new york evacuations had a broad interest one involving policy and its observance by the signatories the preliminary articles had contained an agreement that his majestys forces should withdraw without carrying away any negroes or other property of americans the terms of this agreement signed at paris on november   soon became common and official knowledge in america on april   commanderinchief sir guy carle ton issued an order from his new york headquarters warning all masters of british vessels not to commit any breach of the article relative to negro removals on the very same day the congress instructed general washington to make arrangements to obtain the delivery of the negroes and other american property then in the hands of the british or their adherents a week later washington wrote to carleton suggesting a meeting sir guy was willing if unenthusiastic i cannot decline the personal interview proposed by your excellency this important conference was held at orangetown on may  washington was accompanied by his military secretary and flanked by three witnesses one of whom was george clinton new yorks able war governor washington led off by stating that he had asked for a personal conference as the speediest way of reaching agreement over the major problems connected with the british evacuation namely taking over the posts occupied by the british troops and recovering negroes and other property belonging to americans carleton replied that the british were leaving the county as fast as they could civilians had already been sent away including some negroes expressing surprise washington observed that transporting negroes was contrary to the provisional treaty carleton then advanced a point of view which dismayed the american negotiators despite its familiar ring it could not have been the intention of his government said carleton to ignore its obligations to negroes who had come into the british lines under proclamations of freedom issued by his predecessors to deliver up such persons some of whom would thereby be executed and others seriously punished would be a dishonorable violation of the public faith however if british evacuation of the negroes was subsequently declared to be a treaty infraction the crown would compensate their owners with this possibility in mind carleton had directed that a register be kept of all negroes involved    thus the british evacuation of new york as of savannah and charleston proceeded with little american hindrance alexander hamilton found the british point of view on slaves defensible but his was an almost solitary voice in nonloyalist circles indignation over the carrying away of slaves was both widespread and enduring it was to affect american diplomatic relations with great britain for nearly half a century years after the war americans were still hammering the point that the payment of prewar debts in london and glasgow should be withheld until his majestys government made restitution for the lost blacks it appears that the position britain finally adopted on the return of slaves was formulated by guy carleton whose view became standard policy negroes who were with the british prior to the signing of the provisional treaty on november   were free those acquired after that date were to be given up in arriving at this dictum carleton was doubtless moved as he claimed by a sense of responsibility to the negroes a farseeing man carleton may also have felt that if britain defaulted on promises of freedom made during the war any similar proclamations in future conflicts would not be trusted nevertheless he carefully fulfilled his assurances to washington that he would keep a register of negroes to facilitate the compensation of their american owners he assigned a board of three men to keep the register and every wednesday morning the board met for two hours at fraunces tavern with the three american commissioners by the time his majestys forces officially withdrew from new york on november   the british commissioners had compiled a detailed list of  negroes they had inspected comprising  men  women and  children this massive inspection roll of negroes bore eight columns listing the names of the negroes their former masters and the names of the vessels on which they were embarking one heading was entitled description and bore such arresting comments as fine boy an idiot likely rascal snug little wench and nearly worn out to these  negroes who left new york must be added the hundreds of unregistered ones carried away in private vessels the total number of colored persons who left that city as well as other ports can only be guessed perhaps it would be safe to say that during the evacuations the numbers of negroes leaving savannah was  charleston  and new york  if anything these figures are a bit low and they do not of course include those who went off with the french nor the thousandsperhaps around five thousandwhom the british carried away prior to the surrender of yorktown many negroes were carried off without regard for their own wishes this would be particularly true of slaves belonging to departing loyalists likewise many negroes who had deserted to the british were not consulted about their being taken off in the evacuations perhaps most of these former runaways would have left america voluntarily since the british had assiduously spread the idea that those who went back to their american masters would be severely whipped and then assigned the hardest kind of labor the belief that their former masters would treat them harshly for having fled was no doubt a strong factor in shaping the conduct of negroes who had a free choice in peacetime a recovered runaway was not likely to get off lightly in wartime a slave who not only had taken to his heels but had joined the enemy had reason to feel nervous about the welcome he would receive upon his return to the home plantation to allay this  fear some masters promised a pardon virginias theodorick bland jr  sent word to his slaves isaac and kitt who were in new york that if they would come back to framingdell the family plantation in prince george county he would let bygones be bygones neither would listen isaac informed blands emissary that he had heard that once a slave had returned to his master he was treated with great severity exclusive of the thousand or more youngsters who were born within  the british lines and who therefore might be considered bom free a small number of adult free negroes perhaps a few hundred went off in the evacuations there were eight free negroes among the  colored refugees who came to east florida from south carolina as of july   numbered in the  black emigrants from georgia to east florida as of july   were  free negroes accompanying the british from charleston to new york late in  was free negro bacchus a smith by trade thirteen free negroes  men and  women were included in the  adults sailing out of new york in november  on the peggy concord and diannah    thousands of negroes were taken to other islands in the british west indies from  to  the colored population of jamaica showed an increase of  practically all of the black immigrants were slaves many had been brought in as slaves but many others who came expecting to be free were seized by those holding no legal title and sold for rum coffee sugar and fruits perhaps the most noteworthy of the negroes taken to jamaica was george liele who as a slave and a free man in georgia had been a dedicated preacher brought to kingston in  as an indentured servant liele worked out his time in two years once he obtained his certificate of freedom liele resumed his work in religion preaching in private homes and then organizing a churchthe only baptist church on the island by  more than  persons had received baptism at his handsmany of the negroes evacuated from the united states did not go southward thousands went to canada perhaps their lot may be suggested by focussing on the story of africanborn thomas peters darkskinned and of large frame peters had in  fled from his master and joined the british during the war he served as a sergeant in a negro armsbearing pioneer company being twice wounded in battle with the coming of peace he and his wife settled at annapolis in nova scotia a province to which many of the canadabound negroes went the british had promised peters and his comrades not only freedom but a farm his majestys officers were slow in making good the promise of a farm and the civilian authorities were likewise dilatory the black settlers in nova scotia felt cheated either the surveyor was too busy to mark out their lands or the plots they received were largely thick pine forest and hard to clear finding themselves landless or holders of land that would produce little many negroes apprenticed themselves to farmers or congregated in burchtown a nearly allnegro community peters was a patient man but after six years of waiting he determined to go to england to seek redress from the kings ministers by virtue of a small sum raised by his fellows and by working as a hand to pay his passage aboard ship peters arrived in london early in  here he received a welcome that must have made up for much of the disappointment of the preceding years granville sharp and his fellow reformers took peters in tow and soon the former slavesoldier became a london celebrity his eloquence his passion his spirit made him the rage of the newspaper world the latest fashionable craze and the newest object of philanthropy to assist peters his abolitionist friends drew up a memorial in his name and sent it to william w granville secretary of state for foreign affairs this document described the plight of  colored families at annapolis royal and  families at new brunswick these negroes would remain in those provinces it was said if they could obtain the full grant of land and provisions originally promised them otherwise many would be willing to migrate to any country which would make them a competent offer  this petition which peters signed by making his mark brought quick action the secretary of state ordered the governor of nova scotia to investigate the matter if the charges were true the governor was informed that the province must fulfill its obligation or send these families to sierra leone a removal to sierra leone would entail some expense but his majestys government had an obligation to these negroes for their wartime services the idea of transporting the canadian negroes to africa originated with the directors of the recently incorporated sierra leone company founded to enable destitute negroes in london to make a new start by settling them on the west coast of africa the company had acquired a site and begun operations by the time peters visited london on its board of directors in  the company counted such wellknown abolitionists as thomas clarkson william wilberforce and granville sharp it was sharp who introduced peters to the other board members and enlisted their interest in the black nova scotians in turn peters was favorably impressed by the kindness of the board membersby their assurance that he and his associates would be welcome to sierra leone and by their belief that his group would be better off there than in frigid canada with the tacit support of parliament and the approval of peters the sierra leone company got busy on august   the company authorized two agents lawrence hartshorn of halifax and john clarkson to screen out the candidates for resettlement and get written testimonials as to their character sobriety and industry the agents were authorized to offer twenty acres of land to each prospective migrant with ten additional acres for his wife and five for each child    many of the candidates were personally enlisted by peters who returned to the province prior to clarksons arrival including his family peters recruited a total of eightyfour persons from st john new brunswick and annapolis and brought them to halifax some applicants made their way alone many of these arrived at the headquarters city only after hard journeys of up to  miles through wooded and little known country    thanks to men like george and peters there was no problem in recruiting good prospects indeed the directors of the sierra leone company were surprised and gratified by the number of applicants by the end of the year a large enough group had been recruited and the ships chartered on january   a bit over three months after his arrival at halifax agent john clarkson could joyfully write i am now under sail with a fair wind and fine weather having on board  souls in fifteen ships properly equipped and i hope destined to be happy for the next few weeks the embarking nova scotians were not as happy as clarkson had hoped the expedition ran into heavy squalls temporarily separating one ship from another some sixtyfive of the voyagers died at sea and another hundred were too ill to be landed when the fleet pulled into kru bay in early march when the remaining thousand stepped ashore they found that little preparation had been made to receive them they knew they would have to work long hours if they were to succeed in throwing up enough shelters before the rainy season set in but if at the moment their new dwelling site lacked adequate housing it bore a sweet sounding namefreetown
