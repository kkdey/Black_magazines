who was marcus garvey
in  jamai ca a named amy garvey on the arm of her chair and invokes the name of her late husband he was no damn fool says he was no buffoon or clown american negroes will find out that he was right integration is not enough far away in the damp chill of london another woman named amy speaks the name of the man to whom she too was once married his spirit is still a dynamic force in the world the seeds he scattered in the s are beginning to bear fruit in america in washington park on chicagos south side an old black man holds a small audience with the same name that mahn he sings in a pronounced west indian accent that mahn was right no one is going to help the black mahn but the black mahn that mahn marcus moziah garvey has been dead now for  years he died broke an exconvict and some said a failure but time has dealt kindly with the jamaican firebrand today  years after his stunning harlem triumphs his name is on many lips a few months ago during the nationwide uproar over black nationalist groups commentators and columnists summoned the ghost of garvey recently a book black moses and several articles in scholarly journals have probed into his life when kwame nkrumah the first african prime minister launched his ship line he went back to garvey for a name black star not the least of many factors in what approaches a garvey revival is the increasing interest of american negroes in a resurgent africa among many people who feel recent events vindicate the little giant are the two women named amy garveys widow amy jacques and his first wife amy ashwood contend that he was a prophetic figure who lived  years before his time garvey they say  did two vitally important things  he went to the heart of the race problem by ripping away the shame and inferiority that were stunting the growth of the black men  he focused attention on africa when black nationalism was dormant to understand these contentions and the air of controversy that still surrounds the garvey name one must go back  years to the heyday of garveyism the man behind the ism was a short black spellbinder with a dandyish mustache and piercing magnetic eyes during the fabulous s he hypnotized the harlems of america with a backtoafrica movement using as a text the slogan africa for the africans at home and abroad garvey preached the gospel of a united africa under the rule of black men in the process he developed what many sociologists consider the first and only mass movement among american negroes he gave his followers parades uniforms and pageantry he declared god and jesus black and urged negroes to glory in their blackness garvey talked big and dreamed big the late james weldon johnson said garvey collected more money an estimated  million in one twoyear period than any other negro organization had ever dreamed of he organized cooperatives factories a small army and a commercial steamship venture the black star linearrested in  on a charge of using the mail to defraud he was convicted and subsequently deported to his native jamaica in  his dreams shattered he died in london that commented professor albert bushnell hart of harvard university is the difference between success and failure had garvey succeeded in his undertakings he would have been uncontestably the greatest figure of the th century having failed he is considered a fool to many of his contemporaries garvey was a fool or worse but says amy jacques garvey they were blind all around you she adds all around you you can see the things he saw then coming true going back into the turbulent  racial history of the s she avers that it was important for a leader to come forward at that time and tell negroes that they were somebody it was important to assure them day after day by every technique available that black was not a color to be ashamed of he gave to millions of people who had no ambition who felt they were born with a handicap a new sense of dignity and personal worth she says he made the masses feel proud of their black skin their kinky hair and their thick lips he lifted black people up and made them feel that they were something of value garvey told them god made you black and he didnt make a mistake race pride meant something to every individual thats why he urged negro children to play with black dolls i remember the controversy over the painting of a black christ his critics laughed and said you see garvey wants to make everything black garvey knew and said that god is a spirit but he said since you are made in the image and likeness of god when you visualize him you must visualize him as looking like you instead of visualizing him as looking like another mana white man carried away by the polemical skill of her late husband she laughs and her eyes sparkle oh she says you cant beat his arguments you cant beat them theyre irrefutable few things are more alive to amy jacques garvey than her late husband when i talk she says i talk for garvey i feel i can interpret how he would feel if he were alive the dynamic woman who has edited a book of garvey speeches has at her fingertips almost everything garvey said and did she can quote for hours from his speeches all around her in the handsome house on kingstons mona road are garvey paraphernaliaold books busts and pictures mrs garvey who has lived in kingston since her husbands death raised their two boys marcus jacques and julius and put them through school by dabbling in real estate and disposing of inherited property amy jacques who is thin and intense differs considerably from her childhood friend amy ashwood who was garveys first wife amy ashwood is heavier and although she lives in london she wears african tribal robes both women however are natives of jamaica both have written books about garvey unpublished and both are persuasive conversationalists amy ashwood started with garvey in jamaica and was associate secretary of his first version of the universal negro improvement association she was also garveys private secretary he divorced her in  and married amy jacques who was then his private secretary at the time of the divorce amy ashwood said some harsh things about the man who proclaimed himself provisional president of africa but time has mellowed her now living in london where she operates the afropeoples centre she spends most of her time preaching the gospel of the new africa which she says owes so much to garvey garvey stole the march on africa she says africa was slumbering when garvey struck at that time the american negro did not want to hear the word africa she smiles you would try to talk to them and they would say i aint lost nothing in africa more than any other man of his time garvey made a contribution towards awakening the masses of the world to racial insecurity although he  was not the first to visualize a strong and independent west africa he gave the idea the new urgency and a tremendous impetus although both women agree on garveys main contributions to the modern world they expressed in separate interviews different opinions on other aspects of garveyism amy ashwood for example believes that garvey would have adjusted his program to changed conditions amy jacques denies that he would have changed every  plank in his platform she says is valid amy ashwood says that garveys bitter enemy the naacp is the american organization doing the most to propagate his ideas the naacp she says has acquired the mantle of garvey they  are the aggressive organization in america today they are making all the moves garvey would have made it must be remembered however that the naacp is a nationalist group and there are other problems outside the united states which it is not addressing itself to amy jacques expresses the traditional garvey opinion that the naacp is an organization of middleclass negroes dominated and financed by whites it cant be called a negro organization she says apart from a few lodges and churches there are few purely negro organizations in america such an organization is vitally necessary she says garveyism is still pushed by garveyites in america amy ashwood says flatly that backtoafricanism which most laymen consider a central tenet of garveyism is outmoded she says i dont believe the backtoafrica movement would be valid for american negroes today i rather think that the booker t washington philosophy of dropyourbucketwhereyouare should permeate american negroes after marcus garvey had returned millions to africa spiritually he had done his work it was finished in the real sense i believe if garvey had lived he would have studied the conditions in africa even more than in the new world and he would have realized that the return to africa had taken placethat the black man in the new world could make a greater contribution to africa by remaining in america rather than migrating it is a sensational misunderstanding of garvey amy jacques says to imply that he advocated backtoafricanism people misunderstood him as a matter of fact the term backtoafrica was used and promoted by newspapers negro newspapers mostly to ridicule garvey there was no backtoafrica movement except in a spiritual sense but migration was planned to liberia because concessions were given there the idea was to take only enough to establish a township as an example and patterns for africans he never advocated mass migration the idea is ridiculous garveys whole program she continues was based on reuniting the three units the people on the homefront in africa american negroes and negroes in the west indies he always saw the three units together he believed in and gave his life for a united race he knew that once a strong african nation was established negroes everywhere would automatically gain added prestige and strength the second mrs garvey is critical of american negroes who she says do not always understand that big cars and fine apartments are not basic to the good life for a man to be respected she says he must have a parent tree the jews have palestine the italians have italy the important thing is nationhood american negroes will eventually win their fight for integration but it will be a hollow victory even if the negro is allowed to participate in a small way he will be swamped as a personality in the body politic and in the years to come the practical realization will be absorption if the american negro is to gain national prestige and racial prestige and economic stability he must become part and parcel of a united race you can have all the highpowered cars you want and all the plush apartments that you want and i can have a horse cart and yet something deep down inside of me makes me feel damn proud to be in a nation of my own and to walk on ground that belongs to me on ground that is being developed and administered by black men of my own choosing what garvey understood was that minority citizenship cannot fulfill the demands of a full man what kind of man was garvey was he a con man or a genius demagogue or prophet he was an enigma amy ashwood says he was a prophet student of mass psychology and something of a healer he was also a racialist in the sense that he conceived it his duty to stimulate in the members of his race something which was a source of great anger to their oppressorsand that something was pride in their origin she falls silent and her hands clutch at the air as she tries to find words to enclose the man finally she says because he could speak to the masses in a language they could understand he was able to assume the mantle of black moses among the contemporaries were many better educated men but most of them lacked the common touch amy jacques says he was a showman an opportunist and a propagandist of the first order he used everything he could to draw attention to and dramatize his ideas he was calm almost phlegmatic in conversation but the minute he walked on a platform he was transformed he could put his finger on the pulse of the audience and address himself to that point in her book she writes a witness at his trial compared him to  a master musician who had complete control of his instrument and plays on it at will and his faults amy ashwood says like the rest of us he was made of mortal clay and he carried his full burden of human weakness and limitation his chief failing was his inability to share responsibility he was autocratic vain and he loved to hog the spotlight he erred in trying to shine too brightly amy jacques says he was not practical he was always so eager to get things done and in cases where he had to rely on others he felt they would do in the same circumstances what he would have done despite these faults both women say garveys name will live in london in an apartment building that once belonged to a lord amy ashwood puts the case for garvey this way he must be resting peacefully and joyously in the certainty that history will give the verdict that he neither lived nor labored in vain and that his successes by far outweighed his faults and mistakes ghanas black star line is a living compliment to garvey nkrumah hasnt forgotten him amy jacques says garvey immortality is assured she says further that garvey knew it he will never be forgotten because he always saw the three units as one he knew that he had made a contribution and he knew that what he had done was worth it he did the dirty work negro leaders owe him a vote of thanks he worked with the masses if the foundation is poor ignorant and rotten how can you build a superstructure that will last he laid the foundation so that a superstructure could be built on it and he did it the only way it could be doneby meeting the masses where they were by dealing with their hopes their frustrations and their fears and so today nkrumah and kenyatta give him credit for the work he did ironically enough garvey never set foot on african soil today as the flames of black nationalism race through the west indies and africa he lies dead in a london grave but his bust rests on a slab of concrete in kingston jamaicas king george vi park a stones throw from the offices of a colored premier this is as close as he ever came to the black_power that obsessed him perhaps as the two amys contend this is close enough marcus moziah garvey they say was a black moses who saw the promised land he never entered from ebony march

are todays athletes too dull
it seems unquestionably to be true that detroits assemblyline system produces fine cars but some doubt clouds the profitable applicability of this system to sports or    are todays athletes too dull in an era not so long gone sports were filled with colorful entertaining characters and these showmenathletes added a great plusquality to games that is sadly missed today in this age of conformity we have a plethora of skilled players who hold their bats the same way run track the same way kick field goals alike but you can count on the fingers of your right hand the stars who still dare to be individuals in their quest for uniformity sports stars today even dress alike and that often approaches the somber style normally to be expected of morticians and income tax consultants of the younger boxers only louisvilles cassius clay is refreshingly different archie moore and sugar ray robinson remain dominant individualistic personalities but such are their dwindling athletic fortunes that they very well may have been removed from the ranks of headliners between the time this story was written and run off the press at negro digest in baseball vic power clevelands first baseman labors to display his amazing artistry afield but instead of appreciation he inspires the defamatory charge of being a showboat to be called a showboat if you happen to be an athlete is a clean sort of way of getting cussed out perhaps the most colorful major league baseball player is the caucasian star washingtons jimmy piersall the payoff for his individuality is a resounding cry from opposing dugouts youre crazy in professional basketball there is wilt the stilt chamberlain who as a superblytalented athlete standing  feet  inch is forced to be an individual bill russell of the boston celtics is the rare player who sports a beard reportedly because hes tired of people mistaking him for chamberlain and bill  occasionally looses his emotions through the medium of a roundhouse right to an opponents jaw but essentially russell is a super defensive player and though he ranges upwards of  feet  inches he no longer stands out physically at a convention of cagers the fbi if given ample time might assemble an allamerica squad composed of colorful stars for the most part however the big heroes of today are about as colorful as the fading strains of a funeral march heavyweight champion floyd patterson hibernates between bouts roger maris the yankee home run slugger often attempted to impersonate greta garbo i want to be alone during his stretch run on babe ruths record jimmy brown the cleveland browns fullback and soft drink salesman is sheer power and speed and all business about the job of scoring touchdowns it is now as if sports heroes are doing probation on their candidacy for election to the staid and stoic ranks of back bay society only a few of them have the courage to twist in public and virtually every word they utter bears the stamp of a publicists approval i became startling aware of this a few years ago after a certain bigoted caucasian player had spit in a negro stars face when i asked the negro star about this great expectorator he said oh hes a nice fella great ball player  of course current sports stars boast many technical qualities the oldtimers never matched this is therefore not a saga dedicated to the theme that the old days were necessarily better this writer belongs to no oldtimers club himself and to confess a truth it is possible that some of the legends ive heard from the oldsters themselves are nothing more than pure fiction on the other hand i do know that in my own time ive watched with growing alarm frequently with yawning boredom the development of factoryline athletes the decline of individuality in sports and this decline appears to run handinhand with the total conformism sweeping this country it is my contention that when sport submerges athletic personalities in its conformist system then games lose much of their appeal their zest their artistry it always has seemed incongruous that a ball player who must hit the dirt on a slide into second base which is about as undignified an act as you can commit in public particularly the bellyslidewill turn around and chastise a contemporary for being a showboat simply because the latter prefers to catch throws at first base with a flairful sweep of one hand instead of playing it by the book in the old days sports stars werent nearly so businessminded as they are today they werent pampered nearly so much the modern athlete wants three days off if he contracts a hangnail and they appear to have loved their games more up to a point a businessminded attitude can be good for the athlete and his sport certainly it is not necessary to drink to excess spend money wantonly on wild wild women and spout profanity in public to earn the reputation of being a character this is not the type of color which is lamented here any athlete who has moxie enough to save his money build an enterprise to insure his future is applauded here on the other hand where would archie moore be today if he were not a colorful figure would dizzy dean remain one of the highestpaid baseball broadcasters if he were not a masterful mangier of the queens english isnt it true that even joe louis remains a popular figure because he possesses a dynamic personality what is this color that i lamentand who were the most colorful athletes of the lost era color is as difficult to explain as why one hollywood actress is sexy and another isnt it is a quality that distinguishes one performer from a crowd in a totally individualistic way it is most often an inborn not a manufactured quality although enterprising publicists often seek to create it color may be found in the way a star speaks runs makes a catch color is a plusquality in a skilled performers stockintrade color in an unskilled performer isnt worth a nickel at the gate but color properly placed is surefire box office even in depression times it is a quality that endears one performer to the crowd while another just as good technically may elicit respect but no fanlove color is a quality with which a player on a losing team may yet salvage some enjoyment for the partisan fan it is often expressed through an athletes display of unshakeable confidence in himself in the fearless way frank robinson digs in at the plate babe ruth used to call homerun shots ted williams used to thumb his nose at sports writers there is no questioning the fine athletic skills of emlen tunnell of the green bay packers hank aaron of the milwaukee braves or elgin baylor of the los angeles lakers but these are not particularly colorful stars they are superstars make no mistake about it and in baylors case perhaps the negative is being stretched yet these are athletes who always make the most difficult play look routine the colorful athlete gets a tremendous kick out of playing money is not a first consideration and he is not ashamed to let people know he enjoys what hes doing he always seems to be having fun the same difference is noted between a louis armstrong and a typical cool cat jazz artist louis plays and sings with a flair all his own with voice and trumpet sounds unmistakably his with an overflowing good feeling and enthusiasm that the stuffy bearded ivyclad cool cat never matches  such is the way with a colorful athlete as compared to the assemblyline star sheer size alone does not necessarily make a player colorful nor for that matter especially good ernie ladd of the san diego chargers stands  feet  inches weighs  pounds and eats like food is going out of style but nobody has nicknamed him big daddy big daddy lipscomb of the pittsburgh steelers on the other hand is not only huge enough to inspire awe he is also good enough to engender respect and flairful enough to be truly colorful most frequently as in big daddys case you are told that a player is colorful by his very nickname somewhere along the line while exuding color he has inspired a coach writer or teammate to give him this catchy monicker such was true of satchel paige goose tatum sweetwater clifton rarely does a colorful player bring such a name as elijah percival or jeremiah into sports in all the annals of sport there never have been more colorful athletes than satchel paige jack johnson or goose tatum among negro performers and mickey walker babe ruth or babe herman among the caucasians walker is remembered as the great fighter who was known to show up for a bout intoxicated get clobbered into sobriety then go on to win his battle ruth was of course the bandylegged potbellied cocky heavyeating funloving homerun hitter who revolutionized offensive baseball herman will always be remembered as a hardhitting erraticfielding star who allegedly caught baseballs with his noggin and of an occasion stole bases that were already occupied all six of these performers had this in common they were uncommonly colorful and they were uncommonly skillful i shall dwell on the former trio at more length satchel paiges main forte was his ability to throw a baseball faster with more accuracy with more complete confidence in his ability than anyone of his time he attracted possibly more fans in more big cities different countries and hick towns than any other pitcher who ever lived because while winning games and striking out batters he was also a master showman a titanic entertainer satch wasand is at age  a dramatic actor of no mean skill which he has demonstrated in one hollywood motion picture he knew instinctively how to manipulate a crowd as well as how to fool batters lean and lanky he affected a slowdrag type of walk that sent crowds into gales of laughter the moment he stepped out of the dugout or bullpen he invented a series of original pitchesand gave original names to pitches that everyone else threw when satch joined the cleveland indians in  youthful gene beardon was surprised to learn that satch threw the spitter supposedly a new pitch oh that  satch rejoined is that what you call it ive been throwing that pitch for  years few pitchers would have had the audacity to call in their infielders and outfielders confident that they could strike out the side but satchel paige did it few pitchers would have dared throw the hesitation pitch at major league hitters but satch did few pitchers possessed his keen understanding of human nature his witticisms his flair for conversation when satch realized that there was some question as to his age he did not end all suspense by merely telling people the truth instead again displaying his flair for showmanship he let everybody guess built the guessing game up into a national contest which still goes on as early as  a fan walked up to satch and claimed you must be  because i saw you pitch a game in  good public relations was a part of satchel paiges color he loved nothing better than an engaging conversation i once saw him patiently and smilingly sign more than  autograph slips in a boston night club during world series time although he had come out of his hotel room only to dance the rhumba he made every person he signed for feel as though he got the biggest bang of his fife out of the project he actually enjoyed it and on that night satch could have run for mayor of boston and won there never was any walking through crowds of kids for satch as some of todays lessable prima donnas do i once heard him scold roy campanella for refusing to sign an autograph for a ladys kid roy was too busy eating but satch wasnt another part of satchel paiges color was his intellect although most of his color stemmed from his skill and his humor on the mound satch like louis armstrong actually was and is a geniusuntutored by oxford standards perhaps but no less a genius he speaks with authority on subjects ranging from muleskinning to engineering i once saw satch talk a famous magazine photographer up a tree on photography photography is one of his many hobbies when he was with the old st louis browns satch did the same to a collegegraduateengineer on the subject of engineering it is satchs claim that he once sang in a tuskegee institute quartet that he foiled a murder attempt on himself by sitting down crosslegged to eat bugs with south american savages when you can come up with stories like that you just have to be colorful for imagination is too a part of color jack johnson was not only in all probability the greatest heavyweight fighter who ever lived he was by far the most colorful cocky and contemptuous of his foes fearless in the ring as well in private life possessed of natural leanings  toward the dramatic jack enlivened his sport as it had not been enlivened before and has not been enlivened since he suffered a loss of popularity because he dared marry a white woman but none of this can detract from the fact that jack johnson was a colorful practitioner of legalized mayhem nothing proves it more than the fact that during his lifetime he was star athlete actor preacher singer nightclub operator writer and whatall jack was known to toy with his intended victims just for the fun of it and the fact that his supreme confidence antagonized fight crowds delighted him he knew this invaluable secret to be successful you either have to make them glad or make them mad the villains role was not distasteful to him jack was so skillful a fighter that he could call his shots as babe ruth is supposed to have called his homerun shot in the world series of  and in the long ago when jim jeffries came out of retirement to assume the role of white hope in a bout with champion jack johnson gave a classic performance while rumors of a fix floated around the ring jack toyed with the massive jeffries methodically chopping him into human hamburger then when jack decided that it was time to end the thing he said well jim you better go for yourself this is itor words to that effect some historians say that until that moment jeffries expected jack to take a dive final proof of jack johnsons colorfulness as a boxer can be found even today in nationwide arguments about his titlelosing bout with jess willard willard will never achieve in history complete acceptance as the better man that day because johnson was shown while taking the count holding an arm and gloved fist over his head as if to shade the sun from his eyes willard claimed a clean knockout johnson insisted that he was forced to throw the fight and his proof of course was the controversial photograph somewhere in the byways of america reese goose tatum still plies his trade as a professional basketball star like satch and jack goose has been a tremendouslytalented athlete both in baseball and basketball but he is most widely known for his rare ability as an athletic comic and pantomimist in the latter category he is without peer internationally known goose brought up from arkansas to the harlem globetrotters a flair for making people laugh he inculcated this into his playing possessed of unusuallylong arms an individualistic gait and a loosejointed body goose seemed to make each shot of the basketball a thing of productional comedy he was the sort like satch who could rouse an audience to laughter just standing stilldoing absolutely nothing but just standing there looking around yet his knack for scoring baskets was uncanny in baseball he sometimes affected an oversized first basemans mitt a comic split as he fielded a low throw a little bit of a jig as he made a fancy play perhaps this was showboating but it was also an art a clean art and millions of people enjoyed it unfortunately there has developed among negroes a school of thinkers who decry the talents of such people as satch and goose and louis armstrong this is partially attributed to the fact that negroes have been brainwashed into thinking that the talents of these men constitute uncle tomism or deplorable buffoonery or lack of dignity which negroes can no longer display to the world but there is a difference between being an uncle tom and being a true clean wholesome showman red skelton a superb clown takes pratfalls and he makes millions of dollars doing it seldom if ever has satchel paige done anything degrading on the field of play many ingroup critics forget that colorful oldtimers of paiges clan are untutored geniuses that in spite of the handicap of poverty and lacking formal education each one through his special genius his wealth of color perfectly matched with his athletic skill has become an international celebrity great as they are none of our young stars of today are as widely known nor as widely loved as satchel paige some of the younger  players look down their noses at him but they crave the lavish approbation the public pays him in a sense the decline of colorful athletes can be charged to or attributed to progress each of the three athletes dwelled on here came to the bigtime already possessing certain original traits each had learned his sport in his own way he was a product of a more individualistic society none had been subjected to a coaching system nor had he been taught that conformism was the rule of life today in baseball most players are products of a farm system where everyone is taught to hit alike run alike field alike unless the athlete follows closely the pattern laid out for him he is liable to be turned away by a manager most professional football players are collegetrained and they therefore bring with them a certain amount of social finesse to coin a phrase which might be most pleasing to the late emily post but which does not easily make for individualisms in their sports no one is encouraged anymore to be different the grayflannel suit is madison avenues trademark and most young advertising men in that sector feel out of place if they dont dress in grayflannel ivy league or whatever is the current style of dress on madison avenue similarly athletes now are encouraged to dress alike wear ties whether they feel comfortable or not clear statements through publicists never speak out on a matter  thus when a jackie robinson or sugar ray robinson speaks independently he is frowned on when a ted williams refuses as he used to to tip his hat to the fans after hitting a home run he is called a rebel no one can change willie mays breadbasket catch and despite his rating as the greatest allaround player in the game willie is called by a few critics a showboat actually the modem athlete is afraid to be colorful unless one comes along who just happens to be so good and so distinctive a personality that no one can change him the colorful athlete finds it most difficult to make it the decline of the colorful athlete is to be lamented it must be admitted that athletes and teams are better than ever because new records are being set all the time but there is something about the factorymade athlete that just doesnt measure up to the oldtime colorful player be he baseball football basketball horse racing hockey or track star these factorymade athletes make it look too easy they have lost the skills so recently displayed by such as kid gavilan in boxing with his bolo punch and his fine sense of timing which allowed him to goof two minutes of each round

as bom and grew i  to manhood south of  the masondixon line and although some twenty years after the civil war and the freedom of the colored man there still existed a feeling of race prejudice as a youth i was indoctrinated with the idea that the colored family was of the servant class uneducated and destined to live in the poorer sections of our city that as a race they could never be educated to the degree attained by the members of the white race yet working for my family was old isaac johnson and his wife cecelia they were descendants of a slave family and neither were free until after the civil war fortunately they had been the chattels of a family by the name of clark good people and with this family they spent their early lives matured fell in love and married isaac as i remember him with his white hair and beard was a saintly man a lovable character and loyal servant cecelia his wife just as saintly and lovable was beloved by and depended upon by our entire family and as a cook she had no equal as a youngster i loved to sit upon their laps and listen to their tales of days spent in slavery and of their experiences during the civil war on isaacs knee with my head upon his shoulder i would listen in awe and enchantment as he would unfold to me how he had stepped upon a copperhead snake the snake biting him on the foot how he immediately took his jackknife made a cut where the fangs had entered the flesh letting the blood carry away the pisen as he termed it the story of how the union soldiers the northerners in dem bloo uniforms in de middle of de night stoled all de food de cattle de horses scotched de land and took ebrey ting de old massa possessed and then he would add ah hopes you son will nebber grows to see de likes ob dat kinda war  well old isaac and cecelia passed on to their reward and we their chillen as they called us grief stricken placed them in the hands of thar lawd years passed and i grew up in  i with old isaacs thoughts in mind went off to war during my service overseas as an ambulance driver i saw wars destruction and devastation i carried back from the front the maimed bodies of all nationalities regardless of race creed or color i learned that war was no respecter of mans station in life the great and the small the white the brown and the black were mowed down as a reaper would do its job in a field of grain as old isaac would say de war god is no specter of persons dey all looks alike to him then i learned of an incident which cut deeper into my feelings that man regardless of race creed or color is as old isaac used to say one of de lawds chillen a group of boys after a costly advance returned to a small french village taken with the loss of several of their buddies they gathered their bodies together catholic protestant and jew and went to the village padre requesting permission to bury their dead in the village churchyard cemetery the old padre granted permission to bury all the baptised buddies within the cemetery but he said the laws of my church will not permit me to allow you to bury the unbaptised jewish boy in consecrated ground they then laid to rest the bodies of all their buddies except the one jewish boy in consecrated ground and with sorrowful hearts they placed the body of the boy of jewish faith in a grave just outside of the burial grounds returning sometime later to visit the village cemetery much to their surprise they found the grave of their jewish comrade in the cemetery grounds surprised they called upon the old padre and asked him why the grave was now within the cemetery enclosure his reply to them was as i informed you boys my church would not allow the unbaptised to be buried in consecrated ground but there is no law on earth that prohibits me from moving the fence your buddies all rest in the arms of our saviour so i have a confession to make that i shall always hold within my heart old isaacs philosophy we is all of us de lawds chillen regardless of the color of our skin or our station in life old isaac was a true disciple of his lawd his hopes dat i would nebber see a war did not come true but in the old padre i found another isaac who taught me all men are created equal regardless of race creed or color may this confession convince others whose prejudices are wavering it took old isaac the old padre and two wars to convince me that all we have to do is move our fences
the tuskegee story
the spectre of white political nation nondo mihaunts fearful whites from downing street tq elizabeth ville and from manhattan to the golden gate but nowhere is legal takeover by negroes more postuskegee pres luther h foster sible than in tuskegee alabama and nowhere else have affronted whites contorted the law to such ludicrous lengths to preserve a political supremacy the unique demography of tuskegee and macon county makes this a major battlefield for the balot testing ground for the fearsome question of whether negroes would participate or dominate if given the chance for only here in this black belt oasis do negroes rest on all three legs of the tripod to power only here does the negro population enjoy superiority in distribution of wealth and educational reserve the countys population disparity negro  white  is a carryover from slavery when the many black hands were needed for the comfort of the white few and has increased by virtue of two major negro institutions located here the countys only two financially important establishments thus far have been tuskegee institute and the veterans administration hospital their combined gross annual payrolls alone total  million  million and  million respectivelymore than half the countys total income  million each institution is predominantly negro with token integration in the last several years amounting to about a dozen whites altogether unless the county attracts more white industry soon it is ironic but conceivable that whites will press for more integration into the two negro institutionsparticularly the veterans hospital tuskegee institute  with a teaching and research staff of  including  phds eight edds two mds nine dvms and  holders of masters degrees and a nonteaching staff of answers the question of educational preparedness even without adding the welltrained nucleus of the member staff of the veterans hospital eleventh largest in the nation the stakes and the strategy even so the denial of political power even political expression to that otherwise prodigious group hasin the pastbeen almost absolute but this has been possible only by denying those citizens the most basic tool of democracy the ballot thus the battle lines are drawn negroes many whites say would take over local government and send representatives to the state house and possibly to congress in short order but squarely between tomorrows negro political representation and todays nonpolitical negro is the high barrier of discriminatory voter registration supporters of the barrier are referred to looselybut with some exactnessas state officials and the whites downtown doing most to beat down the barrier is the tuskegee civic association many of whose  members were among the all but five negro voters gerrymandered out of the city in  by an act of the alabama legislature before the foursided city map was carved into a sided spectacle  negroes were registered city voters no one has doubted and few have denied that the intent of the gerrymander was to prevent negroes from voting in city elections true to its character tca reacted to the gerrymander by educating macon county negroes on the merits of not shopping with white merchants and of setting up more businesses of their own which they did unlike most protest groups which have sprung up across the south since  the tca is more than  years old it has consistently employed discussions and time consuming attempts at conciliation and meticulouslydocumented complaints all without violence or unsavory advantage neither has it sought or received official interference in either direction from the va hospital or tuskegee institute the tcas plodding pace often seems incongruous with the efforts of younger groups whose accent is on direct and immediate action its policies and strategy are very much debated whenever the impatienteven those within the organizationplace a measuring stick alongside tcas accomplishments what does tca do and how fast they ask last winter tca president dr charles g gomillion himself sadly remarked that no progress has been made in race relations in tuskegee since he came to the community  years ago gomillion head of tuskegee institutes social science department noted that there had been some material progress among negroes but progress otherwise was impossible since no white person in macon county will meet with negroes to discuss any type of problem another avenue the may   civil_rights decision was legal payday for those who had waited painfully since plessy v ferguson legalized segregation in  similarly tcas biggest payday came last march when a supreme court verdict followed by the federal district court in montgomery struck one of the most direct blows ever dealt to disfranchisement since enactment of the th amendment for the first time in the nations constitutional history the supreme court ruled in a case on gerrymandering which the court had previously regarded as a political thicket out of judicial bounds but the court held that the tuskegee gerrymander was indeed an exceptional case and ordered the citys boundaries restored on grounds that the intent was to deny a basic federal right to otherwise qualified voters the techniques used to prevent negroes from registering and voting are too incredible to be recounted in any but a compilation of southern tragicomedy but as a partial result of its patented chicanery alabama placed ahead of only her sister antagonistmississippiin the small percentage of voters in  alabama ranking th had only  per cent of her votingage people at the polls while mississippi showed  per cent the national average was  per cent the  elections found throughout the south only  per cent of votingage negroes registered  as compared with  per cent for southern whites in macon county less than  per cent  of the votingage negroes were registered while the books showed  whites registered although the census showed only  white persons of voting age that bleak pattern anchored the tcas case gomillion v lightfoot before the supreme court which remanded it to federal district judge frank m johnson jr sitting in montgomery judge johnson ordered among other things that sixtyfour named negroes must be registered within  days within  days after examining an applicant the registrars must tell the applicant whether he is registered and if not why the board must register any negro whose performance in attempting to qualify is equal to the performance of the least qualified white applicant ever registered and until notified otherwise the board must report to him each month on progress made this was by far tcas biggest triumph in its  years of peaceful efforts but with voting an elemental matter in a democracy the victory was a major achievement in the total southwide struggle for civil_rights since no other case so dramatically and clearly defined the voting issue and unmasked the awesome determination of those who fear the wrath of negro votes important though it was tca members saw clearly the incompleteness of their victory while headlines across the country underscored the verdict tca celebrated cautiously what macon county negroes have had to learn is that while laws are tools they are merely tools and must depend upon the skill and intent of the mechanics who use them who owns government  what have the whites to fear or hope for in being outvoted by nonwhites would there still be a place for them in a government which rightly or wrongly they feel is really theirs to run or ruin what does the tca really want to accomplish for the macon county negro participation in accordance with his interests and ability is gomillions answer if in time he is interested in and capable of filling the majority of positions then he should go into them gomillion adds but to take over just because we are in the majority in populationwe are not interested we want to start at a level at which we can  begin to learn the various intricacies and move on in accordance with our interests and merit we dont take the position that we ought to have the majority of the positions simply because we are more numerous now there are people who do feel that waybut that is not the policy or thinking of the people i work with in the tca we would advocate or support no one for office merely because he was a negro dr gomillion who thinks tuskegee mayor howard rutherford appeared more openminded on local race problems at the time of his  election says now that less conciliatory interests appear to have gotten to the yearold mayor even so the tca president says he plans to negotiate soon with the mayor on such goals as jobs for negroes in local governmental agencies the mayor refused to answer questions on race at the time of this writing because i honestly dont think they will help solve the problems in tuskegee he did say however that he thinks tuskegees race problems are lessening and that we could work the problem out all right if people would be levelheaded and calm votes make a bargain the mayors plea for a period of calm is sincere such a period would allow him to make quiet overtures to negro voters who now equal white voters and who will surely gain ballot superiority be fore another election date arrives following judge johnsons orders last september  negro municipal voters were added to the  permitted to vote before the citycarving at that time  whites were registered but they have not added substantially to that number since the restoration of city boundaries with the court holding the door open negro voting applicants are pouring in at the unprecedented rate of  per registration day two per month with  per cent of them passing the tests white county voters recently outnumbered registered negroes by about  but at the present registration rate the string of  votingage negroes yet to register leaves little room for doubting the outcome the trend against the ballot bigots is gradual but unmistakable in macon county and the city of tuskegee mayor rutherford knows that from here on in heor whoever wins the electionmust get the negro vote this makes for a bargain heretofore nonexistent much credit for the bargain is due to va employee william p mitchell meticulous energetic and methodical chairman of the tca voter franchise committee the most consistently informative and effective of the more than  consecutive tuesday night lectures since  were mitchells clear analyses of the legal loopholes ferreted out or contrived to disqualify negro voters it was mitchells kind of educating and encouraging which fostered the  economic withdrawal that closed the towns only movie and at least  of the towns  white merchandising concerns tca is kaliedoscopic there are many stories in the tca story there are the crusade the internal problems and successes of a negro middle class a towns moral struggle and the oddity of a white minority whose tradition time is ploughing under and of course it is a story of votingwhich seems a threat to one group a right to another and a question to all on the matter of motive much of this composite story was told recently at tcas fourth anniversary celebration of its crusade for citizenship  a campaign given impetus by the gerrymander of  the rev k l buford tca vice president and methodist minister summarized the voting and gerrymander victories and observed another significant achievement has been the spirit of togetherness by which we are now benefited our forces are not divided now our strength is not dissipated as it once was you will remember that it was at this very point that our white neighbors were misled they predicted that we would not stick together they said that we would sulk for a week or two but that we would come back and the whole thing would blow over in a few days but we did not sulk we did not pout like children but we determined that we would join hands the high and the low the lettered and the illiterate the fortunate and the unfortunate the man who lived in a palatial home and the residents of tenement farm houses the man of means and those who were not so fortunate and we decided that this was every mans battle    but the race has not been won as yet and we cannot afford to grow content at this stage in the game for the race will not be won until the last vestige of discrimination and secondclass citizenship has been swept from our view certain differences between the tca and other protest groups are clear generally they add up to the tcas more leisurely pace which due to local circumstances macon county negroes can perhaps better afford tca strategywithdrawal instead of sitins conciliations instead of demands court cases instead of placards downtown and educating to vote instead of to ride may be only surface differences yet such strategy could mean that tca hears the sound of another drummer as thoreau put it if so it could mean that tuskegee negroes will get there by walking instead of marching to participate instead of dominate
the new challenge to negro colleges
 can be proud of the y m jit t £ private negro colleges ww and universities for the ln efh role which they play as a powerful force in the social and cultural changes taking place in the areas where they are located the private negro colleges developed the first generation of negro leadership they later provided the first teachers for the publicly supported colleges and public schools the educated negro ministry and the first opportunities in such professions as medicine and law these colleges and universities subsequently produced leaders who enriched the main stream of american culture booker t washing ton walter white j e k aggrey and charles s johnson to name a few from the past they have continued to develop men whose achievements rank high by any scale of values mordecai w johnson john hope franklin thurgood marshall and martin_luther_king jr are part of a long list of alumni whose accomplishments form the most concrete justification for the support of the private negro colleges one important mission of the private negro colleges  is that of identifying recruiting and financially assisting the talented negro student to obtain an education but the task is even greater than this for we must not only identify recruit and finance todays student we must provide him with guidance and widen his horizon by pointing the way to the many fields of study and job opportunities outside of the traditional professions of teaching preaching law and medicine it is for this reason that i have chosen as the subject to discussemployment prospects in the international field with particular emphasis on africa why africa it is in this area where the interest of many of us gravitates that the united states faces a number of key challenges foremost among these is the continuing clarion call across the continent for selfdetermination the magnitude of this demand may be seen in the fact that during the past  two years  new nations have emerged in africa african countries account for some  member states in the united nationsmore than from any other continent it can be expected that several new nations will join the group in a few they look to the united states for years these new nations are completely committed to the principle of total independence and freedom a similar clear and unequivocal commitment our series of votes in the united nations on the angola situation demonstrate that the u s government is aware of the need for action on this issue the second challenge is the need for accelerated even rapid social and economic development in all of the new african states the great need is not only one of raising the standard of living of the majority of the people but also one of planning and economic development in all of their human resources of massive health programs and of transportation communication and electric power networks africas great mineral and agricultural potential has only partially been exploited the continent produces most of the worlds cobalt diamonds and gold it is the source of substantial supplies of copper iron maganese and uranium among the principle agricultural resources are cocoa coffee palm oil rubber and vanilla the need for technical knowhow as well as technically trained personnel is great the united states together with other highly developed countries of the free world has obligated itself to assist the new african nations in longrange programs of economic and social development the third great challenge is that of educationthe basic tool from which all other instruments of progress are fashioned over  per cent of the population of africa is illiterate the scale of this problem can be seen from the following today for the african countries as a whole only  per cent of the children of primary and secondary school age combined are enrolled in school the situation varies ranging from two per cent of the school age group in several countries to nearly  per cent in others in the majority of cases the proportion of children out of school exceeds  per cent of the school age population it is axiomatic that a high illiteracy rate is incompatible with rapid economic growth and social advancement the african governments agree that the key to the future is education by education i am speaking of a wellbalanced system of primary secondary and technical schools as well as colleges and universities all of these institutions can grow and expand to meet the challenge of the vast shortage of skilled manpower  technicians teachers administrators doctors nurses and specialists of all kinds this lack of trained personnel rather than finances is often the bottleneck to development the united states in cooperation with the various agencies and member states of the united nations is attempting to meet this need squarely with a broad program of assistance now where do we fit in the colleges and universities of the united states are deeply involved in our efforts to meet these challenges first of all they are engaged in the massive program of educating and training the thousands of foreign students who annually come to the united states during the school year  we had a total foreign student population of  of whom approximately  were from africa in addition our american institutions are involved in training thousands of students in americanaided colleges and universities in africa secondly our american colleges and universities are providing many of the specialists for the technical assistance educational and economic development programs that are in operation abroad this is especially true of the staff of experts sent out by the agency for international development commonly called aid and of course i must mention the peace corps which is relying heavily on recent college graduates for its inspiring programs abroad the private negro colleges are not newcomers to the task of edueating africans in fact they have pioneered in this field among the best known of the distinguished graduates of the american negro colleges are president kwame nkrumah and the late dr j e k aggrey of ghana governorgeneral nnamdi azikiwe of nigeria and dr hastings banda of nyasaland the united negro college fund institutions are continuing their links with africa as participants in the african scholarship program of american universities which is directed by dean henry of harvard university not only are we bringing students here but some of our schools such as hampton and tuskegee are operating programs and sending specialists to africa under contract with the u s government but this is not enough notwithstanding the needs of our own country for highly trained personnel the negro colleges and universities should share in the national efforts to meet the tremendous demands placed upon our country by the underdeveloped nations of africa and of the world we must make every effort to encourage and to prepare forward looking internationally minded young men and young women who are eager and capable of serving our government and international organizations both here and abroad in the past because of the spectre of discrimination we have had reason to hesitate in preparing our selves for positions in the international field there is no longer cause for reluctance there is now a challenge the fresh invigorating wind of opportunity that prevails in the field of international employment today the most important limitation of opportunities for the negro in international work is the limitation that the negro sets for himself today the opportunity to equal or surpass the widely acclaimed accomplishments of a dr bunche is much greater opportunities for welltrained negroes at home and abroad are open with such private organizations as the rockefeller brothers fund the ford foundation and the africanamerican institute in addition the opportunities for qualified negroes in the department of state in the international offices and bureaus of other departments and in the united nations and its specialized agencies such as the international labor organization the food and agriculture organization and unesco to mention a few are unprecedented secretary of state dean rusk at the state department conference on equality of employment opportunity last august stated we are determined to do everything we can to insure that discrimination is not practiced in the department of state and that we open up the channels of opportunity to all of our american citizens he further said that american personnel overseas must be representative of all the american people and that is not yet the case that we would like it to be he heavily underlined the fact that the department of state is seeking bright young negroes to take the foreign service examination and competent experienced negroes for appointment to middle and highlevel jobs but let us note with all honesty that  negroes took the recent foreign service examination and none passed in the future let us not be weighed and found wanting in my capacity as assistant secretary of labor for international affairs one of my principal tasks is to serve as chairman of the united states delegation to the annual conference of the international labor organization widely known as the ilo the international labor organization which has its headquarters in geneva switzerland has sent out over  experts of  nationalities to undertake over  assignments in  different countries these experts are trained in many different fields one country may want an agricultural advisor another an educational expert and a third an instructor in the automotive or electrical trades to qualify technical competence and experience often carry as much weight as a phd i should mention that among my other duties i am a member of the board of the foreign service of the united states my office has responsibilities for recruitment training and orientation of foreign service officers particularly those who specialize in labor matters    thus you can see that i have a personal interest in preparing more of our young people to take a place in the international field are we ready to meet the challenge can we provide qualified individuals in sufficient numbers who can take advantage of these opportunities in spite of our limitations of funds facilities and faculties we have an obligation as educational institutions to exert every effort to prepare our students for international service or at least to give them a sufficiently strong background so that they can go on to graduate schools elsewhere and qualify themselves what is needed is a good general education including facility in written and spoken english and a good background in sociology anthropology history government geography economics and administration those students interested in becoming foreign service officers need fluency in at least one modern language in addition to the general liberal arts background already indicated in this regard i call to your attention the administration bill now before the congress which calls for grants and loans for the construction of academic facilities and college scholarships for needy and talented students

the shadow of john brown
on the ninth day of  £ may in the year of our £ lord  a group gtocss of peoplel moj tly e  groes gathered as they have done for a number of years upon a small plateau lying high in the adirondack mountains in northern new york state there they commemorated the onehundredth and sixtysecond anniversary of the birth of john brown abolitionist they recalled that this man left his family his farm and his home on this very spot now only three miles from the famous resort town of lake placid to try an experiment in martyrdom this year they also remembered that it is the close of the first century since the beginning of the civil war it was this very john brown who triggered that conflict when in the summer of  i had a visitor at my home on main street in lake placid in the person of a frail old colored man lyman epps i therefore had the feeling when we shook hands that i was fingertipping a full century of american history it was on the eighth of december  a bitter cold winter day that this man lyman epps had lifted up his voice to sing blow ye trumpets blow as the remains of john brown abolitionist were lowered into the frozen adirondack earth at that time there were many controversial opinions about john brown in his own community some said he had been a martyr others thought him a daring and idealistic patriarch still others those practical ones we always have with usdeclared him an outright fool be that as it may john brown with his five sons and a handful of dedicated followers both white and colored had previously left the log cabin home in what is now known as the north elba township and stealthily headed toward the arsenal at harpers ferry virginia so great was this mans hatred of slavery and its injustices and cruelties that under his inspired leadership the little band dared surround and capture the united states arsenal at harpers ferry john brown had the forlorn hope that the negro slaves would rise up against their masters and join his crusade but the slaves knew little of the movement for their liberation the whole project had been poorly organized if at all for a pitiful few days the band held the fort they were then captured some killed john brown was hanged and his body brought back by his wife to the cold north where today john browns body lies amouldering in the grave while his soul goes marching on here then before me in this yearold negro whose wrinkled face reminded me of a brown withered apple was a living attestation to those days perhaps it was the quiet reserve in which he held himself that gave lyman epps an aura of great dignity out of proportion to his fivefootfive stature when i asked him to what he attributed his many years of earth he gave me a wry smile and answered maam i alius behaves muhself if there is a better rule for longevity i do not know it he sang a ballad for me in a tuneful voice a bit on the quavering side and then confessed his most earnest wish he wanted to be permitted to live in the old brown homestead to wear a cap with an emblem on it in the shape of a golden eagle and to be allowed to tell the summer tourists who flock into the place what he knew about john brown and his family i promised him i would write to the governor this later i did i received an answer from a secretary who referred me to a department who referred me to a bureau who referred me to a society who said no it didnt matter anyhow for on november   lyman epps passed to his heavenly reward at the age of  our village clerk matthew clark told me that he and the undertaker and two colored women wrapped in large woolen shawls against the bitter cold were all that followed the body to its grave there had been no singing perhaps the winter wind moaned through the lonely pine trees as the last of the living symbols of the civil war passed from our region what i gathered from my talks with lyman epps and from what i later learned interviewing some of the descendants of the john brown neighborsnow my neighborsis here related and history corroborates the story  abp the year was  on a beautiful morning in june of that year john brown abolitionist walked out of his house to where a hundred feet beyond lay forever imbedded in the mountain soil a great granite boulder some ten feet high and about thirty feet  long from the back of this stone where it sloped upward to a rounded top john brown climbed its weather worn surface and mounting its crest began to chip away at the flintlike face of the rock as he continued hammering the thought came to him that this smallish plateau had been a wise choice for the building of his home the sight was high enough above the road to alert him to any ones approach from the south there the trail stretched back through some five miles of cascade notch with its elongated lakes and primitive forests to the south rose the peaks of the great range of mountains the highest of these marcy lifting its head over five thousand feet above sea level this mountain range seemed to encircle john browns tract of land as if to protect it from the waves of hatred flung at him from that direction his onestory clapboard house did seem dwarfed by the vastness of the great wilderness about it but through those very windows bleak and small as they sometimes seemed he could always get a clear view of the top of whiteface mountain  miles to the north today that peak seemed to stand isolated against the summer sky and coldly aloof from the affairs of men as coldly aloof as john brown felt himself to be from the bickerings and indecisions of friend and foe the sky began to cloud over a cooling breeze was blowing up it drove the milky whiteness of the swishing mares tails overhead northward until finally the rolling vapors were swathing the peak of whiteface mountain in undulating gray clouds as if to hide its countenance from the tragedy to be enacted at its base with his chisel he had recessed the first initial j into the stone surface and the second initial b had been begun when john brown felt himself tiring he wiped the sweat from his eyes absentmindedly with his shirt sleeve how much harder than chipping this flinty rock was it to pierce the complacency of his country men he pondered to violate their pharasaical serenity or force them to take some steps to liberate the unhappy slaves from their misery it must be done it must be done and god john brown feels has appointed him for the task a sadeyed elderly woman mary brown now leaves the house and walks slowly toward the great rock she comes to call her husband for his noonday meal he is not quite through he tells her the homely little woman stands mutely beneath him and waits she has guessed at her husbands purpose atop the rock in her heart she has prayed for wisdom with which to turn him back from his resolve put me here mary when i come back he instructs her here in the shadow of this great rock mary brown is too inured to anguish to afford the luxury of even womanish tears she feels certain it will be her mournful duty to put john brown here for his last sleep she knows that now her husband has determined to leave his mountain home his family his neighbors and his friends for the fatal and sublimely irrational attack on the government arsenal at harpers ferry the negro slaves must be freed if only to prove to an apathetic world that there are no inferior nor superior races since in spirit all humanity is one mary brown had not yet resigned herself utterly to her fate she had one last hope she would try to pierce her husbands selfesteem when the hammering had stopped she looked up at john brown and told him of an incident which had occurred that very morning in their house some childish difference had arisen between their daughter and a neighbors girl while at their play in the heat of their quarrel the neighbor child had spat out that her grandfather didnt think much of john brown she had heard him tell her father that so far as he was concerned john brown was gods damnest fool if this was what their neighbor and supposedly good friend thought of her husband what mary brown cried out would the world say of his proposed venture in the south john brown looked down on the stricken face of his wife he noticed her careworn face and her work hardened hands he tried to comfort her to assure her that the raid on the harpers ferry arsenal might just prove a success if he outlived the attack there would be honor and plenty for all if it was gods will that he pay for the enterprise with his life god had prepared him for that too perhaps the world must exact a sacrifice for awakening it to the sufferings and indignities of slavery when he returned to her then she must put him here beside this great boulder for his eternal rest and as for the neighbor she need not be distressed over that why a hundred years from then nobody would either remember the neighbor nor his sayings  c the year was  it was a beautiful summer day in july the state of new york that now owns the john brown place has recently had it restored to its original status as when the brown family lived there a stir of excitement is evident in our selfcentered little village of lake placid a commemoration service is to be held out at the old john brown farm three miles beyond us it is to celebrate the passing of a full century since john browns sacrifice shocked the people of this country into its bloodiest civil war also this day will mark the completion of the restored homestead in what john brown would have called his dooryard there stands today a bronze figure of more than  life size of the patriarch he seems to be walking toward whiteface mountain in the north with his right hand extended in a gesture of explanation to a kinkyheaded little frightened negro boy about whose shoulders john browns left hand rests benevolently the great stone boulder lies a very short distance to the left it is now fenced in with a spiked iron enclosure the tract of land about it is filled today with the parked cars of many people white and black who have come to hear the speeches and browse through the restored home of the patriarch chairs for some two hundred visitors are arranged in the open before the speakers stand so that all may sit and listen to the tragedy of john brown in solid comfort i flowed along with the crowd to the glassedin grave marker in the shadow of the great boulder john brown is recessed in letters a yard high newly cut into the stone a slim and wellgroomed lady is down on her knees in the grass before the small and glassencased old tombstone which john brown had himself brought here from off his fathers grave in new england standing beside the notetaking lady kneeling there i recognize one of my not too distant neighbors an elderly proudlooking woman by reputation a great church worker the kneeling lady rises and is introduced to me she speaks with a marked southern accent when she laughingly explains that her husband had refused to accompany her to the affair he had stated that john brown gave the south enough trouble while he was living and he her husband being a southerner had no desire to see any more of him nor to meet with any of the rabblerousers who again so recently have come to upset the peace of south with their protests their law suits and their agitators i felt it unwise to pursue a topic of conversation so very controversial i simply shrugged my shoulders and looking up alarmed at the swiftly overcast sky i said could john brown be here today i wonder what he would think my neighbor friend gave me an oblique smile as if to say between you and me i might add something to that and she did at this very place and almost a hundred years to the day it was that john brown told mary brown his wife not to distress herself over what a neighbor had said so disparagingly about him i suddenly recalled that i stood in the presence of a descendant of that very neighbor why you know she gloatingly whispered my great grandfather did not think so much of john brown my people turning to me as you must know were his very close neighbors in fact it was my greatgrandfather who helped care for the brown family when the abolitionist left them on his wild adventure south my father once told me that his grandfather always maintained that john brown was gods damnest fool we stood a bit shocked we were hushed by the fact that this nice churchgoing lady would use the name of god in vain and on the sabbath too suddenly from the mountain range a terrific wind blew up a very black cloud gathered directly over us it did seem as if john brown had overheard and resented my neighbors remarks everyone ran for his car i arrived home just as the storm broke it was like a cloudburst it darkened the whole countryside bodies of water like overflowing turbulent rivers poured down on everything i looked up and out of my window over the turmoil of the downpour i could just barely detect the tip of the gold cross standing atop the stone church steeple the other side of main street i clenched my fists i cried out in my heart give em hell john brown give em hell
the crispus attacks story
it was a moonlit night made brighter by the new snow that blanketed the cobblestone streets groups of young men paraded up and down king street around the commons speaking in hushed tones casting hostile glances in the direction of the british soldiers standing guard and moving about the commons it seemed that resentments of the past five years mounting in intensity had reached the point of explosion the very atmosphere of boston was electric with tension what had been for many years only routine disgruntlement became with implementation of the hated stamp act a cause that was november   the citizens of boston had resisted protested refused to cooperate and the act was repealed the following march but then the stamp act was followed by measures only slightly more bearabletaxes on glass paper lead tea plus a law establishing a civil list making local officials responsible only to the king of england the people demonstrated cried taxation without representation to humble them the kings agents brought in two regiments of british troops and when the citizens refused to house them the troops were billeted on the commons and in faneuil hall this stratagem had not worked of course the people became more bitter their resentment flared into taunts incidents between the redcoats and people of the town occurred more frequently and now this day march   a british soldier had struck a small boy with the butt of a musket some man among the townsmen called out to the soldiers and hard words were exchanged the soldiers stepped forward to face one of the roving gangs the two groups squared off against each other the townsmen with cudgels and clubs the redcoats holding their muskets at the ready then from among the citizens a man named crispus attucks stepped forward he was tall somewhat burly with dark brown skin and hard curly hair beneath his cap he was a stevedore and sailor a husky man now in middle years known as the mulatto he faced the british soldiers and spoke out fearlessly the way to get rid of these soldiers is to attack the main guard he shouted strike at the root the roving crowds of townsmen drew up behind him voicing their agreement shouting their anger at the band of armed soldiers let us drive out these rascals they screamed they have no business heredrive them out an officer appeared and ordered the soldiers to run your bayonets through them the townspeople if the soldiers were attacked the soldiers began loading their muskets when they raised the rifles the townspeople surged forward accepting the challenge led by crispus attucks you cowardly rascals for bringing arms against naked men a citizen screamed lay aside your arms and we are ready for you attucks backed up by his sailor friends shouted let us fall upon the nest come on dont be afraid of themthey dare not fire knock them over with his club he aimed a blow at captain preston who had rushed out to command the soldiers the captain deflected the blow from attucks club the club knocked the musket from a soldiers hands attucks quickly seized the bayonet from the fallen musket but as he rose with it he was tackled by a british soldier why dont you fire cried someone from the ranks of the militia and the soldier stepped back and fired his musket crispus attucks fell dead on the commons in rapid succession five other muskets blared forth and four other citizens fell beside attucks two of them samuel gray and jonas caldwell died instantly the other two samuel maverick and patrick carr died later maverick the following morning carr on march  the first blood of the american revolution had been shed the excitement which followed that massacre never abated the bells which were rung in the town calling the people of boston into the streets was the summons to arms and rebellion three days later a public funeral was held for the first martyrs of the rebellion four hearses met at a junction in king street and from there a procession moved six deep to the middle burying ground the four victims carr was still alive were buried in a common grave under a gravestone with the following legend long as in freedoms cause the wise contend dear to your country shall your fame extend while to the world the lettered stone shall tell where caldwell a ttucks gray and maverick fell for the next several years and until america had won independence from england march  was celebrated as the principal american holiday to this day march  is known as crispus attucks day and is marked by those who remember that crispus attucks was the first hero of the american revolution until that march evening when the finger of immortality pointed to  him crispus attucks was little known even in boston he had been a slave and it is known that some  years earlier he had fled from his master william browne of framingham mass for browne had advertised in the papers for attucks  return the following commercial appeared in the boston gazette or weekly journal of tuesday october   ranaway from his master william browne of framingham on the th of september last a mulatto fellow about  years of age named crispus six feet two inches high short curld hair his knees nearer together than common had on a light colourd bearskin coat plain brown fustian jacket or brown allwool one new buckskin breeches blue yarn stockings and a checked woolen shirt whoever shall take up said runaway and convey him to abovesaid master shall have ten pounds old tenor reward and all necessary charges paid and all masters of vessels and others are hereby cautioned against concealing or carrying off said servant on penalty of the law boston october   subsequent advertisements for attucks return appeared in the boston gazette on november  and november  and then attucks name and activities went unrecorded until after the events of march   where did crispus attucks spend the intervening  years no one knows for certain but scholars and researchers have offered many opinions the late john wesley dobbs of atlanta wrote crispus attucks might have gone to sea he might have visited foreign lands this we do not know but we do know that he was very much alive on march   when he showed up on king street with a big stick in his hand ready to die and to become one of americas greatest heroes he died defending the honor integrity and selfrespect of all american citizens living then and the ones to be born later on according to dobbs attucks did two important things on the day he died he firmly established himself as a man of valor fortitude and bold enterprise he believed in that most precious american heritage of freedom and he made the down payment on liberty and freedom for all members of his racial group who were to live after him the martyrs grave that crispus attucks shares with his fellow patriots now lies in the northeast corner of the old cemetery between the park street church and the tremont building in boston it is near the grave of samuel adams one of the signers of the declaration of independence six years after attucks death but an even more imposing memorial to attucks heroism stands in boston commons the scene of the boston massacre and of attucks death it is a monument erected by the state of massachusetts in  on the monument freedom holds in her left hand a broken chain and in her right the flag the american eagle sits at her feet on a bronze tablet the boston massacre is depicted crispus attucks lies dead and his fellowpatriots mortally wounded are falling back into the arms of the citizens the words of two great americans are carved into the monument those of daniel webster say from that moment we may date the severance of the british empire and those of john adams say on that night the foundation of american independence was laid and an american negro born a slave set the moment in motion

it is our feeling that the position of the negro in the theater is neither safe nor secure it is obvious that the negros share in the benefits of the american theater has never been commensurate with what he has given to it the theater has depended heavily on the negros vitality and creativity but has not accorded the negro artist equal status or opportunity artists have borrowed liberally from the negro but they have not seen fit to recognize the contribution with the honesty which should be consistent with american tradition they do not accept the negro as their equal in the performing arts since the time of the shakespearean actor ira aldridge who achieved great fame in europe negroes have had to fight to gain a place in the theater and express themselves there the fight goes on people in the theater and show business as a whole are fond of pointing to the socalled liberal tradition in their profession and declaring that artists do not discriminate those of us who have been around a while know that this is not true artists are capable of bias but to face the problem squarely and to put the responsibility where it belongs we must admit that the artists are not always responsible for the exclusion of negroes or other minorities or the refusal to make proper use of their skills and talent this is usually the prerogative of the producers and of those vitally importantand sinister influencesknown as sponsors recently we have heard about the energetic campaign of p jay sidney aimed at ending the unfair and distorted image of the negro projected by the theater the movie industry radio and tv he has not hesitated to tell people who are nationally known that they are phony liberals he has picketed the theatre guild the paramount talent association and others and he has achieved some result he has received assurances from some of these people that there will be an improvement in the american scene this is an important question now the united states is concerned about its image abroad but many of us are more concerned about the image at home the fight that the negro is waging is not only for an increase in the share of employment but for a difference in the portrayal of the negro there is the increasing importance of the presence of  negroes in our society it is a national problem which is causing us embarrassment abroad the facts are rather depressing the truth is that the entertainment media of this country are not depicting the negro correctly and his contemporary role in society times have changed today the negro as citizen worker professional scientist has spread completely across the whole spectrum of this country negroes are entering new fields the change in conditions requires a parallel representation on the stage in the movies and on tv because of the aura of liberalism that has grown up around the theater it has been rather difficult to level strong charges against the theater or the other arts but i do not believe the arts can be exonerated from charges of race barriers within it barriers do exist against negroes and this is a denial of democracy but also it does a great disservice to the arts since it denies the logical use of the skills and talents of nonwhites

as to what the theater offers the negro performer writer director or producer now i would say it offers him an eitherora chance to fight like hell or starve to death i remember an occasion when we discussed the theater in american culture etc and this afternoon the theme might be better understood if we try to indicate where this particular part of the american scene fits into the total picture and i would like to give you some background thoughts and ideas to see what the fight is in the late s the supreme court of the united states gave the dred scott decision which was that the negro had no rights which the white man was bound to respect the civil war revoked that decision and put in its place the th th and th amendments and two civil_rights acts meant to show that the negroes had all the other fundamental and basic rights that anybody else had but at a later date in  the supreme court threw out the substance of the amendments and substituted another rule which was that of separate but equal but what this meant was that you did not have to include the negro you did not have to respect all of his rights provided you gave him a token indication of membership in the human race and provided you gave him a separateand certainty not equalshare of the substance of this country then in  this was reversed by the supreme court this latter philosophy embodies the minimum changes going on in this country today and that is simply fight the struggle to push to extend to all our citizens those rights previously reserved to the whites only all of us have suffered from this exclusion this perversion of our democratic heritage and it is as true in the theater as in other places so we come today to see what we can do to explain this fight to ourselves and to indicate how we might help to bring to fruition that democracy and the rights to which we are all entitled this particular aspect of the theater today is a depressing one and i would like to indicate briefly some of the nature of what we face as a negro and nonwhite performer in the theater i testified as a witness before actors equity as to the nature of the discrimination and the substance of my testimony was a sample drawn from one weeks fiscal statement in conjunction with the play with which i am associated and i showed by the report that in a negro show written by a negro featuring negroes and about negro life  negro people were employed this is against all of the other employment figures for our show where we have  stagehands none of whom are negro none of the ushers are negro none of the scrub ladies are negro and none of the other attendant functionaries are negro this in spite of the fact that my producer is not a man who attempts to discriminate what i am implying is that the exclusion of the negro from the theater is part of a system which was set in motion a long time ago and if we are to do what is necessary about eradicating this condition we must address ourselves to the system which automatically goes into operation the minute a negro becomes involved in a production much of this is automatic one thing having nothing to do with the particular choices of the people in positions of authority and power we must certainly address ourselves to getting that aspect of this question taken care of we must address ourselves to those who do have policymaking positions and who can hire more negroes practicing a fairer presentation of the american scene in their choice of players the american scene is far more integrated than we get when we go to broadway and when we look at tv and the movies i feel good about the future because it is my nature and i feel that men and women can do what they will and must do if they know what needs to be done if they agree why it needs to be done and if they are willing to bestir themselves to see that it gets done my feeling at the moment is that our position is going to get worse instead of better because the theater is going to get worse before it gets better and because we are not yet as a people as ready to face facts and implications as we ought to be we will discuss them think about them but to take a vital step and become active is something else normally what we do is acquire information express our willingness but draw back at the final commitment

i am interested first in the remark about the final step raisin in the sun and purlie victorious represent very small steps because i am interested in integration in the theater and i dont think raisin in the sun or purlie victorious represent integration in the theaterrather they represent a reflection of our society and that integration does not exist in our society these plays are important but i am more interested in how do we fight forhow do we getintegration in the theater when we have an author like ossie davis who writes a play and we succeed in getting it on that is fine but i am interested in other playrights writing today and largely they just dont write parts for negro actors or directors when casting dont think in terms of negro actors i would like to throw out for discussion the questionhow do we break the door down how can we get through to the playwrights many of the plays that are presented could have more validity by showing negroes on the stage and this can do more to bring in money than a lot of other things now being done i feel that it has to begin with the playwright because finally what it must lead to if our society gets to that point is that eventually we can cast negroes simply as actors and they will not have to be cast in terms of their skin color and then we will have the theater showing the way instead of following behind what society is doing another thing is that we still have to go through many arguments with people because when you do a play with negro actors then you better be successful you can do  plays which run for a week or two and nobody says anything but if you do a play with negro actors and it has a short run they say thats why it failed because there were negroes in it negro plays should have the right to fail too how do we proceed negroes could be used much more than they are why arent there negroes in subways are for sleeping there is nothing in new york probably which is as integrated as the subway i am doing a play now laid in rome but there are negroes in the chorus we have to show that it can be done by doing it
stuart vaughan
let me start by saying that i have just come back from europe where we spent eight months seeing foreign productions we came back to see what our feeling about the new york theater was going to be we went to various productions the two plays which we liked bestthe two productions we liked bestwere purlie victorious and moon on a rainbow shawl and the companies in those plays are in a great proportion negro performers i would like to say that after having seen the work of the berliner ensemble and others in europe mr daviss work stands up with the finest acting in the world and his play had an impact and drive which i responded to with great sympathy we have no need to apologize for the talents and abilities of our negro actors maybe because negroes have to fight to get where they are perhaps that is why they are so vital now i want to raise a problem i have directed a number of classical plays in new york and i want to raise this problem because i need to be informed i have tried to use negro performers in classical plays wherever i could and i have found myself limited by my own esthetic concepts which may be too narrow and i have found myself limited by the historical validity which is in the head of my audience negroes could be used in many of shakespeares plays but people are not used to the idea in some cases makeup solves the problem but of course in some cases it does not what are we going to do about this problem i do a play like the octoroon which has to do with the negroes past why did we do it perhaps to get a reaction of disagreement it was an artistic success in terms of what we were trying to do what should we do about plays which have a place in their historical past what do we do about the historical problem
howard da silva
all of this so far has been interesting because so many questions have been raised here does our problem begin with play writing what about casting i think the battle has to be waged on all fronts in all ways you need only read a few novels about negroes to realize how shabbily they have been treated in all the arts i would like to pose thiswe all work in the theater and the method has become second nature dont we know that there is a difference between the surface representational way of presenting an art and the evocative wayevoking the reality if you have a talented actor there before three minutes have gone by if an actor is creating you dont care if he is polkadotted it has been my experience that where you have a gifted performer the question of pigment is discarded very quickly by the audience which easily bridges the gap i would like to see us continue the battle on all frontsdo more to encourage the writing of works about negro life both contemporary and historical and cast negroes irrespective of pigmentation without waiting for a future time lets do it now
ruby dee
ive just read for a job doing a tv commercial and i want it desperately i would make a lot of money and it would be secure but the money would go back into the theater because the theater needs help one positive thing i feel todaythis is shown first with purlie victoriousfirst i want to commend the new producers like mr rose and the people of dedication like mr da silvaand to say that pur lie victorious is attracting a whole new kind of audience and that is wonderful people who never came to the theater before are coming to see purlie victorious and one feels as if one is reaching to appeal to ones source i feel happy that we can walk into a gathering of negroes and be applauded for our performance that is importantthat more of us are encouraged to come to the theater if we encourage more negroes to come to the theater purlie victorious will have repaid its backers i feel if there is some forward thrust to life there is life and hope and something that people of good intention can do in the world is to encourage the negro audience of course i believe in integration but before one can integrate we must think in terms of equals i would love to see negro producers i would like to see negro money take over some of the houses then we could say that we will develop this kind of talent we will put in the american scene a new look a new life we will encourage our writers and assure them of a market this is all very indefinite but before there can be real respectartist for artistwe must seize the reins we must equate when we operate in terms of the pattern of society we get a certain kind of respect and help and it may be that in the theater by seizing the reins we will accomplish something by getting a new audience

we want our cut of the constitutionnot with a spoon but with a shovel im a great one for racial pride its just that i dont need it in my line of work man if slavery comes back i want to be your agent you are a disgrace to the negro profession why some of the best acting in the world is done in front of white folks purlie victorious judson the irreverent reverend in ossie davis play purlie victorious

his one was going to t be a jewel really a  perfect jewel isobel snead could hardly ¦      wait to tell the girls at bridge this afternoon after the succession of clumsy incompetent maids she had had to let go one right after the other it would be a relief to put the children and the house into helens hands helen she tasted the name found it flat a little ordinary she decided like ellen and edith or may isobel liked names with a flair reaching on the night table for pencil and paper the thought came to her again like a fat maggot that she must have been completely witless to have married alfred snead you just knew a man with a name like that drank beer and from a bottle every time she heard a name like cartwright or rhinelander she wanted to kill alfred now she started to scribble roxanne    illena    helena there it was under her very nose helene of course with a carrot after the last e or whatever it was they called that little jigger they used in spanish or was it french she lay back on her pillow thinking how beautifully impressive it would look when writing to her sister back on the farm helene is quite adequate in a foreign sort of way the children adore her and have been behaving beautifully after the last one    then at bridge this afternoon she curled her toes thinking about it when you said helene people just naturally thought of someone aristocratic well no not that at least not in a maid but she did have a grecian air about her tall aloof and just awfully efficient she was probably a bit stupid back of that madonnalike expression but you didnt really have to know anything to be a domestic really those girls were always feeling sorry for themselves but if they only knew it they were the lucky ones at least they didnt have to get in the rat race called culture where you had to be on your toes every minute for fear you would get caught off guard and say something wrong she closed her eyes and sighed luxuriously she would have the girls greeneyed at bridge and how too perfectly lucky that helene fitted the size twelve uniforms they had on hand now alfred wouldnt have a chance to blow his stack about buying a new batch he loathed having the girls wear uniforms she rolled over spreading her arms high on the pillow it was simply delicious she decided being able to lie in bed without hearing the morning ruckus of the children she thought now of the girl calling the children to dinner alto fred still called it supper helene would say firmly going right up to them dinner is being served children you will come now some of the other girls in the block in just any kind of a dripdry would yell out loudly you kids coming suppers on she yawned hating the thought of getting up but it was nearing ninethirty and she wanted to watch the girl a few hours before leaving to play bridge after all she had only come three days ago but what a blessed three days the change in the children was simply unbelievable she never had seen two such rude illtempered disagreeable children as chrissy and roger had been this past year which just proved you couldnt be too careful about selecting a maid chrissy had the makings of a lady underneath it all like her mother but roger was quite like his father quite boorish at times she watched the morning breeze play with the curtains alfred had not yet come up to tell her goodbye before leaving for the office she wondered if helene had offended him not that he was easily upset no he was too thickskinned for that more than likely he had angered her it was just like him with his coarse brand of humor she cringed thinking of his morning greeting to that other one what was her name    well girlie this egg aint even been laid yet and worse yet his oolala when a vulgar fat gyrating alfred was just leaving she heard him say ouilafo as he opened the front door she walked upstairs slowly and sat down on the vanity to think it was very quiet downstairs too quiet she thought as far back as she could remember the children had made so much noise in the morning she hadnt been able to sleep they were such lively healthy uninhibited youngsters so very normal i since this helen had come they had been acting subdued queer sort of it just wasnt natural for children to be so quiet and well behaved why they were frightened that was it that girl had them scared they were cowed into being good her headache had cleared now she started to dress thinking it over she realized that all along she had thought the girl had a mean eye it was the madonnalike expression that fooled one for the sake of the children she would just have to let her go it was too bad really how would she ever be able to teach the children not to be prejudiced when one right after the other failed to prove himself her self she corrected mentally
no color line in hell
say once there   tt  was a negro in at ii  lanta who had made up his mind to commit s£j mcs suicide so one day he went down to the main street and took the freight elevator up to the top of the highest building in town in fact the highest skyscraper in georgia negroes could not ride the passenger elevators but he was so anxious to commit suicide that he did not let jim crow stand in his way he rode as freight once at the top of the building he took off his coat drew a deep breath approached the ledge and jumped off he went hurtling through the air and was just about to hit the sidewalk when he saw a white woman come around the corner he knew he had better not fall on that white woman so he curved and went right on back up there was another negro who one day came to a strange town in mississippi where he had never been before when he got off the bus he did not see any of the race around so he asked a white man where do the colored folks hang out here the white man pointed at a great big tree in the public square and said do you see that limb negroes in arkansas when you ask them what life is like in tennessee will tell you the white folks are so bad in memphis that black folks cant even drink white milk but if you ask negroes in tennessee what it is like in arkansas they will say man in that state you better not even put your black feet in no white shoes there are innumerable variations on the use of the word white in the south they say for example presumably in fun that the reason negroes eat so many blackeyed peas in dixie and in louisiana so many red beans is because for years after the emancipation colored people did not dare ask a storekeeper for white beans red beans or blackeyed peas okay but it was not until folks began using the term navy beans that ne groes had the nerve to purchase white beans too in a wylie avenue hashhouse one day i heard a negro say to another one at the counter here you are up north ordering white bean soup man i know you are really free now everybody laughed some of these types of jokes are even laid on animals they say there was once a black cat in mobile who decided to head for chicago because he had always heard that up north there was no color line hardly had that cat gotten to chicago than he met a white cat desirous of being shown about the black cat said to the white cat lets go round the town but the white cat said to the black cat you better set your black self down in some places so another pleasantry goes white folks are so mean they will not give a negro the time of day a colored man said to a white man what time is it sir the white man asked the negro do you play chess the negro said yes sir the white man said then its your time to move these and hundreds of other jokes of a similar nature which negroes tell on themselves belong in the category of white is right yellow mellow but black get back their humor is the humor of frustration and the laughter with which these sallies are greeted for all its loudness is a desperate laughter white people often do not understand such humor at all negroes do and such jokes told at appropriate moments amuse them no end shortly after the big detroit race riots a cartoon appeared in a negro newspaper that harlemites thought highly if wryly hilarious but no white person to whom i have ever shown it even cracks a smile let alone laughs aloud the cartoon pictures a wall in a sportsmans den on which the heads of the game he has bagged are hung a deers head an elks head a tigers head among them mounted like the others is a negro head two little white boys are looking at the head one little boy pointing at the negros head tells the other youngster my daddy got that one in detroit last week most such jokes however are at the expense of the south in harlem they say a young mothertobe about to bear her first child decided to go back down south to be with her mother when the great event came her young husband tried to keep her from going pointing out to her that aside from having better hospital facilities new york had no jim crow wards and colored physicians could attend patients in the hospitals in the south one often has to have a white doctor since many hospitals there will not permit negro doctors to practice inside their walls still the expectant mother insisted on going home to mama the father in harlem waited and waited for news of the birth of his child no news came the ninth month passed the tenth month passed finally he phoned his wife and told her something must be wrong to go to the hospital anyhow and be examined she went the white physician marvelled that her child had not yet come putting his earphones to his ears and baring her abdomen he pressed his instrument against her flesh to listen for the prenatal heartbeats of the unborn child instead what he heard quite clearly and distinctly inside the body of the mother was a sugar chile robinson type of voice singing the blues  wont be born down here  wont be born down here if you want to know what its all about as long as south is south  wont come out no i wont be born down here he wasnt she had to come on back to new york to have her baby harlemites swear that that colored child had plenty of sense a great many jokes with which negroes regale each other but seldom tell white folks are hardly complimentary to racial intelligence jokes relating to tardiness are among them some such jokes even go so far as to blame the darkness of the race upon a lack of punctuality on that morning long ago in the dawning of creation when the lord called upon mankind to wash in the river of life they say that everybody promptly went down to the water to wash except the negroes the negroes lingered and loitered along the way dallied and played and took their own good time getting down to the river when they got there the other folks had used up all the water and had emerged whiter than snow in the river bed after so much washing the negroes found only a little mud into the mud they waded with their bare feet late in their desperation they bent down and put the palms of their hands in the mud too by that time even the mud was used up therefore to this day nothing is light about negroes except the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet late always late other jokes relate to behavior and how a negro in so far as these jokes go will always snarl things up even in heaven they say the first time a negro went to heaven all the other angels became excited when they heard he was coming and had prepared a great welcome for him even saint peter and the lord were moved at the prospect of greeting the first member of the darkest race into celestial glory in honor of the occasion the gates of pearl were shining and the streets of gold had been polished until each cobblestone gleamed but what did that negro do that negro was so excited when he first got his wings that he took off then and there at top speed and would not stop flying he flew and he flew and he flew and he flew  in his crown of gold and his snow white robes he lifted up his wings and flew like mad from the east to the west from the north to the south up and down and all throughout the universe he whizzed by the golden throne at  miles per hour wings spread like a constellation he flew around gods footstool so fast the cherubinis thought he was greased lightning he went past st peter at such speed that he started a tailwind on the golden streets finally saint peter said whoa but that negro did not stop peter sent a band of angels out to catch him but they could not get anywhere near that negro gabriel blew his horn but he paid him no mind he was a flying soul he made wings do what wings had never been known to do before he looped a loop in the sky then he looped another loop and tied a knot that negro was gone solid gone he scattered feathers all over heaven and stirred up such a gale that the lord god himself stood up and cried stop when he stopped that negro skidded bang into the pearly gates broke one wing smack off knocked his crown into eternity snagged his robes wide open and fell panting at the foot of the throne saint peter just looked at him and said just like a negro in the category of the bawdy joke there are hundreds illustrating the prevalent folk belief in the amorous prowess of the negro male many such jokes cut across the color line in boastful fashion they say a white man came home one cold winter night to find his golden blond wife on the living room divan deep in the loving arms of a great big dark negro petrified in his astonishment the white man forgot to close the front door the icy winds rushed in thinking his wife was being raped in a frenzy he cried darling what shall i do to this negro she sighed from the couch just shut the door so he wont catch cold even in hell according to the joke makers a negro is hell since for so long negroes had had such a hard time on earth as compensation up until the end of the civil war all of them automatically went to heaven when they died but after lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation and things got a little easier for negroes on this globe the lord decided to send a few colored folks to hell the first negro consigned to the devil was a tall strapping man of color who in his day had been a great lover from st louis to the gulf because his boudoir skills left him so little time for grace the lord said send that negro to hell so peter threw him out of heaven no sooner did the negro set foot in hell than he grabbed the devils daughter and ruined her ten minutes later he enticed the devils wife behind a hot rock and ruined her about this time the devils mother came along the negro grabbed her and ruined her the devil suddenly became aware of this mighty despoilation trembling for the first time since he had been ruler of hell he fell to his knees and called on god for help lord please take this negro out of here before he ruins me whether or not hell then began to draw the color line the story does not say but negro jokes often draw a color line through their humor in such a fashion that only a negro can appreciate them certain aspects of the humor of minority groups are often so inbred that they are not palatable for outside consumption there are thousands of jewish jokes that rarely reach the ears of gentiles and if they did they might be embarrassing to the ears of both groups so it is with negro humora part of it is intended only for negroes to others such jokes are seldom funny anyhow the point is lost for often the nuances are too subtle for alien comprehension a joke is not a joke when nobody laughs

no one would know if you didnt tell them the old lady seated next to me smiled reassurringly rich thats it they must be rich she turned to the girl sitting  next to her and went on only the rich ones go to college my brother and i tried to suppress our obvious amazement we were in utah heading via bus to utah state university in logan this was our first encounter with a native loganite many similar experiences were to follow in what is called by some the last stronghold of the mormons as the bus wheeled its way northward through sardine canyon and down into cache valley i was in awe of the picturesque beauty so unlike my stereotyped idea of what utah should look like i expected barren desert land as far as the eye could see i later learned the topography of the areaits marvelous mountain ranges and desert lands we got off the bus at logans small combination restaurantbus station and surveyed main street simultaneously we were being surveyed always before when people stared i was egotistical enough to think it was due to an attractive personal appearance but having spent most of my time in denver new york city and california all fairly cosmopolitan areas this had never been a problem but in logan well    logan turned out to be a utopia of provinciality foreignersthose not only from foreign countries but those foreign to cache valley were out of place we took the towns only taxi and went up on the aggie hill we soon discovered that there was no university housing available then came the search for a place to live we went to several private homes advertising student housing only to be rebuffed with sorry no smokers no drinkers and no foreigners it was then we realized that we were not being recognized as negroes but as iraqis persians etc my brother and i are fairskinned negroes we learned that many of the people in the area had never come in contact with negroes and were not aware of the great variation of skin color hair texture etc that exists among american negroes finally allowing the landlord to believe that we were iranian students we acquired a small three room house situated down on the island which was really too far from the campus for walking but we did not realize this at the time still excited about attending a new college that year it was my senior year and my brother was beginning as a freshman we cleaned up the little house and the next day headed for the campus after registration we found there were eleven other negro students on campus all but one were on athletic scholarships i was the only negro girl on campus we immediately learned the magnitude of influence the mormon church had in the city on the people and on the university the first statements i heard concerning the mormon religion were biased coming from the other negro students the foreign students and the jack mormons mormons who had broken away from the church the mormons believe the negro is cursed they believe the negro is inherently inferior the negro cannot belong to their church negroes are not allowed to step inside their temples tabernacles or wards their religion is the only true religion the first quarter passed with no major incidents most of our contacts were with other negro students and the foreign students of which there were about  on campus most coming from iran iraq africa the west indies and south america most of these students were in the agricultural fields sadly to say many of them had been only to logan and had not visited other places in the states consequently they were forming opinions about the united states using logan as an example and sadly to say hate the lds latter day saints talk was prominent among them i felt kind of greedy in my contacts with the foreign students there was so much to be learned from them so many new ideas to be gleaned from and exchanged with them i felt sad that so many people in logan could not see the wealth of faraway places that had been brought to their doorsteps winter quarter my brother and i moved into the dorms on campus when i went to report for my room the house mother asked my name i told her she looked all through her room chart and couldnt seem to find my name i told her i thought the room number was  still not looking at me her eyes scanned to room  and she murmured no thats not it two ne  she looked up at me embarrassed now excuse me dear what did you say your name was i repeated my name and added and i am a negro my roommate was the only other negro girl on campus that quarter  shortly thereafter came the big blowup several of the white girls were known to be dating negro fellows this had been going on for some time but never so out in the open the school administration was bombarded with complaints from various sources one sunday afternoon all the negro fellows were called together the content of the meeting was ambiguous reports varied depending on which of the fellows was telling about it but in essence the problems of interracial dating were discussed and the negroes were asked not to date the white girls the next day the whole campus was buzzing about the meeting accounts varied and stories were grossly distorted rumors ran rampant the colored guys will be expelled if they are seen with white girls they will lose their scholarships the guys wont be allowed to play ball the following day a discussion group hashed over the subject a committee was selected to see the president to clear up rumors and to ascertain university policy concerning the subject of interracial dating during the meeting the president stated that the rumors were untrue that the negroes social activities would have no bearing on their athletic and academic activities the furor eventually died down then there was the night utah state played brigham young university a long time bosom enemy of states i was particularly anxious to see the game because the star player on byus team was an old school buddy of mine during the game a fight ensued between one of our negro players and my friend on the other team reportedly name callingthe seemingly favorite insult between white and blackwas the cause of the ruckus at any rate feelings were keyedup and after the aggie victory i went to the opponents dressing room to say hello to my friend the hallway outside the dressing room was filled with angry byuers this was another time when seemingly i was not recognized readily as being a negro i listened to the talk those dirty niggers play like animals usu should be barred from the conference everytime we come down here those black niggers start a fight theyre not athletes theyre animals id never been so disappointed in humanity at that moment my date for the evening who happened to be a dark skinned negro pushed his way through the crowd to find me i took his arm and stood very close to him everyone became quiet all eyes were upon us some faces seemed to mirror disbelief others distaste and dislike and still others a somewhat apologetic look about this time the players came filing out of the dressing room my date asked a tall fellow standing near us if he would call my friend he looked at us strangely and called again silence evidently people thought there was going to be another fight my friend walked over seriously then his eyes dropped down to me and a big grin broke across his face we chatted excitedly i learned he had married one of my girl friends tensions relaxed slightly but we were still the center of attraction after goodbys and an invitation to visit in brigham city my date and i left followed by stares i later found out that byus favorite nickname for usu was usuall designating the growing negro attendance in an effort to understand logan the people and their religion i often talked to a returned missionary whom i had classes with i also took the utah history course the memorable thing my missionary friend told me when i asked about the mormon attitude toward the negro why negroes could not hold the priesthood i wanted to know i had learned that negroes could be members of the church and that there were negro mormons was this analogy suppose a father has two sons certainly he loves both of them very much however one of the sons as in many families is a little more capable a little more conscientious than the other son this does not mean that the father loves him any more on the contrary a parent seems to love the seemingly less competent child more due to his need anyway this father has a huge fortune that he must leave to his sons it is natural that he should give this responsibility of wealth to the son who is most capable of taking care of it so it is with the priesthood i did not agree with my friend in this line of thinking but it was a concept that i had not heard previously on several occasions the negro students were invited to be panel members in some of the sociology and psychology classes some of the questions asked of us were unbelievable are negro babies born black are negroes sexually more potent is it true that negroes have speech defects there were many and varied explanations for why the negro exists and why he is black and needless to say a great deal of time was spent discussing the issue depending on who the explanation was coming from and the seriousness of the speaker these statements were sometimes fascinating sometimes humorous and at times disgusting but always highly interesting cain killed abel and all cains descendants were cursed with black skins ham son of noah had a black wife whose descendants were cursed with black skins there are three lives the before life the here and now life and the after life the people who lived wicked lives in the before  life are cursed with black skins in the here and now life the negro today however all is not lost for the black man by leading a good life now may redeem himself and his white skin for the following life and then the negro students joined the act and added such explanations as in the beginning everyone was black god sent a big rain for everyone to wash themselves the rains came and everyone except one lazy fellow washed away the blackness when he awoke only a puddle of water remained and he was able to wash only the bottoms of his feet and the palms of his hands the lord baked his people when he made them and he simply cooked some longer than others some he burned up completely there were many jokes circulated among the nonmormon students about the mormon religion and its founders joseph smith and brigham young calling joseph smith ol joe or mighty joe young and brigham young brig and pres was common about this time a book entitled mormonism and the negro was being sold in the book store briefly it dealt with the curse of black skins that the negro is under and why the book in my opinion was ridiculous it caused quite a bit of commotion and i was pleased to learn that it was not endorsed by the mormon church through my study of utah history and my association with the professor who taught the course i gained an appreciation and understanding of the mormon people which i had not had previously i found their history to be exciting and unique in many instances their pioneering spirit the incorporation of religion and everyday living and the fight against persecution for the practice of polygamy in the early days are admirable even though i could never believe in the mormon religion i respect it i would like to see a greater reciprocation of respect for differences in this area in the past few years this university has grown appreciably athletic wise due in great part to the negro athletes recruited from other states if this is to continue the university is going to have to offer these athletes and other outsiders as well much more than a continuing battle against provinciality

does the bible support segregation
several years ago a new bishop was appointed to a certain diocese in the southern united states the bishop was a yankee and his flock both priests and laity were somewhat apprehensive as to how tu» he would conduct himself in the delicate area of race relations shortly after his arrival he called together the clergy of his diocese when he appeared before them he was holding a copy of the bible in his hand fathers he said i will accept any policy on race relations that squares with this his priests and people understood him this statement marked the beginning of steady progress in realizing a truly christian policy of racial integration in the churches and institutions of that diocesebut in recent weeks we have been subjected to the dismaying sight of a catholic laywoman defying the bishop of her diocese on the basis that his directive on the desegregation of the new orleans catholic schools contradicts the plain teaching of the bible now while it is true that down through the ages the bible has been used by men to justify the most heinous of crimes we need only think of cromwells psalmsinging soldiers in our day it is hard to take the allegation that the bible teaches segregation seriously we might not be too surprised to find a backwoods snakehandler espousing this doctrine or some south afrikaner supporter of apartheid but to find such an attitude among catholics is a shock and a scandal i have not made any survey as to how prevalent such ideas are among catholics in this country but i seriously doubt that the lady in question is in any sense representative of the laity in the south or anywhere else but perhaps just for the record we might inquire into the merits of the case can we find anything in the bible which justifies racial segregation the racist has certain pet passages which he loves to quote out of context both literary and historical genesis the first book of the bible is a favorite quarry of texts for the rabid segregationist ironically enough one of the principal aims of this book is to show the unity of the whole human  race both in regard to its origin and its destiny let us examine a few of these passages in the fourth chapter of genesis we read gods words to cain    cursed shalt thou be  a wanderer and a fugitive on the face of the earth    and the lord put a mark on cain gen  this text from the story of cain is actually pointless when taken as a justification for segregation cain was a criminal who had just killed his brother abel the lords curse was his punishment for that crime and no one can seriously speak of membership in any particular race as being a crime original sin too has sometimes been interpreted by racists as an early attempt at integration satans words to eveyou yourselves will be like gods gen are thus supposed to reflect her desire to rise above her station it is hard to suppress a smile at such mangling of the text adam and eve did indeed sin by trying to arrogate divinity to themselves but to equate this with the demand of any human being for equal rights based on common humanity and citizenship is nothing short of nonsense but the biblethumping segregationist goes on to find other texts and one of his favorites comes from the sixth chapter of genesis the sons of god seeing the daughters of men that they were fair took to themselves wives of all which they chose    and god seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth repented that he had made man miscegenation cries the segregationist biblical scholars for centuries have puzzled over the meaning of this obscure passage one thing however is clear this passage has nothing whatever to do with racial mixing here the book of genesis is talking about groups which it represents as being just a few generations removed from their common ancestors no racial differences could have developed in such a short span what about the oftrepeated allegation that the sons of noah ham shem and japheth are the ancestors of the modern races this is based on genesis   and the sons of noah who came out of the ark were shem ham and japheth    these three are the sons of noah and from these was all mankind spread over the whole earth bible scholarscatholic and noncatholic alikeare agreed that this verse was never intended as an historical explanation of the racial origins of mankind in races of the old testament a h sayce remarks attempts have been made to explain the names of the three sons of noah as referring to the color of skin japheth has been compared with the assyrian ippatu white shem with the assyrian samu olivecolored while in ham etymologists have seen the hebrew kham to be hot but all such attempts are of very doubtful value it is for instance a long stride from the meaning of heat to that of blacknessa meaning indeed which the hebrew word never bears but even if we were to grant that this passage is concerned with racial differences at most it would indicate that the biblical author was aware of various racial differences and could by no stretch of the imagination be regarded as a justification of the practice of racial segregation everyone im sure remembers the story of the tower of babel from chapter  of genesis    the tower which was going to reach to the heavens    which god prevented when he made the various groups working on it speak in different languages and so be unable to understand each other    and which ultimately led to their separation from each other the segregationist grabs this text too as proof that races must be kept separated but this interpretation completely misses the point of the story we are dealing here with a parable on the pride of man the diversity of languages and consequent dispersion is seen as a decline from the primitive unity of the human family and not as a step along the road of progress to the racist abrahamwho in some ways was a champion of exclusivenessmay seem the patron saint of segregation but his exclusiveness was tribal not racial in fact the difference between abraham and the neighboring peoples was no greater than that between the english and the scotch abrahams first son ishmael had an egyptian mother agar and cetura who bore abraham six children genesis  and  was a northern arabian actually abrahams apparent zeal for racial purity in making isaac his heir and in sending his other children away was occasioned by sarahs sharp tongue and confirmed by gods selection of isaac as the one through whom he would fulfill his promises to abraham abraham himself had been quite willing to make either ishmael or his slave eliezer his heir and his concern to obtain a wife for isaac from his own people was merely an example of the bedouins concern for tribal solidarity and lets look for a second at some of the other great names of the old testament moses wife sephora came from the land of madian which was a part of arabia exodus   even a casual reading of the book of kings shows that the harems of david and solomon were certainly a mixed bag but perhaps the outstanding example of extratribal marriage in the old testament is found in ruth the moabitess ancestress of both david and christ himself in short the ancient israelites were a blend of mediterranean peoples and any attempt to claim that they were concerned about racial purity is a myth the one real example of an attempt to prohibit intermarriage with nonjews  by the priest ezra and the governor nehemiah was based on spiritual motives nonjews were pagans and there was real concern that intermarriage would cause defections from the faith of israel another popular prooftext is verse  of the th chapter of leviticus do not breed any of vour domestic animals with others  of a different species do not sow a field of yours with two different kinds of seed and do not put on a garment woven with two different kinds of thread the purpose of this piece of legislation was a religious one it was to inculcate practices which would serve as reminders of a religious truth the need to preserve the faith of israel undefiled by any admixture with pagan cults like much of old testament law it has been superseded by the new testament and no longer is binding on us yet the tortuous reasoning of the segregationist would seem to be that although we no longer have to avoid the mixtures expressly condemned in this passage we plant hybrid corn wear suits made of dacron and wool and crossbreed cattle we must treat it as the biblical warrant for avoiding a kind of mixture never even hinted at in the text we might summarize the old testament attitude on racial segregation by saying very simply that the ancient israelites had no such concern those passages which might at first glance seem to lend support however fanciful to segre gationist views are either concerned with other matters entirely are examples of tribal suspicion of the stranger or based upon religious and not racial grounds in turning to the new testament we find that jesus himself was by no means of pure stock both st matthew chapter one and st luke chapter three give christs family tree and in both accounts of it we find several nonjews but still more important the new testament teaching of christ and the apostles offers no foothold for the segregationist actually it provides much more support to those who would abolish every sort of invidious discrimination st paul summarizes the whole new testament teaching on the unity of mankind in christ to the galatians he writes no longer is there jew or greek no longer is there slave or freeman no longer is there male or female you are all one in christ jesus galatians  he reminds the ephesians christ it is who has made both jew and gentile one and has broken down the partition wall of hostility which separated them ephesians  against this background of new testament thought we might pose a different question from the one with which we began this inquiry if the bible neither supports nor tolerates segregation does it demand integration the scene of judgment described by matthew chap   indicates that there is one and only one decisive question christ will ask us have you loved your neighbor as yourself he has never assured us that such love is free of risk it may well mean risk of health or wealth or even life itself but neither has he offered to excuse us because of such risks of course the problem of integration or segregation is a modern problem it did not exist in the world of the bible but this modern problem nevertheless demands the light which biblical teaching on human relations can and does shed upon it how can any christian seriously maintain that segregation is compatible with christianity or refuse to work actively in so far as he is able for the elimination of this scandal from the modem world the unity of mans origin and destiny the community of mans fall and redemption the demand of christ for a love that surmounts all barriers of social or class distinction leaves no other alternative do not be surprised brothers if the world hates you you know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers he who does not love abides in death everyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him    little children let us not love merely in word or with tongue but in action in reality i john 
a kind of homecoming
oday february   i set foot on african soil for the first time i had expected and anticipated a spiritual excitement a kind of dramatic consciousness of identity with the spirits of ancestors long dead and unknown and i wished very hard to feel something anything truly different after the long hours in the airplane but all that happened was the heat which soon had my shirt sticking to my back in the short walk from the plane to the airport lounge airport guards with rifles or with pistols holstered at their sides yet wearing friendly smiles and saluting the travelers with friendly gestures of welcome the sky blue and clear and limitlessly empty except for the large wrynecked carrion crows which circled lazily patiently confident that sooner or later they would find a meal the long ride to the hotel in conakry capital of the former french colony of guinea along a narrow asphalt road fringed with trees suddenly and sweetly familiar the trees of boyhood and hometown cocoanut palms curving sinuously upward their tufted tops swaying in disdainful majesty above the green banana and papaya trees mango trees so deeply green each leaf seemed to be in shadow breadfruit and laden orange trees here and there a clump of the sweet cassava plant or the blooming hibiscus and bougainvillea and now it came to me in a tearstarting rush i had seen it all before in the british guiana of my boyhood all of it the crows and the trees and the low huts strawthatched with walls and floors of packed clay as the car sped along the road i caught glimpses of familiar faces long remembered and i had the feeling that if i leaned out and called out a name someone would answer with pleased recognition as i approached the center of conakry the feeling of being in familiar surroundings decreased probably because the buildings seemed so strange square and shuttered tenthirty in the morning and everywhere groups of people sitting at doorways or outside the shops or in the shade beside the road men always the men sitting dozing or in friendly argument among themselves men talking and laughing while women moved among them with bundles or large household vessels balanced casually on their heads and tiny children strapped straddlelegged on their backs in front of the shops the innumerable tailors each one pedaling industriously on his treadletype sewing machine undisturbed by the talk and laughter of the groups of men around them who had plenty of time to stand stare and comment and the others those easily identifiable as strangers always in groups of four or more strongfeatured men who reminded me of the drillers and surveyors and oilmen of maracaibo but without their easy banter and ribaldry russians czechs and chinese all looking serious and dedicated as if determined to prove that they were not tourists i called at the bank to change some travelers checks into the local currency but finding it closed during the midday lunch period not much lunch for the staff i thought for now is the time of ramadan the moslem month of fasting i wandered around and sat in the bar st germain for a beer and sandwich nine chinese eight men and one woman sat at a nearby table waiting to be served the lunch they ordered meanwhile reading technical pamphlets and books with hardly a single word exchanged between them the waiter a friendly little man originally from somewhere in the west indies noticed my interest in the chinese group we call them the miracle workers he said they build well and very quickly have you seen the exposition building i replied that i didnt know there was one nice he said very nice and they build it like that and he snapped finger and thumb to indicate high speed the men were lean hardlooking and young the woman slim and petite her hair severely short her face impassive and without makeup when the food arrived they kept their books open and read while they ate as if the food held little interest for them and was merely a necessary interruption in the flow of more positive endeavors other people dropped into the bar and my friend the waiter would say russian or american one partly graying man approached my table greeted me in french and sat down he said he was a correspondent from yugoslavia in guinea to cover the impending visit of marshal tito now i know why there are all the flags and street decorations i said well partly he replied most of them are left over from the visit of the russian premier who was here a short while ago i returned to the bank in the afternoon the staff was just arriving and was busy shaking hands with each other in the french manner the bank is a large building the offices at street level with several other customers white and black i waited at the counter while the staff showered each other with courtesies they were all very young and when they were finally seated at their desks and had begun their various activities they seemed very slow and inexperienced typewriters and adding machines were operated slowly and ponderously and i had the feeling that they were all in training if not completely new to the job when finally a clerk approached me he took what seemed to be an awfully long time to complete several forms then i was told to sit and wait so i stood at a barred window and watched the movement in the street outside people spitting all over the place so with some disgust i turned away awful isnt it a man was standing beside me he too must have been watching the people i mean the spitting he went on but theres a reason for it theyre fasting most of them and what with the heat and the dust it is very difficult to swallow the saliva so they spit same thing in all moslem countries try fasting and you might feel yourself wanting to spit too he was tall and thin and very red as if new to the heat and strong sunshine he spoke in english each word clearly and carefully enunciated as is the case when one is using a foreign language his thin bony face had a sharp intelligent look but pleasant with curiosity and understanding it must be difficult for them in this heat i replied not knowing what else to say theyre accustomed to it he said its one of the things that binds these people together their religion and helps to rally them for political action when necessary which part of africa you from im from the west indies i answered and i am visiting africa for the first time to take a look at things i come from prague he told me im a teacher i am here helping to train teachers so we talked about teaching i mentioned that i had taught in schools in britain and referred to the kind of problems i had encountered there in guinea he said there was never any problem of discipline because religious and other influences conditioned the child to respect his elders and the educated person commanded a position of prestige the main problem was how best to meet the acute shortage of schools teaching staff and equipment and at the same time keep pace with the hunger for education which was everywhere in evidence as i spoke with him i realized that he had a real and simple belief in human dignity and his work was important in that it was geared to a readiness to be sympathetic and helpful i noticed that while talking the time had slipped away and we were still waiting for our money so i approached the clerk who had attended me and asked if there was any reason for the delay everything is ready he replied but the cashier has not yet returned from lunch he was very matteroffact about it and i felt myself becoming impatient and irritable especially as the clerk casually ignored me and went on laboriously adding figures on a machine the czech teacher said this is not paris or london you know after all theres nowhere to go in a hurry so dont be too impatient these young people are trying to do a very complicated job without much experience when the french left they took every piece of equipment they could with them together with the experienced staff so these young men and women have to learn as they go and banking is not the easiest of business transactions nevertheless they are making it work no matter how slow it seems as they become more and more accustomed to the routine of the work and the techniques of international finance the whole thing will speed up and heres something else when it is finally running smoothly all of these young people will have the satisfaction of knowing that they did it themselves thats important you know soon afterward the cashier arrived a goodlooking obviously pregnant young woman she quickly checked through the forms made some rapid calculations on a small adding machine and paid me the amount i required in guinea currency from the speed with which she worked in such contrast to her colleagues it was clear that she was very experienced and pregnant though she was very much needed once out in the street the czech teacher remarked thats a sign of the times all the white faces were on the wrong side of the counter i understood his little joke when i left him i wandered away from the center of town through the narrow streets lined with the allpurpose shops of the lebanese traders past a high wall behind which could be heard the alltoofamiliar sounds of childrens voices i followed the wall around to a wooden gateway and entered a small courtyard where about a hundred children sat in tight rows behind long narrow trestletype desks and repeated the instructions of a teacher as he explained simple arithmetical tables with the assistance of a blackboard i paused but he noticed me and came over i apologized for interrupting his lesson but he seemed quite pleased to have a visitor especially when i mentioned that i too had been a teacher as soon as the children saw me they stood up very quietly a gesture of respect i had received previously only in the public schools of britain and it occurred to me that whatever the shortages in other fields this new state was not ignoring the importance of social niceties the class was mixed boys and girls of about eleven years all simply sometimes poorly dressed without any attention to uniformity but their black faces and lively eyes shone with their hunger for knowledge and information the teacher wore khaki slacks and shirt and simple sandals of broad strips of leather fastened to thick rubber soles which i suspected had been cut from old motorcar tires on his brown intelligent face he sported a sparse scraggly beard which did nothing for him nor took anything from himit was simply there thats all his french was beautifully articulated and i later discovered that he had studied for eleven years in dakar are you over here to help us as a teacher he asked oh no i replied im merely wandering around africa looking for things to write about my first visit you know welcome again he said and we shook hands again but its a pity youre not a teacher we desperately need all we can get see for yourself i need at least another teacher to help me here any likelihood of the situation improving oh were getting help he replied but not enough quickly enough people are going to help us from china and czechoslovakia and yugoslavia and the west indies you know martinique and guadaloupe where they speak french sometimes it even becomes a bit complicated when some of the new teachers have to teach through interpreters until they can manage in french damned funny at times his laugh was easy and pleasant i suppose that limits the scope of the teaching you are able to do i suggested not too much he replied because we are adapting our educational plans to our needs and right now we need artisans and agricultural workers more than we need clerks and potential bureaucrats so we are concentrating on primary education to supply a broad general base then in the secondary schools we are providing technical education planned to create an interest in the country and a willingness to contribute to its development the child who gets an education must appreciate that the state needs his trained usefulness you mentioned teachers from china czechoslovakia etc i said do not they present the possible danger of introducing communistic ideas into the minds of the youngsters immediately his face lost its pleasant friendly mien his eyes shone with controlled anger and he replied you americans are all alike black or white youre all the same in a hasty attempt at apology i said im sorry i did not mean to offend you by asking that question incidentally im not an american im a west indian please forgive me if my question annoyed you im not annoyed he said carefully im merely sorry for you because you americans have developed such a phobia about the word communist that you see nothing but communists wherever you go here in guinea we are desperately trying to transform independence from a political attainment into an economic reality to do that we need help and we are not too proud to accept help but we will not accept any help if it means jeopardizing any part or aspect of that independence we sacrificed so much to achieve i looked at the children and noticed that they were watching somewhat anxiously something of the teachers changed mood must have transmitted itself very quickly to them and they were in silent response to it the teacher himself seemed suddenly aware of the childrens interest because he turned and rapidly wrote a few simple problems on the blackboard which he instructed them to copy and solve in their notebooks when they were busy at this he turned once more to me maybe you americans would like to help us if he emphasized that little word with hands and shoulders and eyesit even had a strangely sibilant sound as he hissed it at me maybe you would help us but only on your terms because you neither understand nor believe in african neutrality and that is simply explained by the fact that as yet you do not believe or respect africans he paused and shrugged a tired patient gesture i am not a communist im merely a teacher trying to do my job as well as i am able this is not a communist country and i think i can safely say it will never be the day you black americans understand what personal independence really means you will begin to understand how we feel about our country he was not angry but i was becoming bored with being called an american and being blamed for their supposed sins of omission i made one more try im not an american im from the west indies oh yes so you said he answered smiling suddenly but you sound like an american you ought to stay here awhile and becomewhat is the termbrainwashed he laughed at this and i joined him and on that easier note i left him the afternoon sun was very warm and i made my way in the general direction back to my hotel anticipating a refreshing shower and a change from my sweatdamp clothes here and there i saw groups of workmen swarming over the skeleton of a new building and it was with something of a shock that i realized that nowhere in sight was there a single piece of mechanical equipmenteverything was being done by hand ladders were makeshift arrangements from roughly cut saplings as were all other wooden supports in use concrete was mixed by hand and passed by a chain of hands to the place desired here and there i saw a european directing operations and i guessed from their slavic features that they were eastern european but in spite of what the young guinea teacher had just said there was not much evidence of concentrated popular effort in fact conakry was to me singularly depressing    i passed a group of women dressed in their national costume with wide flaring skirts and an overmantle of embroidered gauze on their heads they wore headkerchiefs of brightly patterned cotton tied to show wide points rising elegantly from each side like the wings of some exotic bird immediately the rusty wheels of my memory quickened into gear and i recalled seeing women similarly dressed long ago in my native british guiana on market day in the countryside yes memory was clearer now i could even remember seeing a photograph of my grandmother wearing that distinguishable headkerchief i looked closely at the women observing their finely shaped features black and silky smooth did my origins lie somewhere here with these people i could not understand a word they said for they spoke an african dialect but they smiled at me and i bowed as i passed i was feeling something now and it was a good feeling for the very first time in many years i was walking among people without being conscious that i was different from them although a stranger to africa i felt sufficiently identified to be at ease comfortable to belong passersby might readily recognize that i was a stranger to guinea but unless my speech gave me away it would be assumed that i was african from some other territory or state a stranger but not strange because i was by origin a fragment of the whole back in england persons often asked me from which part of africa are you because on first contact they immediately associated my black skin with africa now in an african town among africans i felt at east and realized with something of a shock that the white faces looked strange to me a group of men standing outside the office of air france chatted softly but earnestly about the congo and patrice lumumbas death for which they blamed the united nations in general and the negligence of ghana in particular i sat nearby to listen surprised at the amount of information they seemed to have with them the congo was a cause celebre and indicated the need to so order their own internal affairs that it would never be necessary for the united nations or any other organization to intervene from a passing taxi a radio blared forth the sound of childrens voices in song something in praise of president sekou toure their voices too loud and evidently untrained but undeniably enthusiastic as the men spoke of the congo it was clear that lumumbas death and in such strange circumstances crystallized in their minds the evils of all colonialists and their policies one man made a reference to tshombe and spat on the ground to show his disgust from what they said i learned that the guinean forces in the congo had been recalled some had already returned home now and then someone spoke of we in africa or we africans but i had the feeling that for them africa meant guinea because there was little or no reference to any of the other african states it was very exciting to watch them and notice that the language they used their mannerisms and fondness for the philosophical turn of phrase were all very french indeed but none of it detracted from their dignity or belief in the rightness of their opinions back at the hotel i had an excellent dinner and from my corner table observed the other diners some of whom were guests at the hotel others officials resident in the town and able to afford the exorbitant prices charged for the meals bits of conversation could be heard in russian yugoslav czech chinese german french arabic english and american eating was a long drawnout affair because after dinner there was nowhere to go and nothing to do for entertainment having eaten i sat at the bar next to a tall very black man who between sips from his glass held it up to the light as if determined to discover how such a harmlesslooking liquid could produce the kind of effect it was having on him his hands holding the glass fondly like a communicant were large and powerfullooking as were the shoulders and chest which bulged the thin gaily colored shirt and i was sure that when he stood up hed be six feet tall or more his thin face was dominated by a large aquiline nose and marked high on each cheek with three vertical incisions which made him look rather like a pirate in festive mood i ordered beer and surreptitiously studied the antics of my companion as they were reflected in the mirror over the bar he must have caught me at it because he suddenly turned to me and asked stranger he spoke in english yes i replied ghana no im west indian he looked more closely at me as if to locate something in my face you look like a ghanian he said tonelessly and went back to his careful examination of his drink turning the frosty glass slowly in his fingers then how do you like my country he shot the question at me without turning his head i only arrived today i replied ive been wandering around town taking a look are you a salesman or with a mission or something no im a writer looking for copy this is my first visit to africa and im trying to record my impressions he pivoted around on his stool and very seriously extended a large hand welcome to africa he said his grip was strong the fingers cool from contact with the glass this is my first food today he continued shaking the glass been fasting sunup to sunset ramadan you know ive read of it i replied know anyone in town not really just nosing around i could show you around tonight if you like he offered his drink completed we set out he was even taller than i had guessed about two inches over six feet and walked with a slightly stooped posture as if accustomed to accommodating persons much shorter than himself the night was cool from the soft sea breezes and from the forecourt of the hotel could be heard the soft murmur of the tide on the beach close by overhead the towering mango trees lost their tops against the darker sky now crowded with stars which seemed brighter because of the dimly lit streets we followed the road around from the hotel and he pointed out the stately gardensurrounded houses once the residences of highranking french officials and now converted to service as ministries of one sort or another when the previous occupants the french left he remarked they literally gutted the houses what they could not cart away they smashed baths toilet bowls everything on into the town by now the shops were closed and the streets were for the most part deserted except for an occasional group of two or three men chatting beside an open doorway a general air of depression seemed to hover over the whole place and nowhere could i detect any sound of music or laughter god what a place to be stuck in i thought what does one do for entertainment in this place i asked he stopped with that curious habit of listening with his head cocked to one side entertainment he echoed oh i see what you mean there are no night clubs or brothels here these days the french took them with them when they departed so hastily but we manage very well without them he laughed luckily we are a polygamous people so have ways of entertaining ourselves then in a serious vein we do know how to enjoy ourselves believe me but right now most people are observing ramadan and that is a very quiet period for us we walked in silence for a while past the deserted market with its tiers of open stalls through narrow streets lined with closely packed twostory buildings dark behind their tight shutters and empty except for mongrel dogs foraging in the shadows on past the high wall of the soldiers cantonments until we reached some open ground beyond which the chinese exhibition building rose in massive silhouette here we stopped very impressive i offered in an attempt to probe his thoughts what he asked the exhibition building like a transplanted piece of new china oh sure he replied his thoughts elsewhere before long all the open land like this will either become development areas or be turned into parks and playgrounds for our children but before that happens we have lots of lessons to learn and the chief one is to live without the things we cannot affordthings like night clubs and brothels he turned and grinned at me his teeth a flash of white in the dark gloom of his face we africans often talk glibly about independence he continued after a while before it is achieved the very word has a certain magic quality and very often we expect that many of the problems which attend the winning of independence will solve themselves in some magical way here in guinea we are learning that independence must be more than a political milestone it must become a spiritual quality so that we can better apply ourselves to the grave tasks ahead of us this quality of the spirit is not breathed in with the night air at this he waved his arm in the gesture of an oratorit has to be learned and developed we the old ones learned it through fighting and sacrifice and we have to teach it to our children with everything else they learn in that way all of us will understand and accept that each one of us has the responsibility for making this country great excuse me please i interrupted but are you a lawyer or teacher perhaps no he replied im a soldier he began walking and i fell into stride with him have you been to the congo his answer was long in coming yes he finally replied and for me the most important lesson is this that under no circumstances must we in guinea allow our internal affairs ever to deteriorate to the point where any outside country or organization needs to intervene or is asked to intervene but fortunately that is very unlikely we walked in silence for a while all kinds of questions clamored within me but i felt that he was in the mood to talk and needed no prompting from me it was a saddening experience for me he continued to see an organization like the united nations forces of which we were a part become so completely ineffectual as an organ for peace and stability through the vagueness of its mandate the irresolution of its authority and the proved inexperience of some of its top personnel who though tagged and uniformed as military personnel had neither the tradition of military action nor the personal experience of situations of armed conflict to guide their decisions much of what happened in the congo since july of  must be laid at the doorstep of the united nations and it will long remain a matter of national and personal regret that we contributed by association to the whole unhappy situation the congo dilemma is a monument to human error everyone involved in it made mistakes varying only in degree unfortunately in nearly every instance mistaken action was persisted in primarily to save somebodys face or defended because no other course of action seemed effective stupidity is no respecter of persons and many innocent people have died because of it we in guinea can avoid such fatal stupidity by teaching ourselves and our children to appreciate the disciplines and responsibilities of independence and so to believe in this little country of ours that no hardship is too great and no contribution too small in helping its progress does the man in the street feel the same way as you do about the countrys development and his involvement in it i asked yes of course he replied even though he might not be as articulate in exposing his feelings while youre here talk to them yourself and if you have the time get up into the country among the smaller towns and villages talk with the people you might run into a few surprises we continued our walk swinging right along the tarmac road which followed the twisting coastline overhead the palm fronds whispered softly as they touched each other sly sounds vaguely heard against the wash of the tide and the heavier chorus of crickets frogs and the sleepless nightjars people passed us talking softly together the slap slap of their sandaled feet audible long after they had faded into the distance we need help to do the things we need to do here he continued and we are getting help from certain quarters but we need more the time must come when we shall resolve our differences with france without sacrifice to our national pride or integrity and one fine day the americans will think seriously enough of us and other african states to treat us with the dignity due to independent states and their inhabitants we are sick of being badgered or maneuvered into situations of choice between east or west merely because the united states will not conceive that we are free people and intend to remain free from any kind of influence or control jesus christ the damn folly of it he exclaimed do you know something none of the russians or czechs or yugoslavs or chinese who come here ever ask about the united states and what we think of them we have a few american teachers in our schools but no one asks us if that means that were becoming capitalists why the hell cant americans recognize that to people like us freedom and independence are the most precious things we have anyway he said more calmly it may all work toward our good the hardships we experience now might prove to be the best possible thing that could have happened to us dont you think i ventured that your political conduct i mean your countrys political conduct must reflect a truly neutralist attitude if you expect to be believed that is not what is expected of us he replied no one believes in african neutrality we are exnected to be either prowest or procommunist and if we refuse to enter bodily into one camp we are promptly branded with the label of the other if i or one of my countrymen should visit russia tomorrow the word would go around that i am prorussian or procommunist and id have a hell of a time if after that i wanted to visit the united states but take the other side of the coin no eastern european country would refuse me entry merely because i had previously visited the united states what does that make you think who is it that has the growing up to do we were now once more outside the hotel de france well here we are he said tell you what if you like i could take you around tomorrow we could take a run up into the country and let you see whats happening there conakrybrothels apart or the lack of themis like any town anywhere which has felt the influence of a cosmopolitan population upcountry you might better see and understand the things ive been talking about id like that fine i replied delighted to have so interesting and responsible a companion showing me around this was indeed a lucky break one thing you can do he said seeming in no hurry to leave when you write about us let them know that what we need even more than their money or their machines is their respect theyve got to learn to respect us as equals much of the time they humor us ive seen it with my own eyes so i know what im talking about nowadays wherever an african goes and speaks he is listened to and nobody ever attempts to be critical of him unless they feel that his political complexion differs from theirs theyre never very much concerned with the man or the content of his talking but merely with the kind of political alignment he represents or seems to represent we command attention in the councils of the world primarily because we are africans and so we are wooed and solicited and pampered like clever performing monkeys because nobody is really taking the trouble to look behind the facade and understand the african the first thing about our new independence is our desire to be seen and heard often we are unprepared to be seen and heard and our posture is merely an imitation of those who so recently controlled us yet it is readily applauded and encouraged uncritically just because we are africans however when we are reported i notice that our remarks are invariably qualified by reference to our use of english or french as if that were the seal of cultural arrival it is hardly ever noticed that every african who stands up in the worlds councils speaks a language different from the one he learned at his mothers breast and is consciously or unconsciously making a concession to those who would otherwise find it nearly impossible to communicate with him on the other hand we africans do not seem to have finally made up our minds about the grave responsibilities which lie ahead we resent the old image which nonafricans entertain about us but we have done little to present a new and clearer image of ourselves very often we behave as if we are shipwrecks struggling helplessly in the floodtide of independence instead of capable marines managing our political affairs with judgment and discretion we have a hell of a lot to learn from each other and from nonafrican people with wider experience of government industry and representation than ourselves but we need the kind of constructive criticism and appraisal free of political bias which would stimulate us to increased responsibility of expression and action he laid a fatherly hand on my shoulder and said you must forgive me my young friend for preaching to you but it is not every day that one has the opportunity to talk like this with an outsider too often you people are in a hurry to judge us out of hand and naturally our first impulse is to resent your criticism because you have shown very little inclination to understand and be at least patient with us try to balance everything you see and hear against the fact that we were suddenly thrown upon our own limited resources with the added handicap of the antipathy and distrust generated by the conduct of the french in the last days of their control remember that in spite of our difficulties we are a small country but a united one have a good night and well start upcountry early in the morning ill call for you around eight oclock i watched his tall figure swing easily down the path onto the road to move into the treecrowded shadow of the still african night
i breakfasted at  am and comfortable in cool khaki shirt and slacks i waited for my friend who arrived promptly on time in a large chauffeurdriven american car he may have noticed my surprise because he said laughing i wangled it on the argument that you were an important visitor its one of our official cars outside the hotel the air was damp and fresh with dew which still hung in misty patches over every ditch or narrow gully the driver leaned heavily on his horn as we moved through the town streets already crowded with people on their way to their various jobs or to the large market in the center of town we slowed down as we passed the market the air now heavy with the ripe odors of dried fish fruit and a wide variety of unfamiliar herbs and roots people shouted at each other across the inches which separated them in the ageold exercise of haggling over the price of an article their arms flailing the air in wild gestures or their fingers fluttering in insistent illustration every kind of merchandise seemed to be on sale but most of it utilitarian and of cheap manufacture brightly patterned cloth from japan cheekbyjowl with gay enamel cooking utensils stamped with the legend sierra leone independence  large bunches of bananas and plantains piles of local oranges chickens lying on their sides with legs securely tied their eyes halfglazed with fear the public letterwriter sitting at his little table ready to serve the illiterate for a price and the ubiquitous tailor the whir of his restless treadle lost in the general cacophony   this country is rich very rich my friend said look at the color of the i earth weve not even begun to tap our resources of bauxite or lets say were i only scratching the surface so far under that useless grass theres wealth i waiting to be dug up but it requires money lots of it wish i knew a short i cut to fort knox he laughed then as if struck by a sudden idea he said i tell me something about president kennedys peace corps what will it do i and how does he plan to set about assembling it i why does everyone ask me questions about america as if i am an i american or somehow responsible for what happens there i seem to spend i an awful lot of time explaining that british guiana is not the usa all i i know about it is what i have read or heard in france i replied strange the way americans see africa he murmured more to himself than to me i wonder who it is that advises him about us in africa peace corps where would he send them and what will they do and what is most important how will he choose them i read that they will be mostly young men will their expressed liberality be a qualification would they have to like black people before they become eligible or will they be shown how to be a liberal after they are chosen would a man be barred because he is a southerner even if they satisfy all of mr kennedys requirements does that imply that we in africa will believe in them what guarantees have we that the men of the peace corps who come to be nice to us in africa would be just as nice to black americans in the usa and when they come over here what will they do just tell us what nice people americans are were not interested in peace corps were not interested in hearing how peace can best be preserved from young liberal americans wed rather have some of the practical symbols of peace out there he pointed at the blur of landscape flitting by you know bulldozers and tractors and wed welcome young peaceful americans who could teach us how to turn this brown grassy promise into a productive certainty so that our country might taste the fruits of peace before they grow too old to care peace corps he whispered that is the kind of charity which should begin at home and be firmly restrained from leaving it his lips tightened into a thin bitter line or perhaps he intends sending black americans to teach us about peace they are not much better than the white ones i hear that they want to identify with us africans and that theyve started all kinds of organizations which claim to reflect african heritage very good provided they maintain the distance between america and africa and are sensible enough to understand that a black skin does not make everyone an african ive seen them here and in other places in africa and been rather sorry for some of them when i observed their disillusionment with us from thousands of miles away tomtoms and grass huts and polygamy seems very attractive and picturesque and freedom for africa is an exciting battlecry but close at hand the heat and the dirt and disease and shortages play havoc with lofty resolutions i suddenly felt somewhat out of accord with him maybe this was aimed obliquely at me because i too felt a sense of identity with africas political destiny surely i interrupted the expressions of solidarity from black americans is all of a piece with african progress even though they come from people several generations removed from the african scene im concerned with positive values he replied sagely not with questionable postures the best contribution any outsider can make is to be as active and positive as possible in the fight against indignity and inhumanity americans are americans and the black ones should concentrate all their efforts in fighting the many forces of indignity which beset them in america that is the kind of contribution we need herethe encouragement of knowing that on all fronts the fight for social equality and political freedom is firmly joined do you know and once again his face relaxed in a smile quite often i meet black americans in africa and by god theyre so american in everything they do and say that they dont seem to realize it and we africans find it most irritating because of the common factorour black skins seems pretty hopeless does it i asked not altogether he assured me laughing maybe one day we africans will become as familiar with airconditioning and laborsaving devices and department stores so that well develop a few more factors in common with our american cousins    there was a question which had been on my mind all day now that he seemed relaxed and affable i decided to plunge in about your president i began well what about him so far you have said nothing about him in european newspapers i have seen him referred to as dictator procommunist strong man and demagogue so far you have been very frank and outspoken in your observations about the outsiders would you be just as frank in telling me about guineas leadership after two years as an independent state again the familiar headononeside pause but this time the beginnings of a smile tickled the side of his mouth and ran along the big arched nose the things you read were mainly true but the people who wrote them did not understand the truth they were writing they did not even know they were writing the truth because they do not know the man easy relaxed patient even fatherly now hed be generous and explain it carefully to me two things they do not understand the africans background and the meaning of african nationalism in africa we have always been accustomed to authoritarian rule it has been the basis of our social structure long before any european ever set foot on african soil and it still survives in the heart of every african no matter how europeanized he might seem to be in africa we respect strength and we honor it when it is allied to personal courage and skillful leadership our president has these qualities and he is an african in the fullest sense he is well informed although he never attended university either here or abroad and when he speaks he speaks the language of our people in the way our people understand we trust him and we follow him dictator demagogue those are european terms they have no meaning in the context of africa nor has the term democracy in guinea we are for the most part of our three million people illiterate democracy presupposes a literate majority of the population what we need what we must have is strong forceful leadership toward achievable targets designed to involve everyone irrespective of educational or other considerations he sipped his drink before continuing as for the other thing it seems impossible for the outsider to get into the skin of the african to understand the terrible but wonderful spirit which has recently been released within and among us you blind yourselves with label and name tags and refuse to look behind them to apprehend the facts if an african reads marx or engels you brand him communist if he visits prague or moscow you brand him communist would you consider him a capitalist if you caught him reading the financial times the lesson you need to learn all of you both east and west as you are fond of describing yourselves is that we are first and last africans we are willing and ready to learn from you all of you but we have no wish or intention to be anything but africansfree independent africans your newspapers expend a lot of time and energy criticizing our form of government let them note that we are all firstclass hundred per cent africans there are no secondclass citizens among us let them also note that the oneparty rule which they find so difficult to swallow is not restricted to guinea liberia ghana tunisia these are but a few where the same things exist and sierra leone go there and take a look milton margai has no opposition party to contend with then theres nigeria right now we have the job of feeding housing and educating our people and of building our economy so that we can continue to improve their food housing and education and we have a leader who is young strong and vigorous enough to do just that i suppose you have noticed that our shops have no luxury goods and our women do not wear the latest paris fashions but what is important is the fact that although the french revoked their support of our budget we are not economically crippled as a matter of fact we are stable and moving ahead later on we may give some attention to putting a little icing on the cake he laughed and i felt an admiration for this man if he truly expressed the general attitude of the people then guinea was well on the way to setting its mark on the whole continent of africa this was undoubtedly a big night people were arriving for the show mostly europeans men and women dressed fashionably in light linens and silks all looking enthusiastic greeting each other somewhat loudly now and then my friend would indicate an ambassador or special envoy from europe or another african state a tall distinguishedlooking fairskinned negro immaculate in a white sharkskin suit was identified as the united states ambassador the tone of my friends voice did not convey much enthusiasm he may be leaving us soon he remarked as the gentleman passed us on his way to the main hall i thought that the ambassador may have completed his tour of duty and was moving to some other theater of operations one must never underestimate the deep effects of conditioning he said seemingly talking more to himself than to me that is why we must use every means possible to keep reminding our people that every aspect of their daily lives must reflect their consciousness of freedom and independence treat a man unequally and after a time he will think or behave unequally even if you subsequently place him in high office he will occasionally betray some residual traits of inequality we are a free and sovereign state and would prefer that representatives from other states at ambassadorial and other levels are chosen from among the best in their field and at the moment we are inclined to doubt that black americans have had sufficient opportunities at higher diplomatic level to provide them with the background and experience necessary to the efficient execution of the job of an ambassador we cannot be expected to entertain the highest regard for a black ambassador when we know that in many parts of his own country he would be refused hotel accommodation and other facilities merely because of the color of his skin and when he speaks to us on matters of importance we cannot be sure that he speaks on behalf of all america it therefore follows that america must quickly introduce changes to equate the status of her black citizens with that of her white citizens or keep the black ones out of internationalrepresentative office may i ask you a rather frank question i interrupted why not its a free country he grinned you are bitter about america arent you one might even say you are positively antiamerican arent you guilty of the same kind of phobia which you so determinedly condemn in them its strange he replied but i feel no hatred no none whatsoever is that difficult for you to believe lets put it this way im impatient to see some improvement in the relationships between other countries and ourselves but i think it is necessary to speak ones mind ive been speaking frankly with you because i hope that in reporting me you will present the truth and perhaps it might lead to some revision of attitudes no im not antiamerican i am merely proafrican even if at the moment all africa for me is concentrated in the word guinea  i suggested that we get seats for the fashion show and we inquired at the desk but discovered that we were days too late all available seats had been sold and there was not even standing room it was no great disappointment because the long car trip the heavy meal and the beer all conspired to produce a comfortable lassitude and we agreed that perhaps bed would be best i said goodbye to my friend as he would be busy from then on and would be unable to spend more time with me and retired to my room to scribble down everything i could remember of our conversation later i could hear the sounds of music and cheering from downstairs but soon these subsided into the dark peace of the african night
