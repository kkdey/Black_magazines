  by isabelle rivierez with louis e lomax
i am the child of a mixed marriage and i will never forget it even if i tried the peoples of the worldboth white and negro would not let me my father hector rivierez is a lightskinned negro from french guiana in south america my mother born violette barbaut is a blueeyed blonde from france the contour of my face and the texture of my olive skin show that i am a negro and the child of a mixed marriage hardly a day passes that somebody doesnt ask me what its like being halfwhite and halfblack quite candidly it is no picnic in paris where i grew up fathers brown skin and mothers blue eyes seemed as natural to me as the sun and the moon like the eiffel tower where i played the champ de mars park where mother and i strolled they were fixtures of my childhood world it never occurred to me that our family was odd i knew that i was darker than mother lighter than father and not exactly the same color as the other children on my block i knew i was different but if your father is negro your mother white and you are three years old being different is the most natural thing in the world little do you suspect that one day this difference will cause you pain i was born on december   six months after the germans occupied paris but our home along the avenue de la bourdonnais was a warm and secure place fathers law office was located in our sevenroom apartment thus he and mother were always home and their presence sheltered me i saw no difference between the blacks and the whites jews and gentiles who were fathers clients then one day one of fathers clients a jew came to our home crying his entire family had been wiped out in a nazi concentration camp only he had escaped as i listened to his tragic story i realized for the first time that being different could mean trouble even so the coals of racism had not seared me that was to come later we spent our summers at our country home about  miles from paris all of the villagers were white but we had no problems i remember joining with the children of the village as they lined the road to welcome the american troops negro and white en route to liberate paris from the nazis we felt all was well with the world needless to say we were wrong at least i was two years later at the age of six i realized how wrong i was it happened during my first days in school the children gathered  around me nigger some of them shouted gypsy others taunted i did not know what either word meant i only knew that i was being called something bad i got mad i fought with my tormentors they fought back when they realized that namecalling angered me the incidents increased when i asked my father what these names meant and why my fellow students attacked me he explained as clearly as he could still trying to shield me from the raw side of life you must not fight father told me you must learn to be proud that you are colored but mother is not colored she is white should she be proud also yes father said you and i should be proud that we are colored mother should be proud that she is white that is the way god made us some roses are red others white but they are all roses and they all smell sweet the same is true of men the color of their skins has nothing to do with the quality of their hearts minds and souls i was colored and i was colored in a world where color may not basically matter but where men make it matter this is the first shock a child of mixed parentage experiences despite the fact that she is halfwhite and halfcolored she can never be white some children of mixed marriages pass for white hiding their negro heritage in order to escape the pain of discrimination this i could never do i am not ashamed of my color and while still at my fathers knee resolved never to hide it i learned to ignore my fellow students when they called me names once they realized they could no longer hurt me the namecalling stopped yet despite my outward calm the race question had become a vital part of my inner life i wanted to know more about my father and mother i realized that theirs was not just another marriage mother felt my concern and through a se ries of long talks i came to know the story of their love and marriage father had come to paris to study law mother was also a student there they met and fell in love it was not easy for them mother explained to me their parents objected to the marriage each family wanted its child to marry within his own race they were warned that society would ostracize them even their friends reminded them that their children would be born into the no mans land of being neither black nor white nevertheless they were married love knows no barriers mother told me i would not let the prejudices of others rob me of lifes sweetest experience there were other negroes in paris but they were not torn by the conflicts that wracked me they were as aware of being negro as i was but they had come by that awareness via a different perhaps more natural route i felt i was a negro by force not by birth that i had been made negro by an arbitrary ruling that only children of two white parents can be white i soon became bitter and difficult to get along with by the time i reached secondary school i had become a problem student i was not the only colored student in the school but i was the only nonwhite in my class one afternoon i could bear it no longer i was sitting along the back row in my sewing class i hated the teacher and i resented the gulf between her and me shattering the silence of the room i sang at the top of my voice this place is full of filth only i didnt say filth it is boring and i want to go home the teacher almost fainted then her shrill voice rang out isabelle and silence returned to the room as i was sent to the principals office and expelled from school that was not an easy day for my father who by then had been named to a high french government post in ubanguishari now the central african republic we talked alone perhaps more alone than we had ever talked before it was more than a father talking to his daughter it was a negro father talking to his negro daughter isabelle he said part of being negro is that you cannot afford the luxury of misbehavior people expect you to misbehave you start out with the odds against you you are constantly in the process of proving yourself following this incident my parnegro i had been to africa i had seen black men i sympathized with and fought for their cause i felt colored yet i had not found a sense of true identity there like nonwhites everywhere i was thrilled by the african freedom explosion which has given a deep feeling of pride to the colored race myself included yet i could not think of myself as african somehow there is a cultural gap between the africans and me i needed to find people of my own color who read the books i read love the music i love and who generally accept the same spiritual values that i accept if i could not find such a feeling of brotherhood with the africans where would i find it in the summer of  my parents and i visited fathers home in french guiana there i felt the chilly correctness with which many people of this negro country received my mother and for the first time i realized too that the sword of racism has at least two edges now that i look back upon it i am glad that i saw racism in reverse it saved me from more bitterness perhaps even hatred for the nonblacks of the world after father returned to paris mother and i went to america in miami beach florida we lived in the best hotelswithout incident then we went to new orleans that did it patrons dropped their food on the floor as we walked into the hotel restaurant fortunately we had not made reservations there we were simply passing through and had arranged to check our bags while we went sightseeing we traveled from louisiana to new york overland partly by bus at long last i saw the raw segregation and discrimination i had read about on one occasion i sat in a seat directly behind the bus driver he eyed me cautiously sizing up my light olive skin and long silk black hair finally he mustered enough courage to ask are you white or colored his manner and speech were polite obviously he wanted me to laugh it off by saying i had a deep suntan i am a french citizen i replied but i am a negro then i remained in my seat i have never ridden with a more confused and shaken bus driver but i saw more than segregation i saw the american negro i began to read every negro newspaper and magazine i could find a detailed account of the sitin demonstrations filled me with more selfpride and race pride than i had ever felt before i heard jazz not for the first time but in its native setting and i felt a response that could never express itself in france these are my people in spirit mind and purpose i have found a sense of identity when mother flew back to paris i remained in new york as secretary to one of the african delegations to the united nations strangely it was not until i began to move among american negroes that i fully realized what it means to be the child of an interracial marriage being the child of a mixed marriage is more than just being negro luckily i am now a grown woman i can make my own way and the fear of rejection by negroes as well as whites does not haunt me i know many children of american mixed marriagesand their experiences have not been pleasant would i marry a white man yes if i fell in love with one if i married a white man however i would not live in the united states not that the race problem would concern me but i honestly feel it would cripple my child forever american negroes are on the rise their own desegregation victories and the african revolutions make them increasingly proud of being negro for the most part however they are not yet ready to accept interracial marriage needless to say the masses of american whites are not ready to accept it either i have dated both negro and white men in new york i look upon them as individuals rather than as racial types yet when i think of marriage i think of children i know children of mixed marriages will have a difficult time regardless of where their parents live yet interracial marriage will not only continue it will increase mother was right love knows no boundaries and from the union of these brave lovers will come a generation of children that may well cure the racial pains that so contort our era 
wrestling rings down the color curtain
what jackie robinson vottydid for racial integraa vv jftion baseball a big vs dyearold negro wrestj er namecj bearcat wright has done for wrestling bearcat who lives in new yorks harlem and has become the hottest negro wrestler in the past year had to pull a spectacular stunt in the middle of  before the authorities of wrestling in gary in diana recognized that he meant what he said he was tired of being allowed to only wrestle with other negroes in segregated cities one night they had a sellout because they had previously announced that i was to wrestle a topflight opponent he recalls i was scheduled to be against a white man but when i arrived i found they had another negro for me i won the match but i felt let down i was back there the following week again once more supposed to wrestle a top contender again they gave me a negro thats when i decided something had to be done i made a little speech to the crowd in the arena i told them i would not appear anywhere again that i was not allowed to have mixed matches mainly because there was only a handful of negro wrestlers bearcat also feltjustlythat since until that time the negroes in wrestling consisted mainly of his own buddies it would not be an honest match as far as he was concerned as he could certainly not try very hard to knock the block off one of his own pals after my speech i got a letter saying i was suspended from wrestling in that area at the same time the naacp informed me that a committee had been formed asking that area to open up mixed matches surprisingly enough there was no real problem my suspension was lifted and slowly mixed wrestling has been opening up everywhere that it wasnt permitted before and negro audiences have been increasing too bearcat doesnt say it but it is known that he might not have had as easy a time convincing promoters of his stand if it had not been for the groundwork that another wrestlerwhitehad done in delighting negro audiences the great antonino rocca uncrowned leader of all wrestlers has long proven that negro audiences will pay money to see someone they like and after the many recordsmashing gates they have helped to swell for rocca since a number of spanishspeaking afficionados of wrestling in the east are negroes it was easy for them to include bearcat in their attention as well rocca has insisted for a long while that good wrestlers like bearcat and his tagteam partner sweet daddy siki are an added attraction to wrestling in mixed matches just before this article was written a longtime dream of bearcats came true he was signed up for a title match with international wrestling champion buddy nature boy rogers whereas rocca sticks strictly to the rules never starting a match before the bell rings rogers is a villain in every sense of the word knowing this wright has long had a chip on his fists from seeing rogers dirty tricks knowing that the socalled champ goes all out to hurt anyone and everyone who stands in his way in the ring whether it might mean breaking legs arms necks hearts or rules on the occasion of this title match while the two opponents were waiting for the event to start a roar of the crowd warned wright that rogers was creeping illegally up on him with mayhem intent not waiting for his own wrath to subside bearcat grabbed rogers arm twisted it and rammed the elbow into a metal part of the ring the elbows ligaments nerves and tendons were so badly injured that even after an operation it was not known how long it would be before rogers could get into action again one thing is certain the fans all raceswill demand a return meeting of the two and the promoters will be assured of the usual full house for this grudge match the name bearcat is not manufactured at least not by its wearer  he was born in omaha nebraska the son and grandson of a prizefighter bearcats father  also named bearcat as was his father before himfought five champions primo camera jack dempsey jack johnson max baer and mickey walker the mickey walker bout was to decide a dispute as to whether a good little fighter could beat a good big one walker proved he could although the younger wright was christened and he hates admitting this edward michael wright he now pays his income tax as bearcat so we guess thats his official moniker young bearcat had  professional boxing matches undefeated he was  when he started and the promoter arranged to give him  a week training expenses whenever he did have a fight they would deduct the  with the result that he would wind up still in the red after a while he found himself in great condition always a winner but a wreck financially one day the promoter asked if he knew anything about wrestling he admitted that he had wrestled some in school and was thereupon invited to work out in the gym with some wrestlers finally the promoter got him a few bookings in the hope that he would make enough money to be satisfied with his boxing matches but the hope boomeranged the first wrestling match i had i got  for myself bearcat remembers nobody to cut in no one to pay no training expenses do you blame me for ditching boxing for fulltime wrestling although he has done well as a single the fans like to see what are called tagteam matches in which two men on one side alternate when tagged by each other with wrestling one of two men on the other side for the past two years bearcat has been partnered with sweet daddy siki who rates nearly as highly with the fans as bearcat does he is even on the big wrestling calendar for  that is sold by the capitol wrestling arena which is top rating in any wrestlers language i got my ring name in an odd way sweet daddy remembers in  i was in montreal canada the second time i was there a girl in the audience kept shouting sweet daddy sweet daddy the next week i found she had spotted her friends throughout the audience shouting the same thing a few nights later i got into the ring and was turned around looking at the crowd when i heard the announcer say in this corner weighing  pounds sweet daddy siki  he was stunned but he liked it and has used it ever since his real first name now dont scream is reggie since bearcat and sweet daddy teamed up even when theyre singles promoters try to have them on the same card youll find this happening very frequently that the same two wrestlers will travel together and appear on the same card  usually one is the wrestler responsible for making travel and hotel arrangements and getting both of them to the arena on time a kind of buddy arrangement that pays off in fewer disappointments and nonappearances for the promoter bearcat and sweet daddy are unique in their styles of wrestling both of them like to butt their opponents on the head with their own heads  in addition to which bearcat has a shouldershuffling and musclelimbering routine that is comic to watch but effective as a stumper for an opponent trying to grab him bearcat says he is a member of a group of people descended from africans who are built much like himself they are all very lean very tall he is  weighs  and quite agile one sports writer put it that bearcat has the strength of a bear and the agility of a cat which certainly fits in with his name when asked if wrestling is phony bearcat and sweet daddy have different answers to prove it isnt if its so phony how come professional football playerswho only make tops  a year and certainly have the build  how come they dont give up that pennyante stuff and join us asks sweet daddy because they know darned well its a rough tough business wrestling is and no holds pulled i get sick and tired of having people say wrestlings a fake bearcat growls youve certainly seen plenty of football games did you ever call them fake just because a halfdozen of those big linemen who weigh nearly  pounds each jump on a small guy carrying the ball and a few minutes later he gets up seldom the worse for wear and makes a touchdown nobody ever calls that suspicious so why do they say anything is wrong with wrestling we get hurtas you know but we dont publicize it we do that so the public wont be afraid to come to our matches so they wont be afraid of the gore seldom are we damaged to the point of bleeding since we are supposed to use only the flat of the palm to strike the face but the twistings the dropkicks the backbreakers the stepovertoeholds all of these can inflict bad damage and often do if you get a wrestler who just wants to win and doesnt care how he does it people forget when they say we pull punches that wrestlers perspire did you ever try to hold on to a slimy wet smooth surface a blow can slide off that way too but the occasional ringsider who is looking to find something wrong will say phonyfake they should be as honest as we are thats all i can say although bearcat and sweet daddy are still comparatively new to the big money they arent complaining in wrestling you start in the small time hitting the small circuits with the smaller arenas and you receive only a percentage of the gate the more your following grows the bigger the gate the bigger your cut when bearcat had his first match with buddy rogers at comiskey park chicago in  it was a  gatethe first one at that price for rogers either to date however nobody has beaten antonino roccas many gateswelling matches but theyre all trying so far  has been bearcats best year financially when he made about  for  he expects it to be about  less because he couldnt refuse the demand for him to return to some of the smaller arenas where he made his start sweet daddys take in  was  and this year he expects it to be about the same bearcat and sweet daddy wrestle five and six nights a week and travel so much they might be on the west coast one night in chicago another night or canada or florida what they really like is music but what a difference in tastes bearcat likes jazz and classics sweet daddy goes for rock and roll calypso pops and some jazz in fact he has a record of his own out that he sings rock and roll shimmy shimmy partner bearcat is quite a food addict too he has a set of gourmet cook books and loves to fuss around the stove as well as to eat but he refuses to eat anything fattening he likes good lean meat but fancies vegetables so much that at this writing he is seriously thinking of becoming a vegetarian he also studies yoga they no longer have time for gymnastics sweet daddy eats anything as long as it is food he admits they never eat after two in the afternoon on the day of a match and they never eat before going to sleep saying its the worst thing in the world to do for a hobby other than music bearcat has some pacing horses race horses in a sulky he owns some in batavia new york with a little farm there and hopes eventually to take off wrestling during a racing season so he can race his own horses sweet daddy goes in for fancy cars he had a  sl mercedes benz grey but bearcat made him get rid of it because it only seats two one night they had a friend along and no place to put her so bearcat had to ride in the trunk that was that now sweet daddy has a caddie convertible so bearcats head doesnt hit the roof sweet daddy also has a runabout an isetta with the opening in the front in  bearcat picked up a new hobby all his life he had wanted to fly an airplane when he left the new york area a year ago he decided here is my chance and bought himself a  place singleengine cessna and learned to fly it afterwards he occasionally takes it for a short hop to another town but refuses to solo at night sweet daddy just refuses to fly anything but a jet or wont  even go jet if he can go on train within a reasonable time bearcat and sweet daddy think a wrestlers life is the only life for them they point out that all matches end in the ring as they dont believe in wasting their energies fighting without pay anywhere else bearcat also asks people to consider the difference between boxers and wrestlers have you ever wondered about the fact that boxers go around having a high old time for weeks or months between bouts then take a scant five or six weeks to get in trim while wrestlers have so many matches so many nights a week that theyre forced to keep in condition all the time does that sound like trickery if its the kind of sport where youre told what to do why bother keeping in condition bearcats other favorite subject is prejudice talking about that understand there is prejudice everywhere in the world i am not speaking as a minority member i am speaking as a world viewer i see one race hating another one religion talking against another i dont see any reasonoutside the ringfor hating anyone in fact they opened up a new way of living for my people when they opened credit myself if theres anything im not its prejudiced when i see people i dont see colors or denominationsi only see humans    wrestling has become a new way of life to many negroes who are also becoming stars in the field tagging behind bearcat and sweet daddy in the listings of top negro wrestlers and the areas they work out of are bobo brazil who works out of indianapolis and is one of the best sailor art thomas who has become quite popular in the east luther lenzie who usually stays around oregon and california dory dixon who is from jamaica but works out of texas shag thomas also out of texas and rick waldo who usually stays in the foreign areas such as australia japan new zealand and sao paulo sweet daddy originally came from jamaica too but lived so long in los angeles that hes practically forgotten his beginnings one thing that no negro in wrestling can overlook when people forget the color of their skins the only other color they can see is the greenbacks that come in the gates of the arenas where they appear 
the bugle blows for good jelly
the other day the local  hr  ce raided a negro arbecue and beer joint   nd arrested nine peo«wiirwpje raj  j anj arrests came as something of a shock to the owner i dont know lt why theyre bothering me said henry good jelly jones restaurateur bootlegger and politician it aint election time but bother him they did and because good jelly or just jelly to his friends is something of a local celebrity these days there was a sizable press section on hand for his trial the reporters were not disappointed good jellys wife when asked whether a gallon jug was the same jug found during the raid  answered i dont know jugs dont have no names later the white prosecuting attorney asked her why she found it so easy to answer defense questions and so hard to understand his mr city attorney said robert lilliard her negro attorney shes a little confused by all your highclass words you just talk like we talk down at good jellys and well be all right highclass words snorted the city attorney whats so highclass about the words white corn the case came out as everyone knew it would the charges against good jelly and his friends were dismissed for if good jelly has a striking ability to get into trouble he has an even more remarkable ability to get out of it fifteen times he has been called before the bar of justice in recent years fourteen times he has been set free the explanation of this enviable batting average lies deep in the structure of southern politics the negros role in it and the specific power structure of nashville henry jones with his golfers cap big flashing smile and long police record is a power he is among the last of the ward heelers very simply he controls the votes of a large number of unbelievably poor people and for a minimum of service protection and financial reward he delivers these same votes without the slightest concern for ideology in nashville he is the negro whom many negroes like least to think about he is the negro whom many whites like most to think about in his own blunt word he is a nigger what is worse that is all he wants to be respectable negro society shuns him yet to some of the negro poor he is perhaps the only truly big man in their lives good jelly first became interested in politics at an early age because he was an uneducated negro there were distinct limitations to the ambitions he might reasonably entertain and yet many people who govern his city and who dedicate schools and other buildings in the highest of ideals are perfectly willing to deal with him call him a backdoor negro said one white leader they wont have their picture taken with him  and they wont pose with him even at negro functions but they know how to get hold of him when a white man once complained about jellys police record and about his bootlegging and the fact that he has many friends among politicians a negro answered thats the way you people really want him it is hardly surprising then that the complexities of playing the system at both ends have produced two jellies they are separate but equal jellies there is a jelly for whites and a jelly for negroes the whites jelly is an ingratiating uncle tom laughing smiling hiding from any slightly serious question or threat behind the big smile and a joke in which old jelly is always the butt the negroes jelly is something different he is kind he has clothed many of his people housed more and fed them all if he calls one and gives him the key to the big black cadillac and says its time to move the caddy the man is honored by the assignment if he calls eight of them together and says that the newspaper wants their picture and that he jelly approves of the idea then a picture of eight smiling faces is taken if he tells them to vote this way or that they vote this way or that i carry a lot of weight around here jelly admits  bout half the people in this precinct i control two hundred three hundred people theyre my people good jelly is a dark stocky man of about fifty whose use of minstrelshow techniques in front of whites is a legitimate heritage as a young man he left his nashville home and joined the cast of the mandy green from new orleans minstrel show the poor mans version of the famous silas green show for mandy green he traveled the south as what he calls one of those blackface comedians and i was pretty good then he returned to nashville where he became associated with the then ruling negro ward heeler pie hardison i was pies chauffeur he thought i was a pretty good fellow and i was a good driver and a good talker and so he got me into politics one time pie said i ought to be in there pitching for the mayor and i said if you want the mayor then im pitching one hundred per cent and so i got him the votes pie hardison is gone now and his heir does his pitching from a small hut off a dark alley deep in the negro slums in a small halfmasonry halfwooden cafe he cooks bootlegs and politicks there is one small sign over the doorit is upside downand it says best jelly says this is not the name of the cafe that the name is jones barbecue it is a small cafe and there are no menus only signs on the walls at one end of the cafe white beans cost twentyfive cents at the  other they cost twentyone cents there with regular violations of local whiskey laws we have some whiskey but we dont have no beer we have to send out for the beer he operates his machine the restaurant is essential to his success as a politician for good jellys machine has been described by one reporter as the lame the sick the poor and a few of the penniless good jelly himself says down in this part folks dont have but a little money and so they come over here when they have a little and we feed them and they come over here when they dont have any money and we still feed them i dont turn them down i always feed them and i get them a place to sleep most times right here and get them to a hospital and even a job sometimes they get what i got these folks and they dont forget if the voters dont forget neither does good jelly he keeps a thorough file on each of his debtors name favors granted addressor frequently the address of someone who will know where to find the debtor before election day good jelly will make sure all his friends are registered he will also send out cards reminding them of their civic responsibility come election day and good jelly takes out his big cadillac and herds his people to the polls he likes to start early it gives him more time later in the day for rounding up slackers ill tell you why good jelly has got so many friends said robert lilliard the negro attorney who is also a city councilman a lot of these politicians just like him you can really count on jelly if hes for you why you can check his precinct the next day and his votes will be there if you treated him right good jelly himself says that he asks little for his interest in politics im for any man thats a good man he is fond of saying how does he tell whos a good man i read about this man see and i can tell if hes for me i want to know all the issues is that all what issues a lot of these men they want to be politicians and so they come and see jelly and i see how friendly they are and theyre pretty friendly theyre good men we talk about these issues all of these issues he repeated emphatically im for any man thats a good man other interpretations of good jellys political motivations have been offered from time to time id say he gets an average of about  for an election one white politician told me it depends on a close local election with a lot at stake i expect hes gotten  or more maybe a thousand how much money did you get for the sheriffs race i asked him pointblank money money i wouldnt do none of that he said the man he come down here and he was a good man and he said how he wanted to do right   it is not without a touch of regret that many white politicians worried by the new power of the sitin leaders and the young negro ministers foresee the demise of good jelly and his kind you make the deal with jelly one politician said and thats it you dont have to worry about him coming downtown with a bunch of his damn people and sitting down at some nice restaurant or calling the damn newspapers and announcing hes going to picket some company for better jobs jellys all right take care of him on the drunk and disorderly and that kind of thing and thats it he comes through i asked we take care of him and he takes care of us the man answered it was of course inevitable given a oneparty electorate in which factions outweigh issues in local elections that more than one faction would sooner or later make demands on good jellys talents thus for the past two years he has been caught right in the middle of the factional fight between the forces of the mayor and the forces of the city judge who might one day like to run for mayor in the past good jelly usually swung with the judge but as a student of local politics you never know who will be your next ally and similarly your next enemy he steadfastly refuses to burn his bridges i been a deeply strong supporter of the mayor im not mad at him he knows ol good jelly similarly as a student of the science of local law enforcement good jelly is hesitant about turning on the police the police he says they see im a pretty good fella and like im trying to do the right thing and theyre all right i like the police a showdown between the two factions came during last years election for sheriff the mayors forces favored the incumbent the other forces including the city judge favored his opponent police and sheriffs deputies swarmed over good jellys cafe all week long several times jelly was threatened with arrest he placed signs for the incumbent in his cafe but the policemen couldnt watch everywhere while they sat and talked with good jelly in the front of the cafe mrs good jelly slipped out the back and voted the jelly machine for the opponent who carried that precinct five to one jellys lack of concern about civil_rights galls many young negroes in nashville if john kasper were running against thurgood marshall and it was a local race and the right people went to see jelly for kasper thats all it would take said one negro bitterly jelly himself has said my folks theyre not the integration type theyre not interested in all that all they want is a little food attorney robert lilliard has explained jellys continuing popularity in just about the same terms those folks they arent going to eat at woolworths or grants or anything like that but they got to eat jellys the only thing those people have and he looks mighty good to them but even lilliard concedes that sooner or later other political leaders will supplant good jelly jones and his kind among the negroes you take this city growing all the time and the city limits going out and the negro making a little more money all the timea thing like jelly got its getting to be less and less important all the time five ten years from now there probably wont be any good jelly pretty soon both sides too busy worrying about this middleclass vote to pay for jelly thats where the next battle will be 
a girl with guts
ive told noisy night club patrons to shut the heck up  nina simone readily admits and there have been times when i walked off the stage in the middle of a concert because the audience was discourteous the sensational songstress who is a bundle of talentand of temper and temperament say her criticshas long conducted a personal vendetta against boisterous night club and concert customers this earned her the dubious honor  of being the bad girl of show business but ninas unorthodox crusade ultimately paid off today she can look back on the days when my conduct wasnt too hot with a wry sense of humor it got to the point she smiles where people would come out just to see what id do next then early last spring something occurred that forced her detractors to revamp their uncomplimentary estimates of her onstage conduct two performers one a young pop singer the other an opera starwere involved in  widely separated incidents that made headlines and proved to nina that she was not fighting a lonely battle the historic event was headlined in variety the bible of show business patronperformer tensions anew as mathis nina simone walk out the article noted that performers are demanding more respect from audiences and will take active steps to get it on march th backed by a trio of musicians nina opened at the roundtable a club on manhattans swanky east side when the group appeared on stage the patrons were busy dining as the first number was announced the clatter of dishes the clink of glasses the laughter and chatter barely halted then the noise continued unabated nina gave the downbeat and began to play but she did not sing for the second number she again played an instrumental and for the third and fourth between numbers nina resorted to her own personal method of heckling the hecklers she tossed acid comments at the audience she sang snatches of her hit song porgy changing the lyrics to chide the noisy audience for two more nights this continued then by mutual agreement between nina and the club management the twoweek engagement was cut short looking back on the incident nina feels she handled that particular audience with kid gloves there was a time she says when i would have walked out without saying a word what made this incident memorable was the fact that on the very same night down in san juan puerto rico johnny mathis stalked off the stage of the club tropicoro rattled by uncalled for remarks from the audience johnny performed for a scant fifteen minutes before turning his back on the hecklers and cancelling his twoweek engagement it so happened that a few days later in hopkinsville ky opera star rise stevens was forced to interrupt her concert to shush a couple of giggling schoolgirls there were also a number of persons in the audience who were listening to a local basketball game over transistor radios to some show business veterans these events were proof positive that todays entertainers are no respecters of the timehonored tradition the show must go on but to nina they were vindication of the long lonely and so often unappreciated fight she was conducting but she disclaims credit for being the originator of this technique for squelching hecklers i dont know who should get credit for being first to insist that performers are not just court jesters but are due some respect for years charlie mingus was called all sorts of names was accused of being hateful and of  always pitching one but all he wanted was to be heard miles davis thelonious monk and several others have reputations for not hesitating to make clear their contempt for unruly audiences nina simones deepfelt desire to be heard with the respect due an artist goes back to her childhood in tryon n c where she was born eunice waymon some  years ago her mother was an ordained methodist minister and it was at the local church where she conducted services that ninas musical genius first received public acclaim at the age of four the tiny prodigy was picking out tunes on the piano and at seven she became organist of her mothers church as well as a member of the choir i studied classical music for fourteen years nina explains and i was taught at an early age to respect an artist in any field when someone is rehearsing there must be no interruption at a concert hall one must be neatly dressed and observe proper decorum i grew up assuming that anyone acquainted with the social graces would be aware of these basic elements of good conduct thats why i could never get over the shock of coming face to face with badly behaved audiences my idols were marian anderson alexander boleslawski and horowitz one would never think of being rude when one of these artists is performing and while all  entertainers may not be considered artists they should be accorded the same respect this insists nina simone is the reason behind her oftcriticized onstage conduct thats all i ever wantedrespect i would actually feel degraded each time i had to scold an audience i didnt get a kick out of it no matter what people say with a rueful smile nina admits sometimes i got results other than what i wanted but gradually audiences began to catch on once at roberts show lounge in chicago i told off a noisy couple in the audience then the next time they created a disturbance i did only threetnumbersbut in such a way that the rest of the audience got the message i was angry i walked off without saying a word well utter confusion followed then i heard applause and people calling for me to come back when i did i didnt say a word just picked up where id left off even more graphic proof that her unique method of handling hecklers had the backing of a growing number of persons came last summer at the huge jazz festival at madison square garden sponsored by the new york daily news by this time nina recalls i had a reputation for being too demanding too outstanding hard to get along with when i went on stage and began someone yelled down from the balcony it was a smart remark something about not being able to hear me oddly i didnt get angry or upset i just said into the microphone you up there in the darkcome out in the light and repeat that well that broke the audience up they were immediately on my side for once i got more positive than negative reaction to what i was trying to do the next day in the daily news there was an article praising me nina admits that although conditions are better now and the public has rallied to her cause she previously was put on the carpet by club owners columnists even close associates but as she shrewdly observes everybody loves a winner nina is accustomed to fighting against odds she has had only one hit in the popular sense recordi loves you porgy for colpixbecause she refuses to compromise her art and go commercial ive lost money because of my stand but i cant help it interestingly enough nina simones earning potential has skyrocketed although her work schedule is greatly curtailed a polio scare early in  brought the sharp realization that there was more to life than making money fortunately ninas ailment was later diagnosed as something other than polio but during her brief hospitalization she had time to think to reexamine her values even though she can command fees of  a week for as often and as long as she cares to work nina decided to work only two weeks out of a month appearing only in night clubs of her choosing making records and filling concert engagements she lives a comfortable relaxed existence in her large apartment  floors above central park west overlooking central park and at this point in her career is very pleased with the way i feel inside she has her eye on a future career in films and with good reason currently featured in columbia pictures notorious landlady starring kim novak and jack lemmon nina was highly impressed by the fact that for three minutes work in the picture she was paid as much as she would earn in a week in some other medium although she insists that her recently won battle against night club hecklers was on behalf of all performers and had nothing to do with the race question nina has some very definite ideas about the stirrings of national pride in africa asia and in this country as well my only regret she says is that there arent more negro artists more negroes in all fieldswho have the courage to stand up and speak out on this race issuethe things they dont like the things they do like we need more such as those kids in the south thank god for them 
the failure of the negro intellectual
during the past forty years the relations of negroes to american society have undermsrvrvsm gone funj amental changes the tempo of these changes has been accelerated during the past two decades the changes in the relationships of negroes to american society have been the result of changes in the economic and social organization of american life which have in turn had their repercussions upon the negro community and its institutions as a result of the changes in the character of the negro community all the platitudes and cliches about negroes and race relations have lost their meaning and relevance the changes in the negro community and american society have reached a stage where we are beginning to see in rather clear outlines the real problem of negroes in american society there can be no question at the present time that the negro must be integrated into the american community but the integration of the negro into the economic and social organization of american life is only an initial stage in the solution of some of the problems of the negro there still remains the problem of the assimilation of the negro which is a more important and more fundamental problem it is with this second problem that i am primarily concerned but in order to clarify the issue it will be necessary to make clear the distinction between integration and assimilation    it is relevant at this point to say something concerning integration and the negro community  in the generally accepted meaning of the term integration involves the acceptance of negroes as individuals into the economic and social organization of american life this would imply the gradual dissolution of the negro community that is the decline and eventual disappearance of the associations institutions and other forms of associated life in what constitutes the negro community we do not expect anything approaching this to occur in our life time moreover any discerning person will be aware of the fact that certain aspects of the organized aspects of negro community life will be affected sooner and more fundamentally than other aspects for example negroes have always been forced to depend upon the ecomonic institutions in the american community for employment and a living despite the vain hopes that negroes have had concerning negro business as a means to economic salvation and independence the integration of negroes into the industry and as white collar workers into the manufacturing and commercial institutions of the country has increased the economic welfare of negroes and provided them with more business experience than all the socalled negro business enterprises in the country on the other hand there are certain cultural institutions such as the church and the fraternal organizations that will not dissolve or disappear however it has already appeared that in those sections of the country where newspapers carry news about negroes as normal human beings and negro reporters are employed the circulation of negro newspapers is declining i mention these facts concerning the negro community because it is necessary to emphasize the fact that integration involves more than individuals but the organized life of the negro community visavis the organized white community    how does integration differ from assimilation assimilation involves of course integration for it is difficult to see how any people or group can become assimilated without being integrated into the economic and social organization of a country but assimilation involves integration into the most intimate phases of the organized social life of a country as a consequence assimilation leads to complete identification with the people and culture of the community in which the social heritages of different people become merged or fused in  charles francis adams stated in a lecture in richmond that the theory of the complete assimilation and absorption of all peoples because of the absence of fundamental racial differences had broken down in the case of the negro the negro according to adams could only be partially assimilated or in our language integrated but not assimilated when he spoke of absorption he was evidently referring to amalgamation in recent years there has been much talk about the integration of the negro but hardly any attention has been given to his assimilation there have been some wild guesses about the amalgamation or absorption of the negro and his disappearance in  to  years it is to the question of the assimilation of the negro that i want to devote the remainder of this talk it may seem strange if i tell you that the question of integration and assimilation of the american negro has not been considered or raised  by american negroes but by african intellectuals only recently at a luncheon in washington an african intellectual spoke on the subject and afterwards asked me to write an article on the subject but the contrast between the attitude and orientation of american negro intellectuals and african intellectuals was revealed most sharply at the congresses of negro writers held in paris in  and in rome in  at these congresses the african and i might add the west indian intellectuals were deeply concerned with the question of human culture and personality and the impact of western civilization on the traditional culture of negro peoples it was to be expected that african intellectuals would be concerned with such questions but the amazing thing was that american negro intellectuals who were imbued with an integrationist point of view were not only unconcerned with this question but seemingly were unconscious of the implications of the important question of the relation of culture and personality and human destiny i insist that these are the fundamental questions with which all thinkers should be concerned and that it is unfortunate that americans have not concerned themselves with these questions the lack of interest in this important question or lack of understanding of it is responsible for much of the confusion in regard to integration which is changing the entire relationship of the negro to american society as far as i have been able to discover what negro intellectuals have had to say concerning integration has been concerned with the superficial aspects of the increasing participation of negroes in the economic and social and political organization of american society practically no attention has been directed to the rather obvious fact that integration involves the interaction of the organized social life of the negro community with the wider american community moreover there has been an implied or unconscious assimilationist philosophy holding that negroes should enter the mainstream of american life as rapidly as possible leaving behind their social heritage and becoming invisible as soon as possible this has been due i think to the emergence of a sizeable new middle class whose social background and interests have determined the entire intellectual orientation of educated negroes in my black bourgeoisie i have considered this phenomenon and it is unnecessary to go into the question here there are certain phases of this phenomenon which are relevant to this discussion the first aspect is that the new negro middle class is the stratum of the negro population that is becoming integrated most rapidly because of its education and its ability to maintain certain standards of living in its hope to achieve acceptance in american life it would slough off everything that is reminiscent of its negro origin and its negro folk background at the same time integration is resulting in inner conflicts and frustrations because negroes are still outsiders in american life despite integration the middle class in escaping from its sheltered and privileged position in the negro community has became more exposed to the contempt and discriminations of the white world thus the new negro middle class is confronted with the problems of assimilation and their intellectuals have not provided them with an understanding of the problems this lack of understanding on the part of the socalled intellectual fringe of the new middle class is due partly to the general antiintellectualism of this class and partly to the desire to achieve acceptance in american life by conformity to the ideals values and patterns of behavior of white americans this is no speculation on my part every study that has been made reveals that they think very much the same as white americans even concerning negroes moreover socalled negro intellectuals continue to repeat such nonsense as no race has made as much progress as the american negro in the same period and that his remarkable progress has been due to oppression yet anyone knows that after  years american negro intellectuals can not measure up to african intellectuals it was the white scholar buell gallagher in his book color and conscience who showed clearly that negroes in every part of the world where they enjoyed freedom had achieved more intellectually and artistically than the american negro all of this drive towards conformity to dominant beliefs and values is implicit or unconscious striving of the middle classes to become assimilated the great difference between the orientation of the african intellectual and the american negro intellectual is striking when one considers their starting point in their analysis of the position of the people for whom they are supposed to provide intellectual leadership all african intellectuals begin with the fact of the colonial experience of the african they possess a profound understanding of the colonial experience and its obvious effects upon not only their traditional social organization but the less obvious and more profound effects upon the culture and the african personality the american negro intellectual goes his merry way discussing such matters as the superficial aspects of the material standard of living among negroes and the extent to which they enjoy civil_rights he never begins with the fundamental fact of what slavery has done to the negro or the group which is called negroes in the united states  yet it is as necessary for the american negro intellectual to deal with these questions as it is for the african intellectual to begin with the colonial experience the american negro intellectual is even more remiss in his grasp of the condition and fate of american negroes he has steadily refused to recognize what has been called the mark of oppression it was the work of two white scholars that first called attention to this fundamental aspect of the personality of the american negro moreover it was the work of another white scholar stanley m elkins in his recent book on slavery who has shown the psychic trauma that negroes suffered when they were enslaved the pulverization of their social life through the destruction of their clan organization and annihilation of their personality through the destruction of their cultural heritage sometimes i think that the failure of the american negro intellectual to grasp the nature and the significance of these experiences is due to the fact that he continues to be an unconscious victim of these experiences after an african intellectual met a group of negro intellectuals he told me that they were really men who were asleep all of this only tends to underline the fact that educated negroes or negro intellectuals have failed to achieve any intellectual freedom in fact with the few exceptions of literary men it appears that the ne intellectual is unconscious of the extent to which his thinking is restricted to sterile repetition of the safe and conventional ideas current in american society this is attributable in part of course to the conditions under which an educated and intellectual class emerged in the american society this class emerged as the result of white american philanthropy although the situation has changed and the negro intellectuals are supported through other means they are still largely dependent upon the white community there is no basis of economic support for them within the negro community and where there is economic support within the negro community it demands conformity to conservative and conventional ideas witness for example the vote of the national medical association in new york city against placing medical care for the aged under social security the action of this group might be attributable partly to ignorance and what they conceived to be their economic interests nevertheless it was done under the domination of the american medical association which ignored the whining complaints of negro doctors against racial discrimination i could cite other examples which more clearly represent the absence of intellectual freedom in regard to national and international issues most negro intellectuals simply repeat the propaganda which is put out by people who have large economic and political interests to protect of course negro intellectuals are in a different position from the standpoint of employment if they show any independence in their thinking they may be hounded by the fbi and find it difficult to make a living at the present time many of them find themselves in the humiliating position of running around the world telling africans and others how welloff negroes are in the united states and how well they are treated one is reminded of the words of langston hughes in his recent book ask your mama where he says that the african visitor finds that in the american social supermarket blacks for sale range from intellectuals to entertainers thus it appears that the price of the slow integration which the negroes are experiencing must be bought at the price of abject conformity in thinking one of the most important results of the lack of freedom on the part of negro intellectuals has been their failure to produce men of high intellectual stature who are respected by the world at large we have no philosophers or thinkers who command the respect of the intellectual community at large i am not talking about the few teachers of philosophy who have read hegel or kant or james and memorized their thoughts i am talking about men who have reflected upon the fundamental problems which have always concerned philosophers such as the nature of human knowledge and the meaning or lack of meaning of human existence we have no philosophers who have dealt with these and other problems from the standpoint of the negros unique experience in this world i am not talking about the puerile opportunistic rationalizations of the negros effort to survive in a hostile world the philosophy implicit in the negros folklore is infinitely superior to the opportunistic philosophy of negro intellectuals who want to save their jobs and enjoy material comforts the philosophy implicit in the folklore of the negro folk is infinitely superior in wisdom and intellectual candor to the empty repetition of platitudes concerning brotherly love and human dignity of negro intellectuals who are tyrants within the negro world and never had a thought in their lives this brings me to say something of what negro intellectuals or scholars have failed to accomplish as the intellectual leaders of negroes they have failed to study the problems of negro life in america in a manner which would place the fate of the negro in the broad framework of mans experience in this world they have engaged in petty defenses of the negros social failures but more often they have been so imbued with the prospect of integration and eventual assimi lation that they have thought that they could prove themselves true americans by not studying the negro since integration has become the official policy of the country they have shunned more than ever the study of the negro they have remained intellectually sterile while propounding such meaningless questions as should negro scholars study the negro should negro painters paint negro subjects should negro writers and playwrights write negro novels and plays about negroes this is indicative of the confusion among negro intellectuals but more important still it has meant that negro intellectuals have cut themselves off from a vastly rich source of human experience to which they had access it is scarcely believable that the only significant studies of negroes in politics have been the work of white scholars i have already mentioned other fields of interest in which scholars have made significant contributions of course some of this failure has been the result of ignorant administration of negro schools which have refused the intelligent proposals of negro scholars let us take the case of conants book slums and suburbs which deals with the tragic position of negroes in america as long as  years ago i pointed out that urbanization had changed the entire relationship of negroes to american society and that comprehensive and fundamental research should be done on negroes in cities but those negroes who have controlled the destiny of negro intellectuals ignored this and even today no negro college or university is concerned with this fundamental problem conants book which reveals the poverty ignorance and social disorganization of negroes emphasizes a phase of the integration and assimilation of negroes to which i have only vaguely referred it deserves special attention in what i am undertaking to discuss not only has conant devoted attention to the position of negroes in slums but i have noted that ashmore has published a book dealing with this problem and the frustrations of the negro middle class the significance of the large proportion of unemployed impoverished and socially and personally disorganized negroes in cities for our discussion can not be overemphasized it shows clearly that whereas a relatively large middle class is emerging in our cities at the same time a large degraded proletariat is also appearing it reveals the wide economic and social cleavage which is becoming more manifest between the middle class and the masses of negroes these negroes have little education practically no skills and what is more they have never known a normal family life because of their lack of socialization they can hardly take advantage of the educational institutions they are unprepared for employment in an industrial society and they are unfit for normal social life conant is afraid that they will become susceptible to communist propaganda but he does not know negroes if they were to become communist their lives would be organized about objectives and goals which would have some stabilizing influence   but most of these negroes will become the victims of liquor dope and disease and they will engage in all forms of crime and antisocial behavior those who seek an escape from their frustration and bewilderment will not join communist movements they will join all types of religious sects and cults some of which will have nationalistic or racial aims in fact the growth of the black muslim movement represents disillusionment on the part of negroes concerning integration and a repudiation of the belief in assimilation which is so dear to the middle classes recently we have been hearing about the revolt against the leaders of the negro the most significant sympton of this revolt has been the revolt of negro youth against the old respectable and conventional leadership which acted as mediators between the negro community and the white community the most dramatic aspect of the revolt has been the sitin movements which are a direct attack upon segregation the aim is in tegration and utimately assimilation if i gage correctly the aims of the leaders this seems to emphasize the failure of negro intellectuals they can only see assimilation beyond integration but there are problems of american life that negroes will have to meet in becoming integrated and assimilated and they concern the economic and social organization of american life i pointed out at the beginning that whatever change had occurred in the status of negroes was due to changes in the economic and social organization of american life american negro intellectuals seem to be unconscious of this fact and seemingly believe that integration and ultimate assimilation will solve the problems of the negro it is very important for our discussion on integration and assimilation that the leaders of the nonviolence technique have gone to india for philosophical and ideological justification of their revolt against segregation and discrimination in american society that the technique should be nonviolent is natural since negroes who are outnumbered by whites and threatened by the armed might of whites could not resort to violence or revolutionary tactics i do not think that it represents any moral superiority on their part moreover i do not think that gandhism is really applicable to the negros situation in the united states nevertheless i recognize that it achieves a certain moral respect ability because of its religious basis this is especially important where negroes confront the guiltridden respectable white middle classes in analyzing the movement and in seeking its religious and moral inspiration we should recognize that it has its roots in the religious experiences and culture of the negro folk the leaders may speak in philosophical and ideological terms that are drawn from an alien culture but the dynamics of the movement are to be found in the religious experiences of the negroes when negroes are forced to face hostile white mobs they do not sing indian hymns they sing negro spirituals and the hymns of their fathers which embodied the faith of their fathers in a hostile world that the negro leaders should turn to an alien culture for the philosophical and ideological justification of their revolt shows the extent to which negro intellectuals are alienated from the masses it is also an indication of the failure of the intellectual leaders to perform their role in relation to the negro they have failed to dig down into the experiences of the negro and provide the soul of a people with exceptions and i will name langston hughes as a conspicuous example they have tried to escape from the negro heritage it was their duty to put this heritage in history books in novels and in plays in painting and in sculpture because of their eagerness to be accepted as americans or perhaps sometimes because of their fear they have written no novels and plays about denmark vesey harriet tubman or schields green who went with john brown they have accepted supinely as heroes the negroes whom white people have given us and told us to revere even today they run from dubois and paul robeson in view of the negros history the negro intellectual and artist had a special opportunity and special responsibility the process by which the negroes were captured and enslaved in the united states stripped them of their african culture and destroyed their personality under the slavery regime and for nearly a century since emancipation everything in american society has stamped the negro as subhuman as a member of an inferior race that had not achieved even the first steps in civilization there is no parallel in human history where a people have been subjected to similar mutilation of body and soul even the christian religion was given them in a form only to degrade them the african intellectual recognizes what colonialism has done to the african and he sets as his first task the mental moral and spiritual rehabilitation of the african but the american negro intellectual seduced by dreams of final assimilation has never regarded this as his primary task i am aware that he has carried on all sorts of arguments in defense of the negro but they were mainly designed to protect his own status and soothe his hurt selfesteem i am talking about something entirely different i am referring to his failure to dig down into the experience of the negro and bring about a transvaluation of that experience so that the negro could have a new selfimage or new conception of himself it was the responsibility of the negro intellectual to provide a positive identification through history literature art music and the drama the truth of the matter is that for most negro intellectuals the integration of the negro means just the opposite the emptying of his life of meaningful content and ridding him of all negro identification for them integration and eventual assimilation means the annihilation of the negrophysically culturally and spiritually guy johnson has written recently that in the next  years there will be more integration but far less than the negro hopes for and as a consequence there will be much frustration moreover as park once wrote the negro will be treated as a racial minority rather than a racial caste i am inclined to agree on the whole with this prediction especially for the south but even in the north where negroes will achieve greater integration i can not envision any assimilation in the foreseeable future the best evidence of this is the manner in which the centennial of the civil war is being celebrated the important fact about the civil war is the emancipation of the negro and lincolns achievement of worldwide immortality as the emancipatornot as the savior of the union which was a local political event yet the nation has ignored and repudiated the central fact which is the most important element in the boosted moral idealism of the united states the negro is left out of the celebration both physically and as a part of the heritage of america the civil war is supposed to have been the result of a misunderstanding of twobrothers white brothers of course and the emancipation of the negro is forgotten confronted with this fact the negro intellectual should not be consumed by his frustrations he must rid himself of his obsession with assimilation he must come to realize that integration should not mean annihilationselfeffacement the escaping from his identification in a chapter entitled what can the american negro contribute to the social and economic life of africa in the book africa seen by american negroes i pointed out that the american negro had little to contribute to africa but that africa in achieving freedom would probably save the soul of the american negro in providing him with a new identification a new selfimage and a new sense of personal dignity i want to emphasize this by pointing out that if the negro is ever assimilated into american society his heritage should become a part of the american heritage and it should be recognized as the contribution of the negro as one recognizes the contributions of the english irish germans and other people but this can be achieved only if the negro intellectual and artist frees himself from his desire to conform and only if he overcomes his inferiority complex it may turn out that in the distant future negroes will disappear physically from american society if this is our fate let us disappear with dignity and let us leave a worthwhile memorialin science in

how marian anderson blessed my life
never have i been one to seek out celebrities somehow it didnt appeal to me to join a noisy milling throng secure an autograph or to shake the hand of a famous personagenever except once i still contemplate on the urging which propelled me backstage that night in milwaukee in  my husband was teaching in wauwatosa a suburb and our budget was tautly stretched of necessity fifty different ways so it was that when a neighbor approached me with a paid admission asking me to accompany her to marian andersons concert at the civic auditorium i was doubly thrilled thrilled because the love of music was an integral part of our lives and happy for this opportunity as we hadnt been able to afford many concerts but there was a stumblingblock to my acceptance which my husband duly pointed out some years earlier i had lost a child and had been advised i would probably never have another now i had become fruitful again and the doctor had circumscribed nearly every move i made prohibiting me from stairs from crowds from wearing heels and from becoming weary i desired this child with all my being but i also yearned passionately to hear this wonderful woman in person so to all my husbands arguments i promised to be careful careful it was a joy to be in a crowded hall again and observe the people streaming in from every direction there were both negroes and whites some from each group were garbed in glamorous evening attire others were dressed in casual street clothes while there were some who looked downright shabby i found myself thinking how marvelous and right it was that all these folk representing the entire ladder of financial standing and many walks of life should be congregating for this occasion i knew that there were some of our colored friends who probably came from the dilapidated coldwater tenements which are the blight of every metropolis this appearance of one  of their own would serve as a challenge for courage and the memory of this evening would linger with them as the afterglow of a brilliant sunset seen across barren plains i knew that there were whites present to whom this evening was just another event of the social season who would return to their exquisitelyappointed homes with no thought as to the farreaching implication of social equality presaged by this artists appearance i also knew that there were some like myself who loved beauty in any form be it wrapped in brown or in white covering    the lights were dimmed the usual hush descended over the entire assemblage the curtains parted to reveal a plain empty stage empty save for a little man seated at a grand piano and miss anderson herself standing tall still almost forbidding in her bearing her gown floor length was of winecolored velvet simply fashioned with long sleeves and modest decolletage welcoming applause thundered throughout the vast building and still the artist stood quietly almost statuelike there was no effort on her part to sell herself to the audience by the customary sweeping curtsies and sparkling smiles most performers employ only her somber eyes betrayed her interest as they swept over the sea of upturned faces and when the ovation finally died away she merely lowered her head in acknowledgment before signalling her accompanist to begin time stood still for me as she sang opening her mobile mouth to emit glorious warm rich tones and as the full purity of her voice reached out to embrace each person present one realized that this lady need not resort to stage mannerisms or gestures her gift was her lovely instrument which she gave unreservedly in a varied offering of classics german lieder and spirituals she herself was only the channel through which beauty flowed constant and moving encore followed encore until she finally sang schuberts ave maria the crowd attentive before now was spellbound with the silence so pronounced one could have heard a pin drop as the last note faded away a holy solemnity seemed to pervade the place i mopped my wet cheeks then glancing around saw tears on other faces both brown and white this group who moments before had been wildly cheering was suddenly on its knees gradually people arose until everyone was standing in silent tribute to this masterartist and then they began filing out as if from a place of worship my neighbor and i had reached a sideexit when i impulsively turned to her and said lone i must go backstage and tell miss anderson what inspiration and courage her singing has given me i must tell her do you mind she looked at me so very ponderous and awkward then at her watch well your husband did say not to be too late you know yes i know i know    but ive never felt so moved in my life it wont take too much longer i pleaded she smiled indulgently after all pregnant women often get extreme ideas all right ill go along she answered the line of greeters was longer than i had anticipated and i shifted my uncomfortable weight from one swollen foot to the other while my friend looked more and more disapproving but slowly we approached the great lady and i mulled in my mind the verbal bouquet i would present her when i finally stood before her no words came she was taller than i so that she gazed down on my tentshaped figure and her dark liquid eyes seemed to hold a composite of all the sadness and compassion in the world then her large strong hand grasped mine and all my flowery words slipped from mind any i heard myself murmuring brokenly ohmay god bless you onstage she had only offered fragments of smiles but now she suddenly flashed a wide one which lighted her entire face her reply remained with me like a benediction all through the next difficult days thank you he will be blessing you too before long and he did as two weeks later a lovely girlchild was born to us by rights this story is finished but an epilogue must be added in order to show how miss anderson not only inspired and encouraged me then but later gave me comfort nearly two years ago my mother was in our home slowly dying from cancer one sunday night marian anderson made a guest appearance on tv and i turned up the volume so her voice would reach mama in the bedroom l§sl when the warm rich voice began singing hes got the whole world in his hands i slipped to mamas door to see how she liked it i paused unobserved as i saw a thin bony hand upraised while i heard mama say with conviction and hes got me in his hands too the memory of that scene etched indelibly on my mind comforted me often after mama left us again marian anderson unknowingly had blessed my life
agony in angola
angola has been in a q  state of virtual civil k » war since march  gr  when heavy fighting between angolan nationalists and portuguese whites broke out in the northwest section ol that west africa colonythe prize possession of portugal for over  years in all some  whites and about  africans have been slaughtered an estimated  africans have fled to the neighboring congo for safety because of tight censorship control clamped on the press in angola and in lisbon by portugals premier antonio de oliveira salazar few dispatches concerning the angola trouble have been able to reach the outside world the onthespot reports that have found their way into american newspapers and magazines can to a large degree be credited to the zeal and forthrightness of protestant missionaries and african pastors and teachers who have suffered greatly at the hands of portuguese civilians and military angola with its  million africans and   whites is portugals cinderella colony  times larger than portugal herself under the harsh portuguese rule the exploited angolan africans have gained little economic advancement and few educational privileges there has been no political participation by the people either african or white the lot of the average african under portuguese rule has not changed substantially in  years the presence of the protestant church in angola has been one of the brighter spots in the existence of that nations africans for more than  years protestant missionaries have been at work there teaching in schools operating hospitals building modern villages raising crops and most of all spreading the gospel the missionaries have often been the only people angolans could turn to for counsel in angola missionaries and africans became close companions and worked and worshiped together few portuguese whites ever dreamed of such association with the africans thus when trouble broke out last february and march inevitably the protestant church was suspected of having supported the nationalist movement this suspicion grew when africans attacking whiteowned plantations and homes bypassed protestant stations the protestant church in angolaespecially that part of it supported by american methodists and british and canadian baptistshas suffered greatly at the hands of portuguese who have entered on something of an antiprotestant crusade    the methodist church has suffered considerably more than other denominations and churches work ing in angolawith all the damage done by portuguese whites who blame that church for much of what is happening the methodist board of missions in new york estimates that at least  of its african pastors have been killed either by portuguese civilians or by military forces some after hurried trials others without trial in half of the methodist area in angola the luanda area  african pastors and teachers reportedly are in prison have fled with their people or have been killed only  are accounted for and known to be in no immediate danger the church has lost one of its top district superintendentsguilherme pereira ingles who had developed and served one of the largest methodist districts in all of africa according to reports he was shot in the leg and taken to quibaxi for imprisonment after a hurried trial he was shot to death his body was loaded in a truck with others who had suffered a similar fate then dumped into the dange river armed white civilians have destroyed or seriously damaged many of the denominations churches schools and centers in the capital city of luanda seven schools and chapels and one social center with clinic kindergarten and nursery services were destroyed    last year bishop ralph e dodge toured methodist mission stations in angola as he did again recently alarmed at what he saw  on that first visit he warned that the portuguese were in serious trouble one paragraph of his report to his board in new york gave this graphic picture of angola before the revolt started there are few colored or african lawyers and doctors assimilados hold important posts in one or two government departments and thats all schooling is still left almost entirely to the missions on a voluntary basis the protestant church alone has educated more africans angolans than the government    russia is making propaganda broadcasts in portuguese and the voice of america is hardly heard because it comes at an hour when most africans are in bed    causing great concern is the seeming isolation of american consular officials they seem to be quite confident that nothing is going to happen to portuguese africa an attitude understandable when they have almost no contact with the african people
the outspokenness of the protestant churches in angola against the current abuses practiced in that west african nation by the salazar regime of portugal has surprised both friends and opponents here to fore the missionaries have suffered in silence with the people of angola all at once they have become vocal in bringing recent events in angola before the conscience of the civilized world for judgment indignation at the regime of antonio de oliveira salazar arises from four main sources brutal treatment of africans terrorist tactics and intimidation religious discrimination lack of forthrightness in official dealings let it be said that over the past  years a sizable reservoir of good will has been built up between most protestant leaders missionary and african and the local portuguese european population in fact close and lasting friendships have been formed no one can be fair and honest without acknowledging many excellent qualities in the portuguese people generosity hospitality lack of strong racial prejudices and so on few are the leaders of the protestant churches who have not benefited from these commendable qualities during their stay in portuguese africa individual portuguese citizens have gone out of their way to be friendly to a passing stranger and in remote areas have opened their modest homes at any hour to anyone in distress protestant leaders readily acknowledge their gratitude for innumerable kindnesses shown them by gracious portuguese colonists and officials it is this graciousness on the part of some of the portuguese which has until now kept the pressure of resentment from rising to the breaking point it should also be said that the protestants in angola do not condone violence perpetrated by africans any more than they do that perpetrated by the portuguese no matter how severe the provocation the truly christian position must be one of nonviolence the fact that in angola the provocation finally went beyond the africans endurance can be understood without any attempt at justification protestant church leaders there emphatically deny that they had any part in planning the bloody revolt or that sizable numbers of protestant christians participated in the massacres but that the brutal retaliation of white portuguese against all africans and especially against the educated protestants has evoked a fairly solid block of protestant opposition cannot be denied although angolas protestant churches have ministered to the spiritual needs of europeans as well as africans few europeans have affiliated themselves with protestant churches portugal being a predominantly roman catholic country has favored people of that faith for decades consequently most of the work done in angola by protestants has been among africans missionaries have grown to understand admire and trust the african people without being blind to certain weaknesses and the need for spiritual as well as intellectual economic and social development which the latter encouraged against protestant property the methodist mission in the center of luanda the capital city suffered a mob attack under police escort this was followed by others elsewhere in luanda and in other parts of north central angola many churches and schools were destroyed by white terrorists it is rumored that even the government now recognizes that it permitted mobs to go too far in destroying church property following the unfavorable american vote in the united nations but it was more than reaction against the american vote that triggered the vandalism for years portuguese plantation owners had resented protestant schools which they said brought about a reduction in the number of laborers resentment had been rising against the protestant educational program in which a limited number of africans were preparing for university training and an even smaller number were already studying in portugal and elsewhere the general wave of terrorism which followed the march revolt in the north provided an opportunity for the embittered europeans to get even with the protestants for limiting the supply of cheap labor through an effective if limited educational program after the mob violence by europeans the feeling rose among missionaries that if the police permitted such action in the capital city there was not much to be gained by continuing to remain silent thus the story of property damage so much less significant than the loss of life estimated at  africans and  whites was also presented for world judgment a third factor one which has long offended the protestant discrimination in portuguese africa protestant tax money along with that of other groups is used to subsidize the work of the roman catholic church protestant marriage and baptismal certificates have never been officially recognized thus protestants are forced either to deny their own faith in seeking a repetition of the ceremonies in the catholic church or to forego the needed documents the children of protestants married in evangelical churches are officially considered illegitimate the salazar government fails to recognize protestant churches as legal entities and usually refers to them as sects for the past quarter of a century the portuguese government has permitted few if any protestant missions to be established in angola whereas the program of expansion by the roman church has been facilitated to such an extent that protestant workers have had to take jobs constructing catholic churches in protestant communities in one portuguese territory no protestants can train as teachers because all teachertraining facilities have been turned over to the roman church and protestants are excluded from all such facilities a very illuminating new book protestantism in africa by professor jose julio goncalves concludes that while protestants should not be opposed openly they must not be encouraged or they would grow too rapidly therefore the only feasible way to handle the protestant problem is to discriminate against protestants and that is just what the salazar regime has done for years though it has laws proclaiming to the world that it endorses freedom it instructs its agents to interpret those laws so as to thwart the protestant witness the deviousness has been an offense against the protestant conscience which believes in dealing with all religious groups openly and on a basis of equality a fourth factor which has been hard for protestants to understand is the lack of forthrightness on the part of the salazar government in  one protestant missionary asked for permission to open a new mission although the matter was pursued in both luanda and lisbon no reply has yet been obtained lisbon laying the blame on luanda officials and vice versa a request from another missionary to establish residence in mozambiquecosting him more than  in fees for translating into portuguese all documents from birth certificates to university diplomashas after a wait of five years been neither granted nor refused  this lack of frankness is very hard for protestant missionaries to comprehend the portuguese have some laws which are among the best in the world but interpretation is left to the whims of petty officials who openly declare that they are the law interpretation of the laws varies not only from place to place but from day to day depending on individual officials mood and motivation thus it is that constant confusion prevails one official will give one interpretation and the next will give another in one instance a friendly official authorized a school to be built after the foundations were poured and all the materials purchased his successor refused to recognize that permission had been granted so for five years the material has stood beside the completed foundations waiting for a new and more amenable administratorin the hope that he will reverse the decision of his predecessor protestants who normally give and expect a straightforward reply are constantly frustrated by the referral technique and all the continual delays it is not the little frustrations however which have caused the protestant leaders to adopt a stiffening attitude toward the salazar government but the fact that the world should know what is happening to human beings living behind a jungle curtain
floridas first distinguished author
or many years when ¦jrj giving talks in florida £ p j i have pointed out that there is only one first w c i ass nativeborn florida author who has written any even small body of work about the state marjorie kinnan rawlings philip wylie and all the others were born elsewhere and adopted he florida scene the exception was zora neale hurston seldom on inquiry had any of the audiences ever heard of her or known any of her work at that point i revealed to the white southern audiences that zora was a negro as i announced this i looked around for the nearest exit i never had to use the exit and when i told this to zora she roared with laughter on february   at age  zora died in fort pierce florida in poverty and obscurity she is a prime example of the excellent american writer who in our smashhit or virtually nothing kind of literary civilization gets lost in the shuffle far more recognition should be given to such writers and i ask permission to give this to zora i regard her early books their eyes were watching god  jonahs gourd vine  and the florida parts of mules and men  depicting life in the turpentine camps to be in the top rung of american writing certainly as good as anything anyone has ever written about florida and take another look at those titles they are as exceptional as the wonderful imagery she possessed and gave to her readers as real as the hurricanefrom the viewpoint of the negrowhich she pictured among her people in the vegetable raising district around lake okeechobee zora not only could write but knew what she was writing about her autobiography dust tracks on a road  won an anisfield award for better race relationships she knew how to express herself the peak of her economic careerand it was mt everest rising from the plainwas the short period during which she worked as a writer at paramount in hollywood when i asked her what she thought of california she wrote back true to her native florida i like my land lying down how did this girl born without her permission in possession of a black skin in a backwoods florida town make a place for herself in the world her handicaps would seem to be almost insurmountable eatonville her birthplace is a remote community of a few hundred negro people in northcentral florida not far from orlando it is a place of dirt streets incredibly colorful negro cabins set beautifully beneath towering live oaks dripping with long beards of spanish moss it was the first incorporated negro town in the united states and one of the very few which is entirely negro zoras father was a baptist minister he was able to augment her primary education to such an extent that she was able to work her way through two years at howard  university in washington d c by serving as a maid then she won a scholarship for two more years at barnard college and became the second negro to be graduated from that school during this period she supported herself by being secretary to fannie hurst when she and miss hurst travelled and wanted to eat in restaurants from which negroes were barred miss hurst introduced zora with an air of great mystery and vast importance as the princess zora and there was never any difficulty it being assumed that zora must be royalty from the far east after barnard zora studied anthropology for three years working under dr franz boaz and for this work morgan college at howard conferred upon her the degree of littd she worked in the anthropological field off and on for most of her life her studies and reports  on voodoo in the united states and haiti are definitive on the subject and one of them when her research penetrated too far nearly got her killed meanwhile she also wrote on general subjects and her writings included novels to live during this usually penurious period she taught at north carolina college for negroes during these years she was also awarded two guggenheim fellowships and a rosenwald grant zora was rather short and squat and black as coal she didnt look and sound much like a doctor of literature but more as though she could do a good days washing she was filled with an effervescence for life seldom seen in the human race she had an abrupt explosive laugh that burst like a bomb she always had some new idea or project she enthused over some she actually carried out it was both exhilarating and tiring to be with her for she caught you up in her ideas to the point of exhaustion she herself never seemed to feel she was absolutely and completely improvident saving what little money she ever earned was a repugnant idea to her when she did save it was to pay for some new project such as an abortive one of mystery involving an expedition to honduras which she financed and from which she returned flat broke i never could find out just what that project was about probably it was one of the harebrained kind she sometimes developed  she couldnt help being sensitive of the color line but her sensitiveness was of another kind than the usual it was never bitter she was always proud of being a negro and once told me she wouldnt be white for anything in the world she wrote in her autobiography my own circumference of life is there  i give you all my right hand of fellowship and love and hope for the same from you in my eyesight you lose nothing by not looking just like me    you who play the zigzag lightning of power over the world with the grumbling thunder in your wake think kindly of those who walk in the dust and you who walk in humble places think kindly too of others    consider that with tolerance and patience we godly demons may breed a noble world in a few hundred generations or    so zora not only preached this with some biting irony but also carried it out gently in the life she loved to live with zest once when she was visiting me and my wife at our florida home and we had asked her to stay to dinner while the meal was being prepared a white caller came to the door zora seeing him before we did stepped away so that the man would not see her afterward we told her that she need not have done this she said that she didnt want to take any chance of embarrassing us we did not always get on as well as that after the honduras debacle she wrote to me from miami that she did not have eating money but she had the promise of a job in new york if she could raise the fare to get there i sent her a few dollars and advised friends in miami of her plight they got together and raised enough for her fare instead of using it for the avowed purpose she did not go but remained in miami when i remonstrated with such behavior and scolded her she wrote back that she had read just at that time that i was going through the trying process of having a book published because of this she understood why i was so testy and she forgave me for being put out with her at the time i was prone to think that perhaps too many scholarships and fellowships and grants might have been given her generating the conviction that others should support her and that there should be a limit to such grants perhaps i dont know i got over my aggrievement when i learned with amusement that she had gone to work in a miami beach house as a domestic and that her employers one day had found out who she was by reading an article she had written in a copy of the saturday evening post on their livingroom table then i remembered how one day she had shown a single spark of defeatism over her color she had told me she had written an article but she didnt think that the saturday evening post would buy one from a negro i told her that was the only stupid thing i had ever heard her say because of it i wouldnt write a note to the post for her for if i did and her article was accepted she might even erroneously have some question in her mind she was to send it to them and find out for herself the post bought that article and others commercial writing however did not consistently appeal to zora because she didnt care enough about making money still filled with ideas and schemes rarely based upon getting rich she drifted to the fort pierce area of florida during her two last years she earned a precarious living as a substitute teacher at lincoln park academy there and contributed to the local negro paper the chronicle then she had a stroke that halted work on a new book she was writing she spent the last months of her life in a county home her funeral at a tiny negro funeral home in fort pierce was attended by over  people sixteen of them white the mourners overflowed the small hall out onto the porch and then into the yard there was a little printed program entitled funeral rites of the late zora neale hurston which offered a brief biography the order of the service and the names of the pallbearers and flower girls who were some of her students expenses were paid by contributions many from those who never knew her the local negro population did not need a white florida writer to be there to speak an appreciation  to tell them who zora neale hurston was she was someone they may not have understood too well but they knew she had pulled herself up by her bootstraps and done something not many white people ever do the wonderful understanding of negroes for the human race born perhaps of their necessity to tolerate it was never better expressed than at zoras funeral when these people among whom she had lived so briefly nevertheless stood by one of their own the editor of the paper for which she worked said zora neale went about and didnt care too much how she looked or what she said maybe people didnt think so much of that but zora neale every time she went about had something to offer she didnt come to you empty the minister said when people learned i was going to preach about her they asked me what can you find to say well i can find a lot of things they said she couldnt become a writer recognized by the world but she did it the miami paper said she died poor but she died rich she did something the main hymn sung at the service was hell understand and say well done an exact appraisal of the situation the single jarring thing and that meant reverently was the way they dressed her in a short frilly pink dressinggown with frothy pink mules on her feet an incongruous garb for one so real and earthy i can hear zora herself commenting on it and saying she wouldnt be caught dead in such an outfit i am sure she would have added her favorite statement as she loved to roar gleefully i aint got but two things to do stay black and die she has achieved her purpose part of it with some magnificent writing she is out of circulation and all her books are out of print one cannot be rectified the other should be

between rounds the b y twelve active members a of the leimert chess ihj club contributed fif  teen dollars each to the naacp for the third quarter then completed arrangements to fish and golf at lake arrowhead during the last two weeks of august our western avenue barber fred clay suggested getting back to the business of chess when reverend jess patterson asked for a short delay to collect from each member fifteen dollars more for the freedom riders of core fred switched his cigar to the other side of his mouth and reminded jess he had just collected two hundred dollars vacation expenses from everybody furthermore he had had an empty chair for two months now the group sat silently after the minister explained the need for additional contributions then he said quietly well gentlemen if we cant support them with a little cash i motion we spend our vacation in the south ed smith who had taken over his fathers grocery store and was in the process of building the first negroowned supermarket in los angeles was the first to contribute the fifteen dollars followed by builder steve wright who was trying to integrate a new development professor hubbard was last to contribute before returning to his table he asked gentlemen everyone has already given of his money but why shouldnt we also go i quit placing my chessmen and was aware of a shifting uneasiness pervading the room why the hell should we spend our vacation in jail replied the barber there are other ways of going about those things he didnt answer what other ways but steve wright who from previous discussions had some support for his plan suggested we back his building company in negotiating financing through a local savings and loan association and with the negro press supporting us we could begin breaking down the walls of housing discrimination in california the minister said the situation was more grave in the south and our obligation was clear positions comprising elements of truth which conscionably could not be dismissed were reiterated but with no indication of resolution finally dr rogers ended the meeting by suggesting we ponder the matter and reach a decision at a later time  i drove slowly along the sparsely lit westside streets realizing steves remarks were more meaningful as i observed fewer houses and an increasing number of large apartments which seemed even more crowded because of the darkness    i entered and closed the door quietly enough but i expected dorothy to call to me because we usually had a late dinner on thursdays after club meetings a light from the bedroom cast its brightness across the dim hallway then i saw the thin hands of the black forest clock and realized she must have eaten long ago a magazine on child care had slipped from her limp hand to the floor the other hand rested on the fold of the bedspread which sloped from her swollen stomach i felt that any project which might take me away from her at this time could be summarily dismissed i switched off the reading lamp and went to bed quietly relieved no one had asked my opinion on the question of a freedom ride to the south    at breakfast dorothy seemed nervous as she sipped coffee and waited on me it was almost time to go before she told me she had lunched last tuesday with professor hubbards wife then she asked what was your position on the freedom ride project i havent given it any serious thought dear seems a fine thing to me she said as she handed my coat i brushed her hair aside and kissed her forehead as i left for the hospital whitedressed orderlies wheeled quiet stainless steel carts containing used breakfast dishes through the brightly lit corridors ward nurses were preparing to give bed patients individual therapy as i picked up the distribution from the message center before going to my office absently i initiated circulation copies then found a new case i opened the file but kept wondering if anyone in the club actually would ride to the south and i was annoyed because dorothy apparently had discussed the matter with professor hubbards wife and had not mentioned it to me my irritating discomfort increased somewhat when the dermatologist came into my office and sat crossing his legs got your crystal ball mr miller he asked maybe a little common sense will help the expression on his face reflected my tone of voice rough case i explained whats the problem a kid in the prison ward what is he doing up there pumped his stomach he paused and recrossed his legs they said he stabbed another boy who is in emergency now oh i see he broke out in a rash at the prospects of police interrogation  so i asked them to postpone questioning until tomorrow thought you might have a chance to look in on him and give me your report whats his name he hasnt told anyone wont tell who his family is either dr walton said a little more information was on his chart then left for a conference i returned to the new file planning a tentative appointment then phoned the receptionist notifying her of my destination and took the elevator to the prison ward on eight the guard greeted me and unlocked the door after a brief exchange i indicated i wanted to talk to the patient alone he was standing by the window the flannel hospital pajamas fitted his stocky body loosely his wavy blond hair was meticulously combed red welts stood out from his face hello what the hell do you want help if i can i dont need your damn help i looked at his bed chart his stomach had been pumped of barbituates the skin disorder tentatively diagnosed as a reaction from nervousness manifested with fear was under observation my name is    your name is sam and you look like an attendant im a medical social worker and my name is robert miller the boy was silent i repeated the next question twice then real ized he had heard me but was not going to talk any more it was just as well i thought under the circumstances even an initial interview could be aggravating but since he was no longer defensively verbalizing i thought it safe to ask for his cooperation he remained silent and there was no discernible change in the defiant expression on his face when i asked his name i suggested his parents would start checking the hospitals and police stations when he didnt come home tonight the boy turned toward the window i knocked on the door and the guard unlocked it i told him loudly enough for the boy to hear to contact me if the patient made such a request he nodded and closed the door there was no doubt the boy was quite frightened and was courageously trying to conceal his fear with aggression i felt certain also that my being a negro made it easier for him i stopped at my office and phoned emergency they told me todd duncan was the name of the boy treated earlier for knife wounds he had been transferred to ward two the nurse told me todd was in  as she opened his file she said his right lung had been punctured by a sharp instrument he had a slight temperature from infection and was now in an oxygen tent she returned the file and added his parents had been there all night  there was a small brown lady sitting on a cushioned chair in the corner of the waiting room i dragged my foot once not to startle her and she raised her head her red eyes were nearly closed by puffed eyelids she lowered it again i introduced myself and apologized for intruding at such a time but explained i was interested in the circumstances surrounding the incident its all right mr miller im cried out she said i might as well talk about it some after a moment she began as if she had already gone over it many times todd went back to los angeles    she paused but before i could ask she explained they lived in glendale and had been plagued since the day they moved into that typical american community i remembered the newspaper accounts  the dailies reported it was allegedly some teenagers who disturbed the peace protesting the addition of a negro family to the all white community the negro weekly reported some teenage hoodlums and other irresponsible citizens had smashed windows burned a cross on the lawn and honked automobile horns during the night outside the home of a negro family recently moved to glendale it added that the police behaved in the usual way in such cases the woman said she had been frightened for todd and asked him not to go i guess the kids are a little different from us mr miller i need time to think your parents should be notified yes they should be his voice rose they should be here he said pointing at the floor but theyre not theyre not even in town he shouted theyre too damn busy being successful to care about me he sat on the stool at the desk nervous tension and anxiety had caused the small red welts to reappear on his chin and about the sides of his face my name is howard lancaster he said calmly i had to lean closer to hear the quiet voice repeat his parents name and address so i could note them then in the same tones he spoke of the disorganization and the resulting coldness of his home life his father was a public relations expert for an electrical company and he traveled extensively his mother was a buyer for a downtown fashion agency both were frequently away from home at the same time as was the case this weekend it was during these times he had begun using seconal to soften the loneliness of rejection howard concluded he was unappreciated and was an unimportant member of his family the boy turned from me but i knew he was crying i phoned howards address to the investigating officer who was in the process of questioning witnesses regarding howards companions the only thing on which  all of them agreed was there were a total of three white hecklers one of whom pushed todds girlfriend i asked for her address then went to see her i spoke but the two boys their ball and gloves beside them sat in silence on the lawn of the blue stuccoed duplex i pressed the button twice before the large oaken door was opened by an eightyearold holding a baseball cap in his hand he stood to the side of me telling his friends he still couldnt come out then he turned and called deanie and wandered outside adjusting his cap on his head nadine lewis was an olivecomplexioned girl with thick black hair draped about her shoulders her hazel eyes had been crying i told her i was from the hospital and her eyes brightened i considered that todd had an abnormal temperature and he needed help to breathe under the circumstances i could only tell her we would have a report on his progress tomorrow it was all my fault she half whispered as she sat on the sofa will you tell me how it happened miss lewis i asked and sat in a chair near her it started because of my clumsiness i guess some white guys were heckling us and i suppose the blondhaired boy was kind of drunk and was showing off anyway he came over yelling at us to get out then he bumped into me knocking me off balance toddwas near and he caught me she paused and continued the other kids probably thought something was going on and rushed over his friends also came over and thats when it must have happened were you pretty close to the blond boy during the whole thing yes you see anyone with a knife no she replied then added i didnt know anyone had gotten hurt until i saw two of them running some of the kids were kneeling over todd and the others were holding that drunk one she paused finally the police came we were both silent for awhile then she said that since the incident a hundred more students had come by her house to register for the students for civil_rights now association and they would begin picketing monday we could use a little more guidance mr miller but nothing is going to stop us from enjoying the full citizenship which is our right under the constitution i felt as uncomfortable in nadines presence as i had felt with mrs duncan yet i was impressed with nadines determination which was something akin to the will of a man dying of thirst in a desert as long as he saw a mirage he would not cease to struggle but making an illusion a reality was a monumental task i guess thats why i hadnt tried it individually or with a group and though ive been moderately successful i knew the social climate had been such that my full potential had already been aborted i could have wished her luck that the project would be successful or safety in the face of mobs threatening physical violence instead i said it was going to be a hard task and hurriedly left    when i returned to the hospital there were two messages for me one from the police informing me they would clear with the hospital later today to take howard to juvenile hall and that his mother had returned home the other was from howard asking me to come see him he greeted me before offering me a seat at the desk then returned to his bed the springs sagging beneath his weight i told him his mother had returned his head slowly nodded she was a part of it mr miller he paused and continued she was with some of our community leaders when they met at  at one of the fellows house and he overheard them discussing ways to get the negro family out of the neighborhood did you get to know todd i asked no he replied i saw him in his yard a few times then about a week later we were in the car and he came out of his house with this big sign sit until served so we just followed him howard stood with his back to me and began explaining it was his intention just to frighten todd when he was interrupted by a knock on the door the guard with two folding chairs preceded a stylishly dressed lady who embraced howard and a man in a wrinkled suit carrying a small briefcase im robert    im mrs lancaster and i want howard out of here the woman began my attorney has already explained you havent a single reason to hold him here his release might have been arranged mrs lancaster if the police had been able to contact his parents well im home now she said so everything is all right and i dont have any time to be wasting around here a boy has been stabbed mama said howard quietly you didnt do it she said but i was partially responsible and i was with them when they did it you didnt do it she repeated but i know who did both mrs lancaster and the attorney came to their feet you stay out of this mrs lancaster said i think you should talk this over with me howard before you say anything else said the attorney ive already thought it over the boy said in monotones and i know we were all wrong  but its all over now howard said mrs lancaster no its not all over he yelled they think i stabbed that boy youre innocent let them find who they want im going to tell them howard persisted no howard we live out there thats why i should tell mama i forbid you she snapped his quiet firm voice broke the silence bill hopkins daryl long and joe    joseph stewart had the knife    the nurse said the oxygen tent had temporarily been removed the infection had been cleared and she permitted the parents to see todd briefly now mrs duncan was sitting in the same place her husband and her mother had joined her and they refused to go home though the nurse told them todd would be all right he opened his eyes as i called his name i told him nadine and the other students were continuing the demonstrations and there was a weak grin on his discolored face finally he said id be with em if we hadnt had trouble last time did you know those boys i asked him they burned a cross on our lawn he answered you know which one stabbed you he nodded affirmatively was it howard lancaster i dont know their names the blond one no    at the hearing three weeks later howard and todd identified joseph stewart as the one who did the stabbing joseph was ordered to the california youth authority his companions bill hopkins and howard lancaster had had fewer prior police contacts and a subordinate role in this incident both were ordered placed in a forestry camp all the parents were counselled and admonished i said goodbye to howard and followed todd and his parents out of the court building where nadine and the other students rose from the shade of the fan palms and quietly greeted him in the hot august sun i drove home in anticipation of dorothys approval of my decision later i would tell the chess club of todds courage and of his enterprising parents whose move was equally important and probably more fundamental because full citizenship is impossible without fair housing from which all else could emanate i felt a committee to develop wrights housing plan would be selected that night after which i would motion the remaining members take a freedom ride

please mr baldwin we all got troubles valdostabom louis lomax is a rather more treacherous writer to read and talk with mr lomax writes sometimes so candidly and in such fresh style of the unsuspected anguish of the negro lot that one is charmed and amused at the satire and force of his prose only to be felled by his insistence too that we behold the perverting misery of race discrimination he talks with an exuberant and amiable vitality in a disarming accent still redolent of south georgia and just when you think everything is going to be all right because he is such a friendly fellow his heavylidded eyes darken and deepen with an impaling effect to tell the uncomfortable truth as he hopes somberly that white people will learn to love before the negro learns to hate other new novels and essays and texan john howard griffins shocker black like me about his southern adventures in negro disguise confront us with unimagined depths of pain and anger among negroes and yet in the dourest and most persistent of the negro writers there seems detectable a thin strong theme of wary optimism about the south a hope for freedom friendship and equality unprecedented between two races living together this great high hope so cautiously suggested by negroes is also entertained by thoughtful white southern writers in a frequently quite emotional assertion of the similarity and natural compatibility of negroes and whites down here the late w j cash patron saint of southern white selfcriticism observed with an intensity comparable to mr baldwins that negro entered into white man as profoundly as white man entered into negro  subtly influencing every gesture every word every emotion and idea every attitude and with a biting sorrow comparable to baldwins acutely intelligent and humorshot gloom suggests a southern personality common to negroes and whites which might liberated from our awful shackles make a free and affectionate society in the symposium the south i erner as american l d reddick a negro scholar points out temperamental likenesses between dixie whites and negroes in speech gait food habits and orientation toward life we talk and laugh the same way make the same judgments and weep at similar sentimentalities says reddick quoting charles black that     southern whites and negroes are bound in a special bond in a peculiar way they are the same kind of people    even their strife is fratricidal james mcbride dabbs in the southern heritage wrote     through the processes of history and the grace of god we have been made one people    and it is disastrous to talk and act as if we were two if on the contrary we would play the game wholeheartedly together if we would be our deepest selves there is no telling what great age might develop in the south mr dabbs with a white southern love and audacity exceeding any negro literary optimism i  know of also wants southerners to rise to the level of loving passionately    our rich and varied configuration of people black and white as we love our earth and landscape in which case we should not only solve our greatest problem one of two major problems of the world today but our age would become a challenge to generations yet unborn another writer leslie w dunbar in the autumn virginia quarterly review looks beyond the hope of messrs cash baldwin lomax and dabbs to his own southern white assertion i believe the south will out of its travail and sadness and requited passion give the world its first grand example of two races of men living together in equality and with mutual respect the souths heroic age is with us now maybe mr baldwin and mr lomax ought to come on back home i tremble to consider mr baldwins response to a suggestion that the deep south is his home but he has confided that his alabama parents just barely made it to new york in time for his birth and that traveling south was strange to come back to a place youve never been still his deep south origins and happenso birth in harlem are sufficient for any ancestorworshiping southerner to claim him as rightfully our own anyway it occurs to me that the stingy shy but very eager beginnings of our first grand example to the world are preparing a place a home where all of us may feel like people instead of like whites or negroes this is apparent in the desegregations popping out all over the south so fast you cant count them and the community pride relief elaborately casual acceptance and occasional glad burst of good manners which accompany the forced change maybe mr baldwin amid his own kind of folks who know so well his intelligent gloom and comic ironies might mitigate his melancholy and enrich his wary hope and perhaps the compatibility of white southerners who already love before mr lomax hates might invite and expand his natural and indigenous southern exuberance and idealism maybe not next week but it may not be long before our rich and varied configuration of people black and white will meet as these writers already have to clean repair furnish and light the lamps and fires in our common home 
garden party at lastourville
the lambarene airstrip is no idlewild every time a plane circles you know it is the plane dark heads everywhere lift toward the sky as for the second coming in the land rover we bobbed along the dirt road waved at from the huts and arrived at the airstrip what looked like a hundred people mostly africans were waiting for the plane men in their sunday best in orange trousers and yellow silk shirts women in crazyquilt wraps their children on their backs dignified black officials with their untutored wives vous etes avec une femme ou avec deux the steward asked and crowds of bigeyed children two particularly elegant specimens in rumpled jacketsone with a hawaiian sport shirt underneath another in a jaunty racing capstood a little apart from the crowd after a short time we all scrambled into the old dcthe ingredients for a fine and brotherly jelly if a few screws got loose the captain walked through the cabin a thin somewhat bent and unhappy looking fellow of about fortyfive with a small mustache and eyes which looked disgusted and also a little yellow i remember thinking gastric ulcer bad liver he paced all the way down the cabin and said angrily to the steward get them all up front cant you see we are overweight our point of gravity is much too far to the back all the people behind me were somehow pushed beyond the door which divided the fuselage in two whether they were sitting lying or hanging ill never know for although the door flew open every minute it was kicked closed again too quickly to see what was going on behind it we were flying already and there was the river the schweitzer hospital and the godawful jungle stretching endlessly the stink the heat and the anxiety were almost unbearable there would be three stops before brazzaville at the first stop some africans got off to go to their villages and a few white passengers joined us the second stop would be lastourville the plane touched down and made a sort of jolly jump on what is called a runway in this part of the world we piled out as the chickens and goats scattered before the invasion from outer space the dinnerjacketed gentlemen and their wives and many others clambered into a truck which served as the local limousine service the other passengers walked out of the sun to spend the half hour for loading and unloading in the shade of one of the three small buildings which formed the only shelter on the airstrip the main building was about twenty feet long and one story high with four glassless windows and no door on it in faded lettering was painted lastourville two smaller sheds carried respectively the words meteo and t s f we sat in meteo because there were a few chairs and a bed a few minutes later madame meteo very pretty and young walked in with a child at her breast she sat down to complete the feeding smiling at us only then i noticed that this was not a waiting room but the bedsittingdrawing room of mr and mrs meteo mr meteo also came in soon sat down and said well youll have a long time here more than half an hour i asked ah oui monsieur he said maybe tomorrowhe had the beautiful ivory smile of africaand went on i have just radioed to brazza but whats happened i asked bewildered something wrong but didnt you notice you smashed two wheels of your landing gear coming down i went out and saw indeed that there were more people standing around and under the plane than usual for on an african airstrip there are always a number of unauthorized visitors watching the proceedings of fueling loading and unloading a few of them with lighted cigarettes in their mouths there was very little left of two of our three wheels and the jolly little jump at the landing might well have been our last one the answer that came back from brazza obviously said that it was sunday and que voulezvous    cest la periode des vacances but tomorrow morning they would send a plane to pick us up nobody was excited the eighteen passengers merely shrugged their shoulders and the captain found a bottle of whisky we sat in our dead plane waiting for the flight engineer to come back from his explorations in the town of lastourville about five miles away after a while i went for a walk down the road to look at the few mud huts before the first one a woman sat on her haunches a bronze statue she looked at me impassively in front of the second hut an old woman her breasts bare was delousing her daughter the third hut bore a sign with a name and under it ancien combatant  an old man in yellow trousers the remains of an army tunic and a faded scarlet fatigue cap on his gray curls arose from a box in his bonedry dirt front yard and saluted gravely his neighbors one in a nightshirt the other in old blue shorts grinned and we exchanged a few words in french in the trembling heat we must have been apparitions to each other back at the plane my fellow passengers were still drinking whisky it was stifling i sat down and read an old parismatch the captain looked a little less grim after his third whisky do we sleep in the plane i asked him maybe he said we have two ddt bombs the steward consoled us pleasantly i know i said because they had fallen on me during the jump there was the sound of a jeep in the distance and the navigator came back he had a bottle in his hand with the compliments of the commissaire de district who was also trying to arrange lodgings for us for the night but it was difficult for lastourville only had four european families there was plenty of space for the african passengers however another truck arrived and we were taken to the heart of the village the road went downhill past the huts i had already seen and kept on going downhill for five hundred feet through a dark funnel of dense virgin forest then all at once we were at the end of the funnel a vast valley spread out below with the wide ogowe river winding through it and rows of mountains receding into a blue background behind it as in a medieval painting deep down in this shangrila a few neat houses african customs of his region but the animals interested him more on his walls were beautifully framed pages from buffons histoire naturelle and most of the books on his shelves were about animals animals are my passion he said as he got up lightly for such a heavy man and waved us to the buffet which had been prepared and here hundreds of miles away from the next settlement in a funnel of virgin forest on a large mahogany table covered with damask waited an exquisite buffet froid you were unexpected and i am sorry but you will just have to take potluck smiled the commissaire waving his arm toward caviar mallosol pate de campagne foie gras thon a la portugaise and thick slices of cold roast beef there were freshly fried potato chips and many more complicated and tasteful things and warm fresh french bread there was an endless supply of mellow bordeaux and a particularly fruity cool moselle wine had the plane really miraculously made so safe a landing or had we already ascended to some afterlife standing around a table piling plates with delicacies in front of wide open doors with the soft murmur of cataracts below and a too esthetic crescent moon over the palm trees after supper we returned to the terrace and more drinks were served in the stillness of the equatorial evening we were all enveloped in irreality how long shall we still be tolerated on this continent mused the priest sipping his cognac i dont know said the commissaire but i wouldnt know what to do in france that i can tell you theyll still need us for a long time to come growled the texaco dealer they arent reasonable enough to see that said the radio man their leaders know that they couldnt operate a radio station that they couldnt drill the oil wells that they havent one single economist but the young hotheads think they can do everything because they are completely ignorant and the russians will try to confirm them in their beliefs and take over we dont want to exchange a mild tyranny for a harsh one said the african journalist we know very well that we got an education from you that without your engineers technicians and doctors we are sunk we need you administratively medically technically but then i am a moderate and i know it yes said the texaco man you know it but still you want your independence dont you and expect us to pay for everything fill the gaps in your budget defend you and give you every service for free do you think that can go on forever what is your press doing to make it clear to your people how much you need us if we get out youll go back to the jungle in a few years time look at the congo he said triumphantly i am told that leopoldville is already beginning to be overgrown with jungle youll start eating each other again the lumberjack joined in viciously i think we wont said the journalist quietly we know it will be difficult but we have men of good will we are divided in tribes and we cannot sweep away the old customs but we have more than we ever had we have a french as a common language we can communicate with each other we want a civilized way of life even the village people want it maybe they dont quite know yet what efforts it will demand of them and your politicians wont tell them either said the pilot mixing in for the first time they are just fighting about who will get the greatest power the biggest car and the most trips to paris or the united nations they will learn and our people will learn to distinguish between them the journalist replied our people are tired of being black subproletarians they feel the need to live like other human beings you have taught them that need if you have taught them anything we may have taught you many needs said the priest maybe you were better off before we came we have taught some of you in order to make you clerks in our offices and mechanics for our caterpillars but we have failed to raise the level of the family for how few girls have we trained it is true your people havent cooperated very much    now you want bicycles radios and sewing machines and cameras and you think that is culture and im afraid youll sell your soul to whoever promises things to you you are thinking of the russians again mon pere said the journalist with a smile i grant you that where there are frustrated discontented politicians and povertystricken populations the communists have their chance but we dont want them the chinese communists have done fantastic things in the few years they have been in power but we dont think their example could possibly work in tropical africa on the other hand i grant you that we want the things you have we want housing food hospitals and education especially education but above all we want human dignity you never gave us that did you you took it from us you didnt mind doing things for us but never with us you despised us really now we want to build our countries ourselves for we have learned that we are human beings like you if anything more human than you for a few moments nobody spoke then the priest said what i worry about is that you have no tradition of responsibility except to your clans you have no tradition of the brotherhood of man except within your tribe and we have not been able to instill it in you the african smiled again arent you a bit optimistic about the honesty of your own politicians and your european history as i read it is not exactly a demonstration of brotherhood between your tribesmake it african and it will be different compounded of old and new theirs and ours not a mixture of both heritages but a new compound if this new product frightens us and we cannot accept it we shall lose the continent spiritually politically and economically and it will seal our doom for africa is awake now my host was petting his friend the baboon the moon had disappeared and a hot heavy breeze was blowing on the terrace the guests dozed over their drinks    is africa really awake the commissaire said pouring himself a last cognac or do we whites just think so because we are falling asleep he looked at me with a bitter smile and lifted his glass happy dreams mon ami

threetables away sitv ting in the sun the two girls and the blond young man sipped iced vermouths and chatted around them all the languages of western europe crackled and cooed i could not hear their voices but it was easy to tell they were americans the girls as cool and comely as mannequins in orange juice ads wore just a trace more makeup perfectly applied than the other women the man crewcut and cleareyed wore polished cotton chinos on his long casually outstretched legs and there was about all three the glow of good food and good care and unlimited soap and water in palma de mallorca in the late afternoon after siesta time the tourists and international idlers flock to plaza gomila and sit at tables of the outdoor cafes and gossip and drink aperitives and plan their evening dissipations occasionally i sat in the plaza too in the shade for my father and mother had the foresight to relieve me of the necessity of torturing my skin to bake it brown i was sitting there with friends a frenchman and a dutch woman discussing the palma opera season a week away over syrupy palo tunel with soda another acquaintance an englishwoman was to be prima ballerina in the opening opera aida she was a charming woman once very well known long ago she had danced with ? pavlova and that was why we three were planning to be down front on opening night malicious well maybe but it promised to be quite a show and then glancing up my eyes met those of the blond young man toasting in the sun he smiled and nodded i turned to see who was behind me only a table of spaniards fervently discussing pesetas the favorite national pastime next to futbol and bullfighting no he was smiling and nodding at me i smiled and nodded right back then went on talking about the superannuated ballerina a moment later i glanced up again and the young american was still staring pensively now but seeing me look up the milk and fresh fruit smile flashed quickly over his face he nodded again this time i didnt reciprocate once was enough no point in being ridiculous but i wondered fleetingly what he was up to what his angle was in palma one never knows i soon found out    before i caught a ship and took off for west africa i lived in a salmoncolored miniature villa in the middle of a huge garden where flowers and fruit bloom all year round there isnt another house like it on that sunsprayed blueandpastel island there are hundreds of villas yes fabulous estates places fit for kings and often actually occupied by the remnants of europes exiled nobility but none so small and compact and delightfully romantic as mine when i returned from africa rich in experience but virtually penniless my lovely villa was in the hands of someone else fortunately a friend i was invited to put up in what had been a few weeks previously my own guest room water a bit deep for him anyhow i saw you sitting in the square and i made up my mind to tell you that im sorry i bothered you it was just on my mind all the europeans keep asking me about it and telling me they cant understand how things like that can go on in america hell i cant understand it either i could sympathize with him europeans had showered me with so much unwanted sympathy over little rock and assorted racial incidents that i had contemplated passing as a guinean however i reflected how capriciously ironic of fate to implant in this golden innocent the toxic seed of a nations guilt suddenly i had an impulsive idea considering the status of my wallet it was madness say do you have to get right back to your friends i asked how would you like a drink well im meeting the girls later on he hesitated a moment you dont have to buy me a drink he said but id like to what do you say sure i feel like i need one he said with a quiet sigh i led him to the nearest bar and we both ordered cognac we sat on the patio looking northward across the gently rolling sea and we talked until long after the moon rose over the bay of palma on a clear night its an exquisite sight and it was a clear night all the while i kept thinking of pepito and hoping he wouldnt mind too much my not coming home to get him but then there was no need to feel too conscience stricken pepito had all that wonderful garden to romp around in
