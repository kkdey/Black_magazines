paradoxically fit was the french who first forced us to seek z its essence and who then showed us where it lay when they enforced their policy of assimilation and thus deepened our despair early on we had become aware within ourselves that assimilation was a failure we could assimilate mathematics or the french language but we could never strip off our black skins nor root out our black souls and so we set out on a fervent quest for the holy grail our collective soul and we came upon it it was not revealed to us by the official france of the politicians who out of self interest and political conviction defended the policy of assimilation its whereabouts was pointed out to us by that handful of freelance thinkerswriters artists ethnologists and prehistorianswho bring about cultural revolutions in france it was to be quite precise our teachers of ethnology who introduced us to the considerable body of work already achieved in the understanding of africa by the university of oxford what did we learn from all those writers artists and teachers that the early years of colonisation and especially even before colonisation the slave trade had ravaged black africa like a bush fire wiping out images and values in one vast carnage that negroid civilisation had flourished in the upper paleolithic age and that the neolithic revolution could not be explained without them that their roots retained their vigour and would one day produce new grass and green branches negritude is the whole complex of civilised valuescultural economic social and politicalwhich characterise the black peoples or more precisely the negroafrican world all these values are essentially informed by intuitive reason because this sentient reason the reason which comes to grips expresses itself emotionally through that selfsurrender that coalescence of subject and object through myths by which i mean the archetypal images of the collective soul above all through primordial rhythms synchronised with those of the cosmos in other words the sense of communion the gift of mythmaking the gift of rhythm such are the essential elements of negritude which you will find indelibly stamped on all the works and activities of the black man in opposition to european racialism of which the nazis were the symbol we set up an antiracial racialism the very excesses of naziism and the catastrophes it engendered were soon to bring us to our senses such hatred such violence above all such weeping and such shedding of blood produced a feeling of revulsionit was so foreign to our continents genius our need to love and then the anthropologists taught us that there is no such thing as a pure race scientifically speaking races do not exist they went one better and forecast that with a mere two hundred million people we would in the end disappear as a black race through miscegenation at the same time they did offer us some consolation the focal points of human development

only be by force that is its first disadvantage a more serious one is that it would not be humanistic for it would cut itself off from the complementary values of the greater part of humanity as i have said elsewhere it would be a universal civilisation it would not be the civilisation of the universal whereas our revised negritude is humanistic i repeat it welcomes the complementary values of europe and the white man and indeed of all other races and continents but it welcomes them in order to fertilise and reinvigorate its own values which it then offers for the construction of a

offhand money makes a lot of us unhappy it causes many of the domestic upheavals in family life and sometimes seems to be the greatest single cause of all tension why should this be its a necessary commodity and we cannot escape it yet why cannot we learn to live with it harmoniously asking ourselves a few pertinent questions however we soon get an inkling as to why our money seems to manage us rather than we manage our money for instance do you eat steaks roasts and chops at the beginning of a pay period but find you have to lean heavily on starchy foods bean soups and meat substitutes at the last of the week when you really need to dress up do you discover that your hat is one color your best purse another and your one good dress will blend with neither does your family often complain of boredom and though you took the whole group out for a bangup time movies dinner and bowling right after payday theres nothing to do after that till next pay day are ordinary medical expenses always considered emergencies although as with most families they do occur regularly shots for the children dental appointments physical exams etc an answer of yes to these few questions and similar ones may give you the first hint that no one in your family is really managing your money but you are being managed admittedly money is one of the first reasons of family quarrels and disharmony so doesnt it make sense to get back into the management role as quickly as possible also since money is naturally of first importance in daily living it is certainly wisest to make it provide more living how take over make a plan for your money first take time to reckon past expenses get a general idea of how much of your money must be spent for food how much for housing and how much for clothing health recreation etc at the beginning of a pay period divide out all your available money into individual envelopes marked in these categories then plan to manage these different expenditures rather than put all your money in your purse and go on as long as it lasts food plan a weeks meals in advance according to sales items and seasonal bargains refrigerate and store things carefully to prevent any waste housing include rent or mortgage payments plus other housing essentials such as fuel water and electricity repairs insurance and furnishings clothing plan things to coordinate as to color and purpose go over your wardrobe and that of others in the family then resist impulse buying if you start out to buy a straight gray skirt dont let someone even yourself persuade you to buy that pretty lavender floral blouse that wont go with a thing you own health certain items such as vitamins health insurance etc will be easily planned for ahead but all of us should know that extras are normal so put aside something for those inevitable dental bills doctors visits and prescriptions a health fund accumulated ahead will prevent these things from wrecking the budget recreation a budget that is all business is dreary so be sure to put aside something for fun fare to give a lift to living but make the money really count by composing a fun list of things that cost little or nothing to enjoy things like picnics to state parks fishing hikes trips to the zoo or museum savings nothing makes you feel like a manager like a backlog of savings the amount saved regularly need not be large only constant earmark a certain percentage of all income and if the idea of saving money just for the sake of having money is boring to you then try saving for a purpose a new car new house childrens education vacation boat or retirement if your money manages you life can be stormy but if you manage your money theres fair weather ahead by a s doc young the past fifteen years rip f have been a golden era ii r for negro baseball players in more way than financial an astounding amount of athletic racial and economic progress has been made since branch rickey first brought j ackie robinson into the organized version of the game and jackies southembom manager inquired of rickey do you really think hes a human being but except ing the racial impact and sheer drama of jackies advent into a sport which had maintained for years an unwritten rule against negroes the next fifteen years promise to be even more golden again in more ways than financial in actuality the past predicts the future progress begets progress the first and second waves of negro playersjackie robinson larry doby roy campanella et als in the first willie mays ernie banks hank aaron et als in the secondhave accomplished so much in such a relatively short period of time have laid such a firm foundation on which third and fourth waves can build that this prediction cannot be easily dismissed as wishful or fanciful thinking it is almost as sure as the fact that god made little apples when rickey signed robinson this historic event occurred in the fall of robinson made his debut in organized baseball with montreal in entered the major leagues at brooklyn in he upset a pattern of racial discrimination which had existed since prior to and as early as in recorded sports history negroes had participated in integrated baseball including the major leagues of those days this spring as the major league clubs prepare for competition in the american and national divisions every team lists negroes on its parent roster or farmclub rosters the most successful or best and better teams are bulwarked by negro stars indeed if it were not for negro players the caliber of major league baseball today would hardly approach triplea negro players have been the saviors of the game as millions of fans have come to know itfor as rickey wisely discerned the ravages of world war ii and the lure of betterpaying jobs available to caucasian youngsters in other professions had seriously depleted the ranks of baseballs talent stock in this year the best allaround player in baseball is a negrowillie mays of the san francisco giantsand he is also the highestpaid player in the majors drawing down an annual salary ranging upwards of with baseballallied income added he will earn more than this year the player generally regarded as the one most likely to wreak a successful assault on the home run records babe ruths total of for a game schedule set in roger maris total of for a game schedule set last season is orlando capeda also a giant the pennant hopes of such teams as the los angeles dodgers milwaukee braves new york yankees pittsburgh pirates cincinnati reds the aforementioned giants chicago white sox detroit tigers st louis cardinals cannot possibly be realized without outstanding performances from such stars as maury wills hank aaron elston howard roberto clemente frank robinson willie mays a smith jake woods bill white and others the impact of jackie robinsons success as a major league baseball player transcended the initial fact that he reintegrated the game which is popularly called the national pastime negro baseball players today have escaped forever the tortuous life of their predecessors who were forced into the helterskelter existence of nomads who were grossly overplayed and underpaid who seldom obtained enough rest between games in the fleabag fleabitten segregated hotels where they were forced to live whose health and wellbeing were constantly jeopardized by the inadequate diets of the roadside greasy spoons where they not infrequently took their meals from the back door so rigorous was the life of the oldtime negro players that bunny downs bus driver for the cincinnati clowns was moved to ejaculate shuckin com hoein potatoes nothins tougher than this herewhatchacallittourist baseball negro baseball stars today are national and international heroes they travel firstclass sleep firstclass eat firstclass they play schedules which are within the limitations imposed by night games and the genius of the schedulemakers the best yet devised they are protected by minimum wage scales boast a pension plan second to none often are the recipients of lucrative bonuses are virtually assured that one or two years of play as regulars will guarantee healthy fivefigure salaries one or two of them have even been allowed to shave on the television commercials baseball salaries paid to negro stars have purchased security many fine homes and cars many minks and more than a few giltedged investments andor businesses beyond this the achievements of negro players beginning with jackie robinson who is now a wellpaid vicepresident and director of a multimilliondollar new york restaurant and coffee chain have spun off human civil_rights social and economic benefits for millions of americans patently the kid or adult who cheers lustily for a negro athlete at the ball park cannot retain the depth and breadth of old racial prejudices he may not yet want to live in the same neighborhood with the negro star nor have his sister marry one but his total ideas about race and democracy undergo significant changes as he applauds the negro home run hitter or shutout pitcher today negroes are accepted in many of the nations best hotels such as the chase in st louis because integrated baseball teams broke the ice this spring several major league clubs will house their players negro and white in southern hotels or motels purchased for the expressed purpose of insuring equality of housing eating and recreational facilities in countless american cities and towns race relations are improved the negro receives a better break and everybody is happier because integrated baseball brought home the invaluable lesson that negroes and caucasians can live and work together harmoniously for the greater good of all indeed in many southern areas where integrated schooling remains controversial and white citizens councils call the political plays integrated baseball is accepted it was several years ago that a clevelandowned pitcher named dave hoskins porformed in the texas league and subsequently was publicly acclaimed as the savior of the league the owners of the little rock arkansas team spoke out for integration before eisenhower prodded by louis armstrong decided to protect negro students who courageously walked through angry lines of bigots on their way to class in what may well be adjudged historically as a most significant move the famed birmingham barons withdrew from the southern association a few weeks ago because of archaic jim crow laws in that city and alabama but the limits of achievement by negro baseball players have not yet been posted on the horizon as inspiring and rewarding as the golden era has been the end of the rainbow with its huge pot of doubloons still lies ahead the surface has been scratched but serious mining operations are just beginning negroes have not yet been employed notably in the frontoffices of organized baseball clubs louis jones exhusband of lena horne and former olympic games track star harrison dillard have held public relations jobs with the cleveland indians other negroes have held positions of varying importance with these teams but there are not yet any negro major league managers vicepresidents general managers directors of playing personnel from baseballs standpoint one of the most unfortunate incidents occurred when the dodgers coldbloodedly dumped jackie robinson as he neared careers end for jackie as his subsequent success in business and public affairs proves possesses one of the keenest minds the sport has ever known personal resentment of jackie was the big factor behind his being traded to the thennew york giants a transaction which he canceled by making a dramatic retirement from baseball one of jackies contemporaries campanella purportedly was tabbed for an eventual managers role but his tragic automobile accident ended his career prematurely despite his physical handicaps however campy has worked for did he establish with mays a policy of paying a topflight negro star what he is worth it is reliably reported that a major factor in stonehams hiring of willies former teammate alvin dark as giant manager was darks ability to get along with mays the next fifteen years the goldengolden era for negro ball players will bring a solution to virtually all of the problems large and small endured by them today as these players move up in rank particularly as the general press public and club officials recognize their mental abilities as well as their physical attributesstartling progress will be made on all fronts such practices as negroandnegro rooming assignments or road trips placement of all negro player lockers together in one defined section of dressing rooms lower salaries for certain negro players than are being paid their lessable caucasian teammates james junior gilliam of the dodgers is an outstanding example of the underpaid negro star will disappear if as attorney general bob kennedy visualizes the potential a negro may be elected president of the united states within the next halfcentury then it is not hyperbolic dreaming to expect a major league manager general manager farm director orpossiblya club president during the goldengolden age of the soaring s and s before these startling possibilities are discounted it is well to remember that just fifteen years ago rogers hornsby was arguing that negroes would never fit into organized baseball because of the social angles such as playing cards during road trips involved a new york writer nationally famous was claimingjust fifteen years agothat negroes are always pushing themselves into jobs for which they are not qualified if no one suggested that the sky would fall because of jackie robinsons advent it was only because no one thought of it but oddly enough it was a southerner w n cox of the norfolk virginianpilot who informed the world that if negro players began to hit homers run bases and field with elan the question of their color would soon be forgotten up to date the greatest allaround negro baseball playerofficial has been the late andrew rube foster who not only starred on the mound in negro leagues but also was a colorful and successful manager he used to signal his outfielders with puffs of smoke from an old corncob pipe promoter teamowner league founder and president and baseball commissioner during the next fifteen years someone in major league baseball as we know it perhaps bill white or bill bruton or gene baker or ernie banks will put rube foster into second place its bound to happen progress is like rabbits it reproduces its kind fast open hiring you can sit and talk about it at staff meetings for hours on a high lofty plane you can tell yourself that this is the twentieth century you can ask yourself what kind of a citizen you are when you give lip service to hiring the negro yet never really do anything about it then alone you begin to entertain the small nagging doubts would he fit in with the other salesmen would your customers resent him would the negro salesman mesh into your organization maybe the experience of a national company atlantic gummed paper corp with headquarters in brooklyn would be helpful atlantic supplies strip box sealing to the packaging market it has sales offices in most of the u s it has southern customers its not a giant about million a year in sales but this firm whose building is at the foot of the brooklyn bridge has a problem and its first negro salesman a young man named john anderson has solved it but let atlantics president saul warshaw tell the story i live in the greenwich village area he said and i like to walk one evening he found himself in the center of a market his company hadnt been able to crack the garment area this is a businessasusual district buyers do business with cronies friends relatives most of the time a salesman cant even get through the door i wondered if there werent some way we could get a salesman in a salesman with the guts and tenacity to keep plugging away despite rebuffs one whod be remembered and thats when i decided to try a negro salesman if one could be found whod meet the requirements the door opened and john anderson came in tall and person able he was dressed in clothes of excellent quality and he knew how to wear them after introductions warshaw continued i worked with employment agencies they sent me eight negro salesmen and i got a surprise any of them could have done the job why anderson we asked warshaw smiled said he didnt think john had ever heard and maybe he should he has the hide of a rhinoceros but it doesnt show anderson had sold shoes before he got his first job after service in korea with the marines at a fashionable fifth avenue shoe salon he had found that of the stores customers were negroes but when he originally applied for a job he was told there were no application blanks we negroes are used to that answer i kept plugging until i got to see the vp john anderson was the first negro salesman the firm ever had and became its top salesman later at gimbels he repeated the sales performance but he was ambitious and he wanted what he calls a real sales job after hiring him warshaw gave him intensive sales training in addition to the usual training he sent anderson into the plant to learn how various stock is manufactured to arm him with every piece of factual information knowing hed have a tougher row than most to hoe as far as he knows there was no resentment the salesmen actually went out of their way to help then john was sent out on his own he was given the garment district known as the jungle he learned that when the denizen who guards the traditional barred gate a jungle hallmarkwont let him in he can often make it by the back door and he learned that his very color causes prospects to remember him in that split second i open up with the fastest sales pitch i can since i handle the new gummed tape with fiberglas interior i begin to demonstrate how it works one customera good one now but one we hadnt been able to sell beforesaid you dont know how good that dark face looks to me im jewish and i get mighty tired of seeing nothing but jewish salesmen warshaw admits to a bit of trepidation along the way when the company held a large meeting for its customers he wondered what some of his customers might have to say about anderson instead of icy blasts he got telephone calls many people wanted to know how a negro salesman had worked out they were toying with the idea of adding negroes to their sales forces i gave them one piece of advice if you hire a negro as a salesman you must integrate him into your organization by a tiein to top management clearly understood by the organization and i told them that looking at it from a purely selfish point of view the negro salesman will work harder to prove himself because the stakes are bigger john anderson who attended ucla and lives in westchester with his wife a successful designer of boys wear sums up one day people wont think twice about hiring a negro salesman one day all the sales manager will ask it whos the best man for the job a fighting wenching singing man the bigpowerful negro man stood in the middle of a circle on the sp louisiana prison farm and thrashed the twelve strings of his guitar with fingers of ebony steel the melody he played and the song he sang spoke the joy of deliverance he was getting out he grinned at the other convicts as his brawny voice took up the melody sometimes i lives in the country sometimes i lives in the town sometimes i haves a great notion to jump into the river an drown stop ramblin an stop gamblin an stayin out late at night go home to your wife and family sit down about a fireside bright it was his story and his life most of his fellowconvicts gathered there in the circle around leadbelly had heard the song before and most of them knew the words and its name good night irene by heart he had sung it for them on the long hot summer nights that came after blistering days in the cane rows when they gathered stalks to feed the pelican state factory a mill with a ton intake per day the state ran the mill as it did the rest of the selfsupporting penitentiary spread out over the tract that had once been a plantation they had heard irene before as they had heard most of leadbellys big bagful of more than songs but they had never heard it sung quite that way for this was a day of triumph for leadbelly a day he had lived all his life to celebrate this convict without knowing how or why a responsibility had fallen on his shoulders was a man with a long way to go the journey now more than twothirds run had begun more than years before on the day a son named huddie had been born to sarah and wess ledbetter on a farm near mooringsport louisiana probably in the year before it came to an end leadbelly would go halfway around the world with his own inextinguishable and apparently inexhaustible stock of music and folkways with that would go a way of living beyond the margin of comfortable society that would qualify leadbelly to stand at the same bar with o henry and gauguin villon and van gogh he was not an average man his mother was half cherokee and that explained the copper in his otherwise richly dark skin it might explain too some of the dark confusion and tragedy of leadbellys life but it would be only part explanation the ledbetters enjoyed as many negroes living in the caddo lake district of louisiana have enjoyed a degree of freedom and independence his father wess had bought vi acres of land when leadbelly was five years old and worked most of them leadbelly used to say that he was pretty happy as a child that my father would cut down trees and my mother would cut down brush and id be home sleepin they never touched me to whip me possibly this gentleness of his parents came from deep religious convictions but it was not enough as huddie grew stronger and smarter the conflict came with adolescence and the development of leadbellys giant physical prowess as long as he was a little boy the son of a generally respected and hardworking sharecropper leadbelly was secure nor did his heritage either of african or indian blood cause him any trouble as long as he stayed close to peaceful caddo lake but that couldnt last his troubles were waiting outside as soon as he could get up on a horse and stay there leadbelly rode off into the bottoms at night to play for sukey jumps caddo lake was close to cajun country besides the jumps or play parties there were breakdowns for square dancing the accordion fiddle and guitar usually supplied the music which usually kept going until dawn off in the canebrakes every saturday night at the age of or it didnt take long for leadbelly to learn to like girls drinks and music at some weathergray shanty set down in the bottomlands he could play all night get all he wanted to drink and lie out back in the pines between sets i used to be terrible wid womens terrible rough he said years later ive had trainloads of em trainloadssometimes eight or ten at a dance at fifteen leadbelly was married and the father of his first child the next year he ran away his wife willie mae was pregnant againbut not by leadbelly this time he insisted even before this leadbelly had already made his way to fannin street in shreveport he has told how he took off his short pants to go down there and how he sneaked away from his family to do it the first time out he fell in with some girls who were drinking beerand sugared it so it would taste better but when he took off at he headed for texas i couldnt sleep for thinkin bout the music is the way leadbelly described his appetite for mu sic while still a boy his uncle bob had taught him how to play the guitar then at the sukey jumps he learned about the accordion i as good as they had on a win jammer he boasted the first piece i ever learned to play was po howard from jim faginan green corn from bud coleman these were dance tunes and that was a beginning the rest of leadbellys music came from sources as varied as his wanderings and no one knows exactly what these were at after two years of rambling he banished away and went out in west texas pickin cotton he had also recalled how he went into a bar one day and found blind lemon jefferson little bit of something about blind lemon yes sir just to remember him he said in answer to a question years later cause him and i was buddies we used to play all up and around dallas texas the guitar plinked gently as he talked along fort worth we just get on the train an them time wed get on the that interurbans run from waco to dallas cross the cannon walk the hatchet from dallas an then they had interurban that run fum down to fort worth id git blind lemon bout home an wed get out two guitars an wed just ride anything wouldnt have to pay money in them

around cause when women are around that brings mens an well git money cause when you git out there the women git to drinkin an not thinkin they just fall all up on you an boy that make us feel good an we tear them guitars all to pieces never would quit playin leadbelly was learning his music the best way picking it up as he went along blind lemon who needed a lead man to guide him on his tours was a willing teacher in this way leadbelly lived out the kind of experience that has given to music and folklore so much of its vitality and lusty repertory he rolled along learning from others all the way always adding to music he already knew in dallas in leadbelly heard his first jazz band he threw in for a while with a crew that toured the streets playing alternately guitar accordion mandolin mouth harp and bass fiddle and he had more encounters with women in marshall a town near the texaslouisiana line where he at one time may have gone to college he was hauled into court by a woman who claimed he had attacked her for leadbelly this was the first real trouble he was sent up for a year on the harrison county chain gang on the third morning out the guard got nasty as leadbelly said later in his magnificent chaingang song take this hammer that hurt my pride he just couldnt take it so he cut out across the fields chain and suit with a slug from the guards winchester nicking up the ploughed ground beneath his feet that first time he was lucky enough down in the backwoods he found some negro men and women hoeing they cut his chain loose with an axe and he somehow got home to caddo lake and hid away for a while in a cotton patch the next trouble leadbelly had was more serious on may he was charged in the bowee county court house in new boston texas with murder and assault to murder in this case with two men a gun had been drawn and one of them had fallen leadbelly alias walter boyd on this slate was sentenced to thirty years he tried two breaks the first time he got clean out of jail and stayed out for three days then on june he was sent up to the shaw state prison farm to serve out his year term not long after he took to the pines once more the hounds were after him and he was trapped but he couldnt go back so he jumped into the water they fished leadbelly out of the stream half dead and for a while at least broken in spirit but it didnt take long for him to come back when he did though his spirit had changed instead of trying to run away he tried to work his way out both literally and with guile that was where his strength and his music both helped while he had been out in the blacklands belt of texas leadbelly had done some hard cottonpicking his wife at that time lethe showed him how one day he got the hang of it and before long he climbed up from lethes respectable pounds of cotton a day to an impressive pounds then to pounds a day then he heard of a man who could do a thousand a thousandpicker dont look back at it he yelled and shot for that mark so he was ready for the prison farm once he made up his mind to work he became as alan lomax has written the number one man in the numberone gang on the numberone farm in the statethe man who could carry the lead row in the field for or hours a day under the boiling july and august sun and then cut the fool for the guards all evening cutting the fool for the guards was part of leadbellys plan for his freedom one day he heard that governor pat neff occasionally came to inspect the farm by now leadbelly knew the power of his music he had seen it charm coins out of rich white folks hands in the plushy suburbs of dallas he had ridden all over west texas using his guitar as a free ticket it had got him out of scrapes and women headed for it like bears for honey one night a woman threw herself into his arms so hard she broke all but one of the strings of his guitar besides knowing what he could do with music leadbelly had added to his stock of it along fannin street in the redlight district of shreveport he had heard slow somber blues moaned out by weary prostitutes he had heard flashy ragtime pianists in the cabarets and more elegant bordellos on the state farms he had tapped the rich source of afroamerican song and lore that goes back farther than inmates can remember work songs came as naturally to him as the heave of a hammer or the heft of a steel rail fancy songs he knew from childhood down the red river valley and along the brazos bottoms he had heard cowboy songs old slave shouts field hollers and laments in tent shows that toured the south he heard minstrel music and in one tent in particular he remembered hearing black patti the negro coloratura who had a company of troubadours and who wound up an evening of cakewalks with a finale billed as the operatic kaleidoscope on the mississippi he had picked up the songs of roustabouts stevedores levee workers and boatmen as part of his own oneman performances he had added dancing to his music and could do a buckandwing ballthejack and eagle rock he knew hundreds of popular songs and had already improvised verses of his own based on their melodies his version of the titanics sinking had proved a hit wherever he went leadbelly in then was no mere singer of folk songs as they were then being sparsely studied in american universities he was a fullfledged two fisted professional entertainer a member of good standing of the raw roistering frontier life of river and valley mesa and bordello before governor pat neff came to the shaw state prison farm leadbelly had worked up a piece called governor pat neff it isnt hard to imagine leadbellys cavalier words of greeting to the titlesubject of his song when pat neff did come down leadbelly was summoned to the edge of the porch much as negroes in the old feudal south used to come up to the plantation verandah with their rattles and jawbones and cakewalking to entertain de white folks he danced he sang he played the guitar he worked all the way up through his routine then brought out the governors song as if it were the most casual interpolation the effect was shattering but it produced a result far from what leadbelly who had counted on it to immediately open the gates of the prison farm had intended neff said right off he wouldnt pardon leadbelly im gonna keep you down here to play for me when i come the governor told him but when i get outa office im gonna turn you loose if its the last thing in the world i ever do leadbelly had to wait until january for the governor to keep his promise then just five days before ma ferguson the first woman governor of texas and second woman to hold that office in the united states was inaugurated the pardon for leadbelly came through to the state prison farm huddie leadbelly was out but it was a changed world he was a marked man now with all counts against himfirst for attacking a woman second for murder and assault to murder no hundred other counts could have indicted him more a negro and a man in the deep south he found himself condemned to exist in a halfworld always living in shanties down on the other side of the tracks always performing in halflit lowcaste gin mills and dance halls he tried hard work at first and was employed in a buick agency in houston from to but trouble clung to him as persistently as music stuck in his head in the next five years he came close to being killed at least three times and was undoubtedly involved in scores of other unrecorded fights the first incident was recalled years later when xrays of leadbellys skull in a new york hospital recorded a fracture he said then that he had felt numbness in his head for many months after the night a bottle cracked his scalp open he never went to a doctor on another night he was picking out mrtom hughes town on his guitar in a dance across the lake from oil city when a man stuck a knife in his neck and drew it half around to the other side before his girl era beat off the wouldbe murderer huddie went to the police that time bleeding like a hog and was told to get out and fast then for the third time he was attacked while on the way home from work some men stopped him and asked for whisky from his dinner pail he swore he didnt have any and when he refused to give up his pail his blood began to flow again on february leadbelly was packed off to angola with a second assault with intent to murder written against his name when john alan lomax a scholar a southern gentleman and curator of the archives of american folk music of the library of congress found leadbelly at angola he pulled every wire in sight and added a few invisible ones of his own to get him out leadbelly made his contribution to the campaign by composing a new gubernatorial song this one titled governor o k allen dedicated to the louisiana incumbent a hard man who had vowed never to release any con from any state pen the new song about governor allen was duly recorded by lomax and transmitted to the governors office nothing happened more people were seen then it was finally announced that leadbelly although he had not served his term of ten years could be released on a technicality by august of huddie would have accumulated enough good time to warrant a reprieve that gave huddie leadbelly on august a little over fifteen years until his death on december in which to transmit his music to the world but the rest of the world was slow on the day of his release there were no more than a handful of persons including john a and alan lomax his son who were aware of leadbellys vast repertoire and its potential impact on american music these two men arranged tours for huddie and after he got to new york helped him with recording dates but aside from a temporary flurry caused in campuses along the eastern coast where leadbelly had lectured and sung and a spurt of publicity that ensued when his book negro folk songs as sung by leadbelly was published the rest of the country remained unmoved sales of the book slumped at the mark the march of time did a quick runthrough of leadbelly in march reenacting his release from angola but this was not enough to swing leadbelly into the position of national stardom that he felt he deserved this was a strange thing about leadbelly as long as he lived he was sure of his greatness he thrust it upon everyone and in so doing alienated many persons who might otherwise have been eager to help him almost all the time during his last years he was talking to persons who only halfbelieved him halflistened to him ise the king of twelvestring guitar players of the world he used to boast and everyone smiled indulgently tse the greatest folk singer in the world he said and titters ran through small audiences in small rooms he recorded for many recordcompany labels large and small first perfect milotone then musicraft victor asch and capitol and none of the records sold very well the song he had always said was my song good night irene he recorded for both asch and capitol neither pressing sold well he was interviewed by theatrical agents and each one had a different idea one wanted to put him on the concert stage another suggested that he grow his hair long cultivate a beard and pose himself into a big role as de lawd in a revival of green pastures the folk song people took him to their hearts but that was a limited circuitabout records sold every time he cut one he sang at the village vanguard an intellectuals bistro in greenwich village and for this he earned a week and an occasional nod from a stray critic who became lost below nd street and broadway for a time he was the nineday wonder of the leftwing world he played for rallies he played for parties he was feted and considered socially significant writers found that his songs were founded on social protest sure there was social protest in leadbellys songs they were about his life and the way he and a great many other negroes had been kicked around in the south but they didnt always read like the latest dateline from union square and after a while the tide of leftist praise receded leadbelly was broadminded he also composed songs celebrating the virtues of wendell willkie and came up with an ode on princess elizabeths wedding day the trouble seems to have been that everyone saw a little part of leadbelly but no one saw all of him tin pan alley too turned him down although irene when published after his death by a little sheet music company the first possibly the second music publication ever accorded him was plugged to a faretheewell and sold over a million copies in the decca recording alone sometimes his attempts to get in the bigtime were pitiful in without a contract without even an offer he boarded a train for hollywood sure that this was his destiny but like many another of leadbellys destinies it fell as flat as celluloid during his entire stay there the only offer he ever got was to play for partiesparties given for the stars but leadbelly although he was patted on the head by a galaxy of them was there not as a star but as a curiosity on the performers platform he had sense enough not to be fooled by that and he returned to new yorkstill pretty broke but much wiser but he accomplished two extraordinary things in those last years of his life and by these things alone huddie stands a good chance of being remembered in the first place he succeeded in making good on a boast he had sung when he first hit manhattan i was born and raised in the country man but im stayin in town by this he sang that he was turning his back on the south because he had lived there as a condemned man he was going to make good in the city and stop ramblin an stop gamblin many of his friends thought hed never make itthat exposed to the hypedup tempo of subway life booze and a whole city of new women he could never stay out of trouble but he did a great deal of the credit for that goes to martha promise a girl he had met in louisiana but married later in wilton connecticut in martha stuck with him and she gave him a fireside bright to come home to huddies other accomplishment was sweated out under a sort of desperation that must have been almost as great as the desperation he knew when he halflived a condemned man on the other side of the tracks in the south what he did during those last years was to get all of his music down with calm cheerful insistence he somehow managed to hand over most of his vast inheritance of folk music from the past blues slave songs spirituals work songs ballads popular songs everything was set down in one form or another some of it is on records now for the most part out of print some of it is on several thousand feet of tape recorded only a year before he died some of it was transcribed and published in the first book about leadbelly some of it reposes in the form of aluminum discs in the archives of the library of congress still more was recorded by moe asch of folkways records who plans to issue one longplaying record a year from this source as long as it lasts further material may come to light if and when columbia records chooses to open its archives of leadbelly recordings of all this material so far only irene had enjoyed any great public acceptance yet there is in the rest of this legacy of leadbellys enough to serve as basis for at least two more books a trio of operas a score of films and a bakers dozen of popular hits when irene burst upon leadbellys first big public a few short months before his death in late the cognoscenti of the music world discovered a resemblance to the music of stephen foster in leadbellys song they were years behind a biographer of foster who had already and quite unconsciously delineated this resemblance he has published songs and instrumental compositions john tasker howard wrote some years after fosters death wrote howard the best of the songs form the most important group of peoples songs that have ever come from the pen of any one composer they are probably the most typically american expression that any composer has yet achieved born and raised in the interior foster was little affected by the foreign immigration of musicians that enslaved the seaboard in midcentury the influences that molded foster were inherently americanthe singing of the negroes on the wharves of the ohio river and the sentimental songs that were carried through the country by the socalled singing families in concert he found a medium that was simple and sincere at its best dealing with emotions that are fundamental to all mankind and at its worst never quite so bad as the other popular songs of his own day or later why shouldnt there have been a resemblance between stephen foster and leadbelly the point is interesting and undoubtedly true but like many another approach to huddie during his lifetime it misses the essential in this singer and dancer convict and rambler we had another and possibly even more prolific and imaginative stephen foster in our midst he was quite a character this man who spent most of his life fighting wenchingand singing by antoinette s demond the summer of my six teenth year got started in the same way as any other summera lot of tennis in the morning in the washington park courts and swimming afterwards in the park pool down near fiftyfifth street i saw a lot of ben better than swimming myself i liked to watch him gliding up and down that great big pool he was like a great fish sliding through the water and i liked to watch him leaping off the high board winging upwards a mite before leaning down into the cool greenblue water cutting it with scarcely a splash and when he would climb out so tall so brownblack and glistening and come over where i was sitting and id say hi and hed say hi whats new my heart would pound violently and id know that it was a summer like no other there were to be dances in the park that summer that was different carpenters laid a wood floor for dancing in the old boathouse down by the side of the lake and at one end of it they set up a bar for soft drinks folks were talking about those dances and about the balloons and streamers and japanese lanterns that would decorate the boat house evenings i sat on my porch an old grey stoop with iron balustradesthe same as every other porch down that block of plain brick row houses i just sat there leaning again the iron balustrade watching the catalpa tree which shaded the porch shed its fading pink blossoms little girls played rock school on the stoop next door their flared pleated skirts stood out as they bounced up and down the steps little boys slid down the balustradesno handsand folks passing by complained about the heat and called hey boy to the men peddling ice cream bars one evening that summer when i was sitting on my stoopsitting there with nothing whatever to do ben came down the street i dont even remember what i was thinking about just suddenly big as life there he was and i was smoothing down my dress and smiling at him and saying hi and wondering if my eyes were as wide apart as folks said and if my bangs were lying flat against my forehead or rising upwards from the heat ben said hi to me and his teeth were gleaming in a friendly smile and his beautiful body was standing full before me close enough to reach out and touch he sat down on the steps besides v me and started talking away about this and thati couldnt tell you just whatbut suddenly he was asking me to go to the dance at the boat house and i say yes without any reservations wondering on the one hand how it was that he had decided to ask me and wondering at the same time what i could wear if i didnt know that it would be the red dress when ben left loping on down the street in an easy stride i took a mirror from my skirt pocket to look at what he had seen prominent eyebrows sleek bangs eyes wide apart and a small mouth made up red a dimple showed in my right cheek when i smiled i only had the one saturday night a tawny brown girl in an orangered dress bangs artfully arranged i crossed my legs waiting for ben elegant legs legs like your mothers my father once said i was glad to have such nice legs to go dancing with ben ben called for me around eight he wore a white suit and he smelled of shaving lotion it wasnt even dark yet but off we went to the park we walked unhurriedly past all those tennis courts on south park empty now in the fading light cabs flickered past us picking up fares but we walked enjoying the summer night at fiftyfifth street we turned into the park and followed the path leading to the boathouse that dumpy old boathouse surely looked different we could hear the music of the band as we came up and then we saw the couples dancing on the newly laid floor balloons and streamers were suspended from the rafters and orange and green japanese lanterns bobbed in the evening breeze just roof and floor and dancers in between and the girls in their summer dresses ben and i joined the dancers we changed off with other couples but mostly we danced together we took a row boat out on the lake under the summer stars and the new silvery moon i remember yet the laplap of the water the ceaseless call of the crickets the smell of flowers and fishy water that night at home in my small upstairs room i sat at my dressing table leaning on my elbows looking at myself in the mirror now at last i was sure that i was pretty at least pretty to somebody i stood up and let my clothing fall to the floor i slid into my pajamas and sat down to pin up my bangs i creamed my face and wiped it clean now it all had a purpose i took a notebook from the bookshelf ben i wrote and then sally i drew a heart around our namesa childs game and then the speculation tall brown boy are you for me i lay down on my bed to think that question over and wondering about it i fell asleep ben telephoned the next day what about swimming he asked swimming idly i touched my pinnedup bangs its going to be hot he explained we might as well go over to the pool id love to go i said id love to ben called for me at one oclock when we got to the pool it was already crowded i sat on the side of the pool and watched ben swim as i had so many times before only this time i had come with ben i was his date he swam over to where i was and grinning from ear to ear pulled me in the water ducking me until i sputtered i ducked him back and swam off to the shallower end up and down we swamfun to swimfun to float on our backs watching the fluffy clouds drift in the wide summer sky on the way home we strolled across fiftyfifth street bought some popcorn stopped in at a neighborhood show two features and a newsreel ben held my hand during the two features during the newsreel he put his arm around my shoulders sally he said soft on us close together we sat our thighs touching our shoulders touching bens arm around me we were filled with the wonder of each other filled with the wish that the night would never end come in sally father stood in the doorway in his housecoat and slippers i guess that he had tired of waiting for me to make up my own mind to come in his tone was stern and unfriendly it is very very late he said ben took away his arm and stood goodnight sally he said and started off down the street how i longed to run after him how i longed to stay with him forever i hated to turn into the house my fathers housethe house of my childhood dad stopped me before i went upstairs he said that i was seeing too much of ben that i was only sixteena lot more in that moment i could not bear my father i hated him i only wanted ben but then even then somehow i knew that i was glad to be important enough to call out dads sternest voice his deepest concern i knew it was his way of showing how much he loved me upstairs i creamed my face as usual i pinned up my bangs i hung up my red dress and climbed between the sheets of my bed i thought about my notebook but did not take it down there was nothing to add that i wanted to say i remembered too well what i had written in it not so long before tall brown boy are you for me i knew what the answer had to be and i cried i did not see much of ben after that my father was adamant ben telephoned off and on and then not at all i did not go to the pool i did not play tennis evenings i sat alone on my stoop with nothing whatever to do save watch the children race up and down with their endless games of tag and hideandseek long green seed pods formed on the catalpa and now and again a huge forked leaf loosened and fell to the earth that was the end of the summer of my sixteenth year after labor day school reopened and from time to time i saw ben seeing him brought me pain pain where my heart should be but even then i was grateful for the moments of perfection we had known together sometimes we would meet and he would smile flashing that wide grin he would even say hi whats new and the old rush of giddiness would come over me but id be ashamed to let him see the flush of color that came to my face after a while when i saw him coming i would walk another way the long green pods of the catalpa tree turned brown the children on my street put them into their mouths and pretended to smoke indian cigars they called them for the october school dances ben dated a new girl who had come to our school in the years that followed i had not ben whenever i am thinking many dates many beaux but of my youth i remember ben and most of them i have forgotten but that summer of my sixteenth year by edward james grant the negro in america nn as some right to he sensitive his black cv face is to many white americans a badge of inferiority even before his actual level of culture and accomplishment is known the prejudice which confronts him at every turn in life is sufficient to implant within his conscious mind the weeds of cynicism and discouragement but perhaps the real danger that the colored man must try to avoid is swpersensitivitythat omnipresent chip on the shoulder with its ramifications of distrust and selfpersecution though in a high percentage of cases his conclusions on race animosity may be warranted he must give the benefit of doubt to whomever he is not certain bears him malice this should be true in all areas of his activity sports housing industry public transportation social gatherings for instance he should not immediately condemn the baseball or football team as discriminatory which does not employ a negro player management on that team may be content with its roster of players at the moment of decision and would hesitate to place a negro of inferior capabilities onto the squad it might be possible that a superior colored player would find immediate acceptance on the team yet the supersensitive negro citizen would despise the team for rejecting a player which in the opinion of the mentors would add nothing to its momentum the theory that negro players regardless of their contribution to a team should be accepted on the basis of simple color balance is no more logical than its reverse of rejection because of color in fact this doctrine has certain dictatorial aspects there should be irrefutable evidence that the owner of a team would refuse to add a negro player to its lineup no matter what the situation then this particular team deserves the wrath of negroes everywhere a good example of a quick jump to false conclusions occurred among a group of negroes in the boston area who a few years ago decided that the boston red sox baseball team had slammed the door on colored players and that ted williams in particular was responsible for that policy this supersensitive group repudiated the boston team the hatred which consumed them when they discussed ted williams was far more deeprooted than the animosity of average williams dissenters but soon the sox were fielding a fair not great infielder named pumpsie green and offering a real chance to a pitcher named earl wilson sports writers who would never flatter williams were admitting that he was working with green without directives from the front office to help the rookies batting average the negroes who had vilified both the red sox and ted williams prematurely should have felt sheepish thus while there are admittedly a few cases among nationally prominent sports aggregates of discrimination the evidence would seem to favor a more tolerant attitude on the part of negroes who would ostracize a white team without knowing all the facts the mantle of supersensitivity moves into many areas we find it in restaurants where negroes are constantly on the defensive as they look for signs of displeasure among the waitresses and other help if a waitress is sullen and illtempered the negro might feel that his presence was the reason for her nasty disposition when actually she might have acted just as unpleasantly with white patrons many negroes seem ready to bristle over any action or attitude that might be tolerated from members of their own race we find it in buses and subway trains where a white person suddenly finding himself or herself seated next to a negro might rise and walk to the door this might have happened anyway but the negro will often conclude that his proximity provided the motivation there is a moment of awkwardness embarrassment or anger which may not have been necessary we find it in real estate where a homeowner cannot reject a colored family without being branded as discriminatory there is real danger to this since the homeowner may lose the privilege of selectivity let us assume that this imaginary landlord has interviewed several white families he has turned down the first apartmenthunter too many children the second flatseekers have all the qualifications but mr apartmentowner simply disliked them for reasons of personality and attitude a third prospect may have pets which he insists upon keeping and the landlord does not want animals on the premises these are valid reasons to reject white families at least no official action would be taken to attempt to force the landlord to change his mind however the homeowner would find himself in trouble if he tried to refuse negroes for the same reasons no matter what the objections the national association for the advancement of colored people would call it discrimination if this double standard is carried too far more and more of the rules which apply to white families will not apply to colored families thus while one must admit that the negro has been improperly excluded from many neighborhoods even in the supposedly relaxed northern regions of america and deserves the cooperation of state and fed eral agencies to improve his constitutional rights in matters of housing negro sensitivity should not expropriate from a landlord his privilege of personal choice in selecting that family which will occupy his private property the same objections which would apply to white families should apply to colored families and negroes should be aware of these common objections and react to them as gracefully as white hunters of apartments are forced to do the same situation exists in industry the boss who may honestly feel that a negro employee lacks the necessary equipment to ply his trade may be suspected of discrimination for discharging that worker supersensitivity more than ever will emerge in this instance since income and sustenance are on the block quite often a negro discharged will complain that the color of his skin was behind his dismissal with the result that pressure may be brought against an employer to rehire incompetent or lazy help since the matter of employment is a vital personal issue one must expect resentment at the time of forced departure from a job on the other hand the inflexible conclusion without positive proof that bias figured in any such decision shows lack of confidence and reflects defeatism it would be better to determine that a competent employee black or white will usually keep his job to some degree the spectre of supersensitivity is present in the framework of school integration but in this area the negro is on firmer ground without question the attack upon integration in education by white people in the south or anywhere else it occurs is the most shortsighted objection to arise in the race conflict what possible chance for equality exists for an ignorant minority what better place to start an upsurge of the american negro than in the schools and most certainly on an integrated level where basic respect for one another can be implanted in youth and where all of the facilities of the best educational systems and institutions can be made available to a people sorely in need of this basic freedom if we can continue to concentrate upon this dilemma in the light that negroes cannot be swept under some imaginary rug and that their explosive birthrate tends to increase the black tide too rapidly for an attitude of indifference we may then realize that extensive progress in education should be made however negroes particularly in the north might tend to be oversensitive on this subject where a section of a city is predominately colored there should not be an enraged outcry at the greater number of negro children in the schools within that area the desire to send children by bus far from their environs for the sake of integration at any cost is once again a kind of hysteria which might well be avoided what all this actually boils down to is that the slow emergence of the negro into the doorway of civil_rights could easily extend beyond the bounds of common sense unless the negro controls his sensitivities and allows himself to be judged on his merits this will not be easy for an oppressed race struggling with a builtin inferiority complex supersensitivity is the disease of people who have faced adversity and scorn to some extent it is to be expected and should be accorded reasonable sympathy only when carried to an abnormal degree does it become reprehensible the colored man who feels that a police officer would not have stopped him if he had been white or that a judge might have meted out a lighter sentence may be grievously punishing himself before he can be accepted the average negro must accept himself in other words he must feel like an equal consequently this would result in confidence and selfesteem two characteristics which would preclude supersensitivity once and for all by george puscas as most tragedies do this one began inno cently enough sl bored largely ignored at home the preachers son wandered into the streets of chicago it was johnny bratton was years old a cocky showboat kid instinctively disliked by others but johnny had something going for himfists that could win instant respect and admiration within weeks roaming the streets challenging the neighborhoods johnny found his way to a gym slipped his hands into boxing gloves there the boxing world had itself another fighterand there the pages began to turn on a sickening adventure which produced one of its final chapters here saturday morning the life of johnny bratton is one of the great wastes of the sports world the fault is not all his perhaps not even mostly his but waste it is a sad commentary on the poor boy grown rich the insignificant become important the young moving too fast living too old maturing too slowly within a year of his first wearing of the gloves johnny bratton fought and won his first amateur fight two years later he was golden gloves champion of chicago he turned pro before long he was fighting main events in chicago stadium suddenly the hero of the teeming south side his manager was howard frazier a pound giant who had spied johnny on the streets frazier was wise he moved johnny cautiously in nine fights in johnny earned big money came quickly in the first four months of he made another in pursuit of it came the first tide of moochers bootlickers hustlersthe leecheswho prey on the naive and johnny was naive he was owner of a big black cadillac a sport in expensive clothes he hired a liveried chauffeur to drive the car married fathered a daughter and divorced within a year shortly he met joanne then who later was to bear him a son ricky johnny was a big deal this was the era of big money television fights and johnny bratton was a steady star his fight career progressed though his fists were small johnny possessed a devastating twohanded attack had catlike agility and awesome courage he lived the life stylishly dressed an impassioned spender he banqueted cronies at a clip lost heavily at poker and dice borrowed constantly first sign that the world was not goldcrusted came in when johnny now and growing distrustful sought to rid himself of frazier the illinois athletic commission wanted to know why under constant questioning the manager admitted that he had bet johnnys purses on the outcome of his fights and when fights were lost was unable to make good they say most problems begin with money soon johnnys exwife hauled him into court for nonsupport within the same month march johnny fought charley fusari for the world welterweight title he won but the government took his purse of to pay delinquent income taxes johnny continued fighting he made money fast played faster he had two more title fights the second is remembered as one of the most brutal vicious fights of the last years in it the world darkened perhaps forever for johnny bratton it was the th round at chicago stadium bratton had been holding up well against boloswinging kid gavilan suddenly gavilan cornered bratton rained repeated blows to his head bratton was hurt gavilan punished him severely blows to the head bratton never hit back ringsiders recall it as the most dreadful punishment they have witnessed seeing bratton helpless gavilan paused expecting the fight to be stopped the referee made no move the blows came again and more they were to the head said one veteran fight writer i counted in alland bratton never was able to swing back perhaps because of his cockiness the fight crowds loved to see bratton beaten and probably because of that he refused now to quit the punishment continued for four more rounds it was the turning point in the life of the preachers son a champion no longer he was no more a center of attention and he began to act queerly friends tell how he went on reefer kicks indulged in a variety of excesses frantically embraced the moslem religion and suddenly started grieving inside at the age of frazier explained johnny was accidental witness to the infidelity of a loved one frazier said this troubled johnny constantly in march bratton was knocked out by del flanagan he never fought again within a few months his mind began to slip and soon johnny was taken aboard a van and carried to manteno state mental hospital outside chicago this was september in the years since the preachers son has been largely unknown and unknowing last january a young mother who once might have expected much brought a handsome son ill of infection to detroits childrens hospital in two days he slipped into coma soon passed away ricky bratton a child of tragedy was buried that saturday morning in detroits memorial cemetery the preachers son sits unknowing by will sparks reprinted by permission from the commonweal if law is an ordinance of reason directed to the common good and if american lawmakers are rational men this article will effect the immediate repeal of u s narcotics laws without great difficulty it can be shown that this countrys narcotics laws produce little good but much harm that they rest on false premises that in form and in manner of their enforcement they are destructive of orderly legal process indeed the only reason for not anticipating repeal is that the wisdom of it has been demonstrated many times yet the narcotics laws remain why this should be so is itself an interesting aspect of the controversy products of the indian hemp plant have been used as an intoxicant by millions of people from ancient india to harlem for five thousand years because they are subject to the new york penal law however residents of the latter community are sometimes sent to prison for fifteen years because someone finds them with two ounces of the hemp product they know as marihuana under provisions of the marihuana tax act passed in and now incorporated in the internal revenue code no one can import manufacture sell or buy marihuana in the united states without obtaining certain forms from the treasury department and paying the specified tax since the marihuana act like other federal narcotics legislation is in reality a law to regulate social behavior disguised as a revenue measure the secretary of the treasury invariably refuses to provide the necessary forms traffic in marihuana is perforce illegal and a proper concern of the departments bureau of narcotics behind such legislation lies the belief that use of this venerable intoxicantwhich can be grown in any window flowerboxis destructive to the character or personality of the user that the drug is habitforming that it leads to crimes of violence and in particular to crimes of a sexual nature assuming for a momentand it will be a brief momentthat there is some truth in these allegations there would still be great difficulty in explaining our marihuana legislation for to whatever extent they might be true each of the statements can also be applied to alcohol most of us know at least one individual whose personality has been affected by alcoholism which is a form of drug addiction we are aware that some people become aggressive to the point of violence under the influence of too much whiskey and the aphrodisiac qualities of alcohol are part of our folklore such arguments were in fact vociferously advanced by the advocates of prohibition yet the volstead act has been repealed and america today tolerates despite the existence of four to five million alcoholics some fifty or sixty million social drinkers these latter are sufficiently familiar with their favorite intoxicant and of sufficient number to insist that government recognize alcohol abuse as a problem pertaining to certain users and not to the drug itself marihuana prohibition however remains with us not because of what we know apparently but because of what we do not know the agency most concerned with the effects on human beings of the drug from which we are thus protected by a benevolent government is the u s public health service a film prepared by the research branch of the u s public health service hospital at lexington kentucky for circulation among medical groups shows several experienced marihuana smokers under the drugs influence and states as follows marihuana smokers generally are mildly intoxicated giggle laugh bother no one and have a good time they do not stagger or fall and ordinarily will not attempt to harm anyone it has not been proved that smoking marihuana leads to crimes of a sexual nature smoking marihuana has no unpleasant aftereffects no dependence is developed on the drug and the practice can easily be stopped at any time in fact it is probably easier to stop smoking marihuana cigarettes than tobacco cigarettes almost two decades ago in an effort to prevent use of marihuana from becoming a court martial offense in the military service the editor of the military surgeon col james m phalen md wrote an editorial to which he gave the title the marihuana bugaboo and in which he offered the following conclusions it is my considered opinion that the smoking of the leaves flowers and seeds of cannabis sativa the botanical name for marihuana is no more harmful than the smoking of tobacco it is further considered that the legislation in relation to marihuana was illadvised that it branded as a men ace and a crime a matter of trivial importance finally it is hoped that no witch hunt will be instituted in the military service over a problem that does not exist dr phalen was ignored as medical opinion on this subject is usually ignored but the subsequent continuing witch hunt has at least the advantage of furnishing a corps of imprisoned marihuana users upon whom to experiment and the results of all studies to date have been negative thus a former medical officer in charge of the public health services lexington hospital can state marihuana is not possessed of any mysterious power to force people to commit acts which they would not otherwise perform like alcohol marihuana is an intoxicating drug which releases inhibitions by direct action neither alcohol nor marihuana produces criminal activity and criminal acts may result only insofar as the inhibitions on the personality are removed we see this phenomenon regularly with the consumption of alcohol normal people even when thoroughly intoxicated usually remain affable though their behavior may be silly or even disgusting the psychopath howeverand we all have one or more among our acquaintancesoften tends toward belligerence with the first few drinks and with continued drinking moves toward complete and uncontrolled violence the dockets of police courts are crowded with these cases every morning and of course hundreds of others are kept out of court by good fortune or the handling of the drunk by friends who excuse his fighting and brawling on the grounds that he has had too much to drink in the face of such findings and the utter absence of any to the contrary our marihuana laws should be repealed or at least revised to conform to the various federal state and municipal ordinances regulating alcohol the government should cease imprisoning its citizens for trafficking in a drug which exhaustive research has shown harmless to its user and unproductive of any conduct on his part harmful to society the marihuana statutes are not reasonable are not directed to the common good and neither produce nor preserve happiness for the society they are unjust so also are the diverse statutes regulating opiateseg opium morphine heroinand these are furthermore productive of far more serious and pernicious effects upon the people in whose interest they were misguidedly enacted although hard to credit by those encountering them for the first time the indisputable facts about the opiates are these used long enough or with regularity opiate drugs create a situation in the body which causes the user to get sick when the drug is withdrawn the illness or withdrawal syndrome is however selflimiting and leaves no aftereffects moreover there are no serious toxic effects of any kind associated with the use of opiates including heroin and one may employ them for a lifetime without physical injury dr alfred r lindesmith of indiana university has written it is impossible to interpret the effects of a drug habit upon a persons social life or his character in terms of organic deterioration or alleged toxic effects there are no demonstrable major effects that necessarily follow the use of opiate drugsaddicts escape most of the alleged degenerative results of the drug if they are sufficiently welltodo and many addicts suffer serious character deterioration only after the narcotic agents catch up with them in other countries about which we have excellent information addicts do not suffer the evil effects that are forced upon american users they do not steal lie engage in prostitution or become derelicts to the extent that our addicts do it seems quite clear that american opiate addicts steal or engage in prostitution not from the effects of the drug but from the effects of laws laws which transform a cheap and common chemical into a priceless commodity able to support a vast criminal drug traffic having created the economic basis for this traffic with passage of the harrison narcotics act in our lawmakers have for fortyseven long years been unable to eradicate it in the meanwhile unnecessary human misery the civic corruption which accompanies opiate prohibition no less than alcohol prohibition remain the hallmarks of u s drug control policies there is no excuse for this the problem of heroin morphine and other opium derivatives is inherently more complicated for where marihuana is less habit forming than tobacco the opiates are very definitely addicting drugs in soberly considering the question of addiction however we must endeavor to suppress certain emotional irrelevanciesnot least of which is an inward fear of temptation many of us are disturbed by the thought of chemically sustained happiness or euphoria whether from tranquilizers the soma of brave new world or heroin this is a legitimate and real concern and one which deserves discussion but it must not be allowed to muddy our thinking about the justice of u s narcotics legislation these narcotics laws are not predicated on a reasoned objection to hedonism or some newfangled chemical eudaemonism they are based on the supposition that drugs like heroin are so harmful that we are compelled to treat them as a class apart spend millions vainly attempting to enforce prohibition and turn a deaf ear to the importunities of addicts whom we thus consign to the underworld when this supposition is shown to be unfoundedand such is the overwhelming import of forty years of researchand when the laws based upon it themselves produce undeniable and widespread evil then such legislation should in all logic be abandoned it may be suggested that the fact of a drugs being addicting is in itself sufficient justification for prohibition the difficulty is that it is impossible to write a definition of addicting which does not include alcohol to use the words of dr harris isbell of the u s public health service statistically alcohol is the most important of all addicting depressant drugs contrasting the effects of alcohol and opiate addiction dr roy p finney has written alcohol is by long odds the worst habitforming drug known to man not only is chronic alcoholism many times more common than morphinism but in point of view of viciousness bacchus excels morpheus in many important respects morphine does not intoxicate hence as a driver of a motor vehicle for example the morphine addict is quite safe while the alcoholic is a menace to society the libidinous insulting stare the fermentative halitosis the disheveled inebriate lying comatose in his own vomitsuch things have no counterpart in morphinism it was dr j d reichard who observed that the alcoholic gets high comes home and beats his wife while the morphine or heroin addict gets high comes homeand his wife beats him u s narcotics legislation beginning with the harrison act of is a product of the same mentality which produced the unfortunate and unlamented volstead act of five years later every argument against the latter law applies equally to the former our failure to so apply them results from the relative unpopularity of opiate drugs in our society and our consequent ignorance regarding them as well as from a profound revulsion of the same ethnic origin as that which causes an hashhishusing arab to abhor the whiskey dens of the decadent west america survived repeal of the volstead act and would survive repeal of the harrison law federal narcotic legislation and the local legislation inspired by it is unreasonable in the light of informed opinion concerning narcotics addiction it is productive of much social evil and personal unhappiness incorporated in the internal revenue code ostensibly as a revenue measure it exercises a control over the use of opiates which in the case of alcohol was permitted only by constitutional amendment and which the people ultimately rejected as unwise for all these reasons control of narcotics should be transferred to the food and drug administration which should see to it rigorously that narcotics are dispensed only by or on the prescription of a physician as prescribed by the federal food drug and cosmetic act the federal bureau of narcotics should be reduced to a role comparable to that of the treasurys alcohol tax unit and the government henceforth refrain from repressive measures calculated to prohibitor rather to drive into the control of criminalsthe seemingly inevitable use of such moodchanging drugs as alcohol marihuana and heroin it should do so because its present conduct is irrational ineffective socially harmful andto repeat unjust by richard rive bemies pamphlets coming up what about athlone athlones ready coming up we need three extra workers at athlone and one in claremont jims been arrested when they pick him up last night cops caught him putting up strike notices wheres he now claremont policestation mervyns trying for bail hope he gets it athlone coming up for cape town central hell thatll take some counting gotta have it ready by tonight new shift working in cape town no same five plus eight students hope all this is in aid of something think theyll come out who the workers they should but the colored workers are the problem african dependable they should be after the last time you know of course pac will come out against us i dont think thats any problem could be serious they have strong support in the cape not quite our problem at the moment we have pamphlets to count right lets get stuck into cape town central ok there is something about upper long street that is different from the lower half it is clean and dirty modern and oldfashioned plastic and enamel with just a touch of crinoline and the sedan chair it is moral and immoral its shops are respectable its lanes notorious it contains bankmanagers and clerks whores and pimps mosques and churches englishmen afrikaners coloreds moslems africans jews gentiles germans greeks italians it is south african and unsouth african the lower half is sophisticated and pretentious the upper half vulgar and unpretentious boston cloete and lennie damons turned into it from wale street we nearing the bookshop now its not far to go only two blocks further boston said i hope so do you think hell have it ready who katzen i suppose so i dont know the man apparently hes a strong sympathizer that explains why he is helping to distribute pamphlets whos supposed to drop them joel this looks like the shop boston spoke with a slightly affected accent which made people look at him a second time in conversation and wonder where he came from it offended at first until one became used to it his face was dark brown with heavy bushy eyebrows and a firm jaw his hair was black and wavy in durban he could pass for an indian only his accent gave him away he was soberly dressed except for a brown suede jacket which he hoped gave him a bohemian touch just sufficient to indicate that he wrote short stories he was in his late twenties and starting to put on weight he paused outside a dimlylit secondhand bookshop and compared the number on the door with that on the back of the envelope he took from his jacket pocket yeah lennie agreed peering over his shoulder seems like it lennie was as taciturn as boston was voluble he became cynical when aroused very dark of complexion he was often mistaken for african he didnt like being mistaken for african his face was round and the skin smooth and healthy he was an artist fairly successful but his portly shape belied the myth of a starving painter his clothes were neat somewhat loud in contrast to his cautious personality many thought him arrogant and he did nothing to counteract his reputation well lets go in boston said the bookshop was empty except for a bespectacled attendant sitting at a desk in a far comer and a university student paging through teach yourself calculus it was dark inside after the brilliant glare of long street and it took boston some time to get accustomed to the light the university student nodded to the attendant and left lennie wandered over to the africana section may i help you well yes boston hesitantly began are you mr katzen yes im cloete boston cloete im supposed to pick up a parcel left for me oh yes its at the back of the shop is that the parcel joel left thats it ill get it for you wont be a minute he disappeared into a back room so lennie asked raising his eyebrows he seems all right wonder if he knows joel he must or about the strike pamphlets possibly seems a sympathiser there are i few whites nowadays prepared to help i guess so mr katzen reappeared with a brownpaper parcel tied with string here we are thanks thanks very much mr kat zen boston said putting it into his empty satchel havent i met you before the bookdealer enquired he seemed j the talkative type boston felt he had to get away he was still suspicious and selfconscious about most whites i dont think so are you by any means a writer well yes i try to thats it i remember your name i read some of your stuff yes i cannot recollect where but i remember the name distinctly boston cloete thats it i liked your stories very much boston felt embarrassed he found compliments gratifying but was never quite sure how to accept them lennie watched patiently this is len damons oh yes the artist yes the artist lennie repeated they shook hands and an uncomfortable pause followed well thanks again mr katzen we must be off good luck and i hope everything works out all right they left the dark interior for the bustle and brilliant sunshine outside it was one of those bright saturday mornings wonder if he can be trusted boston said wonder lennie repeated vast patrols next week in peninsula police chiefs reassurance peninsula is prepared for a possible strike undeclared state of emergency begins the people demand a national convention he found his own relations hardest to convince blearyeyed from lack of sleep arguing canvassing threatening discussing but what do you want us to do stay at home during the strike its easy for you to say so but what about us we must learn to take risks yes but i have a wife and kids there are wives and kids all over south africa but this looks like every man for himself i must look after the interests of my own children i wonder if your children will agree with you one day my wifes all right mary understands i can keep the kids from school for the strike but joe and i must work and if you turn up and find all your colleagues stayed at home then i come back but you would have gone look its too big a sacrifice to expect from a family man there are plenty of family men all over south africa who are prepared to make the sacrifice that might very well be but the fact remains that if i dont report for work they might kick me out so so where does a colored man find another job where did you find the one you have now will you politicians find me another dont be silly my kids will starve so that their kids might eat one day im not thinking of one day im thinking of my children not in ten years time or next year but next month im thinking of ten years time all very well for you to speak so but i must consider my position think it over but think fast there isnt much time i dont think theres anything to think over well make an attempt at any rate long street was crowded with office workers lastminute shoppers women with babies tramps newspapervendors slick citytypes wontworks bus boston and lennie made their way towards the central area edging and dodging between people the noongun boomed from signal hill boston adjusted his wristwatch must get to castle stationers before lennie said why on earth i want to buy some drawing paper cant it wait no i have to paint over the weekend hell must you buy it now it wont take a minute we must get these pamphlets to alec by well make it there are plenty of buses theyre usually crowded at peak hour well manage they wove their way through the crowd boston stopped to buy a times what does it say the countrys jittery the whole damn south africas jittery strike fever yes what a way to welcome their new republic boston accelerated the pace you helping to distribute leaflets tonight no why the hell not boston turned on him im a painter not a pseudopolitician were all in on this are we ive not been invited thats not funny at all didnt intend it as such must you go through life as a cynic if you prefer it that way o go to hell boston always felt annoyed at lennie when the conversation reached that stage it had often happened before he knew it was useless to continue in the same strain he would start arguing and the more excited he became the more cynically lennie would react finally it would sink to the level of personalities he walked on moodily refusing to continue the conversation cigarette lennie asked peace offering come off it no thanks oh well artists of the world unite your world is so small i love it comfortable isnt it boston sneered very but it doesnt cramp my style but then your style is extremely limited isnt it terribly so confined to posterity what price arrogance they continued their silent walk long street was becoming less crowded but queues stretched along the pavements so boston began meaning to paint masterpieces over the weekend one can but try except that one might succeed that would be a pity how is your novel getting on your answer to dreiser the great south african tragedy no time for writing these days too busy helping to organize a strike how noble yes its terribly hard work not being selfish behold i take upon my shoulders all the burdens of south africa drop dead you started it did i they continued without saying a word till they reached castle stationers ill wait outside boston said alright now dont take a helluva time boston leaned against a lamppost and lit a cigarette the newspaper was full of strike news he scanned the headlines a huge gas explosion at coalbrook high heels prevent city mayors hike thousands arrested in mass police raids theyre jittery he thought damn jittery he hoped that lennie wouldnt be long there was alec to meet at cape town is ready to cope with strike every hope republic will have peaceful birth we the people are granite durban coloreds on the march transvaal coloreds up in arms two nonwhite men one a young university student dropping leaflets in letter boxes pm in district six you take the next block be careful right how many pamphlets are left quite a few still in the car ill take the first ten houses no dogs i hope take my torch but dont use it unless its really necessary this is sure risky i know have a cigarette before you go thanks first time you do this yes youll learn i suppose so we still have six blocks to do whats the time now twentyfive to twelve looks like a police van dont move keep still no its ok oh well breathe again we must be careful theyre picking up too many of us i hear they picked up bill and margery last night yes but margerys out bills still in believe they went to house where the owner phoned the police bloody swine in either case its better not to knock just slip the leaflet under the door or in the letterbox then run not really unless its necessary ok ill tackle this row meet you in the car ill take the next block all in order v see you later boston finished his cigarette and stubbed it out impatiently against the lamppost damn it was time lennie came he tried to do the crossword puzzle twelve across discovered a stout domestic penny he gave it up he glanced at his watch and get to alec by there was no sense in standing around he might as well find lennie inside and shake him up he spotted him patiently stand ing at the crowded stationery counter while whites were being served first his face was impassive as usual like an african dan mask one never knew what lennie thought or felt unless he spoke boston tried to catch his eye but lennie stared stolidly ahead of him oh well boston walked over to the bookshelves his eyes ran over the titles plays pleasant pursuit of love the floating chinaman he removed the last named from the shelves what a giddy title this is a book one must not read emphatically not he replaced it somehow he had a strong feeling that he was being watched he looked around selfconsciously the shop was crowded and no one looked as if there was time to pay any attention to him there were so many books one must not read sex detection space fiction he would not shake off the feeling of being watched but then he always felt selfconscious about his presence in a crowd lennie still waiting to be served and alec to meet at he removed modern american short stories from the shelf hemingway katherine porter erskine caldwell he glanced at the introduction the americans have a genius for the short story may i help you he looked up selfconsciously at the rather downatheel shop assistant in a pink overall may i help you no thanks its quite all right he said somewhat confused im waiting for someone just waiting he halfsmiled at her are you sure he detected a slight suspicion in her voice yes quite sure why i only asked sorry she turned around and walked away hurriedly boston didnt like it he wished to god lennie would get done should he have come in should he have waited outside why the hell should he he walked over to the stationery counter one cant even look at books in a shop without attracting attention he wished lennie would finish so that they could get the hell out of the place meet alec at it was now close on to christ was it a crime for a colored man to read books in south africa couldnt one even remove books from a shelf excuse me was every nonwhite a potential thief pimp liar excuse me the manager stared down at him weak blue eyes peering through strong lenses in contrast to his huge size the assistant fidgeted at his side yes miss smart claims she saw you putting a book into your satchel the assistant nodded agreement of all the bloody cheek please control your language do you mind mind what opening your satchel yes i do mind i mind very much may i ask what you have in there encyclopaedia britannica and van riebeeks journals im not asking for your sarcasm and im not asking for your cheek will you please open your satchel im waiting for a friend thats not my business neither are the contents of my satchel very well if you insist on being difficult i shall have to call the police boston felt strong resentment humiliation had he been a white man they would have taken him to the privacy of the managers office a crowd collected must he be subjected to all this they could call the whole bloody police force he would not open his satchel whats up lennie enquired anxiously as he came over im accused of stealing books hell so so theyve gone to fetch the cops thats bad yeah what are we going to do we stay right here that could be nasty well im not a bloody thief the crowd increased in size the manager bustled his way through leading a policesergeant and an ordinary constable whats your name the sergeant demanded cloete boston cloete age twentyseven years address is all this necessary address eight church street crawford where do you work im a writer a what a writer the crowd giggled the sergeant noted down the details in his book well then open your bag boston reluctantly started undoing the straps the constable grabbed the satchel from him and removed the brown paper parcel he handed it to the sergeant whats in here lady chatterleys lover which i wrapped up before i stole it from the childrens section the sergeant glared at him then commenced undoing the string he removed a pamphlet and read slowly his eyes hardened oh i see he said ill give you lady chatterley come along with me by dr benjamin spock i guess that most of us have some kind of prejudice though a prejudice may be positive we usually think of the negative kind the objection to a whole class of people on the basis of experience with a certain number or simply on hearsay some prejudices like those against divorcees artists clergymen or ivy leaguers cause disadvantage only to the people who hold them in the sense that these individuals automatically cut themselves off from contacts which might be valuable in different ways its the prejudices shared by the members of a dominant group and carried out into discrimination against others which really hurt i try to imagine sometimes how painful it must be for a parent to have to tell his young son and it has to be told by the time he is four or five that he will automatically be considered undesirable no matter how good his character and behavior that he will have to be prepared for slights and insults beginning soon if your child is being picked on by one bully its not difficult to explain that this individual is rude or all mixed up but what do you say when it is the bulk of the community it must be hard to reconcile this for him with the religious and ethical ideals you are trying to teach about gods justice the good intentions of most people the obligation to respect them we know that children and adults are influenced to behave according to the expectations of the community i think its a tribute to the good job done by the overwhelming majority of parents of scorned groups that their children have grown up not too seriously impaired by the low opinion in which they are held in the community we are less apt to think about the effect of serious prejudices on those who hold themand on their children at first glance you might think that being in the supposedly preferred position they wouldnt really be harmed but i think that from the psychological point of view there must always be at least some damage to personality the young child who is being taughtby parents or playmates to look down on or shun a group is usually being given the impression that they are somehow dangerous remarks such as they arent like us they arent nice theyre dirty have a vaguely ominous sound its left to the anxious imagination of the preschooler to picture just what the danger consists of this has the same effect on children as giving them fears about policemen or bogeymen or kidnapers which most educated parents try to avoid nowadays to the degree that the child takes the warnings seriously he feels endangered by the group this impairs his trust in people andmore seriouslyhis trust in his own ability to deal with people it also gives him as he grows older an unwholesome method for bolstering his ego when he secretly feels inadequate i think that most of us when we hear a grown man making sneering remarks about a minority immediately sense his lack of selfconfidence his readiness to seek solace through scorn and we lose some of our respect for him so it seems to me unhealthy from the point of view of the childs own welfare to start him out with readymade fears readymade selfdoubts readymade props i suppose that the readiness of human beings to believe ill of an entire group or to swell their dislike of a few individuals into a wholesale prejudice is a capacity which was built into humanity during the savage process of evolution so that men who were threatened with a genuine plot or an enemy tribe would be suspicious enough to fit little pieces of evidence together and to take alarm it is illuminating and disheartening to read for instance a description by an anthropologist of tribe a on a pacific island who are nice people but who believe that tribe b a few miles away are fiends when the anthropologist moves over to live with tribe b he finds that they too are agreeable people but they feel terribly threatened by what they consider the bloodthirsty barbarians of tribe a in a discouragingly similar way in times of hot or cold war in the twentieth century russians germans britons japanese americans have been easily convinced that the enemy were hardly human but experience in the psychiatric clinic as well as in life shows us that there is enormous variation in the amount of suspiciousness and hostility in different individuals one child grows up ready to hate almost everybody another reared in an unusually loving and peaceful family cannot be taught a deep distrust of anyone it may be helpful for our discussion if i point out some of the violently prejudiced distortions of thinking which are obvious in the mentalhospital patients whom we call paranoid this should aid our understanding of some of the deeply hidden roots of ordinary prejudice in everyday people since most of us have the capacity to think in a slightly paranoid way when we feel threatened if insecurity drives the paranoid individual into delusions he imagines that he is both a victim of persecution and at the same time a highly important personagethe head of the secret service for instance or the leader of a worldwide religious sect he keeps enlarging his estimate of the plot against himself until it involves an entire fraternal order or the hierarchy of another religion or international communism though his reaction is insanely exaggerated it reminds us of the ordinary person whose sense of inadequacy makes him feel threatened by a whole group and who tries to overcome it by thinking and talking about how superior he is to them paranoid individuals are also haunted by sexual jealousy they frequently imagine when sick that many people are carrying on successful affairs with their spouses hitler who was not insane by the usual definition but who was severely paranoid in personality rose to power in part by selling his idea that the jews were all plotting together to destroy germany and he and many of his henchmen kept themselves in a frenzy with the fantasy that the jews were successfully seducing aryan girls on a wholesale scale in the end he nearly destroyed his nation this reminds us of the preoccupation of some raceprejudiced americans from all parts of the country whose most impassioned arguments for segregation is their assumption that if white girls should go to school with negroes or work with them theyd automatically prefer to marry them these men repeat with childish belief fantastic tales about the superior virility of negroes doctors know that sexual success and doubt and failure are the monopoly of no race when the integrated use of childrens public swimming pools has been discussed in certain cities the agitated opponents have not objected so much to boys swimming with boys or girls with girls but to white girls swimming with negro boys these examples from the hospital and from the outside world give us clues to the basic importance of insecurityincluding sexual insecurityin prejudice fear of competition for jobs is another factor but this is not to say that only the sick or the very insecure are prejudiced if that were true the solution would lie entirely within the field of preventive psychiatry it would be an enormous burden for psychiatry but it would excuse the rest of the community unfortunately a degree of prejudice can be taught easily to all except those who are thoroughly trustful and loving a tragic example is the apartheid movement in south africa in which political leaders have convinced a majority of the electorate without valid evidence or provocation that they are so threatened that they must enact harshly discriminatory laws against negroes and asians this campaign of fear and hostility is creating of course the corresponding feelings in those who are attacked thus the political majority has made itself sick with suspicion and is inviting its own destruction babies and small children may be temporarily frightened by someone who appears strangein pigmentation or garb or manner or tone of voice but they sooner or later come to trust anyone who is sympathetic and affectionate by four and five they are interested in their parents ideas about the world and sensitive to their parents feelings about individual people but they are not so ready for generalizations and rationalizations that they can be said to have fixed prejudices more important in regard to their future is whether they have learned to trust their parents consistent love and through this to trust other people generally and themselves for the specific teaching of tolerance or intolerance i think that the early school years are particularly important at this age the child by his very nature is easily able to be pushed in either direction he is seriously interested in what the outside worldof contemporaries and adultsconsiders right and wrong he feels the obligation to channel his aggression within socially acceptable limits he wants to be a member of the right group and to conform to its pattern hes ready to disapprove of wrong individuals and groups if he spends these years with friends and adults who have common prejudices he takes these to be not only permissible but noble hes proud to be included as a soldier on what he assumes is the righteous side but if his parents and particularly his teacher whom he now considers a higher authority than parents take advantage of the occasions provided by books the news the neighborhood the classroom itself they can teach tolerance instead they can agree with him that everyone has personal likes and dislikes most of which hes entitled to they can show him that every racial religious and nationality group has produced benefactors scoundrels and everything in between they can point out that the very same groups which are looked down on in one country are well accepted in another they should explain with regret that prejudices are held in all parts of the country and that much of the undesirable behavior of certain members of groups for which the whole group is blamed are fostered by the discrimination they suffer they can demonstrate by all kinds of examples that acceptance brings out the best in everyone when children are taught tolerance they do not merely accept it grudgingly they respond to it and practice it with enthusiasm because it appeals to their straightforward sense of right i know because ive seen it happen in families and in good schools by robert d twiggs it is like searching for the one woman with j whom jesus christ had an illicit love affair i thought as i gazed dejectively at the hundreds of pages of worn wrinkled documents and manuscripts on the table before me it just isnt there and yet what i was looking for had to be there there was so much hidden in between those pages during the previous two years of agonizing days and sleepless nights i had read the words in those documents ten thousand times over i had long since come to the conclusion that it was what those words did not say that i had to find it was what no written documents revealed that i had to discover thirteen of us sat around the long mahogany table in the lobby of the theater at the university of iowa that warm day in late spring ten years ago we were the members of the playwrighting seminar analyzing and discussing each others plays hoping that through such discourse each member would derive some particle of constructive criticism to aide him in the writing of his respective play my play was on the agenda for that particular discussion i had selected to write about the wellknown and very eccentric scientist george washington carver the peanut wizard of tuskegee institute in alabama it is a matter of record that george washington carver was a great scientist and discovered hundreds of useful products what is not yet known is the scope and significance of dr carvers chief discovery that is what it took me ten years to find that one hidden discovery out of the hundreds that was his most important most useful contribution to humanity evidence of its existence was well known my job was to isolate it and bring it out of its hiding place into the open where it could be used and applied by the civilization to which it had been given as indiscriminately as every other thing that carver discovered what has not yet been revealed to the american public and to the world at large is that scientist carver spent many years over the test tube and in the fields to discover a cure for one of the worst and most insidious diseases that ever plagued mankind the more i searched into the life and works of this great man this freak of society by analogy to our present day expectations who made his services available to anyone for the mere asking and gave over sixty billion dollars in talent to the world for free the more difficult it became to isolate that one discovery that accounted for his greatness i pondered the facts as they presented themselves to me there has to be some contribution to society that affects the life of every single human to one degree or another after all isnt that the only means of determining true and lasting greatness it is easy to locate in a pasteur or a curie it is far more difficult to point out in a carver since contrary to the usual pattern carvers greatness preceded the knowledge of his most important discovery it was that very factor however that gave me to know in the beginning that the discovery was existent but hidden i knew too that until it was found that everything that george washington carver ever did would be in terms of historical achievement and lasting greatness limited to the realm of mediocrity this would indeed have been an error in history for if there is anything that george washington carver was not it is average the two hours that i had spent in seminar that evening had been as fruitless and trying as the many others in which carver was the subject of discussion we had analyzed his life and works but could not find a single discovery that was universally outstanding to the extent that it affected the life of each person individually we all agreed that there were hundreds of products of merit that had served a specific need during a particularly grave period in a given situation his discovery of a substitute for quinine from the hulls of peanuts to save the lives of the people around him who were dying of malaria because of the lack of quinine is a typical example but the one discovery that could unmistakably make life better and more tolerable for all humanity seemed to have been missing there were outstanding developments from soybeans milk that was as good as cows milk developed from peanuts to feed the starving young patented discoveries of new species of useful plants that had eluded the searching eyes and trained minds of scientists since the beginning of time there had been notable experiments conducted at the ford laboratory to add to the advancement of the automobile industry new methods of agriculture de veloped to give life back to the dying soil new shades of dyes and colors from sweet potatoes peanuts and worthless clay to enhance the beauty of gods universe and hundreds of others that were given to meet a specific need but that were never recorded but which was the greater trying to find that was like running headon into a stone wall and my head throbbed from each one of those sessions he carefully guarded each experiment in this discovery with total and reverent secrecy only he and his god were permitted that secret knowledge during his lifetime at the end of that discussion excepting the late e c mabie head of the drama and speech department at iowa i stood alone in believing that such a discovery existed the incredibility of carvers ventures of his life as he lived it and of his faith as a scientist in the supernatural was one of the more difficult obstacles that i had to overcome in my search i asked myself how could a man of science have had such faith in god to the extent that he claimed divine communication and supernatural guidance in making his scientific discoveries what did he mean when said god tells me what to do is the secret to be found there incredible sitting there in the theater lobby that day at the university of iowa i had no way of knowing then that before morning of the following day that i too would have had an experience so incredible that it would defy all reason as mans limited senses know reason upon leaving the theater seminar i had the horrible feeling of emptiness that one sometimes experiences when face to face with defeat i felt a strong need for complete relaxation some means of escape whereby i could forget the culminating failures of the past two years that had suddenly landed with one big blow several of us walked from the theater past the art building and along the bank of the iowa river which ran through the campus gently tossing its pale blue waters against the gray stone embankment the sunset hovered over the brink of the distant horizon of the west like a giant disc of dying embers the whole campus was alive with spring and the cool breeze off the waters felt good to my lungs we crossed the north bridge that spanned the river to the east campus and stopped at the iowa union for the usual cup of coffee with the club a heterogeneous group of males and females who discussed everything from einstein to burlesque it so happened that einstein had the floor right off and since too much carver in one day had already given me a momentarily strong aversion to science or scientists i enticed one of the fairer sex of the group to accompany me to the dance floor we understood each other at once she was intelligent beautiful and uninhibited and a little lonely two hours later we had found our own place of privacy on the grass under the stars the presence of her warmth in my arms relaxed me completely our lips met in a tremendous release of passions and i forgot all about carver and his great discovery i was glad to be alive at eleven oclock that night i was walking home alone i took the long walkway that ran up the gently sloping grade on the north side of the quadrangle dormitories a grove of trees stood tall and green on each side of the broad stone walkway near the top of the grade stood one giant tree that towered above the rest as if in guardianship over them there was nothing strange or eerie about the night i had no reason to suspect the unusual would happen it was certainly not the kind of night on which one would expect to see a ghost or in any way encounter the forces of the supernatural it was in fact a bright starlit night with not a cloud to be seen and the wind blew so mildly that it would scarcely have swayed a falling feather from its course as i walked slowly up the grade thinking about the wonderful time i had had with my date that evening i had a feeling of peaceful exhilaration she had been good for me being with her had cleared the confusion from my mind now i could think clearly again i mused there was only one thing to be done now and i would do that yes i would give up this preposterous search that was the only sensible thing to do this carver fellow didnt make any sense anyway talking to plants and getting answers from them and all of that god speaking to him and telling him what to do no it just could not have happened for the first time in two years i had actually thought out my real reason for failure without realizing it i was to learn ten years later that the real failure was in my not being able to believe and accept the facts that i had already found i had rationalized carver clear out of my mind i thought again on the pleasantries of the evening as i walked along in the night i had come to near the top of the grade and was walking under the huge branches of the giant tree when a very strange thing happened suddenly for no apparent reason at all i had a very strong impulse to run quickly it is a ridiculous thing to do without reason but without question or thought i ran as fast as i could the only sound to be heard in the stillness of the night was the sound of my running feet against the stone walk soon i stopped running and started walking at a slow pace again while laughing at myself for being so silly then as suddenly as the impulse had struck me came the fierce cracking sound from the sky above my head fol lowed by a thunderous crashing of the giant tree to the stone pavement i had run just far enough to escape by inches the path of its sprawling branches it had split almost in half the next morning i returned to the scene of that incredible experience to examine that tree i was even more amazed to discover that there were no old cracks or lacerations in the wood the place where the tree had split was fresh and green this indicated that the tree had split instantaneously that nightafter i had run clear of the place where it was to land it was then that i began to understand the credibility of the methods and objectives of george washington carver which had until then seemed absolutely incredible i still was not able to isolate his most important discovery at that time but my experience of having received an inner revelation of an impending danger through a sense about which science has no knowledge consequently a sense to which science gives no credit gave me to know that carver had in fact received messages from plant life that god had told him what to do through some sense other than the five known senses of man these unknown senses which science is now beginning to believe that we all possess but may not recognize must have been very highly developed in carver after leaving the university of iowa with a masters degree in speech and drama i continued my search for carvers most important discovery ten years of searching the written records a visit to tuskegee institute and the carver museum and the interviewing of scores of persons who knew him during his lifetime has led me to the conclusion that the many individual discoveries that george washington carver made and gave unselfishly to the world were actually only sequential experiments in an objective progression to his one great discovery which because of its seemingly incredibility could not be revealed during his lifetime likewise because of its very nature it demanded his life in order to be successful beyond doubt his death marked the completion and success of his great discovery of a cure for one of the worst and most insidious diseases of mankindgreed he had made himself a lifelong guinea pig to discover a cure for mans greed it had been an incredible undertaking which demanded the existence of an incredible life not even the most skeptical can deny that george washington carvers great discovery has been successfully tested and proved at least once by george washington carver himself how long it will take humanity to reach the critical stages of the disease of greed when at such time it will have no alternative for its own salvation but to make use of carvers cure is open to speculation is it not possible to start making application of carvers cure to some degree on a domestic and world level now would it not be of national and human interest for parents and schools to provide their children with the knowledge of the existence of carvers cure would this not provide the world with the needed incentive to obtain the peace and harmony that heretofore only the immortal gods have claimed possible is not the very fact that carver was a mortal in our own time the key to the value of his cure or must we wait until the united states and russia land side by side in another world to make use of the cure or will it be after those incredible unknown senses reach full maturity in man only time can tell the one thing that is now certain however is that whenever the world becomes receptive to carvers cure it will be a much better world in which to live the time for first application is now the world should have one holiday in common as a first step in applying carvers cure i prescribe that the world set aside and observe a george washington carver day this would be one holiday that both communists and capitalists alike could celebrate together some may prefer calling my strange experience precognition but i agree with george washington carver in calling it god a blueprint for real freedom we are at war today the battle lines ww j are clearly drawn laos south africa iran east germany the american hemispherewherever communism and those powers representing western civilization meet there the lines exist the worlds battle lines run right through the heart of cleveland and you and i are involved our sector is a small one but its issues are the fundamental ones people are deciding on everywhere the issues of mans worth and dignity the system of government under which he can best realize this dignity the kind of society which will give him the opportunity to grow lets examine one of these issues in detail racial discrimination its battle line circles the globe from clevelands hough to new yorks harlem from london to johannesburg to bombay to singapore the line runs and on opposing sides communism and the western world face each other in the struggle for mens allegiance you and i are in this struggle whether we choose to be or not we must win it not halfway around the world but here in our small sector of cleveland what is the situation in cold blunt facts were failing our responsibilities to the negro in cleveland or to put it more directly we as americans are failing other americans simply because of racial bias they have been segregated in ghettos and told in effect stay where you are dont move into white neighborhoods they have not been provided with adequate educational opportunities they have been guaranteed an inferior standard of living through discriminatory employment practicespractices in which management and labor unions share equal blame it is not a pretty picture and it has been going on for a long time world war i marked the beginning of the problem war plants needed workers so industrial agents were sent into the south to hire negroes they came to cleveland in carloads many of them with only the clothes they were wearing bound for what agents had painted as a promised land what they found was a city with substandard housing facilities for them a city with little understanding of their problems and little disposition to care a city whose limited social agencies were unable to handle their problems families began doubling up crowding in on each other the slums began by within a year period clevelands negro population had risen to and with the beginning of world war ii the process started all over again war plants needing labor negro labor migrating up from the south inadequate provision to care for them and the spread of slum areas in the heart of the city in years later the nonwhite population in cuyahoga county was in an increase of per cent the negro today represents per cent of the total county population about per cent of the city population by as a conservative estimate it will reach around per cent this in brief is the story of how the negro came here and why what has he found lets examine this from three standpoints environment education and employment from the standpoint of environ ment the negro has found a ghetto not the walled ghetto that existed in poland during the war but the american kind the ghetto bounded by invisible walls of race prejudice he is segregated here as surely as if he lived in memphis or macon or little rock under law of course he is not segregated he is as free as his white neighbor to move about and settle where he pleases but he doesnt the walls of prejudice are high when a negro moves into a white neighborhood he usually pays higher rent and buys his home at a higher price he lives quite often within a silent enemy encampment the price of acceptance comes high so high in fact that the majority of negroes prefer to live within the invisible walls of their ghettos the kinsman area mt pleasant glenville hough and central these areas all look the same dwellings that range from frame houses to suite apartments small lots narrow alleys occasional junkfilled vacant lots most of the dwellings are old and substandard as to facilities many are pestholes and firetraps privacy is the exception overcrowding the rule we in cleveland have done as much if not more than any other city in the nation in our approach to slum clearance relocation and urban renewal we have a right to be proud but the slum is still with us so is the big question what are we going to do about it from the standpoint of environment the negro has found a slum from the standpoint of education he has found a school system which as yet has been unable to meet his problems a cleveland newspaperman put his finger on it a few years ago eleventh grade dixie style he said is eighth grade or lower here this means that when a negro student from the south enters our public school system we have two alternatives we can put him among students of the same educational level or we can place him among students of his own age if we go by educational standards we force a or yearold negro to fit into the highly immature social pattern of and yearolds if we put the student in his own age and classroom group where he is the slowest member the entire class is slowed to his pace the answer to this of course is special remedial classes for the migrant negrobut we have failed to provide them instead we forced an added burden of teaching upon the schools and a cruel burden of learning upon students trying to keep up but unable to do so as a result the number of negro dropouts from high schoolor grade school for that matteris dispro portionately higher than that of whites and because of overcrowded school conditions little effort is made to encourage them to return the result a growing army of unemployed youth ages no job to work at no school to attend one strike against them because of their color another because they lack a high school diploma as for college education despite the fac hat we have many fine higher educational plants here in cuyahoga county one percent of the students are negro although negroes account for per cent of the countys population our churches have failed the negro too and by our i mean both negro and white churches in cleveland as a protestant im sorry to say that protestant denominations are most to blame unlike the roman catholic church which took care of its own the great wave of catholic european immigrants to cleveland the protestant churches have largely ignored the southern negro as the white parishioners move to the suburbs the church moves with them and the methodist and baptist successors from the south are left on their own the result churches in abandoned store fronts an inadequately trained ministry an unfinanced church organization and a shallow religious life which fails to meet the deeply spiritual needs of the negro there are of course a few magnificent exceptions from the third major standpoint that of employment the negro has been the victim of discrimination in a peculiarly subtle form he has not been denied work he has simply been denied the opportunity to work at jobs for which he is qualified both by skill and education i think we may as well face a few hard facts about this in our job market today the negro is still the last to be hired and the first to be fired despite qualifications for higherlevel jobs he is for the most part accepted only for unskilled and semiskilled jobs a negro competing with a white man for a professional managerial technical or responsible clerical job hasnt a chanceunless he is dealing with a company which makes a point of nondiscrimination in employment procedures thus the negro is doomed by prejudice and by lack of educational opportunities to accept the lowerskilled jobs the kind hardest hit in a recession the result inequalities of earning power and widespread unemployment average annual income of a negro family for example is that of an average white family and when unemployment strikes economic hardship follows a similar pattern in for example percent of the white labor force was unemployed at the same time negro unemployment was up to percent as with housing and education however the employment picture is not entirely dark we have made slow but steady progress over the past quartercentury in providing more negroes with job opportunities in industry weve whittled away at the barriers of discriminatory practices but management and labor alike have a long way to go before racial democracy exists in their ranks this is the negro situation today in cleveland what are the effects of such a situation you can sum it up in one word waste waste of people waste of dollars waste of a way of life waste of people look at the situation a moment today america needs to use every available resource it has in its tremendous struggle against worldwide communism yet were neglecting the negro were failing to qualify onetenth of our total population to join fully in this competitive effort even to support himself and this is waste waste of people we definitely need all of us are very prone to speak of what were doing for the negro weve reached a point where wed better start thinking what can the negro do for us translate this waste of people into economics and the cost becomes impressive nationally our economy produces around billion a year ten per cent of the people engaged in that production are operating at about halflevel in terms of annual income because negro annual income is about half that of white butif that per cent could be brought up to full operating level it would mean a billion increase in our gross national product in years from now a billion increase examined from the marketing angle waste also exists the negro race today has a purchasing power of billion if that could be doubled another billion would be added to the nations purchasing power and this is a home market were spending millions abroad cultivating foreign markets yet here at home is a market of million negroes more people than there are in canada more than in norway sweden and denmark combined almost as many as in belgium and the netherlands combined indeed if we should merely reduce negro unemployment to the same level as white unemployment negro purchasing power could be increased two or three billion dollars annually on the local level the cost of prejudice is also high were wasting human skills and services that could contribute to the economic health of the area were wasting a large segment of potential purchasing power and were paying for this wasteout of our pockets in tax dollars the reason is the slum it devours health and welfare dollars in for example cuyahoga county paid out over million in health and welfare costs the negro race constituting only per cent of the population received per cent to per cent of that money the slum breeds crime it can do nothing else for overcrowding creates antagonisms deprivation leads to theft it is not surprising therefore that between per cent and per cent of major crimes are committed by negroes but this has nothing to do with race according to a statement made by a high cleveland police official some years ago if the same number of whites were crowded into the negro areas crime results might be the same environment is the villain here and because it exists we pay thousands of dollars annually for increased police protection and related costs the slum moreover is a drain on the citys entire economic life according to a study made by the american bar association slum sections of city yield only about per cent of its total tax receipts but they absorb about per cent of the total cost of services so racial discrimination results in waste of people waste of tax dollars waste of a potential market waste of a citys economic health it results also in disillusionment with a way of life look at the world for a moment through the negros eyes around him a slum beyond that the intangible walls of racial prejudice he knows what is happening in the south he looks beyond the oceans and he sees on all continents the same churning racial problem called by different names and he wonders about words like freedom and democracy which promise one thing but deliver another the negro looks out across the world and says under years of free enterprise government i have made little progress colored peoples elsewhere in the world have made as much progress and perhaps more under strong centralized government in a far shorter period of time is democracy worth it and sometimes in his heart the answer is no this is waste of another kind for loss of faith and inability to believe in the american dream mean a wasted capacity for responsible citizenship this disillusionment has had two important results first the negro is becoming biggovernment oriented since most of his social gains have come through the federal government instead of through local agencies and governments he turns naturally to the federal government for help this is understandable but it is also a dangerous factor in what is already a pronounced drift toward socialismor big statism the second result of the negros disillusionment is that he realizes in order to gain the equality denied him he must fight for it and his most powerful weapons are the economic boycott and bloc voting if a company is unwilling to give equal opportunities to negroes says the negro it must pay the price of losing its negro customers this is the economic boycott when issues arise which affect his own interests the negro has learned to vote in an organized manner this is bloc voting both bloc and blockade are powerful weapons both are legitimate and if we had met our responsibilities to the negro as we should have done in the past there would be no need to use them now they are forces to be reckoned with the logical question now i think is what can we do about the negro situation what can you and i do as individuals to alleviate and correct these problems there are three things we must do we must first take the trouble to understand the problems we must then evolve workable solutions and finally we must bend all our efforts toward achieving these solutions reprinted by permission from the cleveland plain dealer by marie snow igger nigger this scornful expression followed the blueeyed blonde child down the street from the allwhite school she was of english irish descent caucasian in appear ance but the child was not socially acceptable to the white families of this small town in central mississippi her parents had expressed sympathy with the unfortunate plight of the negro racethe poverty the humiliation the utter hopelessness of their lives this white family had spoken out had dared to be counted with the few who felt this oppression should end they had paid dearly for their courage their schoolage child had steadily lost friends had been dropped by the better families of this old old town had been called names in school since it was learned that her parents were niggerlovers this was a timeless expression a term attached to any who showed sympathy for the colored race another white man welleducated a tenyear resident in the community felt he could no longer be silent he spoke up against racial discrimination the man was in business for himself his world suddenly turned upside down his employees were called names by former friends they were asked do you work for that soandso niggerlover you must be hard up for a living this businessman who spoke just once for right and freedom was harrassed by phone calls night and day by radical racehaters who called him names who shouted obscene words to his wife and daughter if they answered the phone the phone calls reached his brother who was listed under a dif ferent number they reached his mother who lived at another address under a different name this harrassment went on for three days then it quit the man was defeated subdued he had learned too well the price to be paid for freedom of speech in another small community two neighbors lived sidebyside for three years they had had doorstep discussions of religion economics politics then the newspapers printed the shocking news that a grade school in another state had been integrated one man mentioned this to his neighbor he was obviously agitated deeply disturbed almost obsessed with the problems that this could bring to his own state the other man tried to calm him by saying soothingly well it has to come some day it may not be so bad the same people who try to suppress the colored man would suppress the white man too if given the right opportunities the disturbed man bounced to his feet his face reddened with fury he puffed for breath struck his neighbor and knocked the startled man to his knees with one fanatical blow as the astonished man stood to his feet the erratic neighbor ran into his own house shouting you get off my property if youre here when i come back with my gun ill blow your head off the sensible man although stunned at the turn of events left the yard because he knew that most white southerners kept a loaded gun in the house to protect my family lack of personal freedom has been a source of annoyance to one liberalminded man this white retired minister sometimes assisted the sketchilyeducated negro pastors in organizing childrens services townspeople in the small community felt this assistance could develop into trouble and kept close watch on the minister the license numbers of white friends who parked their cars in his driveway were written down and checked against files in the county records to identify the owners of the cars then a selfappointed watchdog of the state would visit the car owners in their own homes warn them that the minister was there to cause strife accuse him of being communistic and warn the car owners that it would be wise if they no longer associated with such a person one individual became angry but later joined the many who succumbed to disapproval and avoided the minister in the future certain churchmen and women are concerned with the ignorance between the two races they realize that the southerner doesnt really know the black man the caucasian may know the janitor in his place of business the storekeeper knows his stock boy during working hours but he knows nothing of the boys attitudes and opinions of the white race that he accumulates in the process of growing up the white housewife may know very little of the personal life of her domestic servant by comparison the colored domestic servant knows everything about the white family from overhearing conversations she knows something of their economic standing in the community the maid may be a sounding board for the frustrated housewife the servant may sooth give cautious advice sympathize but she is never to mention her own personal problems it is untidy of her to do so not the best etiquette and it is rarely ever done because the white race has only a stereotyped picture of the negro race and because the average negro is afforded an even more limited view of the white race certain uplifting individuals may seek to form an interracial nonaction group to meet regularly to discuss the problems the differences the likenesses and goals of both races if this group is discovered by the public as one group recently was it produces unfavorable publicity social and economic hazards to many one such group met in a church although not sponsored by the church itself and brought embarrassment to the pastor dissension among church members and criticism from other sources for this reason only a courageous pastor can be broad minded toward racial issues many white pastors and their churches are cool toward anyone who is liberal in his thinking concerning racial issues to be other than cool or even polite to such a person may create a real problem for the pastor because of this situation the pastors feel they cannot preach the entire truth in this socalled bible belt to preach that love of god results in love of ones fellow man to preach brotherhood of man is an anathema all too feared and consequently avoided by the white clergy on the other hand some ministers are sold out to a racist religion they proclaim it is against gods will that the negro be treated as a member of the human race a generation ago some white ministers preached that the black man had no soul was akin to the lower animals therefore could not respond to a spiritual ministry now in this present generation it is more popular to preach that god made the black man a servant to the remainder of the human race they seek to prove their theories from the bible because this is the bible belt this belt is noted for its many churches its much churchgoing its insistence on having the bible read in the public schools this state votes a dry ticket insists on prohibition at the encouragement of the many outspoken pastors its ministers preach long and often on the evils of liquor but say nothing about the evils of hatred and the sin of violence against ones fellow man that would be meddling in affairs that do not concern the church often the pastors of this state are leaders in community affairs they spark drives for this and that things that better the community but if they teach brotherly love it is a vague reference to some brother far away preferably overseas it is uncomfortable to speak of brotherly loveunfashionable unpopularin this day of racial conflict it could cause the honored pastor to lose his church in this community and prevent him from getting a church in any other community in the entire state there are many minor evils that a pastor can speak out against and still remain a popular fellow consequently he speaks on them pastors feel that they should not interfere with things outside the church they just want to serve their congregations and watch them prosper yet somehow a certain percentage of pastors belong to the white citizens council a radical pressure group that believes in white supremacy more than it believes in religion the pastor can attend the hate campaigns can even be a leader in the local chapter without searing his conscience in this famous bible belt white pressure groups find it easy to recruit new members and hold old members they create fear in the heart of the white man if he does not keep the colored man in his place he is taught to fear amalgamation of the races social mixing and intermarriage are readily connected with the term integration integration is a hated word it is used as a whip over ordinarily logical citizens of the state of mississippi if a politician wants to be elected he becomes a segregationist he cannot be a moderate the ordinary segregationist wont be elected the segregationist must speak often of protecting our families against the present crisisthe threat of the negro who wants to marry a white woman and rear children of mixed bloodchildren who will eventually cause an amalgamated race of people the implication of mixing the pure blood of the lovely blueeyed blonde southern woman with that of an african causes the most stoic southerner to shiver to point out that few negroes are seemingly attracted to white women that a vast percentage prefer negro women is not logical to the fearful white man why shouldnt the negro want to cross the color line when he the white man has often crossed the color line to seek sexual satisfaction if negro women are desired by certain ignorant immoral white men it is logical to this same depraved person that white women are desired by the colored man knowing his own heart is the thing that causes this terrible fear in the white man when socrates the ancient greek philosopher said know thyself he might have added for mississippi posterity to thine own self be true who pays for the immorality of the white man when he crosses the color line for sexual satisfaction does it bring reproach on him and where is the proof that the white man is crossing the line the proof is in the illegitimate babies born to young colored girls girls with dark skinfrom families of blackskinned peoplewho produce lightskinned babies fifty percent white blood can produce a light baby that is a misfit in a family of dark children the following is a classic example in one rural community a farmer saw a couple meeting secretly in the woods days after day he noticed them particularly since the man was white and the young girl was colored integration between the races is against the state law integration in any form is strictly opposedexcept in the boudoir the colored girl who was orphaned and lived only with two brothers and a sister in their late teens or early twenties became obviously pregnant this girl had no prenatal care it was offered free at the local health centermonthly examinations and vitaminsbut the girl was fearful of the white nurses and ashamed of her condition there was the terrible fear that white women would somehow suspect that a white man had been involved in this and she knew that she would be considered the guilty party she couldnt obtain work for these same reasons and the brothers and sister in the home had scarcely enough to feed everyone there was no money for a layette the baby was bom delivered by a partiallytrained colored midwife who offered no sedation she performed this service on credit for to be paid in small amounts whenever possible there was not one garment in the house to clothe the skinny squealing infant with the strangely light skin no layette had been prepared not one diaper had been purchased during the lengthy time of confinement the midwife did the expedient thing she removed the pillow from the head of the exhausted young mother ripped off the frayed pillow case and made two diapers then the baby was tucked under a corner of the single quilt that covered the bed he was ready to face a harsh new world what of the white neighbors when they realized this reproach against their community had been delivered ugly rumors began to fly each white wife looked at her own comfortable home her pretty mannerly children and fearing for them fought back she told her husband that she would personally go down there and get one good look at that baby im going to see who he looks like no one is sure how the various white husbands in the community reacted but word somehow reached the young colored mother in terrible fear for her own safety and that of her child she lifted herself from her bed wrapped the infant in a borrowed crib blanket and fled the state by bus chicago is a big city and the orphaned girl had a distant relative there no one has stated who gave her money to buy a bus ticket but everyone knows that her own brothers and sister were too poor to even purchase a dozen diapers for the baby there are other social problems in this state perhaps not as shocking but real problems nevertheless to those involved a white college professor who is a single woman on the faculty of a negro college with an integrated teaching staff recently complained i have no place to entertain my friends i work with other professors often they too are single women like myself with one exception they are colored where can two or three of us go offcampus to eat in a nice restaurant how can we attend the theater and be seated together these other ladies are cultured refined sensitive to embarrassment where can we go in this state without facing the humiliation of prejudice and discrimination it is just too limiting recently this same college professor received correspondence from a local bank where she had just opened an account the letter was addressed to her without the usual title of miss ann smith it simply read ann smith upon opening the letter she discovered that the salutation read the same not dear miss smith but simply the casual greeting dear ann baffled and angered with this familiarity she began to think through this strange circumstance finally it occurred to her that since she taught in a segregated college and lived oncampus the bank had assumed that she was a colored person in the state of mississippi negroes are never given the dignity of such titles as miss mr or mrs whether in correspondence or in newsprint regardless of age marital status standing in the community or education the colored person is referred to simply by first and last name this college professor decided on a course of action she wrote to the bank and inquired of their policy in addressing her fellowteachers who were negroes pointing out that it was distasteful to her to learn she might have been afforded a courtesy that was denied her colleagues if this were their usual policy she asked that they close her account the bank without any reference to her unusual statements followed her instructions common courtesies are daily denied the negro on the street the young man or woman may be addressed as boy or girl and the older person with grey hair may be called uncle or auntie by members of the white race but they are never called mr or mrs when two white men meet an elderly colored man and inquired directions of him calling him uncle he spunkily replied smiling i didnt know we was kin the deep south and particularly the state of mississippi lives behind a blackandwhite curtain if it creates certain problems for the moderate white southernerwhat does it do for the negro who must live with it day after day year in and year out generation after generation how does it affect his personality shape his ideals limit his hopes and dreams it produces a new form of slavery when actual slavery was abolished even the southern gentleman admitted that he had found a more profitable method of farming it was share cropping under this system today the landlord gets onethird of the crop and pays onethird of the expenses the tenant usually a negro agrees to raise the crop receives twothirds of the profit and pays twothirds of the expenses he also is given the use of a house usually a badly deteriorated threeroom shack that has never known a coat of paint during certain seasons of the year the landlord loans per month toward living expenses for a family of or persons this money is loaned at per cent interest and it is deducted from the profit when the crop is sold late in the fall there is no source of income in the winter when no work is is being done in the fields if an emergency arises during the year such as a serious illness the landlord may loan extra money at the same interest in a bad crop year the tenant may find he not only made nothing but that he owes money to the landlord this means he is forced to stay on the property whether or not the relationship has been satisfactory because the negro family lives on his property the white landlord often feels that he owns the negroes body and soul if they attend a colored church where the pastor holds some radical views or is a member of the national association for the advancement of colored people the white landlords in that vicinity may warn their people to get rid of that troublemaker or if that fails they may warn the individual tenants to quit attending that church they may be frightened into obeying if all else fails and the indignation of the white landlords is sufficiently aroused the local sheriff may lend assistance a recent case involved a negro pastor who spoke out against popular opinion in a public school for negro children what he said was not too unusual in itself the negro community wanted something for their schoola gymnasium that seemed unnecessary to the surrounding white community to quiet the unrest some colored person had to be made the scapegoat the negro pastor was the victim he was arrested for whitecapping according to websters dictionary whitecapping means a member of a selfappointed vigilance committee attempting by lynchlaw methods to drive away or coerce persons obnoxious to it the white community found this a very effective method in settling the negro communityon the surface at least after the pastor had paid a heavy fine he was released and nothing more was said on the matter one landlord knew that his colored tenants wife worked in white homes the year round to supplement the family income he had no objections until he realized one family that employed her was very liberal in their views concerning the racial situation upon learning this he demanded that she no longer work for this family although she needed the extra money to feed her large family of fourteen members often a tenant farmer will suspect the landlord of cheating him on the crop but he dares not mention it the landlord keeps the books the tenant is considered too poorly educated to handle the task or perhaps not sufficiently honest to accept the joint responsibility so it is the landlord alone who keeps books at the years end after the harvest the negro is simply told the amount that he owes the landlord it would be presumptious of the tenant to ask to see the books thus he is obliged to stay on the property for another year and work off the debt in good crop years when it is obvious that everyone is making money the tenant may be told that he has earned profit for the years workwork which involved the tenant his wife and a number of children who worked in the fields month after month for the loans given widowed women may find life hard at the end of the year if one is told that she made no money but that she owes the landlord she may feel cheated this was the plight of one widow but she was afraid to move finally she managed to move her few belongings and halfgrown children at night under the cover of darkness with the assistance of a relative and his battered pickup truck her landlord resented losing a hardworking gullible family he located their new residence accused her of stealing the electric wiring from the old shack and asked her to pay to cover this theft the woman denied the theft and further pointed out that the wiring in the house could scarcely have been valued at and was not worth the risk to her the angry landlord finally brought a constable who had no legal papers he warned that she would have to pay the debt or go to jail finally in fear she consulted a lawyer who only advised her to pay he told her that a court battle was useless loaned her the money and suggested that her son work for him at low wages after school hours to repay the debt another widow found it necessary to harvest the crop with the help of her very young family the and yearold girl and boy worked beside her in the field and the sevenyearold boy was nursemaid at home for four younger children this family of children enrolled in school in the middle of november when the crop was finished because of overcrowded conditions and the late enrollment the oldest boy attended the fifth grade for the remainder of the year without any textbooks the colored school simply had no books to give him in their separate but equal schools across town the white school had books to sparenew books as well as secondhand books for fifth graders in a county in central mississippi where the colored children far outnumber the whites only secondhand school busses are used by the colored schools if new busses are purchased they are given to the white schools because the white man is carrying the heaviest burden of taxation the negro schools accept the secondhand busses and try to keep them in repair it is difficult because they are overloaded busses designed to carry to children are sometimes packed with to children daily some busses run two routes which means that very young children must necessarily arise early be dressed and ready to catch the bus by am because too of the double route or the long route these same children may arrive home as late as pm if the bus breaks down which often happens there is a further delay one mother of a firstgrade child said when bonnie gets home from school shes too sleepy to eat supper she naps then gets up and eats i dont see how she can wait when she aint had no lunch in mississippi the oftennew modem negro schools offer a hot lunch at cents per child town parents who are employed may pay for this and the welfare helps some families with lunches many rural families who are share cropping and sending five or six children to school can illafford to buy hot lunches some send a cold biscuit and homemade butterrarely ever meatbut the great majority of the young children and rapidlygrowing teenagers must skip lunch the negro school teachers are paid less than the white teachers though the negro teacher may have a better education it is common for both husband and wife to teach in order to have better housing music lessons for their children and the other things that are important to those who are lifting themselves by their bootstraps because the teachers have had education and its accompanying taste of culture it is impossible for them to live under slum conditions such as their pupils may have to do a negro school teacher may discover a colored family in desperate need where the children are unable to attend school this family may be referred to the welfare but action is often slow if a white man recommends a colored family they will be eligible for assistance often a white storekeeper will recommend a widow and her large family with the understanding that they are to buy at his little store if the family fails to shop with him even though the goods may be overpriced or the credit books carelessly kept the negroes dare not complain in several cases storekeepers have shortchanged a family in cashing welfare checks one such merchant covered up by presenting the widow who protested with several bills one of which was obviously a duplicate of the other one elderly negro woman whose husband was an invalid applied for assistance through the local welfare office the welfare worker arrived at her home studied the needs of the couple and agreed that they could have welfare assistance on one condition that condition was that they would agree to pay a month for the first five months upon receiving the aid the total of was to be paid to the welfare worker who recommended aid another needy family reported this same knotty problem to a white friend this colored family had also been asked by the welfare worker to pay per month for six months in this case to the welfare worker when the family was urged by friends to report the welfare worker to the local authorities the colored family shrank back in fear a negro in mississippi rarely ever takes a case to court because he understands he will receive no justice regardless of circumstances he feels that he will pay his hardearned money to a lawyer for nothing this is particularly true if a negro goes to court against a white person the white lawyers meet together out of court decide how they can best keep the nigger in his place and still collect a fee then the court goes through the motions of a trial once a white judge remarked to a crowded courtroom while the court was in session and a negro was on the witness stand i wouldnt believe any niggers testimony even if the niggers were lined up four deep for miles down the road in this area there is no equal justice under the law if a crime is committed against a white man or woman by a colored person the police go into action the case is promptly solved action brought in court and the harshest penalty possible under the law is imposed if circumstances are such that a white man has erred against a colored person justice moves very slowly if at all if the case is properly solved finally brought to court with a white jury the white man may be acquitted or given the lightest sentence possible since there are few colored voters in the state the jurors are inevitably white on the other hand if a black man commits a crime against his black brother the case may never get to court its just another dead negro you know how they are always drinking and fighting with razors what can you do with them is the attitude of the authorities in an area where illegitimacy is common due to poverty and overcrowding some conscientious mothers with herculean efforts strive to rear daughters with high moral standards the mothers feel that they work singlehanded without even the cooperation of the law officers if a young girl is frightened by the forced attentions of an immoral man the girls parents have no assurance of getting action by the police in fact rumors whether founded or unfounded run rife through the colored section of town the parents fear the police the negroes believe the police try to entice young girls into police cars at night and drive them to isolated areas there are rumors that it has happened but no one has the courageor the factsto bear out the cases the problem seems to be that the two races have no common grounds of understanding no means of communicating with each other no opportunity to air grievances and clear up misunderstandings in an atmosphere of common trust when a colored man breaks a law he fears capture by the police although suspected of a minor robbery he fears that he will be beaten and there are reports that it has happened he fears rumors that are spread of a hotbox where a closemouthed prisoner is put in solitary confinement until he is ready to confess to a crime he may or may not have committed this hotbox is a very narrow dark cell with no ventilation equipped with radiators that send the room temperature up up up although he may plead for water it is given only three times a day with a single piece of corn bread there the prisoner is kept for days until he is ready to confess the constant high temperature has caused dehydration and permanent impairment of vision according to medical doctors too many prisoners after being arrested frisked for weapons and handcuffed are later shot trying to escape the newspapers often either do not report the incident at all or give very few details whatever the circumstances the policeman involved is not investigated he is made a hero and the victims family is left to support itself with only bad memories of police officers who used abusive language with the woman and young girls in the home during the arrest after hearing of such incidents from friends it is not surprising that colored southerners fear all law officers there are other complaints one hardworking thrifty colored man objected to the white persons attitude concerning welfare assistance the whites put my people on welfare then complain about it my people dont want charity they want work they were born for work they were taught to work they love work finding work is not always easy for the colored man jobs that pay a living wage are difficult to find only jobs requiring unskilled labor are available and there are more applicants than jobs the heaviest work the dirtiest work with the longest working hours are the only kinds available still there are more workers than jobs if the job is made easier or the hours shorter or the pay better there are a number of whites waiting to take the job from the negro in some small towns in mississippi the mailmen delivered the mail on foot these jobs were held by colored men who did not object to the many miles walked over burning pavement in the hot sun they liked the pay then the government provided the mailmen with motor scooters or trucks and white men applied for and received these jobs discrimination takes on other forms vengeance raised its ugly head when a colored man tried to improve his lot in life one white man had two sources of income he was a city policeman and he owned a small farm outside the town he hired a colored man to drive a tractor and till the land the colored driver was underpaid although experienced for this type of work a construction company needed a tractor driver and the colored man was hired his former white employer was furious at losing a good driver he found a method of revenge when the colored man drove back to the smaller town to visit relatives his car was often stopped by the policemanthe very man who lost him as a tractor driver on the farm the negro was ticketed and fined for speeding not just once but on several occasions many city officials of the larger communities want the world to believe there is racial harmony between the two groups they speak in glowing terms for radio television and newspapers of the good feelings and understanding between the two races this causes resentment to flame in the hearts of the usually oppressed downtrodden meek negroes and a few of themin retaliationtry to use white facilities recently several teenage negroes sat on the benches at the jackson zoo and watched the monkeys at play police appeared and arrested them for disturbing the peace negroes in small groups are allowed to walk quietly through the zoo but the benches and water fountains are reserved for the use of the whites since that incident occurred the benches have been completely removed from the zoo to prevent further such occurrences if anything more bold than this is attempted the white authorities place the blame for such unrest on outsiders we southern folks know how to handle our niggers this serves as a warning to local negroes that they should not try to change the status quo most are afraid to try clyde kenard a yearold negro tried to register as a student in an allwhite college mississippi southern it was necessary for him to make an appointment with the president when kenard arrived to keep the appointment he discovered that police officers were there waiting to arrest him they found illegal whiskey under the seat of his car according to the officers and arrested him on that charge kenards friends stated that the young man never drank whiskey beer or anything stronger than soft drinks still later kenard was arrested and convicted for planning a theft he declared himself innocent the negro who actually stole the worth of chicken feed and who implicated kenard was given a fiveyear suspended sentence kenard was sentenced to seven years and this attemptedintegrationist is now serving his sentence there is a similar case of punishing the nonconformist jess brown a negro lawyer who handled the kenard case has since been arrested on a bad check charge in this state of small incomes and small bank accounts citizens often overdraw their accounts if a merchant is given a check that bounces he usually gives the person an opportunity to write another after depositing more money in the bank mr brown had traded with this merchant for years with a satisfactory relationship what caused the change of attitude was the merchant influenced by some other element intimidation is a common method of preventing outbreaks of violence several towns in mississippi have trained police dogs these dogs are used in the colored section of town police may hold a dog on the leash and walk through a crowded cafe on saturday night negroes have a natural fear of the white mans dog and the police are aware of this on one occasion police dogs were used to break up a peaceful demonstration the white crowd stood in one group and the colored in another the dogs were held on leashes in such a position that they could only reach the negro group and inflict injury on them on another occasion after a series of small night robberies a police dog was used in an attempt to track a thief when the dog followed the scent to a white mans house and walked up on the porch the police pulled the dog away and urged him to move on down the street a few doors to the colored section of town during the tension concerning the freedom riders police used the dogs to meet incoming busses in at least two cities in central mississippi there are very few colored registered voters because they must pass a complex literacy test each person must be able to understand and explain the constitution of mississippi the test is given by the circuit court clerk in several instances when white people registered and could not answer a ques tion concerning some article in the constitution the clerk either explained the answer cheerfully or gave them a simpler question when the person answering is colored he is not given any help if the clerk has been instructed to discourage colored voters thus pressured he may turn down intelligent people with highschool educations in one case the clerk refused to register a colored woman then observing that she was welldressed asked her means of income on learning that she was a public school teacher with a bachelors degree he replied curtly all right girl sign the register some negro ministers have attempted to register a few have succeeded but others have been discouraged they have been told that it was too late to register regardless of date or that the clerk had other duties and the negro should come back another day the ministers interpreted this as a form of intimidation and were defeated most negroes do not earn a living wage in mississippi the few professional middleclass negroes who do find they have escaped the problem of physical hunger and added a multitude of new problems vacations now possible present new humiliations the businessman whose family wants to take a trip while he is working feels uncertain about travel accommodations one successful insurance salesman told of having to wait in line to buy bus tickets for his wife and children there were segregated waiting lines the white line had to be completely eliminated before the tickets could be sold to the colored line it was a timeless custom the ticket agent held to the custom although the impatient bus driver urged and pleaded and finally swore at him to sell the colored man a ticket the welldressed colored woman and her two neat children waited in humiliation while the crowd stared after they were on the bus they had to find seats in the rear if they had traveled by car they would have bought food at the back doors of many restaurants if they had required motel accommodations these would have been few and far between colored families with two drivers present would have tried to drive straight through to their destination even though they could easily afford a motel and would prefer to stop for the night even vacations are no vacation for themno vacation from embarrassment and humiliation in many areas because of acute poverty the government offered surplus food called commodities to be distributed in destitute areas in the winter months after a bad crop failure this provided staple items such as flour corn meal powdered milk cheese butter and shortening this food was distributed each winter for a year or two in mississippi then suddenly a county stopped the practice when residents of this particular county inquired they were told that it depended on the elected supervisor of each beat or ward if the man felt voters in his ward did not want the needy families to have commodities he did not vote for it why wouldnt the predominantly white voters who elected him want this there were two answers given businessmen or farmers who wanted to hire cheap labor during the winter complained that the colored men wouldnt work for low wages when their bellies were full of commodities grocers complained that the giving of commodities to destitute families cut down on the profit of the local merchant therefore the hungry became hungrier colored mothers remarked often its hard to listen to a hungry baby cry hisself to sleep skinny toddlers learned to walk on crooked legs due to malnutrition school childrens lean frames entered newly erected modern buildings smelled the hot lunch cooking in the cafeteria knowing that they would not eat until they returned home six or eight hours later they were expected to learn under such circumstances to fill their minds with knowledge in appreciation for the nice buildings that the white taxpayers had given them physical oppression brings with it brutality intimidation a thwarting of understanding and interaction between the races by enslaving the negro the white man has enslaved himself he is himself in intellectual bondage even the idealistic college students who may be willing to change the old ways are not permitted that luxury and challenge of youth the white sovereignty commission is a pressure group similar to hitlers gestapo it is truly the watchdog of the state students have said that the commission hires a student in white colleges within the state to observe what is taught in the classroom for per month the student is expected to spy on professors students and school authorities and report on their attitudes and interests certain pressure can be brought to bear on a college that is nonconformist with the ideals of the old south recently statewide newspaper publicity was used against a student who was seeking a college office newspapers considered him too broadminded unfavorable newspaper publicity has frightened away speakers on planned programs also that might have set young people to thinking for themselves they are to be taught as their dads were taught and thus be good disciples of dear old mississippi standing for white supremacy there are some white people nativeborn mississippians cultured educated humanitarian who see the injustices within the state they would change them if they couldif they believed there were others who felt as they do and who would stand firm how is one good man to recognize an ally in a state that has no freedom of speech a terrible fear of reprisal if he opposes longheld customs and beliefs perhaps it is time for the humanitarian men and women of mississippi to stand up and be counted to risk loss of social prestige loss of income loss of popularity in order to change the circumstances before the hated outsiders force the issue
great lady of opera leontyne price hapl gt pens to be an ameri can negro born in mississippi and this circumstance has added non musical elements of interest to her career these need not concern us the singers of the past for the most part also had modest origins think of caruso or emmy destinn for example what does concern us is her voice and what she does with it in that mysterious composite called an opera performance i heard price for the first time at the metropolitan in trovatore in the midst of the greablizzard of saturday afternoon february struggling through the polar wastes of the empty streets i reflected that i was likely to have the whole theater to myself not many would undergo this ordeal to get there but on arrival i found a seething mob a good part of which had no hope of getting into the soldout house from her first entrance price was mistress of the stage both vocally and dramatically and by the end of the afternoon i found myself wishing that poor old verdi who never could get a singer to do anything right had been alive to hear her performance she did not come to the metropolitan unprepared or unknown she had been singing in the leading opera theaters of the world but it was at the metropolitan that i heard her first thousands apparently felt as i did that what we were hearing and seeing verged on the impossible in view of her origins we could hardly believe that this ultraitalian and supremely verdian creation could be what she was i found myself being reminded of singers who had not been heard for decadesrosa raisa claudia muzio artists of my youthand then wondered as we all must whether memory plays tricks in such matters but then was not rosa raisa by birth a russian jewess and was she not also the most italian of artists on the operatic stage this kind of bewilderment befalls those who hear price for the first time and as i have suggested it comes from mundane considerations which properly speaking ought to make no difference in the five operas of her first engagement trovatore aida madame butterfly don giovanni and turandot price showed a versatility which is not in itself too unusual today there are other celebrated artists notably maria callas who range even more widely still from the ethereal floating high notes of the slave girl liu to the dramatic urgency of aida is quite a distance and the florid passages of leonora are not a bit like the classic ornamentation of donna anna vocally each of the five parts is utterly distinct from the others with price not only style but the very color of her voice seemed to change with the character as butterfly for example she achieved a childlike sound in some passages which made the character seem indeed less than sixteen years old particularly when butterfly speaks of her happiness each of the five personages was thus characterized by the voice alone in a manner which if we were speaking of painting we might describe as the brushwork of a master dramatic outbursts strong high notes and the like are not subject to this sort of characterpainting a high c is a high c and it would be difficult to guess at a character by the sound of it but the passages which hold the drama together the crucial passages which build characterare rarely written to reach extremes of vocal display nor can they easily be played upon as price plays upon them to build up in our aural imagination the personage the composer had in mind too often what the composer had in mind during his long solitary labor is not at all what we see and hear on the opera stage and almost every composer has said so price seems to compose each character from the inside out so that a living being comes into existence through the music she sings what is written in the score and she is uncannily accurate about it her versatility is qualitative not quantitative and depends not so much on the number of different things she does as on how she does them it is that rare thing actingthroughthevoice and it is essential to an opera singer of real grandeur price also has the other kind of acting talent which is the ability to express dramatic situations or emotions by means of the body however valuable this seems to me a secondary attribute for a great opera singer most of our opera theatres are too big for subtlety or suggestion thirty years ago we were told that mme lotte lehmann exaggerated in the first act of die walkure when she pointed out with a majestically extended arm the magic sword which siegmund was to draw forth from the tree in orthodox wagnerism she should have indicated it by a look how many persons in the metropolitan opera house would have known what she was doing if she had indicated the sword by a look nothing less than a broad gesture enables the whole audience to understand what is going on at that point this is the problem of all acting in opera it must be broad strong and obvious or most of the audience cannot see it miss price had theater experience before she sang opera notably in the revival of porgy and bess which traveled all over the world something of the technique of smaller theaters has remained in her consciousness she is capable of very effective details of look and gesture which may not be altogether visible from the gallery her butterfly is full of these small touches even her aida although on the grand scale has them she thanks radames with her eyes for having demanded the freedom of the captives her friends and relatives even if each detail is not perceived by everyone these small effects accumulated give a consistent impression of the character she builds her art penetrates the vastness of the metropolitan mainly by its coherence in the larger lines in the main intention thus it is precisely in the absence of movement the classic stillnessthat her donna anna makes its most profound visual effect except in the struggle with don giovanni at the very beginning price hardly moves during the opera she walks a little at the festa and uses her arms when she is demanding that don ottavio avenge her fathers murder otherwise she seems generally still still still she is always intent she is singleminded not a finger moves she does not frown or smile above all she does not grimace she is living for one thing only revenge yet there is a hope at least of joy but it shows only in the voice the metropolitan has seldom been privileged to offer its stage to a performance of such austerity and beauty on a quite different scale her butterfly is as revealing as her donna anna she condenses her body into a small space her movements into the pervasive ballet of the geisha her feet and hands and arms into a style that almost suggests a person confined in a straitjacket her very head into a different physical and therefore psychological relationship to the world she becomes a japanese child bride of about with a candid willingness even eagerness for the act of love the high dflat at the end of the first act is rapture in anticipation here if anywhere the vocalism and the acting are the same thing on the night i heard it i was oblivious of the tenor even though i suppose he must have been singing that same note in aida there are lines in the text which take on new poignancy and depth when she delivers them those about slavery and freedom for instance if she had an amneris of her own rank at the met such as giulietta simionato their clashes on that subject would be a revelation one vital and littlenoticed asset she has for characterization is a feeling for the italian language most of our american singers and many other nonitalians learn italian parts by rote hardly any of them can order a meal in a restaurant when they get to milan no matter how many teachers and coaches they may have no matter how carefully they may enunciate on the stage and no matter how letterperfect they are on dictionary translations such singers thinking in english cannot feel all the meanings in italian poetry true the poetry in opera is seldom subtle or even good but it contains all the echoes associations and subliminal suggestions of a great language price can put the full meaning into her words because she has absorbed them and to put it plainly because she can order a meal in milan and read the newspapers and get around the town and understand what people are saying to her and because she likes italy and the italians this constitutes to a sense of italy and i never have understood how opera singers have to go on the stage in italian repertoire without it generally acting is hardly a word that applies literally to opera where the conditions of work are so different from those of the speaking stage at the metropolitan singers must be forever watching the conductors batonand not only his but that of the cue conductor in the second prompters boxas well as listening to the vociferous word prompter himself it is seldom that they can afford musically to turn toward the person they are supposed to be addressing to look away from the conductor and the prompters on the opera stage requires a confidence in ones knowledge of words music and tempo which few have price can sing with her back to the conductor and never get off the beat bv a fraction so can callas there is another part of ooeratic acting which is radically disjointed from anything we know in the speaking theater everything done on the stage in an opera must be to some appreciable degree akin to the music slow statelv strides like isoldes or the hop skip and jump of don giovanni are determined not only by the character but by the music itself this fact cannot be circumvented in an opera house all the broadway stage directors rudolf bing has been able to entice into the metropolitan have not overcome this fundamental rule that is so ingrained in the singers instinct what they have to do is almost insuperably difficult all those words all those notes all those stage directions if they were to try acting in countertempo to the music they would probably collapse so the singers trap themselves into doing everything in time to the music this is fatal because within a very few minutes it will move any audience to ridicule it tempts singers because it is easy and it arises naturally from the task thus it was that amalie materna fifty or sixty years ago began to wave her scarf to the exact beat of the music in act ii of tristan and isolde unfortunately it became a tradition that has long been honored without question only in recent years has the sequence been broken down into something less than calisthenics price acts neither against the music nor in time to it she acts in relation to it she has that natural adaptability which is instinctive you never see her flapping her elbows or nodding her head in puppet fashion in act iii of aida she throws herself into the duet with the tenor the ugly cabaletta verdi called it the only thing in the opera he seems to have disliked afterward with an abandon that is only frustrated by the woodenness of the tenors she faces her entrance in act ii scene i when she is abject and despondent in the presence of the imperial egyptian princess is wonderfully in the mood of the music without being based on its metrical count but acting even in all the special senses the word assumes in opera can never be the main achievement of a great operatic artist that must always be the fusion of the elements the interweaving of many strands of effort and achievement voice ever first but never to the exclusion of the others this fusion includes all sorts of things makeup and costume among them an awareness of lighting and an absorption in the music to the point at high moments of forgetting the audience price is not yet fully aware of lighting and its powers not many opera singers are callas has a genius for it when she does not have or cannot get the kind of lighting she requires she adjusts her stage movements to get the closest possible approximation if the light is wrong and cannot be changed she simply moves out of it under her ideal conditions of performance the light does not follow her she follows the light the grecoitalian production of medea which she took to london athens and dallas was a high example of the technique with at moments stupendous effects this was prices first season here and she may not yet realize the perils of the metropolitan stage in her final scene of don giovanni she was placed far upstage on a platform from which she could not really have heard the orchestra she could have seen mr boehms beat especially since he kept it high and she has good eyesight she did not deviate an atom from pitch or time conveyed all the meaning of her aria and vocalized with unequaled virtuosity all without descending from her classic stillness yet the lighting was wrong for her having been spanish all evening she suddenly became caribbean because they had thrown a yellowish light on the remote perch where she was obliged to sing it was not a thing an older singer would have welcomed nor is she likely to take to it a second time a great operatic artist not singer alone not actress but operatic artist excels by intertwining all the elements some internal and some external into the whole which is the creative performance there are few such artists at any time when the phenomenon occurs as it does with price we try to dissect analyze and specify but the fact is that there is something baffling in it something beyond and above what we can label there is a hard core of sheer genius in every such performer the mysterious something which differentiates which sets each apart from all others talent and hard work however necessary to the singer are not enough to explain the awe and wonder that fill us when price sings ii trovatore or butterfly or aida or the others in everything she does we have a weird sense of discovery no matter how often we have heard the music before she makes it seem new and again as has been true of other exceptionally gifted beings of the past we are hearing absolutely for the first time something we thought we had known for most of our lives price being the artist she is will never allow her american success to separate her permanently from milan and vienna she gets a higher quality of cooperation there better casts in generalthan american theaters can afford she is devoted to herbert von karajan as a conductor and since he too is enamored of italian style they are said to produce remarkable results she has exceptionally long breath and he likes her to use it for sustained cantilena even when it is not called for in the score thus giving a seemingly endless vocal line her first triumphs in vienna and milan were achieved with great artists as her colleagues and she acknowledges their help with gratitude simionato was her first amneris at la scala for instance she has had no such luck at the metropolitan or at other american opera houses where as a rule one star or at most two is considered enough for one evening this weighs heavily on an opera like aida which demands four or five singers of the first rank what with illnesses from manhattan weather the present wellpublicized unionmanagement hassles and the continuing financial problems such casting is not possible in new york at this time leontyne price is only thirtyfour and it is possible for us to look forward to a series of new creations in the years ahead there is much for her to do in the italian repertoire she has just begun on the inexhaustible treasures of verdi for instance the time will come no doubt when she will be claimed by some german works too this season she is also singing the girl of the golden west for the opening and tosca at the metropolitan and although some of us have only a limited enthusiasm for puccini it will be difficult to stay away from the house when she brings those old war horses to life for such an artist anything is possible starred with errol flynn whenever one of the later mr errol flynns pictures crops up on tv my husband gives me a nasty grin starts his lights camera action routine as he plays with our now elderly poodle yerrol flynn yerrol flynn is the name on the dogs pedigree because the dashing mr flynnalthough he never saw me in lifewas responsible for my buying the dog also unknowingly the handsome mr flynn ruined a summer friendship for me with a woman named anna in another negro woman sue and i were traveling by bus to the cote dazure wed spent a wonderful july in europe sue was a teacher while i was merely a housewife slightly tired of hearing about my husbands tour of europe via the army on the bus we met anna a white woman in her plump middle years who was most happy to see fellow americans from manhattan anna was one of those friendly but aggressive types the dominating kind so certain they can do all things right and often do fairly rich she immediately whispered about the technique of carrying american money in the shoulder padding of her summer coatproof of how welltraveled she was anna talked far too much and sue didnt like her sue didnt like most whites anyway but i didnt mind annas chattering she had been to nice before promised to show us the town innocently we arrived at the height of the season minus hotel reservations and after tramping from one filled smallhotel to anotherover sues protest i phoned anna she told us to rush over yes rush to her hotel that she would get us a room the hotel turned out to be an imposing palace on the promenade des anglais looking far too expensive and ritzy for us sue was against even going in she sometimes forgot she wasnt in the states but we did step inside anna had a nice double room reserved for us at the simply impossible rate of a day i immediately decided i didnt at all mind annas taking over i dont know whether she was lonely or what but anna really took us in hand she knew a number of nicoise and had our money safely exchanged at the unofficial rate then went out of her way to introduce us to her friends even sue had to admit anna was pretty okay i guess anna really made the next few days a dream literally a living dream mornings she took us to visit the homes of her friends or their shops then after a stop at the american express to see if we had any mail we would lunch in the various nontourist the most valued label to a tourist restaurants then spend the afternoons on the rocky beach we seemed to be the only colored women about and caused more neckturning and camerasnapping in our modest swim suits than did some of the startling bikini chicks evenings were also delightfully fullaperitifs on the terrace of the hotel then to some marvelous and cheap restaurant anna always knew about or even dinner in the home of a friend of tiers followed by drinks in some promenade cafe as we listened to the music we fell into bed exhausted every night and i felt i was seeing the real europe one afternoon about a week before we were due to return to paris we were busy mailing cards at the old post office when a thin blonde in her late twentiesabout the only woman in the post office not wearing a bathing suit or shorts came over to sue and i asked in good french pardon me but can you understand what im saying what i asked what is it you speak english the blonde said with a clipped british accent how splendid i took you for africans or were americans sue told her coldly of course tell me would you care to be in pictures were practically in every tourists album now i began so no no i mean motion pictures with errol flynn you see were making a picture outside nice and looking for some colored women i was too surprised to speak sue managed to gasp but were not actresses these are extra parts dressed in creole costumes youll merely walk in and out of scenes it will be quite simple the blonde assured us are you interested at this point anna stepped forward of course theyre interested provided the pay is right how about transportation we can only use theseyou two the blonde said seeing anna for the first time they will be paid of course and i imagine we can arrange for a car to take them to and from the set she turned directly to me where are you staying i eagerly gave her our names and the hotel she said we would hear from her within a day or two and started to leave one minute anna said how long will the job last if they miss out on any paris hotel reservations we expect your company to reimburse them for that the shooting will only take two or three days at most and really as to money and other such details i cant give you any exact figures thats not my department but i assure you the pay will be standard and dont worry about it i must go but ill be in touch when she left sue and i immediately sent more cards to the states proudly announcing we were going to be in an errol flynn movie anna a bit envious i thought said now ive heard everything this should about pay for your stay in nice think i once read where hollywood extras earn per day wow sue said slapping her thin face and if the sun isnt right or something it means retakes and more days anna went on i cant remember perhaps they pay per hour after all youre the only colored women here you should be above extra pay just let me talk to them when they call sue and anna excitedly talked money all the way back to the beach having fallen in love with a poodle pup in paris which id found out would cost to send home all i said was if i can get my poodle out of the deal ill be happy two days at per would about do it and i hope madame simone hasnt sold him already forget ill get you more than that anna said old law of supply and demand you know listen you wire this madame simone youre taking the dog youre bound to get more than enough out of this to pay for him i dont know i said almost to myself even if i should be paid theres still another and im on a tight budget havent the nerve to wire my husband for any moneywe strained like hell for me to make the trip but i really want the pup i turned to sue look in case i dont make enough to pay for the dog can you lend me part of your movie money until we return to the states certainly sue said this isnt money i counted on within minutes id cashed nearly all my travelers checks and wired mme simone the money telling her to send the pup to my husband then i quickly wrote a jumbled air mail home explaining things as best i could we spent the rest of the day at a plage in a state of high excitement talking about cutting room floors stills closeups and what not as if we really were actresses that night we went to bed early to look our best for tomorrow the following day we hung around the hotel finally when the day grew too warm we went to the plage across the promenade one of us rushing back to the desk every half hourbut there wasnt any phone call i had a wire from paris saying the dog would be on a plane the following week what did i wish on the pedigree in all french poodles had to be registered under y so i wired back yerrol flynn there wasnt any call the next day either when sue suggested we try locating the film company anna said that would be the worst thing you could do seem overanxious remember they want you just wait the blonde said she would phone in a day or two but we leave saturday for paris sue said no point in playing it too cool all the better anna said for when they do call and hear youre about to leave theyll pay more this could even prolong your trip for another few weeks we cant do that i said we have our boat reservations anna chuckled dont be simple errol flynn can always get you new reservations wednesday and thursday passed without a call friday we tried to find the movie company although all nice knew mr flynn was on the riviera no one knew exactly where early saturday we boarded the paris bus anna who was staying another month told me to be sure to look her up when she returned to new york and did i want to borrow any money i said no rather abruptly im afraid we had a sad week in paris before our boat sailed sue was a little brusque with me as i was now flat broke and had to borrow all of her gift money to eat but mostly sue raged against anna claiming she had frightened the movie woman off with her talk about big wages i often found myself agreeing with sue although in fairness to anna the blonde could have been a pure crackpot sue and i returned to the states with a lot of explaining to dofirst about why we didnt bring any souvenirs back for friends and then the questions about our nonexistent movie careers whenever a new flynn picture turned up even years later some clown would phone and ask this the one youre in i never called anna in new york and after i paid sue the money id borrowed we sort of fell apart for a time each morning when the unhousebroken pup got us upusually before dawnmy husband would shove me out of bed mumble take him out lights camera action and then turn over to sleep again but whenever i did see mr flynn on the screen in the past nine years i still liked him for he had if all unknowingly added a bit more glamour to the famed riviera for me by woodie king jr after waiting half the evening in the hot summer sun i got high and loafed up hasting street hot sweaty memories of the first block i can hardly remember but i can remember thats more than i can say for some bums i know like winos in doorways dying from hunger and overexposure their pants wet from the knee up the hot sun having its secret ways of making the urine smell like hell they have no memories the first block with its bars filled with already drunks or fags dressed in sisters or mothers clothes winking their false eyelashes at me me too high to spit on them above the bars were open windows with black nasty looking people spitting down to the street on a garbage man and his cart the garbage man sending up words the devil doesnt allow in hell above the open windows the sun hot was smiling down on noisy dark naked babies some running in the street some crying from a homemade buggy for their mother who left them to take her pickup for the usual threegeorges listened to a whore giving me some bull finally asking her how much she would pay me then telling her to go to hell i watched her put the bite on a white kid who drove up in a soupedup ford both he and the car trying to look hip waiting until he went upstairs for his action then went through his car and found nothing but beer bottles took them and deposited them for thirtysix cents and stole a candy bar i too high to remember what block from the first on just walked talked and loafed somewhere on hasting i stopped and played basketball with some wanttobe hipsters i got tired and sat in the evening shade and watched the game the homemade basket probably from a stolen vegetable basket listened to them argue watched them fight and one did get cut finally everyone ran leaving the bleeding kid in the lot it was funny i guess because i was high and didnt give a damn two cops came about a half hour later threw the kid in the car and all three split the scene the other guys came back and continued to play and argue and talk about the cut boys mother the sun finally settled behind the projects and i got tired of watching basketball somewhere on hastings i tried to sneak into the castle theatre where four pictures were playing for a dime but i got caught i loafed in front of the place with some other potheads i know we talked about the pimp life how we would be if always if we had a woman who loved us you got to use somebody a pimp has to use somebody he got to know like hes got to be more than hip like hes gotta be super hip under the theater lights which blinked on off on as if winking its knowing eye we yarded or talked if thats what you call yarding we tried to generalize tried to set a

executive secretary of the new york branch of the naacpthese priests are negro at the top of the mountain stands the vaunted university of the south it encompasses acres of beautiful campus grounds educational institutions dormitories and studentfaculty homes a magnificent chapel and a restaurant the university of the south at sewanee tennessee is owned by twentytwo southern dioceses of the episcopal church the restaurant on campus the claramount inn is owned by the university and is leased by it to one mrs clara shoemate a local mountain girl who made good mrs shoemate has never served a negro at the claramount she has denied entrance to the then only negro bishop of the episcopal church bishop harris of liberia who was a campus guest she has denied entrance to negro priests who have been summertime students at the episcopal theological seminary on campus she had denied some of us in september of last yearand it was her intention to deny us entrance on wednesday of last week we had to arrive unannounced and take her by surprise before she could lock the doors at approximately pm that day we pulled up in two cars got out swiftly and made for the entrance fathers pierson gordon and taylor were the first to enter they were met by a waitress who greeted them and told them that they dont serve colored here while she talked i outflanked her passed behind her and made it to the main dining room followed by the others we quickly sat at three tables waiting to be served the dining room lights were immediately turned off and a rope was hung across the entrance to the room indicating that the room was not to be used for serving we sat then from pm until am without so much as a glass of water we were ignored except for the occasional visits from college and seminary students these young men came in for one of two reasons to tell us that we were destroying all chances for a solution with our coercive action or to tell us that we had no business at sewanee and ought to leave there were two other visitors around pm bishop juhan retired bishop of florida now living at sewanee and until that night only suspected of being the segregationist power behindthethrone there came into the dining room it is a custom within the episcopal church that priests rise in respect when a bishop enters a room in which they happen to be we each stood bishop juhan began to address fr taylor who happened to be at the table nearest to where the bishop had entered he said to fr taylor my advice to youall is that you leave fr taylor asked why bishop juhans reply was so as not to increase the contention here fr taylor said thank you for your advice bish op i was at the next table and the bishop was between taylors table and mine i said to him what did you say bishop his answer was my advice to you is that you leave i asked him why and his answer was because they wont serve you here again i asked why his response was ask the management shell be in later i pressed the point to ask well do you know why bishop the bishop did not answer i broke the silence with the question is it because of my color bishop juhan did not hesitate as he said slowly and clearly yes i believe so in my own church i asked the answer was decisive yes there was nothing further to ask i said thank you for your advice bishop with that i removed my coat from the chair and sat down at the table all of us sat once more later one of the students who came in to talk with us was refused service in the smaller dining room which was kept open to them during our sitin he came back to tell us that bishop juhan had instructed the help not to serve any students who came into the large dining room to talk with us the bishop incidentally remained on vigil in the lobby and small dining room until the hour of our departure the second most significant visitor was miss clara as she is lovingly called by all who dwell on the mountain she came in at about pm saying she understood that someone wanted to talk to her we invited her to sit i asked her if it would not be well to have the lights turned on so that we could see each other she said no this is alrightthe darkness was very dark indeed we asked for a meal she said she has a plan for desegregation which involves feeding a negro student in june and a guest in september she said that she had to overcome resistance from many quarters and that with her plan she would be able to overcome the last obstacle the mountain people the poor white folk who dwell on the mountains side she said that she had thus far been successful in overcoming the resistance of the board of regents the faculties and the student bodies but that the mountainfolk had to be assured that this thing would happen slowly we asked her if any possible harm could come if there just happened to be food in front of us herself included at that moment and if we each just happened to be eating while we talked she said the mountainpeople would blow her place up by morning she said she would be glad however to take us to her home right then and give us the best meal we had ever had we told her we would be overjoyed to accept that invitation for breakfast if she would serve us supper at the claramount now she refused we asked her if the mountain people would not blow her home up if she fed us there she said that they would not at this point there was a sound something like poofthe darkness was made light we looked outside the huge glass windows at the rear of the dining room and beheld a huge cross blazing on the lawn perhaps fifty feet from the room itself we asked miss clara again if we might be served this time she said that the help would refuse pointing out that thev probably needed their jobs we bid her call them into the dining room and ask them in our presence she arose and without saying another word disappeared into the kitchen by now the students were getting somewhat beeredup they would come to the rope which divided us from them and we would be greeted with remarks such as these i like niggers i think everybody ought to own one im gonna buy me one for christmas or look at the zoo or im gonna take a nigger home with me in my trunksome of these men are studying for holy orders in the episcopal church all are college or seminary students of the university of the south eleven oclock is the normal closing hour of the claramount inn soon we heard a voice from among the beeredup students in the lobbyeight more minutes you all and theyll be coming out thentheyll be coming out in six minutes there was a crowd mostly students with some mountainpeople gathering outside in the parking lot we could see the lights from their cars and we could hear their voices they waited and so did we in a quick teteatete we decided that we were not going to leave unless miss clara informed us that she was closing and that it was time to go at am miss clara appeared in the dining room announced that she was closing and we arose we walked swiftly to our cars hearing and not hearing the shouts and the catcalls seeing and not seeing the blackjacks and beer cans we sped down the mountainside one car pursued us followed us to chattanooga and the driver took note of the motel at which we checked in we felt compelled to return on thursday lest students faculty mountaineers and everybody else on that unholy mountain mistakenly gloat over having chased us and lest they be misguided into thinking that our real purpose had been to have our pictures taken as some of them had taunted thursday noon when we drove up the door was locked before we could get out of the cars there were some patrons in the dining room these were allowed by the management to finish eating and to leave by a side door we priests embarked on a standin at the locked entrance throughout the day tension mounted as students faculty and even a few mountainpeople approached us to tell us why we were wrong and why we should go and how much harm we were doing to the progress mrs shoemates plan which had been accomplished no more guests were served that afternoon the kitchen help was sent home earlyand we decided not to be caught there by dark that afternoon breeden pierson zimmer and taylor were obliged to return to their respective homes because of the pressure of their work we felt that if we returned to sewanee on friday it should be only to try the door and finding it locked to leave the mountain with a statement that we had come to sewanee in an attempt to awaken the moral fibre of all there to the unchristian essence of segregation on church ground that we had failed and were going home i for one tried to get a flight out of nashville that night for we did not return to chattanooga on thursday night we went to nashville it was impossible to get a flight and it is only because the morning flight was also delayed for from six to eight hours that this frightened priest was among the number of the six frightened priests who returned to try the door on friday when we arrived at the parking lot of the claramount inn at about pm we at once took note of several cars which bore licenses from georgia and alabama we saw one of the waitresses leap from a table and run to lock the door it was locked when we reached it we each walked up to it tried it found it locked and returned to the car father fortna and father morris had on thursday made an appointment to talk with some students of the seminary at friday night at the campus home of one of the students for this reason we drove both cars outside of the gates to put the proper luggage in the proper cars and parted company fortna and morris were going to have lunch at the rebel inn which is a desegregated bus terminal on the mountain while there they were going to and did send our message to the wire service they would rest a bit down in chattanooga and at night would return to sewanee and their appointment with father hunter driving boyd gordon and i took off down the mountain our destination was the chattanooga airport and our respective homes the road leading down from the mountain is winding but good we took advantage of its goodness and moved off at about fifty miles per hour we had barely moved a mile the trip to chattanooga is about sixty miles when a black and red chevrolet station wagon coming from behind us shot by as though we were standing still it quickly overtook and passed the one car in front of us and disappeared around a turn just ahead when we rounded the bend we were confronted with a sight horrible beyond belief part of that station wagon was lying upside down in the middle of the road some fifty feet in front of that lay the driver half of the engine rested twenty feet up the side of the mountain on the left part of the left front fender and door were stuck in a crack made in the rock on the left which had been the point of impactthe driver had never come out of his lefthand turn on that mountain curve over to the right beyond the road and in a field lay half an axle with a twisted wheel attached metal everywhere was still steaming from the heat of the impact and the disintegration of the car our car screeched to a halt perhaps fifteen or twenty feet short of the broken distorted man on the road i covered him with my coat hunter found a pulsebeat boyd covered him with his coat it was windy so boyd knelt to hold the coats in place gordon asked the other drivers to get the police and ambulance i knelt at the victims head placed my stole about my neck opened my priests manual and began to administer last rites gordon knelt beside me while i prayed a few mountain people gathered a few students who had fol lowed us gathered i prayed for his forgiveness when the ambulance took him away we headed toward our car father hunter gave a patrolman a brief description of the victims recent recklessness he told him of our prayers two students asked me if he was dead i said no we prayed for his forgiveness and healing and if this is not gods will for his reception into heaven we drove away i think it was father boyd who gave my coat back to me saturday morning father fortna called me at my home he told me the man had died he said that a reporter had found out that the dead man was one of miss claras kitchen helpers and that miss clara was reported to have said that he was chasing us but he had passed us some of the kitchen help is reported to have said that he had a shotgun did he plan to get sufficiently down the mountain to park and blow our heads off from ambush as we reached him we probably will never know we do not know if anyone even found a shotgun we do know that he was at work when we arrived at the claramount that we had not closed his place of business that friday the thirteenth and that for some reason he was in the devils own hurry to get away from work ifand god grant that it be not sobut if he was intent upon killing one or all of us four priests god stopped him dead in his tracks sunday afternoon father fortna called me to tell me that before he left for home on saturday the mountain was bewailing not so much the fact that those unwanted priests had administered the rites but was angered over the insult that a black priest had actually laid his hands on their boys head in a final blessing their interpretationa curse we went up to the mountain to eatwe went up to hell may god draw near to that mountain may he shake it to its spiritual depths and place lord jesus in command there over his church as indeed he will some day be capitalism s show place in africa during ivory coast jj v president felix hou jff phouetboignys recent official visits to he united states and britain he was being seen as a spokesman for a particular approach in africa it is an approach which his ambassador in london referred to as a policy of realism and hard work today half way through her second year of independence the ivory coast is a showpiece for that particular approach although houphouetboignys own party the reassemblement democratique africain rda was among the most radical and outspoken of preindependence movements the country today remains the last haven of comparatively unfettered french private enterprise in africa the minister of finance is still frenchborn pioneer industry leg islation is of the most tempting and liberal the approach in terms of economic progress appears to be paying off a survey made by the industrial union of the ivory coast gives the total industrial turnover in as m francs cfa in as m and in as m the countrys capital abidjan is a showpiece of what a modern europeanstyle town can look like in africa industries of all kinds mushroom a giant bakery textile works tobacco factories coffee plants vehicle assembly plants new industries now in process of establishment include a chocolate factory four instant coffee plants two aluminum works one of which will produce some aluminum sheets annually from laminated strip imported from the cameroons federation and an oil refinery despite the fall in the price of the materials she exports the ivory coast has managed to maintain a favourable balance of trade in both her independent years her exports were worth m francs cfa which is some m francs in excess of imports in that year the country which has a population of m exported tons of coffee tons of hardwood tons of cocoa and tons of bananas radical observers find it easy to criticise the regime of m houphouetboigny for its apparent lack of enthusiasm for a deep break with the economic past and they are quick to label his country a haven of economic neocolonialism others however are convinced the old man knows what he is doingthat he is merely using the foreign capitalists to build up his country for him as fast as possible and saving up the application of radicalism for a later date when he will be in a stronger economic position certainly the present policy is vigorously justified in theory asked on one occasion why the ivory coast last year a new ecothe ghanaian and nigerian marketing boards of produce the senegalese too have now introduced themm houphouetboigny replied simply we have a liberal economy we dont believe in that sort of thing however there are already signs that this economic laissez faire is coming to an endeven in the ivory coast last year a new economic and social council was appointed to supervise economic planning it is true that the chair man of this council m jean delafosse seemed when this correspondent met him determined to go slow and avoid radical change he was against increased state participation in industry because he said in my personal view an industry without a private boss tends to be inefficient but the appointment was a straw in the wind this year in his budget message president houphouetboigny outlined some changes which will bring his country more into line with the general trend he promised a bill which will acknowledge the state as the sole proprietor of all uncultivated land and henceforth it is the state that shall share out to all citizens all available land to ensure better production what this measure exactly means and how much uncultivated land exists is not clear nor is it certain that the proposal will be welcomed if government tries to implement it but if radicalism is what houphouetboignys detractors want here they have it the budget also demands sacrifices from both natives and foreigners at a time when further effort will be required from all farmers tho president said it is only fair that those of us who have been a rather privileged class in comparison with the peasantry should also make sacrifices the latter will include a national contribution or special levy of per cent on all salaries and wages above francs cfa a month abolition of free houses for civil servants abolition from of most ministers and civil servants free cars and the introduction of controls on the repatriation of trading companies profits the minister of information m mathieu ekra recently announced that while there was a capital inflow of m last year m in profits was also repatriated to stop this financial hemorrhage all business will be required to pay an additional per cent of their profits to government but these levies will be restored to the taxpayers when they show that they have reinvested twice this sum in industries approved by government this means that business houses must accept some sort of government control over investment in addition to these economies and controls however government has now reviewed its national accounting proceduresdividing the budget into current and capital accountsand from now on it is emphasised expenditure shall under no circumstances exceed the estimates as a further emphasis on the move towards planification the government is now preparing the first systematic plana tenyear plan in the meantime the budget has included a special budget for investment accounting for m francs cfa which is quite distinct from the general and administration budgets an interim plan for has also been approved involving m francs cfa this apportions per cent of total investment towards general development towards increasing production towards equipment for the administration research work receives per cent cultural development per cent and social development per cent politically the presidents doctrine and methods appear to work well he is evidently popular in the country and the affair of the sanwi refugees who went over into ghana has been an exception his showmanship is today concentrated in abidjan with its superb new hotels its unique collection of palaces its elegant modernity and bustling prosperity photographs of all the brilliant goingson there are pinned weekly to the doors of sousprefets throughout the land two reforms since independence have had nationwide effect a major administrative reform aimed at decentralising local government divided the country into four departments and sousprefetures this setup replaces the subdivisions the other reform has been the introduction of national service consisting of six months military training and six months in civil works the french ambassador has handed over to the president the th naval infantry battalion which will become the first battalion of the new ivory coast army as well as the men the ivory coast also receives the battalions armament and vehicles the army now amounts to well over men including the youths called up for national civilian service in the mobile gendarmerie and in the republican guard just after m houphouetboigny laid the foundation stone of the french embassy the ambassador handed over a patrol boat p which under the name of patience is the first vessel of the ivory coast national navy it would be wrong to dwell on the policy differences which have so far seemed to separate so spectacularly the ivory coast from such neighbours as mali and guinea these policy differences are now narrowing as are one hopes the political quarrels between the groups what really characterises the ivory coast is the beauty of its wellwooded naturally prosperous countryside the somewhat phlegmatic good nature of its peoples and obviously deeply held conviction of its government that it is set on the right path in defense of negro intellectuals hum an progress as generally conceived in america is like a horse race it always becomes most complicated and suspenseprovoking when it approaches the home stretch the challenges the confusions the need for timing the need for decision as to when to make the allout break for the tape the suspense of whether or not once the break is madethe horse has the stamina to sustain the drive to the end or the jockey has the skill and wisdom to make the right moves in the right lane all these are part of the drama of that moment of entry into the stretch what compounds the emotion of the present american drive for human progress is the fact that everyone knows that one horse may leave the post and even enter the stretch well ahead and still wind up out of the money it is this single principle which is giving rise to so much study and scrutiny of negro peoples and negro leadership at this juncture in our nations history we find after three hundred years of being on this continent together and building this nation together that white intellectuals are seriously confessing to themselves that they havent really known the american negro and they must now painfully learn what kind of horse he is really like negroes on the other hand are impatiently concerned about their leadership and the timing of the final break for the tape of freedom and dignity this horserace symbolism will first appear to be an inept metaphor but close examination will reveal thatalthough we talk very much about equalityamerican social and economic mentality does not permit egalitarian realities to prevail very long it does not countenance dead heats so the egalitarian thinker like the horse must either gird himself for ascendancy or resign himself to decline the challenge this is the anxiety context which has provoked the increasingly vocal complaints from the white citizens councils and the conservative politicians that the naacp and core are pushing too fast in too many directionsand causing too much confusion while on the other hand negroes are complaining that their leadership is too slow too quiet and too willing to choose the slow outside lane of judicial political and assimilation gravel both extremes expectone wishfully the other fearfullythat the race will be lost but perhaps the most penetrating form of scrutiny of the negro in contemporary america comes from serious negro scholars themselves who are examining their own leadership like to stretch the metaphorhorses examining jockeys and jockeys examining trainers among the plethora of articles now appearing in many national magazines on the general topic of the negro in america one in particular addressed itself to the negro intellectual the significance of this article by the late professor e franklin frazier which appeared in the february issue of negro digest is that the american negro intellectual has always conceived himself and his unique role in american culture in a mixture of practical and philosophical terms and he has made his great contribution to american culture only when this combination has been right he has constantly addressed himself and this nation to the basic meaning of the christian religion the declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights as philosophical and social constructions transcending the vagaries and ironies of legislative law but he has always had to make his address through the machinery of law and social protest it is for this reason that his presence and his protestations have always served as a conscience to the nation and his modus operandi have sharply delineated between local law and constitutional jurisprudence this delineation has redounded to the ultimate benefit of this nation and yielded a clearer understanding of the particular meaning possible destiny and potential leadership role of this nation as the archetype of constitutional democratic government the pressing concern of professor frazier in this article which was titled the failure of the negro intellectual is that the present day intellectual unlike the historic negro intellectual who has always been the charismatic symbol for negro status and social mobility seems somehow now to be frittering away his time quoting and reciting great ideas enjoying the tinsel of middle class identification but abdicating his responsibility to produce leadership in these crucial times there is some validity to his point and indeed some cause to share and communicate his concern however to conceive the negro intellectual leadership role against the image of the traditional abstract philosopher is quite inadequate unless the analogy is highly selective and unless it alludes by comparison to men who related themselves to philosophical functions in the way of moses of socrates of jesus christ and more recently of mohandas k gandhi almost all contemporary professional philosophers generally have abdicated their responsibility to profound moral and ethical issues in their theoretical pursuit of the image of the physical sciences and the emulation of the technological model of mathematics the negro philosopher by contrast who begins as philosopher or theologian like dr martin_luther_king or rev fred shuttlesworth finds that he must release his creative genius as a socratic gadfly to pepper the conscience of the nation with practical demonstrations of how this nation must grow in the difficult learning of abstract and absolute truth but in this role he is neither conceived to be nor accorded the title philosophereven as socrates was not acclaimed philosopher by his contemporaries among academic scholars professor frazier did not intend to assert that men like dr howard thurman dr benjamin mays or dr martin_luther_king are not among the great philosophical minds of our nation he and we are disturbed by that species which comprise the large number of intellectuals for whom so many sacrifices have been made but who are so busy assimilatingnot integratingthat they spend their maximum energy trying to escape the responsibility to address themselves to their past and to their sacrificing forebears that they use the instrumentalities of education and knowledge to become jockeys and trainers in the race to produce a completely free nation and a better future for the generations which are to follow the fairer truth lies somewhere in between the scholar as a person and certain of these expectations the important philosophical contributions by negro scholars of this day are to be found in their address to the meaning of human dignity this address has none of the quality of abstractness which is generally characteristic of philosophical posture because the interpretations are bathed in practical problems and social action programs many negro scholars have awakened to the realization that mohandas k gandhi is no less a philosopher because his theory of human values was made explicit in a social action program they know that moses and jesus christ made their great spiritual gifts to the world through deeds and demonstrations from which succeeding generations inherited the great spiritual treasures of biblical literature and philosophy now unfortunately abused many college students and faculty members alike are demonstrating that relevance to life is a valid philosophical posture and a worthy objective for contemporary philosophical direction they intendin spite of the fritterersto achieve philosophical stature as doers of the word the serious negro intellectual as professor frazier was himself is a softsell moralist he is not temperamentally suited to the bombastics of hardsell moralism and righteous recrimination of the sort which does retributive violence to the offenders against dignity and decency and indeed this posture is frequently misinterpreted both by the conservative wishfulthinkers who hope that negroes will lose the race to freedom and by the anxietysyndromed liberals who want to collect quick bets so that they can luxuriate dont let either be fooled the negros apparent meekness and assimilationism is not to be confused with either weakness or abdication the negro intellectual has a program and he conceives his first responsibility to be to achieve freedom and dignity for this nation without vengeance or malice towards the present offenders against decency and underlying that surface assimilation is a hard core of pride and determination grounded in the realization that they are in the home stretch and thatafter three hundred degrading yearsthe tape of dignity and freedom is in sight three friends there is a saying a v a a friend is a person who knows all about you and still likes you three such persons have come into my life at different times and left a mark that can never be erased one saved my pride one saved my faith in human nature and the third saved my life they were all negro women i belong to the socalled white race far away and long ago in a suburb of boston i was trying my best to graduate from high school my marks in mathematics were very poor i just do not have the type of mentality that can fully grasp the science dealing with numbers one way or another i had managed to get by and graduate each year with my class but this time i knew i wouldnt graduate unless a miracle happened and the miracle happened in the person of dorothy a classmate dorothy was a whizbang when it came to numbers she could add subtract and multiply like nobodys business instead of going directly home that warm may afternoon i had gone to the basement of the school and thinking myself alone was indulging in a good cry suddenly i realized i was not alone and turning around saw dorothy a few feet away looking at me with great concern whats the matter rosie she asked and that was all i needed to make me cry louder between sobs i told her my life was ruined i wasnt going to graduate i had flunked in math i couldnt add two and two dorothy was silent for a few minutes but she seemed to have arrived at some conclusion lets walk home she said i have an idea ill tell you while were walking dorothy and i generally rode the street cars home as we lived quite a distance from the school but the threemile walk didnt seem long this time and this was dorothys plan she would tutor me every day for a couple of hours until the time came for exams that is if i didnt object object who would object to manna from heaven for three weeks i went to her home after school and studied like mad she quickly detected my weak spots and hammered away at them when class was over her mother used to bring in a glass of milk and something to eat generally homemade cakes or cookies when the time came for exams dorothy sat two rows away i could just see the top of her head when i couldnt get the answer right away i would look across to her and as silly as it sounds id get the answer by just concentrating on her big blue hair ribbon i passed of course and my mother went with me to dorothys home while i thanked her and gave her a small gift of gratitude dorothys mother served milk all around and the cakes were extra special with brightly colored frosting time passed as time will do and it was thanksgiving in boston just after the world war ii my husband had died overseas my parents had also died as had a daughter and a sister i had a good job in a large hospital but the thought of being thankful about anything never occurred to me i despised the human race then along came betty betty was a nurses aide in the hospital where i worked she was the only fellow employe whom i bothered to speak to unless forced to do so in the line of duty betty and i went to lunch at the same time but not always together sometimes she would get to the dining room ahead of me and would turn up a chair next to her so that we could sit together i would do the same if i arrived first the day before thanksgiving she saw i was down in the dumps and did her best to cheer me up would i cheer not on your life i sulked all the more and finally told her in words of one syllable what i thought of thanksgiving it was for the birds she made no reply but walked away and left me that night the telephone rang as i sat alone in my little apartment on the ninth floor of a hotel overlooking the charles river it was betty my husband and i would like you to come to dinner tomorrow she said i hesitated perhaps too long for she was back on the line saying of course if you dont want to its perfectly all right if i dont want to if i dont want to i repeated why betty id love to and its wonderful of you to invite me that thanksgiving dinner and that thanksgiving day is one i will always remember i have never known such love from anyone as betty and her family showed me that day besides her husband there was a teenage son bettys mother bettys widowed sister and her two small children and a boston policeman a friend of the husband the policeman had recently lost his wife and they thought he would be lonesome eating alone when the time came to leave i kissed betty and her mother and her sister and they kissed me that little moment of love and understanding will last through eternity and then there was that horrible year of a believer in astrology would say the stars were against me well something was i was jobless in ill health and scared to death my home if it could be called that was on the third floor back of a thirdrate hotel in a thirdrate western city the only bright spot in my life was vannie the elevator operator who was always good for a laugh no matter how depressing the circumstances she would say something to make her passengers laugh and how we needed that laugh i remember one night when it was raining hard and the wind was shrieking as if to say all hope was lost forever i rang for the elevator and vannie responded smiling as usual well she said as she opened the door to let me on this is a fine night to go up on a mountain and howl i who hadnt laughed for days broke out laughing and a sad face man who was already a passenger when i entered took off his hat in respect for something i hope it was vannies gallantry of soul but the time came when even vannie couldnt make me smile i was behind in the rent and was told to pay up by pm the next day or else i started for the telegraph office to send a collect wire to a friend for helpa friend whom i felt sure could not respondwhen i suddenly burst out crying no bells were ringing for the car so vannie took it to the top floor stopped it then turned to me as dorothy long ago had asked me what was the matter so did vannie i told her i was going to be evicted and why aint you got no one you can go to for help she wanted to know the question and its obvious answer brought with it a decision on my part i knew then what i was going to do the cowards way out was it only a coward would continue to live under such circumstances take me down i said abruptly and when the car leveled off at my floor i left without saying good night i would say good morning in another world once in my room i sat down at the shabby inkstained cigaretteburned desk and started writing a letter to a loved one i wanted them to understand that what i was about to do wasnt because i was a coward no it was because there was a knock on the door and right away i knew it was the manager he was going to put me out then he wasnt going to wait until morning i looked towards the window through which i had planned to jump and froze in my seat then the knock came again and i heard vannies voice let us in mis kelly she said in her thick southern voice weall want to talk to you oh well what did it matter i got up and opened the door there was vannie and the housekeeper a redfaced irishwoman generally known as maime who sized me up at a glance and smiled encouragingly vannie here tells me youre kinda broke she said like we all are at times i can remember when i didnt have a nickel for a cuppa coffee but what i was going to say is i need a maid on the third floor doris the one i had quit yesterday said her boy friend doesnt want her working no more what i mean is if youd like the job i know the manager will let you stay until you get square he aint a bad sort he aint ill have a word with him whatdoyuh say i worked there six weeks when a job in my own line came along and i left for the far west maime and vannie walked to the bus terminal with me helping me with my baggage as the hound pulled out for l a they waved frantically from the loading platform dorothy betty vannie and dear old maime how i would like to see them all again i thank the good lord i was worthy of their friendship another country press deadlines being what they are these lines are being written long before they will appear in the magazine to

village bars and at cocktail parties from cape cod to carmelbythesea another country is that much of an event james baldwin is just possibly the most gifted of all negro writers and certainly one of the finest writers of any race or color of this generation his first novel go tell it on the mountain published a decade ago told those who read it that a major literary talent was at hand the promise of excellence was fulfilled with notes of a native son his second book a collection of excruciatingly bright and lovely essays the growth and mellowness of the young new yorkers talent was there in giovannis room baldwins second novel and third book but the novels central theme a homosexual relationship undoubtedly compromised its credits it was with baldwins fourth book last seasons nobody knows my name that the critics broke through their wall of caution or indifference or fear to hail him the little black boy from harlem had made it and it no longer could be denied there remained of course some doubters as there always must be this young man with his audacious probing lilting prose his needlesharp intelligence his extraordinary insight and his savage groping beyond images had to be slapped down put in his place but greatness is his place he proves it beyond all reasonable question with another country this is a novel about the many faces of love it is centered on the lives of nine people over a period of a year only two of these people are negroes they are rufus and ida brother and sister leona is tied to rufus with terrible bonds forged by that madness which is so uniquely american there is vivaldo the handsome young italoirish writer buddy of rufus and lover of ida there are richard and cass vivaldos friends who find their marriage deteriorating as richard becomes successful as a novelist and there are eric and yves about to resume in another country the unorthodox liaison that had rooted in france all these people are joined in subtle and painful and dangerous ways but it is rufus angry ineffectual and doomed who is central to the novel his despair in life and finally his death shadow the lives of all the others and oddly it is with rufus that james baldwin the writer flirts with failure with rufus and ida the two negro characters emerge as the least sympathetic the least well realized of the crop of course this could have been intentional just possibly bitterness can bind thwart development distort perhaps baldwins portraits of rufus and ida are deliberately onesided perhaps he is saying this is a fruit of denial however many readersof all raceswill wish that rufus and ida were as complete and believable as cass and richard and eric and vivaldo their being so would have brought a truly outstanding literary achievement closer to a great one as it is a nother country is a novel most americans ought to read corinna back door slid open j np slowly cautiously jl quietly the little face kcscf p eered round wide eyed there was no one in the dirty littered kitchen that meant that mama and the man were still asleep the little girl eased into the kitchen pushing the door shut with both hands clasped tightly about the knob the child was dressed in a ragged uneven faded gingham skirt and a soiled blue sweater her pigtailed kinky hair was a ratsnest from her nights sleep and she wore runover oxfords on her skinny feet she wore also like a protective capelet a shrinking conciliatory man ner that people found quite irritating because it made them feel so guilty for she made them remember the many crimes they had committed against love harassed mothers seeing her idling timidly among their children would call her to them and comb her hair and give her slices of bread and peanutbutter then the little girl corinna her name was became whiny and clinging and the mothers would brusquely reject her for while it was a shame she wasnt really their problem and she did have a mother such as she was and they hardly had enough time for their own kids what with washing and cooking and ironing and gossiping it was a roundrobin kind of thing on this saturday morning mrs della somers a rather new neighbor had kindly told corinna to go along home and get herself cleaned up and if it was all right with corinnas mommy they could walk up to town together mrs della somers had only lived in the rancid neighborhood for a few weeks and she had taken a fancy to corinna being a childless elderly widow and the pattern was emerging once more but mrs della somers was not yet tired of corinnas perpetual hanging about with her big eyes beseeching with her incessant demands to go to the store for you or get you a glass of water sweep your floor help you wash mrs somers did what she could for the little girl mrs della somers was a thwarted romantic not a realist poverty had not ever made her cynical and rendered her judgment harsh so corinna slid into the cold empty dirty kitchen and hesitantly crossed to her mothers closed bedroom door she knocked silence she knocked silence she knocked and said mamma timidly and gaining courage mamma she knocked her little knuckles making a little noise mamma faint stirrings and the rumble of a male voice corinna heartened called mamma what her mothers voice was slurred and morningfoggy miz somers want take me to town well go on she gonna get you somthin she say i got to get my

hair combed so i can go with miz somers oh hell wait a minute corinna heard her mother and the man talking there was laughter between them and she listened hard trying to distinguish words the door was wrenched open and corinnas mother entered the kitchen she ignored her daughter and went over to the dirty table pushing dishes aside and picking up a crumpled package of cigarettes she greedily lighted one and let the burnt match flutter to the floor boy have i gotta clean house today how cum you diden warsh up these dishes i doan know corinna whined but her mother did not pursue the subject what she taken you to town fer i doan know she jus ask me like she did last week corinna stared at her mother her mother was handsome she had an earthy strong quality that looked good even in the early morning light she was clad in a mans striped robe and her heavy ropy hair was undone about her moody face she looked straight ahead smoking hard at the cigarette she want me to come on mamma dam ol biddyshe ask things bout me well find the comb waitits in my purseyou got any clean sockswait a minnit corinnas mother disappeared into the bedroom there was the sound of voices indistinct at first then clearly waitll i get her dressed corinna waited impassively listening picking at her fingers her stance pigeontoed her belly pouched an awkward unlovely child with great eyes and a profile that would someday have been very pure and lovely her mother reentered the room get you cloes off girl you coulda been undress aincha got a clean dress there in the wardrobe corinnas mother cleaned out the comb and dropped the hair on the floor corinna removed her skirt and sweater and stepped out of her shoes her mother went to the tall old wardrobe that stood in one kitchen comer and opened the doors and peered inside she pulled out a plaid cotton dress that had remnants of lace clinging to a white collar and she bent foraging for socks and found a pair of only slightly soiled white ones here wear

a dog on satday in my own cmon lemme comb your hair corinna went obediently to stand before her mother the woman pulled the starched faded little dress over corinnas head and deftly buttoned up the buttons she kept up a continuous monologue as her hands transformed corinnas hair into beautiful shining plaits there she said go warsh your face and put lotion on your laigs corinna went timidly into her mothers bedroom she passed the big rumpled bed with averted eyes but the man hailed her hello there sweetcakes goin byby hereheres a dime get you somethin to drink on me gettin to be a big ol gal aint you how old are you now corinnas reply was inaudible but the man laughed meaninglessly and leaning in the bed on one elbow he held out to corinna a shining silver coin she took it not looking at him and said thank you with a nod of her head and she fled from his mockery corinnas mother laid her daughters coat across a kitchen chair cmonthat lady aint gonna wait all day there was a gentle knock upon the back door corinnas mother ran the comb through her own hair pulled the bedroom door shut and cinched her bathrobe all in one fluid movement she flung a libelous look around the kitchen and opened the door mrs della somers stood there smiling her gentle wide aging face expectant hello mrs wales corinna ask if we could go to town together we wont be gone long im just going to pay some bills and get a little meat she smiled at corinna who was shrugging into her coat why shure missis somers she enjoys goin with you so much excuse this kitchenive worked every day this week and jes

nickel and a quarter from babysitting while janeys mamma went off to the shoe store you put it up fo me corinna meant no harm she simply did not want the strange mans silver but her mother stared at

somers asked holding out her shabbily gloved hand pick up that dime corinna an get youself a coke like joe say fer you t do i doan want it mamma corinna whined and mrs della somers shifted her limp

accep a gift oh mamma ill keep it i jes wanted you to have it please mamma corinna dryeyed flung herself against mrs della somers and that lady felt her heart turn over with grief corinna held the woman tightly burrowing her face into her plump body holding the gentle woman tightly tightly in a grip of love and longing and fear holding the clean smell and the warmth within her skinny arms and she was quiet now silent and terrified of she knew not what only wishing to cling to this steady rock her childish reason overwhelmed mrs della somers horribly embarrassed by the show of naked emotion attempted to break the childish hold and she laughed foolishly and helplessly saying now now corinnas mother rushed n forward yanking at her daughters arms and there began a brazen fearful terrible waltz around the unsightly kitchen damn brat turn her loose turn that woman loose doin everybody jus the same holdin to em wantin to be wherever you aint wanted i hear em talk evbody jus the same hatin to see you cornin an glad to see you leavin let her be she began to slap viciously at the girl chopping at the frail hugging arms wait wait mrs wales please wait mrs della somers put her gloved hands protectively around corinnas head standing still and facing the angry mother feeling corinna feeling the trembling feeling the seeking and she said quietly let me talk to her she lost to herselfcorinna honey turn me loose and look at me she rubbed her hands across the childs head gently talking to her gentling her soothing her maybe mammall let you go with me another time you got to be a good girl and mind your ma you know honey now stand back an let me see your little face now look look up at me back off and let me see your eyes and ill hold your hands tight in mine corinna responded to the kindly voice and looked up deeply into mrs della somers face and mrs della somers felt her heart shred in half they ignored corinnas mother and the man who now stood peeping around the cracked bedroom door now mrs somers said smiling listen honey ill go on to town and get my shopping done and ill buy you a nice surprise if mama dont care maybe some cookies or a nice dolly even at the tencent store but mama says you got to stay home cause you dont want to do as she says and we must always mind our mamas honey she looked at corinnas mother im sorry bout this mrs wales i didnt

she yours and not mine and that mean that you got the law with you though you aint fit to raise up a dog even much less a little shy girlchile she bent and kissed corinna on the cheek and dropped the small hands and she turned and went swiftly out not shutting the door behind her what was all that about the man asked staring he needed a shave get that coat off corinnas mother said evenly she went toward the bedroom without answering the man and the door was shut behind her the little girl was left standing in the middle of the room she stood there shadowy wispy quiet her hands clasped together upon her flat breast she opened her hands a little and the dime fell to the floor and rolled about until it came to rest under the black oldfashioned stove corinnas mother found it there that afternoon when she swept the kitchen and she held it in her hand looking at it and suddenly she began to weep chitterlings for breakfast marge wheeled her shopping cart slowly along the aisles of the eknunuka air base commissary it was her first time there and she had no idea where to find the items she wanted but having to move slowly and look carefully worked no hardship on marge she rather enjoyed it because it gave her a sense of adventure not knowing exactly what she would see next she loved the excitement of discovering something new whether it was just groceries in an unfamiliar store or new people or even new places however this yen for excitement and surprises did not show on marges face she was a rather tall slender reservedlooking brown skinned woman who looked her age which was she wasnt pretty by a long shot but neither was she unpleasant to look at marge was just average and knew it and never let it bother her she had been in alaska for only about two months having gone there with her soldier husband and their year old twin boys actually her husband was in the army and they usually shopped at the army commissary but the apartment they rented was much closer to eknunuka air base and they had decided to try the air base commissary for a change frankie her husband a tall dark excitinglooking gi was busy talking to an airman he knew and marge hoped that they would talk for a long time so she could shop in peace when frankie went shopping with her he was always throwing things into the shopping cart that wrecked her food budget he believed in the large economy size he bought things like kingsize boxes of frozen crabs gallon cans of concentrated grape juice and pound turkeys last week they had consumed so much grape juice until it seemed it was running out of their ears she shopped leisurely but finally she had everything she needed except meat this she always shopped for last no special reason it was just a habit she went to the meat section and picked up a five pound roast and put it in her cart it was pretty reasonable only cents a pound as her eyes roved further over the meat counter she suddenly stiffened and ex claimed under her breath well ill be darned for there in front of her in the frozen meat section was a container that plainly said chitterlings she was completely flabbergasted for a moment because chitterlings was the last thing she had expected to see in alaska they seemed like such a backhome type of food seeing the container brought to her a rush of pleasant and unpleasant memories she thought first of her maternal grandmother one summer when marge was years old her mother and father who lived in racine wisconsin but originally came from birmingham alabama had decided to send her there to visit her grandmother for two weeks marge had fallen in love with the gentle softspoken old lady at first sight grandma lewis as she was called lived in a beautiful but weatherbeaten old twostory frame house in the best colored section of town her own mother had migrated from a plantation in camp hill alabama when the slaves were freed during the civil war grandma lewis had been born in birmingham reared there married and had children there all of whom had migrated up north she kept marge fascinated by the hour telling her stories out of her own past and tales her mother had passed down to her of happenings during slavery times but best of all she was a superb cook and marge gained pounds in the two weeks she was there grandma lewis filled her up on corn bread collard greens blackeyed peas and blackberry cobbler grandma lewis also introduced marge to chitterlings one day marge had gone to visit a girl she had met there and when she returned to her grandmothers house a highly obnoxious odor met her at the door it was chitterlings cooking but after they were done marge tasted them to please her grandmother and to her surprise found that like limburger cheese they tasted a whole lot better than they smelled as a matter of fact she liked them so well that her grandmother had to fix them for her three times before she left when marge returned to wisconsin she told her mother about the wonderful southern dishes she had tasted and especially about the chitterlings she asked her mother why didnt they ever have chitterlings sometimes her mother smiled grimly and said listen sweetie eating chitterlings is just as bad as if i were to sit out on our front porch with a big slice of bright red watermelon and eat it all the white folks passing by would see me and snicker about it they all think we cant afford to eat anything else but chitterlings collard greens and watermelons ill have to admit they taste pretty good but your father and i have been trying to get away from being stereotyped ever since we left alabama were determined to live dress and eat exactly like everyone else by everyone else you mean white folks dont you mother said marge dont be difficult marge said her mother testily after that marge didnt mention chitterlings again but when she went away to camp winnepeg the next summer and they served watermelon she found herself taking furtive glances at the white girls to see if they might be watching her in any peculiar way and the second time it was served she refused her portion saying she didnt care for it since that time in the circles in which she moved and the places her husband was stationed chitterlings were seldom seen or mentioned although they had bought watermelon several times but now seeing them sitting there in of all places alaska she smiled to herself and on the spur of the moment picked up a twopound container and thrust it into her shopping cart after all it was only cents when she and frankie returned to the apartment and were unpacking the groceries he saw the container of chitterlings he stared at it with his mouth hanging open and finally said well where on earth did you pick that up us members sure will find our own wont we marge laughed and explained that she was surprised to see them herself then frankie looked at her and a little frown appeared on his forehead and marge knew right away that he wasnt amused he said now listen marge personally i like chitterlings although i havent eaten any since i was a little boy but dont you think theres a time and place to eat and cook them after all were the only colored family living in this apartment building right now and we have to sorta set the right example uh we dont want to give these people anything to criticize us about they already think that all we colored folks eat is chitterlingstype food and you must know that chitterlings smell like hell cookin we want them to smell the aroma of roast beef ham and roast pork and so forth cornin from this apartment not this mess marge felt guilty right away because she didnt know why she had bought the chitterlingsshe never had beforedidnt actually know how to cook themand it was true that she and frankie had to be on their best behavior especially since they were the only colored in the buildingbut gosh it was downright stupid to stop eating something just because somebody else looked down on it she asked frankie well what about the italians and their garlicky spaghetti and meat balls are they ashamed huh i dont see why we cant eat roast beef ham and chitterlings too there is no reason frankie exploded except its better to eat chitterlings in a chitterlings neighborhood furthermore i dont even want to smell them cooking myself so youd better find some way of cooking them when im not here or else throw them to hell out then he stalked out of the door marge stuck the chitterlings in the refrigerator and put the other groceries away and sat down and wondered just how shed gotten involved in that silly hassle over chitterlings besides the other tenants in the building werent very friendly anywaythey probably didnt care whether she had chitterlings or didnt have chitterlings she had met most of the women downstairs in the washroom at one time or another when she went down to use the machines but aside from saying hello and asking her in an offhand way how she liked alaska and was she army or air force all of them were rather standoffish the woman across the hall who was obviously a real southerner judging from her accent spoke to her whenever they passed in the hall but she hadnt come over to welcome marge into the building she probably couldnt stand colored people anyway truthfully marge was so lonely sometimes until she could just bawl her loneliest moments were just after the twins left for school then the apartment seemed deadly quiet she muttered to herself now what am i going to do with those darn chitterlings gosh now that ive paid for them id hate like the dickens to throw them away then suddenly she had a bright idea i know what ill do thought marge ill wait until thursday night when frankie goes out to play poker with his friends and late when everybody is either asleep or out ill cook the chitterlings that way the smell wont interfere with anyone now if i remember right i think grandma just boiled them but come to think of it hers werent frozen maybe id better look in my cookbook and see if i can find anything about them marge got her cookbook and rapidly turned to the section on meat but couldnt find a thing on the preparation of chitterlings but she decided that boiling was the only way and thats exactly how she would fix them frankie said nothing more to her about the chitterlings and thursday night he went happily off to his poker game probably wondering why she didnt blow a fuse as usual the twins kept up a constant yakityyak until when marge shooed them off to bed around she looked in the hallcloset and took out the can of chlorophyll room deodorant and then cursed because it was empty she had forgotten that the twins were using it the other day when she went out of course the little monsters had used up the entire container well no matter she was going to use the fan in the kitchen anyway maybe it would suffice m at she began her selfappointed task and when she finally had the chitterlings boiling on the stove she was ready to admit that they were highly perfumed to say the least after sticking a fork in them for the umpteenth time she was finally satisfied that they were cooked but for some reason she didnt have any desire to eat them she turned off the fire and pushed them to the back of the stove and went to bed but not before opening all the windows in the kitchen and living room to make sure the smell would all go out although with the fan going it wasnt as bad as she had expected when frankie finally arrived home and found all the windows open in the middle of december in alaska he thought marge had finally flipped her wig until he found out the purpose of it all at first he was pretty angry but then he finally saw the light or so he said to marge he told her honey i guess we can eat roast beef ham and chitterlings too but for gods sake make sure you have plenty of room deodorant next time marge knew that he probably said that only because he had arrived home so late and was fending off any kind of argument but when he left for work the next morning the chitterlings were still sitting on the back of the stove untouched marge gave the twins their breakfast and they went off to school after the twins left marge decided she would just have toast and jam for her own breakfast and was just clearing away the soiled dishes of the twins when the doorbell rang oh cripes said marge i wonder who that isand me in my housecoat who is it she said its lola the girl across the hall said a voice in a slow drawl oh god marge thought ill bet she was up late last night and smelled those chitterlings cooking and has come to complain she opened the door and there stood lola in her hat and coata tall slender pretty girl with a round face sparkling eyes and an unmistakable southern accent she looked to be about not far from marges own age may ah come in foah a minute ah jus drove mah younguns to school and befoah ah starts in to cleanin mah apartment ah thought ahd jus

grief here it comesbut ill just tell her i have a right to cook what i please in my own apartment lola said uh pardon me foah askin but were yall cooking chitlins last night about oclock yes why said marge in an icy tone lolas expression changed rapidly from one of inquiry to one of eagerness she exclaimed why honey chile ah jus knew ah smelled chitlins cookin you see ah couldn sleep las night and

much ah could eat them foah breakfas dinner and suppah said lola marge stood up and said breakfast well why not theres a big pot of chitterlings sitting on the back of my stove why dont you take off your coat and lets dive right in where is the church goin on the sunday follow ing the brutal mob ac tions at the bus depots in anniston and birmingham alabama a dispirited episcopal communicant of the latter city wrote there is no condemnation of the riots from our pulpit today there was no moral guidance in a time when the eyes of the world were focused on our state and nation our churches really have become gymnasiums where we exercise with the reading of the book of common prayer neither sweating nor breathing hard in the stuffy air of sanctity in an eastern city last summer i had a pleasant visit with an able young newspaperman a negro and an episcopal communicant it developed that later in the afternoon he was meeting his son who was coming home from camp via bus you might be interested to know i said that the diocese of atlanta has just had its first integrated camp one negro boy aged applied and promptly was accepted he proved to be a popular camper and had no difficulty at all his personality was such that he did not feel alone or an outsider and of course this personality was precisely why the other boys did not think of him in such terms the young newspapermans eyes widened you did that in georgia i nodded affirmatively we couldnt do that here he said i am grieved to say that here we do not have a very happy relationship between the white and negro episcopal churches there is little communication between us some feel there is a drawing apart there is a need for some positive action how did the atlanta diocese manage the camp it was explained that when the youngster applied for camp and was accepted the clergy and laymen on the camp committee informed by letter all parents of other boys who had been accepted they were told they could withdraw their son or sons if they wished but earnest hope was expressed they would not none did officials in the small city near the camp mikel quietly were informed the teenage counselors were briefed on their practical and christian duties all went well it was a happy rewarding experience each of us recognized the jarring contradictions in the drama of race in alabama brutal mobs were for some time unchecked by police in that time there were inflicted severe injuries to many for the crime of having ridden on a bus to which they had been sold a ticket in mississippi the jails were being filled with white and colored travelers young and middleaged who were testing what is an incredible denial in this last half of the twentieth centurythe right of a citizen of the united states freely to travel on common carriers and to use the public services in the depots it is a sad commentary that the episcopal churches in these states were largely sunday gymnasiums insofar as any leadership in the tremendous moral problem of our time was concerned nor were they alone the silence of all the churches was inescapable later there was a mild protest by some ministers against the inactivity of police but still there is no action only silence in georgia one small boy makes episcopal camping history by being accepted at the camp maintained by the diocese for the summer recreation and instruction of its young people in an eastern state a young negro doubted this could have been done in his diocese there is a third illustrationand a more damning one there came to atlanta university two brilliant young negro students graduates of mission schools in their native country maintained by one of the larger protestant southern denominations neither was ever called upon by members or officers of that denomination a distinguished member of nigerias high court who had been educated in elementary and secondary schools and colleges all maintained by one of the largest of us denominations visited four southern cities and four in the north and was never approached by any representative of the church which had given him all but his graduate education still another african visitor whose youth had been spent in schools supported by american missions had a similar experience i am glad i was ignored he said i have heard your joke about the african visitor who was finally admitted to a restaurant with the apology of the manageryou see i thought you were one of these american negroes i am afraid i would not have been happy talking with a pastor who would not admit american negroes to worship in his churcheven though the same church educated me there is more than one reason why christianity is not more of a force in the newly emergedand emergingcountries of africa but one of them is this inescapable gulf which the african intellectual quickly sees even though he has never been out of africa a visitor here of course experiences the harsh irony of it the episcopal church in america suffers equally with the others all are afflicted by those callous persons of christian affiliation who insist that the negro is an inferior person and that segregation is decreed by god nor may we episcopalians play the pharisee and pass on the other side from these the ugly distorted even vicious publications of the more fanatic white citizens councils and the hateorganization pamphlets delight in printing sermons and statements from the three or four episcopal rectors in the southern states who lend their names and positions to the prejudices and passions of the extremists certain questions are posed is there any thoughtful person who does not understand why communism which also claims it can redeem and change the world is able to attract so much dedicated service especially though not exclusively in so many depressed areas of the world one must ask what sort of examples or alternatives are offered them missionaries all over the world have sent urgent pleas to their churches in america to put christianity to work in americas problem of race some churches clergymen and laymen have acted with vigor and courage but it still is true that am on sunday is the most segregated hour of all the week that christianity in america cannot go on with this without disastrous results must be plain to all save the most stubbornly obtuse it is not easyand yet in fact it is if there is a will to act that we think in terms of images has become almost a trite truth but truth it is when confronted with something which radically alters the status quo we invent mental images to help us rationalize resistance to change in southern school cases the extremiststoo often assisted by the daily press members of the clergy the bar and the politiciansinvariably conjured up two false ones they first rubberstamped every negro as dirty illiterate criminal or dishonest that this reflected one of the worst evils of segregationa separation from truth and fact and acquaintance with the great body of educated cultured negroesnever occurred to these makers of false images they then pictured the children of such persons as overrunning the schools and then paradoxically they expressed unreasoned fear about intermarriage and the loss of racial purity that the us supreme court decisions plainly had said this overrunning was not the intent of the rulings and had declared placement laws to be constitutional when not used to discriminate was blithely ignored in a campaign to deceive people and create resistance defiance and mobs that most of the nations population had for a long time been operating without laws requiring segregation and without signs of the much feared raceruin also was bypassed the extremists were in fact insulting their own people by implying that only they of all americans were in need of such laws this obsession with false images can be as harmful to christianity as false gods common sense somehow becomes paralyzed it is utterly preposterous that in this period of history millions of americans should be most concerned with where a colored child shall sit in school and whether colored persons shall be welcomed to worship christianity cannot afford to be made to appear ridiculousand yet it is even christians must agree that the long history of foreign missions and the opposition of christians to acceptance of colored persons in their churches would be the subject of loud coarse laughter were it not for the byproduct of it a number of christian and judaic leaders in individual sermons in the past several months seriously have suggested that fewer and fewer persons are using religion as a yardstick for determining values all the evidence tends to sustain them the episcopal church which sensibly avoided any rupture at the time of the american civil war should be better able to act with common sense and christian conviction than those denominations which divided in acrimony and prejudice a decision to accept negro worshipers which results in years of budgets being unmet and building programs bankrupted is perhaps valid in a temporary and superficial manner it is unlikely that any diocese which planned prayed and educated its communicants would suffer any real losses but it may be that the christian churchnot merely the episcopalis at the point where it must face up to losing those persons who cannot entertain the idea of being in the same sanctuary or at the same communion rail with a colored person to compromise almost surely means a slow death as communicants with a prodding sense of conscience and morality drop out this would certainly be true of the young communicants the problem of race is not of course the only one facing christianity today there is the complex problem of growing urban populations the shifts to suburbs the abandonment of many city churches and the urgent need for christian leadership in the socalled asphalt jungles of the large cities but that of race is the most pressing of all many voices ask where is the church going only the church can answer how to tell your child about hildren observe many things for themselves they hear talk among other children and are aware of much more than we realize the parent with the attitude what my child doesnt know wont hurt him is burying her head in the sand children are naturally curious about sex matters and if they cant get the answers at home they get them elsewhere resulting in a welter of guiltladen fact and fallacy how do you handle your childs interest in sex matters here are some of the questions parents ask about the subject and some sugges tions for guidance remember its not merely the words you use in explaining sex to your child that matter but how you say them your expression and gestures your attitude toward sex in general the mother who snatches a childs hand away when he touches his genitals who acts disgusted when he displays interest in his bowel movements who is horrified when he shows curiosity concerning his body is teaching him that the body is dirty and that everything about it including sex is bad many children taught to feel this way grow up abnormal sexually or else they are unable to enjoy sex relations at what age should a child he told there is no right age questions should be answered when asked the younger the children the more wholesome and unashamed is their interest in sex some children begin asking at the age of three or four some at six or seven perhaps at the tender age of two a little girl may point to the genitals of a baby brother and ask whats that she should not be made ashamed of having asked an honest question and should receive an honest answer little boys and men all have that you might say its called a penis thats how they do weewee girls and women have a little opening for weewee its called a vagina you never know when a child will pop a question about sex at you and so you have to be prepared dont put your children off with ill tell you when youre older or you shouldnt bother about such things theyll get the feeling that their questions are bad they wont stop wondering but they may stop asking their parents and go underground for their answers some of which will be unwholesome some parents have the idea that the sex training of the child need not begin until adolescence but by that time his behavior patterns sexual and otherwise will be pretty much fixed for life at this point all you can do is try to correct faulty ideas acquired in childhood and relieve anxieties arising from sexual maturation correcting faulty ideas isnt easy the sex superstitions picked up from other children and carried over into adulthood are difficult to eradicate that is why it is important to give your child the fundamentals early wont knowing the details make children over conscious of sex regardless sexual interests are bound to come to children anyway secrecy rather than honesty is likely to make them over sexconscious the more you surround the subject of sex with mystery and secrecy the more concerned children become with finding out what the secret is your child will discover the facts of life eventually what parents do when they talk to their children is to help them understand students of child development find that if children learn about sex simply and naturally and can ask questions freely they are less likely to go in for sex practices than children who have been made to feel that it is wrong to even think of such matters unsatisfied curiosity coupled with feelings of guilt and rejection account for most of the objectionable sex behavior in children of any age isnt it possible to tell children too much about sex yes when your child asks a specific question answer simply and briefly and then stop dont go into elaborate details when a child first asks where babies come from the simplest answers will satisfy himan elaborate explanation will only serve to confuse him mommie where did i come from in a special place inside mommy right here see at first you were just a tiny seed and then you grew into a beautiful baby was i happy to have you for my own where does the baby come out through the opening in the mothers body called the vagina it is between her thighs does it hurt to have a baby yes but the doctor knows how to make it easier for the mother and once she has her baby she is so happy she forgets all about the pain what about children who never ask questions should they be told anyway children are always curious about the body even if they dont appear to be perhaps theyre afraid to ask questions of their parents because they sense an embarrassment or perhaps they have the idea these things are bad or it may be theyve been told to wait till theyre older such children may have secret sex worries that could cause fear and nervousness its better to get them out in the open so for the child who never comments or asks questions a mother may divulge information in a casual way during toileting for example she may say you know boys and girls urinate differently the boy has a penis so he stands up for a girl because her body is different its easier to sit down or isnt it nice aunt loretta is going to have a baby its growing inside her right now thats why shes fatter than she used to be it is better for healthy sex development and adjustment if children feel free to wonder and ask questions what to do when a child shares the sex information youve given him with the neighborhood you might tell him these matters are a private family affair and its a matter of custom not to discuss them outside the home if your child expresses the urge to tell his friend jimmy how babies get born explain that its better for jimmys mother to tell him since she may want to explain it in her own way or may not want to tell him at all until hes old enough to understand this will give your child the good feeling of being pretty grownup for his age make all this a suggestion not a command since forbidden topics are always intriguing should we teach our children the correct names of the parts of the body and bodily functons even while theyre still young it is well for children to know that there are correct words for the parts of the body and its functions and that these words are not silly or dirty it makes it easier to answer their sex questions over a long period of time if you dont have to use baby substitute words by becoming accustomed to the correct words children take them so for granted that they never seem funny or personal but rather just plain natural another thing if your child knows the correct scientific terms for the anatomy hell be less likely to pick up the inevitable vocabulary of the streets should we allow our children to see us nude or let them undress in front of each other if very small children are allowed to wander naturally in and out of the bathroom when either parent is bathing or dressing bodily differences are noted gradually and accepted matteroffactly questions can be answered casually and information acquired so gradually that a child is hardly aware of having been told anything children need to know that there is a difference in sexes let two three and fouryearolds bathe and shower together without selfconsciousness and they will know and accept sex differences the youngster who has never seen a child of the opposite sex undressed is the one who will be most curious about the matter you might think that such early freedom will persist into the school years it doesnt gradually the child himself desires some privacy and acquires reserve is it a good idea to let a child watch his dog or cat give birth if it happens when the child is present it will be a natural lesson on birth for him from then on hell know how babies are bom he wont have to wonder should we punish our children for using bad language dont act shocked or horrified let your child know youre familiar with the words and their meanings then explain that it is bad manners to use them like nosepicking in public and therefore offensive make it clear there are certain standards of politeness and decency which everyone should respect shouldnt a child be stopped from handling his genitals this is a normal thing for youngsters to do all babies explore their bodies and so discover the sensitivity of the genital organs dont punish the child or tell him hes bad or that it will make him sick especially dont tell him he will lose his penis or that someone will cut it off this results in fear and worry that could be injurious draw his attention away from his genitals by putting a toy or game into his hands by playing with him by giving him something to do most children outgrow such handling if it persists it may be that your child is seeking satisfactions that normally would result from warm human relationships with you or other children be more affectionate with him read to him spend time with him if the problem still persists consult your family doctor shouldnt sex play among children be stopped this is a more common occurrence than most people think youngsters will go with each other into the bathroom and discuss naughty words or giggle about toilet functions they ask to see each others genitals even touch and stimulate each other or they may play veiled sex games such as doctor or mother and father parents should see that children dont have too much opportunity for sex play it isnt wise to let children share a bed constantly or for brothers and sisters to share a room to prevent sex play tell your child that playing sexually is not a good thing to do answer any questions he may ask see that he has interesting work and play to keep him busy dont shame threaten or punish him keep your attitude friendly stress social custom rather than sin the following books are recommended a baby is born the story of how life begins by

that knife she whimpered you fixin to cut me the baby gonna come all right aint no need for no cuttin mamma nobody gonna cut you the old woman soothed she bent and slid the knife under the bed knife cuts the pain you is havin honey just like it done when you grandma hepped me have you such scenes are a thing of the past now on beaufort countys sea islands but years ago they were common enough in the little whitewashed homes of the gullah negroes when the slave ships brought them here to work the indigo and cotton the wretched men and women who debarked had few if any of their personal possessions but they did bring their tribal superstitions and the medical lore of their native africa handing them down by wordofmouth to the generations that have tilled these fertile islands the old timers remember those remedies today although they go now to their family physician or to the county health dept on beauforts boundary street when sickness strikes the simple folk remedies are no longer needed now that bridges and modem roads link the sea islands and a car stands beside almost every gullah home it was a different story when the only way to get from island to island was by boat doctors were few here then and hospitals nonexistent in those days the old mother mightand probably didresort to several home remedies to ease her daughters childbirth pains she might have had the girl blow into a bottle and she probably rubbed her well with a mixture of sulphur and lard possibly she forced her to drink a tea made by boiling a dirtdaubers nest in water if the labor pains were slow in starting the dirtdaubers tea might have been made with tanay to speed things up once the baby arrived the old woman probably slipped a thimbleful of salt under the mattress to relieve the pains of afterbirth those were timetested measures known to every gullah mother in the days when she was not only the housewife but the family doctor too with the child safely born there were other things that could be done for it and for the new mother to make teething easier a black beetle was sewn into a bag and hung around the infants neck if the child became feverish a large green leaf was placed on his head when the young mother returned to her work in the fields she tied a string around her babys wrist so she would know if he cried while she was away if the infant died everyone knew that needles threaded on a string and worn around the mothers neck would dry up her milk by no means all of the gullah remedies were intended for babies and their mothers people who make their living with hoe and ax sometimes get cut and there were special measures for such wounds cobwebs were spread on a cut to stop bleeding and it was common knowledge that soot was good for cuts ashes and salt rubbed in well were a fine healing mixture if those measures failed and the wound became infected they cut open a fowl or an animal took out the heart and pressed it to the wound when the heart turned green they knew it had drawn out the poison fever was a dread scourge of the sea islands but the gullahs were ready when it came they drank a tea brewed from horehound and water or from the long silver wisps of a plant known as life everlasting or rabbit tobacco this latter was good not only for fever but for many other diseases old people then as now had aches and pains for rheumatism and arthritis they drilled a hole in a copper penny and tied it to an ankle with a bit of string salt and sweat caused some of the copper to be absorbed by electrolysis and gave them some relief a salve of axle grease was another favorite remedy and the more desperate sufferers from rheumatism allowed a bee to sting them if all else failed they got a live bullfrog cooked it in boiling lard and rubbed the painful joints with the resulting mixture with no dentists handy they took a drop of lye and placed it in the cavity when a hollow tooth began to ache if a horse or mule had lampas the thing to do was slit the gums and rub salt into the cuts headaches must have been as common then as now for the gullahs had a long list of remedies that antedated the aspirin tablet one cure was to tie a string around the head others soaked a piece of brown paper in vinegar and salt and placed it on the sufferers forehead or they made a poultice of vinegar salt and pounded garlic and spread it on the back of the neck for a real kingsize skull buster the remedy was to bathe the entire head in a tea brewed from mullen and of course everyone knew that a red flannel strap worn around the wrist would stop almost any type of pain for the sick the best painkiller was a smoothing iron slipped under the bed without the patient seeing it boils were a common affliction one heroic cure was a salve made from cow dung and vinegar heated together a poultice made from cactus roots was just the ticket to drain an abscess mumps would leave no serious after effects if the neck had been rubbed with sardine grease and smallpox was much less painful if one drank brown pea liquor or a mixture of lard and cassena a tallow plaster on the chest warded off pneumonia and garlic in whisky prevented influenza if you caught a cold a mixture of ashes and lemon juice would put you right as rain in no time dont think the old hands neglected other phases of preventive medicine to ward off disease in general they wore a bag of asafetida around the neck this might also ward off a few friends but good health was cheap at half the price there was also a way to stop bedwetting although how many were brave enough to try it history says not the bedwetter had to drink a tea made by brewing a rat in water some ills came from the spirit not the flesh therefore when the root doctor had conjured you about the only thing you could do to nullify the voodoo spell was to sip a tea of ground garlic and vinegar every morning when you arose how effective were these folk remedies not very probably although you have to concede that these and similar cures were the genesis of modem medicine with all its gadgets and wonder drugs possibly the sheer faith people had in the old remedies hastened many a cure scientists are still trying to determine the extent to which the mind rules the body the chances are that there was more than one hard kernel of scientific truth tucked away in the old african tribal lore one man who suspects this is somers pringle administrator of the beaufort county health dept he remembers a trip to isolated coosaw island years ago to see how many of the natives were suffering from fever about three out of four admitted recent chills aches and high temperatures but not one of them was in need of treatment that day they had made tea from tabbit tobacco and a few of them had gone by bateau to a store and brought back a bottle or two of tonic mr pringle recalls something worked we couldnt find a single active case of fever at least one timehonored folk remedy works mr pringle insists although possibly not the way the oldsters thought its the old practices of dosing children each spring with sulphur and molasses mosquitoes will not bite a person who has sulphur in his blood the health official said whether they knew it or not mothers who gave their children that mixture were making them immune to feverbearing mosquitoes in the summer months but the old remedies are being discarded and forgotten the gullahs have shifted their allegiance to the pill and the needle you goes to the doctor and he stick you one time with that needle an island housewife said the next day you just as good as you ever was modern medicine has won its battle in the sea islands maybe ill pitch forever the rest of that winter they filled up those sports pages all over the country with stories about how i was still good enough to be in the majors but nothing happened when it didnt i went back to the kansas city monarchs only just mr baird was my boss there now mr wilkinsond decided to kind of retire but mr wilkinson being gone wasnt the biggest thing that was different that season what was different was that i was making a lot less money after jackie robinsond gotten into the major leagues folksd started forgetting all about negro baseball all those old fans were only watching the major league teams and jackie it kept getting worse every time the major league teams signed up another colored boy the worse it got the less i got since i usually was paid a percentage of the gate on top of my regular salary even with me going on fortytwo the way i was throwing i still felt i was too young to take any cut in pay you dont want to settle for less until you know for sure you just cant get that big money anymore and it began to look like the only way i could stay in that big money was to get in the majors i looked and looked but i couldnt see any doors open for me the longer that old door stayed shut the more worried i got then it happened when the biggest thing in your life happens you aint got words big enough to say it so i guess you just say it happens id been barnstorming out of town id done a lot of that after mr wilkinson left the monarchs when i got back to town there was this letter from abe saperstein the guy who ran the harlem globetrotters bill veeck who headed up the cleveland indians had asked abe to scout around for some pitching help his ball club was trying for the pennant and they needed somebody to help out on the mound abe scouted around a lot and i guess he figured the negro leagues was the best place to find some quick help and as old as i was there still anybody in the negro that could throw better than me abe knew that he recommended me to the indians and mr veeck wanted me kept telling me to come up for a tryout abes letter asked me to call him and let him know when i could be there i called quick after twentytwo years of throwing i was going to get a crack at the major leagues lahoma and me danced all over the house youll do it satchel lahoma you know you can i got to cleveland on july that was my fortysecond birthday and i was about to get me the best birthday present id ever had mr veeck told me to go in the locker room and get on a uniform while he was getting lou boudreau the indians manager i didnt feel anything i was just numb i guess when i got out on the field lou boudreau was there in his uniform mr veeck and abe saperstein were there too can you still throw like you used to mr lou asked me i got as fast a ball as anybody pitchin now but i got to admit its not half as fast as it used to be but i can still pitch it where i want to can you do that against major leaguers mr lou asked dont you worry about that the plates the same size up here mr lou just grinned why dont you catch satch for about ten minutes and then bat against him mr veeck told mr lou mr lou nodded maybe you want to warm up first satch mr lou asked me yeah id like that why dont you take a lap around the gravel track maybe run about fifty paces and then walk fifty like my boys do i looked around that big ball park but if that was what mr lou wanted me to do id try it i ran about seventyfive yards and that ball park looked bigger than ever i stopped and went back you know mr lou this is an awful big ball park i said i guess i just wont run after all you think youre warmed up enough he asked me i sure am mr lou got him a catchers mitt and went behind the plate i just tossed a couple real easy and then i started firing i wasnt thinking i wasnt trying to get in the majors i wasnt doing anything except just pitching like id always done that was the one thing i really knew how to do finally mr lou told me id thrown enough and i walked up to home plate thats some control satch he told me you didnt miss the strike zone moren four times out of fifty those that missed were only an inch or two off the plate too lets see if you can do that good when i try hitting against you now you want me to shag the balls lou mr veeck said if you want to mr lou answered get over in right field after seeing satchs stuff i dont think im going to pull many balls to left he didnt either after we were done he told me to go in the clubhouse when i walked away mr lou and mr veeck were up close real close jawing away like everything a few minutes later mr veeck came in the locker room lou thinks you can help the club he told me lets go down to the office and sign a contract it was just like that just that easy as easy as itd been for me to pitch all those years i was in the major leagues the old mand made it i signed that contract real quick i was going to get a years salary for only a halfyear of ball after id signed up mr veeck grinned satch he told me im just sorry you didnt come up in your prime youd have been one of the greatest righthanders baseball has ever known if you had not everybody was happy that id gotten into the major leagues most were but there were some who said it was just a cheap publicity stunt maybe mr veeck did want some publicity but he wanted a pitcher too there was only one guy around who could fill both orders that was ol satch some people wrote some mighty nice things after i signed like the story tom meany of new york wrote he said as far as im concerned the signing of satchel paige to a cleveland contract is far more interesting than was the news when branch rickey broke the baseball color line by signing jackie robinson to a montreal contract it was inevitable that the bigotry which kept negroes out of organized ball would be beaten back but id never heard of robinson at that time with paige its different the satchmo has been a baseball legend for a long time a paul bunyan in technicolor more fabulous tales have been told of satchels pitching ability than of any pitcher in organized baseball about a day after i signed mr veeck called a press conference we signed satchel in accordance with our policy of getting the best available material no matter the cost he said we are convinced he is the best available player who has a chance to help us win the pennant when mr veeck said he didnt care about the cost i guess he meant it i didnt get no bonus but i got that good contract and i think abe saperstein got fifteen thousand for finding me when i heard that i couldnt help thinking that mr wilkinson and mr baird ought to get something theyd sponsored me ever since my armd gone dead and i figured they ought to get something for that i told mr veeck how i felt and he agreed he was a mighty fair man he gave mr wilkinson and mr baird five thousand to split that was five thousand more than branch rickey gave them for jackie robinson when he took him from the monarchs it wasnt until the day after i signed that i started feeling things i knew the indians werent the monarchs but id still be out there with a ball in my hand and the fellow at the plated have a bat in his hand maybe theyd knock me all over the place but i was going to have to see them do it i was starting my major league career with one thing in my favor anyway i wasnt afraid of anybody id see in that batters box id been around too long for that i wasnt as fast as i used to be but i was a better pitcher if i couldnt overpower them id outcute them i didnt feel bad about not having all my speed anymore i was happy over still being able to throw why guys i used to pitch against guys like waite hoyt lefty grove lonnie warneke dizzy dean and carl hubbell werent even around anymore but ol satch was i was just starting starting years after those guys hung up their gloves id waited a long time to pitch in the major leagues but i couldnt have asked for a better setting when i got my first chance it was on july and the cleveland indians were playing the st louis browns in clevelands municipal stadium there were about thirtyfive thousand in those stands and lots of them were there just hoping theyd get to see me i didnt let them down bob lemon started for us and he didnt have it he got behind four to one after three and a half innings and they pinchhit for him in the last of the fourth a couple of the other boys and med been warming up out in the bullpen in the last half of the fourth and when we were ready to start the fifth lou boudreau signaled for me it seemed like a mighty long walk from the bullpen to the pitchers mound i didnt go fast no reason wearing myself out just walking i just shuffled along and every time i shuffled the stands busted loose like they never was so happy to see anyone in their life id pitched before a lot more than that a lot of times and id heard more noise but there still were a pretty good bunch of cheerers out there for just an old friday night game when i got to the infield out came all these photographers there must have been ten of them popping flashbulbs in my face they tried crawling over one another to get pictures of me it was such a mess i just dropped my mouth opep and stopped and stood there for a minute the chief um pire bill mcgowan didnt chase those photographers off the field like he was supposed to he must of thought history was being made so he just let them shoot away i guess maybe history was being made i was only about ten feet away from being the first negro ever to plant a spike on an american league pitching mound lou boudreau was on the mound waiting for me he handed me the ball and said something i dont know what it was i wasnt hearing too good i dont even think i heard those fans any more but folks tell me they were making even more noise now that id gotten to the mound i threw my first warmup pitch and all those flashbulbs popped again youd have thought i was the new president or something the photographer finally cleared out of the way and chuck stevens the browns first baseman stepped up to the plate to open the fifth this was it i felt those nerves they were jumping every which way i didnt feel loose at all i guess i wasnt i threw and stevens singled then the nerves were all gone i was pitching and id been doing that too long to be nervous in a game gerry priddy came up and i fired my hard one he bunted and stevens went to second while we were getting priddy out at first there was one out but the browns had a runner in scoring position whitey platt was up i gave him my overhand pitch and my sidearmer and my underhander ana my hesitation he struck out when zack taylor the browns manager saw what i could do with that hesitation pitch he protested but mr mcgowan said it was legal a zarilla came up with two out and stevens still on second i just fired like id always been firing and got him to fly out to right field for the third out we didnt score in the last of the fifth in the top of the sixth dick kokos singled off me and went to second when one of my boys fumbled around with the ball roy partee was up next and cracked the ball good but right into a linedrive double play eddie pellagrini flied out to end the inning mr lou pinchhit for me in the last of the sixth i was through for the night i hadnt set no records but id done what the indians was paying me for id gotten the side out without giving up any runs in the fifth and sixth innings it wasnt much after that game that will harridge president of the american league banned my hesitation pitch he said hed never seen a pitch like that he said i was tricking the batters and umpireshaving the batters swinging at balls when all the time i had the ball in my hand having the umpires calling strikes when the catcher thumped his glove making them lie the first time mr harridge saw that pitch of mine he must have grabbed a rule book and thumbed all through it but couldnt find anything in those rules against it but he didnt like those batters falling all over the plate swinging at nothing and he didnt like me making liars out of the umpires so he decided i couldnt use that hesitation any more man i almost got worried i was afraid if i showed any of my other tricks he might ban them too i figured id better not throw any of that trick stuff just throw that plain stuff like bobby feller and ewell blackwell and those other boys i guess mr harridge didnt want me to show up those boys who were young enough to be my sons i didnt mind though it was pretty tough on those boys having to play against somebody like me they hadnt had to get by like id had to theyd had expensive coaches and guys like that to teach them how to throw they didnt have to figure things out for themselves they had those trainers to rub them down all the time and theyd gotten plenty of rest between games they hadnt had to come up with those trick pitches just to rest their arms and work out the tiredness they never had to pitch every day for a month at a time or play the whole year round i guess that makes a difference and will harridge must have known i was a little too smart for those kids in the major leagues and he didnt want to see me fool them too much so even if it wasnt in the rule book he called my hesitation illegal he didnt want to cause none of them kids who came up against me any hardships i figured id just have to get out there and confuse those kids with ordinary stuff it was about a week before they banned my hesitation pitch that i got a chance to pitch in my second game it wasnt a regular game but an exhibition game against the brooklyn dodgers on july and there were almost sixtyfive thousand in municipal stadium to see it i went in after the dodgers and we were all tied up three and three after six innings i needed only twelve pitches to get that side out i used my old corkscrew windup and it really floored them i whiffed gil hodges on four tosses fanned erv palica on three curves and struck out tom brown on five tosses i retired the side in order in the eighth too and we finally won the game in the eleventh four to three after that i knew i was in i only wished lahomad been there to see it but the baby was keeping her busy and she wasnt going to be able to get up and see me until the end of the month that next day after the exhibition game mr lou sent me in to pitch again if mr lou thought i was too old he sure didnt show it calling on me only a day after id pitched that exhibition game we were playing a doubleheader in philadelphia against the athletics and we won the first game six to one if we won the second game wed have us a league lead of two and a half games and we could use a little breathing room we pushed ahead four to two after five and a half innings in that second game but we couldnt stand that good living philadelphia started getting to bob lemon in the last of the sixth they got a run in and then mr lou decided it was time for ol satch i got us out of trouble quick and we went into the seventh still ahead four to three we got us another run in the top of the seventh and i was ready to just ride home and protect that win for bob lemon but you dont just ride in the majors not even if youre a walter johnson or a dizzy dean or a bob feller or a satchel paige ferris fain doubled off me in the last of the seventh and then hank majeski smashed my trouble ball on the left field roof that tied the score i just shook my head those things happen but they werent going to happen to me any more in that game i was going to make sure of that my boys got me a lead back right off the bat in the eighth ken keltner belted out a home run and i was ahead six to five going into the last of the eighth i put down the as real fast then and in the ninth we got two more runs with that eight to five lead i just whipped right by the as in the last of the ninth id gotten my first major league win eight to five and id given up only one more hit after that home run the as had only three hits for those three and a third innings id pitched i was one and zero in the majors one and zero against guys who were in knee pants or werent even born when id started pitching i kept rolling too about a week later i got the call again we were playing before a capacity crowd of better than sixtyeight thousand in yankee stadium in new york we were still leading the league but that didnt scare the yankees going into the last of the sixth we were behind six to five thats when they sent me in to keep the yankees from getting farther ahead i didnt let them in the two innings i pitched i put them down with only one hit in the sixth and seventh innings and in the seventh i struck out joe dimaggio too joed belted a grand slam home run off bobby feller in the fifth but he only got air off me it wasnt enough though we didnt score anymore and the yankees won by that six to five score but id run my string to seven and a third innings against the major leaguers while giving up only two earned runs with those two innings of shutout balland lahoma saw it shed just gotten there that afternoon by plane she was going to spend the night visiting and then fly back to take care of our baby after the game we went out celebrating like we hadnt since the baby came it was our first chance to celebrate over me being in the majors the next morning lahoma and me got up early so we could have more time together before she had to leave when i looked out the window and saw all those clouds in the sky i knew wed have more time together than id figured i know about weather and those clouds say no game i told lahoma then you can stay with me until i have to leave she said thats just what i did we just sat around talking and watching that rain come down it came down so hard they called off the ball game i heard it on the radio thats just what i told you i said to lahoma then it was time for lahoma to leave and i had to say goodbye to her again thats the way it is when youre a traveling man after i left her i headed for the train station the indians were leaving new york and heading for boston that rainedout game was the last one we were supposed to play in new york on that trip i guess i got kind of mixed up without my teammates with me anyway i went to the wrong station by the time i found that out and got over to the right one the indians traind left id just missed the old train but i caught me a bird over to boston and headed up to see mr lou its very nice of you to decide to join us was all hed say to me thats when i found out how they did things in the majors those boys just dont have heads of their own i guess even if its raining like everything they got to go out to the ball park and wait until somebody tells them to go home mr lou fined me for not coming out to the park and missing that train i didnt mind the fine thats the way they did it in the majors what made me kind of sore was they wouldnt pay me back for that ticket id bought for the airplane over to boston it wasnt much after id missed that train that mr lou came up to me and asked me if i could start sure i can start i told him are you sure he asked me sure im sure i always started before i know that satch but all these boys are topnotchers up here thats what i always played against then old bill mckechnie one of our coaches came in on my side and that seemed to satisfy mr lou you want me to give you any advice on how to pace yourself mr lou asked me no ill just pitch it my way i always have you can lose it like you want to he told me and walked off i guess id upset him but he didnt change his mind about starting me on august he told the papers id pitch the next day against the washington senators in municipal stadium going into that game id been used eight times in relief winning one and losing one id pitched eighteen innings against those major leaguers andd given up only four earned runs nine more innings against them wasnt anything to fret about everybody seemed to forget all about the pennant race when mr lou announced i was going to start but i didnt a win for us in our game with the senators and a loss for philadelphia in its game with chicago would move us into a firstplace tie in the league with the as boston and new york could tie too if they won their games we all were one game behind philadelphia it was a big game getting late in the season like it was every game was a big one you dont play around in the major leagues and i wasnt about to start the first time i got a chance to go all the way that first chance was something to see all right with everybody knowing i was going to pitch better than seventytwo thousand came out to the ball park that was the biggest night crowd in cleveland baseball history and it stood until i beat it myself a couple of weeks later for a few minutes out there it looked like i was going to let all these people down i got one out in the first inning but then my control left me flat i walked two batters and ed stewart slammed a triple off me and gave washington a two to nothing lead before wed even got to bat dont worry none i told mr lou after i got the side out that ol control aint gonna be missing anymore you just leave me in there thats just what mr lou did even if hed wanted to take me out i dont think hed have done it that earlynot with all those folks out there to see me i settled down pretty good after that we got back one run in the last of the fourth but washington squeezed across a run in the top of the fifth my boys tied it up three and three with two runs in the last of the fifth then in the last of the sixth we scored again and i was ahead four to three we got a rally going in the last of the seventh and mr lou sent in a pinchhitter for me that pinchhitter didnt do anything but we still got another run and were ahead five to three ed klieman relieved me and held the senators scoreless in the eighth and ninth and i had me my second win of the year five to three even if i hadnt gone all nine id given up seven hits and after walking those two in the first inning i walked only two more and got me six strikeouts and when i heard that philadelphiad lost to chicago i got a grin on me that didnt quit for a week id pitched us into first place in the american league even if we had to share it with philadelphia boston and new york that day bostond beat st louis and new yorkd beat detroit that pennant race was really getting tough and we all felt it mr lou wasnt playing any of the amateurs because of the way it was going but he was playing ol satch plenty five days after i got that first start he called me in to relieve in the first game of a doubleheader against the new york yankees i went in to pitch the top of the eighth with the score tied six and six and held the yanks while we were getting two runs and got credit for my third win against one loss eight to six when we won the second game of that doubleheader that kept us in first place by six percentage points you dont have to be no pencil whiz to see how much every one of those games meant but op satch wasnt letting the pressure buckle him i was pushing pushing to show good my first chance in the major leagues but pitching that way wasnt any vacation my stomach troubles were getting to me real often sometimes it got so i thought i couldnt throw that ball i remember once we were playing washington and i was out on the mound my catcher jim hegan signaled for a fast ball and i shook him off i had to those pains was hurting so i couldnt throw the ball then jim signaled for a curve ball i still had to shake him off he signaled for my letup and i shook him off again i just had to wait until things quieted down inside me jim came stomping out from the batters box satch he said ive given you everything and you dont want them whats the matter man i got the miseries in my stomach and lefty weisman aint here to help me lefty was the cleveland trainer and he was out sick himself that day but jim called into the dugout and bob lemon came running out with leftys little black bag what does lefty usually give you satch bob asked me somethin white bob fished around in that bag and finally came up with one of those white pills for me i swallowed it down and it wasnt no time before my stomach got real peaceable and i was ready to pitch again course jim hegan called me a hypochondriac and told me that for all he knew that white pill could have been a cure for dandruff but i knew better that pill was white just like the ones lefty gave me and it quieted them pains didnt it after that first start of mine it seemed like it was forever before they ever got around to starting me again but that was the way it was in the majors you just didnt pitch every day the year round like id done before that took a lot of getting used to for a long time just sitting around like that wore me out id get so tired just sitting id have to sneak into the locker room and take a little snooze i was in there one day stretched out on the rubbing table kind of dozing when my old buddy dizzy dean came in he shook me awake whats the matter boy you tired from overwork he asked me diz im tired from underwork this is the first time in twenty years ive gone four or five days without pitching but that didnt last too long with the pennant race tightening up like it did mr lou started using me more and more wed dropped out of first place again and mr lou gave me the job of getting us back in there on august we were playing a night game in chicago at comiskey park that park held a lot of old memories for me and a lot of folksd seen me pitch there a big chunk of those same folk people whod seen me throw my best against negro leaguers came out to see how i threw against major leaguers they busted down a big gate trying to get in there to see me we had a crowd of about fiftyone thousand the largest ever to see a night game in chicago nobody could have given me any better news than that in my first start in the majors id drawn the largest night crowd ever in cleveland now for my second start id done the same thing in chicago ol satch could draw the fans and youd better believe it now all i had to do was show them i still could throw throw for nine innings but nine innings in this league was a long way id found that out against washington i went easy real easy not trying to burn that fast ball by the batters i just tried to put it where i figured itd do the most good the first four innings went by without us or chicago scoring that ball was flowing out of my hand just like it was some water and i wasnt wasting any pitches i hadnt walked a man in those first four innings i was bearing down i wanted that win just as bad as anybody itd put us back in first place larry doby our center fielder gave me a hand in the top of the fifth inning he tripled and scored a couple of minutes later when jim hegan my catcher hit a fly i had me a onetonothing lead i nursed that through the last of the fifth the sixth and the seventh we werent scoring anymore and i just kept praying my arm wouldnt tire out on me in the top of the eighth i got some breathing room ken keltner our third baseman singled and got sacrificed to second then dale mitchell our left fielder singled him home that gave me two runs to work on that mob watching went wild even though we were playing in the chicago ball park they were there for me that was for sure i didnt let them down in the eighth i set down those white sox again real quick id given up only three hits in the first eight innings dont worry boys we got them now i said when we got to the bench for the top of the ninth they werent worrying my boys picked up three more runs in the top of the ninth and i had me a five to nothing lead i figured i was as good as home i got the first man up real easy i had one out but i wasnt home luke appling singled and pat seerey singled there were men on first and third and only one out i wasnt real worried about losing but i didnt want to get taken out of there i wanted that complete game i walked back to the resin bag and dusted my hands i rubbed the ball i wasnt nervous id been in holes like this before i just wanted to get those next two batters to fidgeting i must have i got aaron robinson and ralph hodgin out real easy i had my first complete game and it was a shutouta shutout in only my second start wed won five to nothing and id given up only five hits i hadnt walked a man that put us back into the american league lead it looks like when they need that stopper need that big game to get back into first place youre the one satch a reporter told me after the game it sure was funny how serious that reporter was when he said that like nobodyd ever known it before what he didnt know was that for about twenty years reportersd been saying that but that reporter didnt bother me what bothered me was those guys who were saying that i was just lucky to get that shutout thats why my next startwhen i shut out those white sox again and gave cleveland a tie for the american league team record of four shutouts in a rowwas the game i thought was the biggest in my career and that covers a lot of ground that second shutout even convinced the umpires bill summers and art passarella hopped in my corner and stayed there how can you rate him bill told one reporter there are few better pitchers in baseball today maybe there arent any and there are few with more stuff he has a slider that cracks like a whip and a curve that explodes and he is plenty fast is there anything else and art told those writers theres a rocking chair if ever there was one that old boys around the plate all the time and calling balls and strikes for hims a breeze i was behind the plate in that shutout he worked in chicago and i never had an easier game in my life you could feel that pennant tension every time you went into our locker room those last few days in august itd been twentyeight years since clevelandd gotten in a world series when i first heard itd been twentyeight years i couldnt hardly believe it why that was even before i started playing professionally and the way most peopled always talked it didnt seem to me like baseballd even been invented before i began tossing my trouble ball i tried to help those boys out when the pressure was deep like it was but they were all so tied up they couldnt hear anybody i figured maybe my pitchingd snap them out of it and i got a chance on august wed dropped two games behind the boston red sox and we were in third place when mr lou sent me in there to straighten out the team thats just what i did i stopped the washington senators on seven hits and we won ten to one i had me a twohitter going into the eighth and gave up only one extrabase hit for my sixth win against one loss boston didnt play that night and we were only one and a half games out of first place that pennant race kept going like that right up to the wire then it endedended with us and boston tied for first place they set a playoff game and gene bearden went out to pitch it for us i was ready in the bullpen just in case gene got into any trouble against boston but gene didnt need my help that day we won the playoff and that gave us the american league pennant we were in the world series against the boston braves it was clevelands first pennant in twentyeight years and they hadnt done it until op satch came around and won them six games while losing only one down the stretch drive thats why they were saying id gotten more fame in three months than most pitchers do in ten years in the major leagues i got it because i won and because the fans wanted to see me when bill veeck signed me he knew what he was doing i showed he knew
the habit of mediocrity a student at one of a our better known colf leges submitted a term paper in american history several days before it was due the research content of the essay was reasonably thorough but the paper itself was hastily written and it contained a number of very obvious errors the professor suggested to the student that since the deadline for submitting the theme had not passed perhaps the student might want to do the paper over if the errors resulting from carelessness were corrected and a few minor points of information were clarified and expanded the paper might possibly merit an a otherwise c would be the highest grade the student could expect the student settled for the c he later explained that since c was an average grade he would see no reason why he should trouble himself with extra effort in trying to earn an a after all he concluded c is passing a young couple i know has a teenaged son who at a very early age showed a high degree of talent be pigs in the house and anarchy in the streets is mediocrity good enough are we really satisfied with just getting by do we really appreciate the boorishness of our friends and do we really accept ourselves in the role of casual indifference in which we find ourselves so often cast we explain our shortcomings by reminding our critics that we are i only human and this handy little phrase has been used to excuse more gross ineptness and general lazinessmoral and otherwise than we are likely to admit one is never merely human for if being i human means anything at all it means that everyone is heir to possibilities which are in a very real sense unlimited you can be better than you are you can excel being human is not a license to be mediocre life has a way of rewarding those who meet it squarely and who are willing to work for its treasures life is selfenriching mediocrity can only beget mediocrity but the real treasures of living the worthwhileness of living may only be discovered and enjoyed if one is in search of something the scale of values you hold and the standards of excellence to which you subscribe determine in large measure whether your life will be rewarded with depth and meaning or whether it will be but a series of shallow episodes colorless and inane yes you can be better than you are but first you must kick the habit of mediocrity there never was a deadlier and more destructive drug elizabeth keckley the rash of memoirs t by white house servants recently in public print reminds us of a very unusual negro woman of almost a century ago who wrote a sensational book at the time entitled behind the scenes or thirty years a slave and four years in the white house this book was published in and was authored by elizabeth hobbs keckley the book was suppressed by robert lincoln son of the martyred president but it was later reissued many of the facts that are known about mary todd lincoln are garnered from this modest literary endeavor of a former slave who rose to a position of trust and love in the first family of the tragic civil war period elizabeth keckley lived a life filled with romance and striking incidents her book invited criticism she portrayed the dark side of slavery and also its lighter moments she had kindhearted true friends in the south as well as in the north many charged that she wrote too freely in reference to mrs lincoln mrs lincoln by her acts forced herself into an unfavorable light she invited public criticismalthough she may have been judged too harshly at times people did not know of the secret history of her transactions mrs keckley stated if i have betrayed confidence in any thing i have published it has been to place mrs lincoln in a better light before the world a breach of trust of this kind is always excusable mrs keckleys life was an eventful one she was born a slave in dinwiddie county virginia in the s she was the chattel of colonel a burwell who was an unstable master and moved with his slaves several times during the childhood of elizabeth at the age of four she was given the care of the infant daughter of the burwells she felt the cruel lash at this tender age for inadvertently dropping her charge on the floor this was not the last time she was to be whipped at the age of eight elizabeths father was separated from his family and was sold to a man going out west she never saw her father again however he wrote to his family in virginia at the age of elizabeth went to live with her masters eldest son a presbyterian minister the minister was burdened with an invalid wife elizabeth did the work of three servants and yet was scolded and held in great distrust at she moved to north carolina with the young couple in north carolina the burwells befriended the local schoolmaster a mr bingham mr bingham was a cruel hard man and a frequent visitor to the parsonage mrs burwell had always mistrusted the young slave and mr bingham became her ready tool of wreaking vengeance one evening as elizabeth was watching the baby mr bingham commanded her to follow him to the study he told her that he was going to flog her and demanded that she take down her dress the thunderstruck slave demanded to know the reason for the flogging she refused to do as the schoolmaster wished but she was overpowered this was the first of many whippings she received at his hands to break her proud spirit these revolting scenes created a great sensation and were the talk of the town when informed of the events the rev mr burwell promised that elizabeth would receive no further floggings savage efforts to subdue elizabeth were not the only difficulties she encountered she was regarded as a fairlooking woman and for four years a white man pursued her elizabeth considered this period frought with pain and she does not dwell too long on the events which led to her giving birth to a baby boyher only child she wrote if my poor boy ever suffered any humiliating pangs on account of birth he could not blame his mother for god knows that she did not wish to give him life he must blame the edicts of that society which deemed it no crime to undermine the virtue of girls in my then position elizabeth returned to the burwell family seat in virginia and was attached to the family of one of the daughters who moved to st louis in st louis elizabeth acquired something of a reputation as a seamstress and dressmaker the best ladies in st louis were her patrons and she never lacked for orders through her nimble thimble she was able to support her white owners however the strain undermined her health about this time a negro from virginia a mr keckley sought her hand in marriage she could not think of marriage as long as she was enslaved and sought to purchase her freedom and that of her son but her owners at first refused to consider it later however her owners reconsidered and set the price at for elizabeth and her son she then consented to marriage assuming she could buy her freedom piecemeal mr keckley proved to be dissipated and a burden further elizabeth discovered that he was a slave rather than a freeman as he had represented himself to be after eight years of marriage mrs keckley preferred that charity draw around him the mantle of silence many years passed and mrs keckley was unable to buy her freedom in the meantime her masters died and she was allowed to make further efforts to gain freedom six responsible men were persuaded to guarantee her return from new york city where she planned to journey to seek donations for purchasing her freedom several of her wealthy patrons learned of her planned trip to seek funds and raised the sum for her and the trip to the east was cancelled on august proceedings began which culminated in the emancipation of elizabeth and george keckley five days later elizabeth considered the purchase money a loan and in a short while repaid her generous friends in mrs keckley left st louis en route to baltimore maryland she tried to operate a school to teach her method of dressmaking to a group of young colored women but this venture was unsuccessful she left baltimore for the nations capital rooms were obtained in washington and she soon had a good business operating senator and mrs jefferson davis later to become president of the illfated con federate states of america arrived in washington at about the same time as elizabeth keckley elizabeth learned that mrs davis was seeking a modiste and elizabeth sought and won the position in this post elizabeth was close to the southern family and their cause secret meetings and discussions of war were held in her presence when the daviss prepared to move out of washington they sought to persuade mrs keckley to go with them but she preferred to cast her lot among the people of the north it is coincidental that in refusing to accompany the confederate first family to alabama mrs keckley remained in washington to become entangled in the affairs of the family of abraham lincoln several of mrs keckleys customers knew of her dream to work for the first lady in the white house one of mrs keckleys customers promised to recommend elizabeths services to mrs abraham lincoln who was a good friend of the customer the customer kept her word and elizabeth keckley was summoned to the white house with a nervous step she entered the presence of mrs lincoln a lady of about years and inclined to stoutness she was interviewed and given the position over three other dressmakers who had also been recommended by other friends of mrs lincoln terms were satisfactorily arranged and thus began a relationship which would last throughout the lifetime of elizabeth keckley and mary todd lincoln mary todd lincoln was bom in in lexington kentucky of distinguished ancestry and was reared amid genteel surroundings of the six surviving brothers and sisters four are said to have had abnormal personalities mary was carefully educated and in she visited springfield illinois and two years later she made the illinois capital her home living with her sister favored by the prominence of her sisters family and aided by her own accomplishments she became a belle of the fashionable society and her acquaintance among people of political importance was extensive there are a number of stories surrounding the courtship of abraham lincoln and mary todd but on november the pair was married after hasty preparations despite lincolns awkwardness they moved in the best of local society but in their home there was limited hospitality unfavorable things were said of their domestic life and even friends admitted that marys temperament was difficult her background and outlook differed markedly from those of her husband toward whose family she was unsympathetic within limitations of her temperament however she was a devoted wife and mother her reputation has suffered much from the ann rutledge legend and from the writings of herndon a law partner of lincolnwho wrote extensively on the lincolns but it is hard to believe that the lincoln home was as thoroughly as unhappy as herndon pictured it lincolns letters show an affectionate regard for his wife and a playful delight in their four sons during the presidency of her husband mrs lincoln gave special attention to levees and other social affairs for which mrs keckley was employed making suitable gowns a southern lady in the white house she was subjected to criticism much of which was gossip and malicious slander certainly the imputations of disloyalty were unfounded even the touches of social gayety with which she relieved the strain of wartime anxiety were criticized as inappropriate a short plump brunette mary lincoln had a certain formal beauty and was described as vivacious and apt in conversation accounts of her extravagance combined with penuriousness her interference in politics her irritable temper and her concealment of expenditures from her husband are too numerous and authoritative to be ignored but on the other side of the picture she was considered by some to be an agreeable mistress in the white house and a ministering friend to soldiers in washington hospitals no presidential family evoked so much curiosity and as soon as it was known that elizabeth was the modiste to mrs lincoln part ies crowded around and affected friendship hoping to induce the seamstress to betray the secrets of the domestic circle lizabeth as mrs lincoln called her became a close friend and confidante of the first family and her advice and suggestions were often sought as a trusted servant and friend mrs keckley described the tragic death of young willie lincoln who died in the white house she assisted mrs lincoln in caring for the youngster and she was exhausted when the end came but she was sent for immediately mrs keckley assisted in bathing and dressing the corpse she was a silent witness to the grief of abraham lincoln and she was a great comfort to the inconsolable grief of mrs lincoln who was so overwhelmed that she did not attend the funeral mrs keckley lost her own son about the same time leaving wilberforce university in ohio he had joined the army and gone to the battlefield and he was killed in missouri it was a sad blow to her and the kind letter of condolence that mrs lincoln wrote when she heard of the bereavement was full of golden words of comfort in the summer of mrs keckley organized negroes of the capital into a group to raise funds for the relief of suffering soldiers the idea proved popular and in two weeks the contraband relief association numbered workers armed with credentials elizabeth visited new york with mrs lincoln in the city she circulated among the colored people and got them interested in the idea she also started a group in boston while accompanying mrs lincoln to harvard to visit robert lincoln frederick douglass contributed funds and lectured for the groups foreign contributions were received and mrs keckley served as a national president for many years elizabeth joined in the turbulent period of the election leading up to abraham lincolns reelection and when many doubted his reelection she stood firm in her belief that he would succeed she was one of the first to congratulate him on his reelection elizabeth was given as a memento one of the gloves worn by lincoln at the inaugural reception many colored citizens wished to attend the reception but orders were issued not to admit them a member of congress enroute to the reception recognized frederick douglass on the outskirts of the crowd when the congressman was told of the restrictions on negro guests he received permission from lincoln to allow the admission of the famed orator and abolitionist when richmond fell in the spring of elizabeth keckley was a member of the presidential party which traveled by boat to the once proud city in the senate chamber she sat in the seat sometimes occupied by jefferson davis she also had the chance to visit scenes of her childhood she described this trip as one of the most delightful of her life the fateful evening in april when lincoln was assassinated comprises an interesting chapter in mrs keckleys life she had been to the white house earlier to assist with mrs lincolns toilette at eleven oclock that evening she was awakened from her sleep to receive the information that the entire cabinet and lincoln had been murdered the news stunned her however she gathered her wits and went to the white house she learned that the dying president was not at the mansion and she could not learn where mrs lincoln was located the next morning a saddened nation learned of the death of lincoln and mrs lincoln sent for elizabeth to come immediately to the white house mrs lincoln scolded elizabeth for not coming sooner and it was learned that mrs lincoln had sent for her immediately after the shooting of her husband three messengers were unable to locate her home mrs lincoln was very exhausted from grief elizabeth was the only person who seemed able to comfort the widow she was also a tender consoling friend to the young sons of the lincolns for five weeks mrs lincoln was confined to her room and only allowed her loyal friend elizabeth to be with her they started to pack to leave the white house and this activity afforded some relief for the two sorrowing women in packing mrs lincoln gave away everything intimately connected with the president the articles were given to those who were regarded as the warmest of lincolns admirers the cloak of mrs lincolns stained with the presidents blood was given to elizabeth later she was to receive the comb and brush of the martyred lincoln at still a later date she donated these precious items in addition to the inaugural glove to wilberforce university in ohio which coincidentally was destroyed by fire on the same night as the assassination of the president mrs lincoln moved to chicago and faithful elizabeth accompanied her there after the family had been settled in illinois elizabeth returned to her occupation in washington she was offered the custom of the andrew johnson family now occupying the white house however she had no desire to continue to work for the first family mrs keckley continued to prosper in her profession meanwhile she entered into a correspondence with mrs lincoln which would last the rest of their lives in mrs lincoln experienced financial troubles and she sought the advice of mrs keckley she wished to sell a portion of her extensive wardrobe for she had not received much assistance from the nation the women met in new york and sought to sell the clothing anonymously the newspapers soon learned of the plans and the impoverished widow fled new york leaving elizabeth to salvage what she could the clothes were placed on exhibition and did not bring in much revenue attempts to sell the clothing also failed the venture proved so disastrous that mrs lincoln was unable to assist elizabeth with her expenses of staying in new york and elizabeth was compelled to take in sewing to pay her own way little is known about the later years of elizabeth keckley she continued to work at her chosen profession sometime after the publication of her book she served as director of domestic art at wilberforce university although mrs lincoln had promised to assist her financially these promises were never fulfilled as mrs lincoln was not able to do so as for mrs lincoln the death of tad in left only one son a certain mental instability now became more pronounced and she was adjudged insane and spent some months in a private sanitarium at batavia illinois in congress tardily granted her an annual pension of this later was increased to at which time an additional gift of was voted after some years of foreign travel she spent her last clouded days in the home of a sister in springfield where she died of paralysis in sweet charlie vaughn when iron horse harry gallatin took over reins of the faltering st louis hawks professional basketball team one of his first moves was to sign up sweet charlie vaughn a hot shot who had broken virtually every school record while playing for gallatin at southern illinois university many think sweet charlie is the answer to the hawks problems hes not only a top shooter his fadeaway jump shot is almost impossible to guard against but he has been rated one of the finest ball handlers and natural defensive men to come along in collegiate basketball ranks in many a moon a twotime small college allamerica choice vaughn among other things while at siu scored points in games for a average chalked up accuracy marks of from the field for free throws copped rebounds a game though a backcourt player as a sophomore in with southerns salukis who have been nationally ranked for several years and playing some of the nations toughest teams vaughn dunked in points for a average last season hit for a game before falling to his personal bugaboo grades he poured in points against tennessee a i in was named to the united press international second small college allamerica squad and the next season moved up to the first team gallatin says of his former collegiate star vaughn is a typical product of the modern era he has all the assetstremendous speed excellent mobility good outside shot and deep dedication hes going to be a great pro player his specialty is his fadeaway jump shot and the way he handles himself there is absolutely no defense to stop him to see him work is a positive thing of beauty gallatin smiles and the giant pound coach adds he has something else going for him hes a negro negroes are the most dedicated kids in athletics today all the colored kids are dedicated by the time a white boy reaches the college varsity level hes dedicated of course but the average young white boy has two problemsautomobiles and a social life girls the average negro kid cant afford a car and he has a limited social life it all adds up to the negro concentrating on excelling in athletics vaughns only trouble at southern was scholastic when he left the squad for good last season after taking a low grade in a fivehour psychology course there might have been some who questioned his scholarly ability but none who denied he had been one of southerns greatest players and the hawks dont give grades for attending classes as merle jones sports editor of the southern illinoisan at carbondale where siu is located said there have been many many fine basketball players at siu through the years but probably none could ever match charlie vaughn in the realm of being an exciting player to watch the team averaged points a game in the first six contests he missed last year for the next games the scoring average was better than points a game vaughn first attracted attention as a schoolboy at little tamms illinois high school where he took a career total of pointsa figure never topped by any prep player as far as could be determined he began playing regularly in his freshman year in high school at southern he was a spectacular player who took to gallatins fast break style of basketball like a fish to water he developed one of the most unorthodox long shots in the gameseemingly most accurate when he was jumping and falling away from the basket on the shots holding the ball behind his head and firing off his right ear with uncanny precision even in his freshman year at southern vaughn launched into a war with the record books he set an alltime scoring record season with points attempted the most field goals in a single game scored the most field goals in a single game was credited with most rebounds in a single game attempted the most field goals for one season and scored the most field goals for one season by the end of that sophomore year vaughn lacked only total rebounds for a season and career scoring record to have all the individual marksbut vaughn quickly took over the scoring record gallatin switched vaughn from forward to guard in the season when the team captain injured an ankle in his new spot during the first games sweet charlie had a averagecompared to a as forward it really didnt make much difference where i played charlie gallatin said he could find the range from any spot on the floor charlie also copped other honors at southern and elsewhere allconference teams allnaia district team upi allamerican alltourney quincy ill holiday team and alltourney cape girardeau mo invitational sportsmanship award allamerican city tourney owensboro ky and as sius most valuable player whether vaughn can help the ailing hawks remains to be seen but if gallatins hopes come true he could be set for a long profitable and enviable record in professional ranks and he could give the hawks some of the defensive and offensivepunch theyve missed by edward james grant what the american new gro may need at this time as a status symbol is a continuous fictional hero there is a tendency among white citizens to take a longer look at black slum areas and at negro degradation than at the fine record of cultural and educational progress within this much maligned race it would seem timely therefore to introduce a negro hero of great character and poise who might fire the imaginations of black and white alike who would gently influence national opinion regarding the emergence of the negro masses from the aura of second class citizenship in the world of fiction all heroes are white cowboys soldiers detectives doctors lawyers scientists spacemen patriots rarely if ever sport a handsome black face rather the trend is to confront the reading or viewing public with a veritable giant of white male beauty with all the virtues one would expect in a god possibly without intention this tends to promote the image of white supremacy and what is more disturbing there would appear to be no plan at the present time to create noble and intelligent negro heroes in book or television play to balance this concept negroes continue to accept unimportant or derogatory roles as servants or straight men for the white heroes who win all the battles and display all the wisdom through it all the black man reflects brawn and quick reflex rather than brain and quick wit certainly the time has come to write a black superman into the literary scene of course we have a few negro actors and a number of negro characters in story form who have reached such prominence that one might question the need of a super hero sydney poitier has gained real stature on the screen while the inimitable sammy davis jr has appeared in a number of television plays as the lead figure and in a few movies in starring roles other negroes have been featured in novel or screenplay so that one cannot say unequivocally that impressive negro representation in fiction is nonexistent but the symbol characterization is still missing the roles enacted by the present cluster of colored stars are so varied that contact is lost by the public as soon as the vehicle in which each has starred has ended unlike the image of a perry mason a cheyenne a marshal dillon a doctor ben casey or a dr kildare the negro hero flashes like a meteor on the horizon brilliant but brief with the darkness of nonrecognition closing in at once behind his sparkling performance this does not mean nonrecognition in the sense of rejection but rather nonidentification with the negro upsurge into respectability and accomplishment the occasional drama such as sydney poitiers ramble in raisin in the sun can do little to erase from the minds of too many white persons the subconscious image of the black man as jungle creature with his bare feet churning the dust in a violent dance ritual unfortunately a number of young american negroes help to advance this association by their penchant for loud or brazen adornment and wearing apparel to counteract this reflection the negro needs a constant hero in story form or in a television series since television is a complicated business in the matter of programming perhaps the story form makes more sense at first a writer preferably negro but not necessarily should introduce a black fictional character in serial form who would carry the banner for his race so admirably that his impact upon the american public could not help but inspire respect and consideration the detective character would seem to hold greatest promise although there might be some arguments in favor of a great dusky doctor who would join the ranks of kildare and casey in serving mankind the detective choice however is strongest in this initial quest for recognition for the express reason that the detective story along with the western retains highest reader preference in america the dated western seems destined to remain in white hands since few negroes wore guns in anger during those roaring times but the detective is timeless furthermore few heroes enjoy the esteem of the sleuth who time and again will move through a maze of perplexing clues and dangerous situations to expose the villainous murderer we have instinctively learned to love the image of a philo vance a sherlock holmes the thin man ellery queen and lawyerdetective perry mason to name a few now is the time for a negro detective alert smart brave clean strong to become a household word he must be so successful in crime detection that fictional white clients will clamor for his services without thought of skin pigmentation the black face of this new hero will not be a badge of inferiority it will become a symbol of honor and achievement he will never use dirty tactics nor will he be vulgar violent compromising his adventures must be the ultimate in plot and characterization so that his public will await each new episode with eagerness and impatience thus we have our status symbol can anyone doubt the influence which the great deeds of mr moto and charlie chan have had upon oriental respectability here is a minority race within this nation which has enjoyed virtual acceptance for many years one would be foolish to suggest that the oriental heroes of fiction were alone responsible for this agreeable development however the favorable light which glows from the brilliant derringdo of the likes of moto and chan cannot be refuted this amounts to a power of suggestion in which many readers bathing in deeds of courage and integrity find themselves cleansed to some degree of race prejudice thus in the negro world the advent of a colored fictional hero couid perceptibly plant the seeds of respect in a previously barren ground this would not mean a sudden and miraculous end to problems of discrimination there would be many hardcore individuals who would not be impressed by a fictional hero but by and large the subtle penetration into subconscious minds of favorable reaction to an idol might cause a number of persons to realize more vividly that the colored race in america is not a total abyss of ignorance squalor immorality and indolence of course there is frequent reference in magazines and newspapers to the large percentage of negroes who have risen above poverty to higher levels of accomplishment and refinement than have a surprising number of white citizens however this direct method of dispensing truth may not be as effective as the revelation by suggestion which would result from adoption by the public of a dashing hero there is nothing furtive in this approach the use of the word brainwashing which has acquired a scurrilous connotation within our society does not apply in this case we have here a simple desire to reflect truth to a public which has closed its eyes long enough to the struggle of a people to be acceptable and accepted in their own country and what exactly is the truth it is the realization by conscientious negro leaders that the black belts of population both north and south teem with a discouraging percentage of ignorant impoverished and unclean people who would not blend in even a middleclass white neighborhood the negro authorities are also aware of extensive white slum areas with their streams of human degradation though a much greater percentage of white population has reached superior cultural and intellectual levels those negroes who qualify under the standards of morality dignity intelligence and achievement should have equal billing there is no logical reason why the sudden appearance of an enlightened negro family in an all whiteupperclass area should cause pandemonium yet real estate values will drop legal battles will rage ostracism for the intrepid family is assured and in many instances broken windows or worse will reflect the angry mood of selfrighteous citizensthis in spite of the fact that the family which can afford to live in a pretentious settlement will have reached cultural and educational heights worthy of the neighborhood thus the only objection is black skin the standard by which all negroes continue to be judged that is why our fictional black detective or doctor or whatever should have his day with this recalcitrant public should he win no friends change no minds soften no attitudes blunt no windmills nothing will change for the worse if on the other hand the clouds of prejudice were to open just enough to admit one thin beam of the light of tolerance our negro fictional hero will have served mankind to the utmost the urban ordeal of negroes a discussion of the condition of negroes in american cities is concerned essentially with the problem of negroes in american civilization since more than seventenths of the negroes in the united states are city dwellers today until world war ii much of the thinking concerning the conditions of negroes in the united states was dominated by the mistaken assumption that the major problems of negroes were those growing out of their position in the rural south while it is true that until world war i ninetenths of the negroes lived in the south and fourfifths of those in the south were in rural areas the majority of the negroes in the north have always lived in the cities in when the first federal census was taken negroes constituted for example per cent of the population of new york city and per cent of the population of philadelphia since the proportion of negroes in the north who live in cities has increased from per cent to nearly per cent at the same time negroes in the south have been migrating to cities with the result that somewhat more than half of the negroes in the south are in cities i before the civil war in the south as well as in the north where there were relatively few slaves free negroes were concentrated in cities in for example there were free negroes in new york city in philadelphia in baltimore in richmond virginia in charleston south carolina and in new orleans louisiana after emancipation negroes migrated in large numbers to the cities of the north as well as of the south between and the negro population in fourteen southern cities increased per cent as compared with an increase of per cent in the white population of these same cities during this same period the negro population of eight northern cities increased per cent during the next two decades to the movement of negroes to cities slowed down and as late as nearly seventenths per cent of urban negroes were in southern cities ii the urbanization of negroes during the twentieth century has followed a similar trend in the white population in the south the urbanization of the negro population closely paralleled that of the white increasing from less than per cent in to over per cent in between and a million negroes moved from rural areas to southern cities with a population of and over and into towns and cities with populations ranging from to the movement of negroes to southern cities was inconspicuous and occurred at the same time as the mass migrations to the north which were replete with dramatic incidents and were directed principally to a few citiesnew york chicago philadelphia and detroit the mass migrations to northern cities which began during world war i and have continued to the present time have resulted in a shift in the negro population which has changed fundamentally the relation of negroes to american civilization there has been a change both in the numerical distribution and in the proportion of negroes in the population of the north and of the south at the opening of the present century per cent of the negroes were in the south whereas today only per cent are in the south in they constituted a third whereas at the present time they comprise only a fifth of the population of the south for years negroes did not constitute more than per cent of the population of the north and only one per cent of the population of the west at the present time the more than negroes in the northern cities comprise about per cent of the population of the north in new york city chicago philadelphia and detroit there is a total of negroes in the citiessix in the south seven in the north three border cities and one western citywith negro communities numbering or more there are to be found today about or a third of the negroes in the united states ill the pattern of settlement of negroes in american cities has always provided an index to their economic and social condition in urban areas from earliest times negroes have been concentrated in the slum areas of american cities this has been primarily the result of their poverty at the same time those who were economically betteroff and educated were able to escape to some extent from the slums in philadelphia it was noted as early as that the more successful negroes tended to move to the periphery of the negro area or to escape from it altogether but on the whole the negro population has been concentrated in the slum areas especially in northern cities where the processes of ecological segregation in the expanding cities are most manifest therefore in considering the pattern of settlement of negroes in american cities it is necessary to recognize the differences between not only southern and northern but border cities as well in the older cities of the south the location of negroes was due largely to historical circumstances the location of the widelyscattered negro population in the older cities like charleston south caro lina and new orleans louisiana was the result of small negro settlements comprised mainly of servants which grew up close to the house of the whites in which the negroes served these patterns of settlement took root before the spatial pattern of the cities was affected by the economic forces which have shaped the pattern of modern american industrial and commercial cities therefore another pattern of settlement has appeared in the newer cities of the south where industry and commerce have determined their spatial pattern in these cities there are several large concentrations of negroes and the remainder of the negro population is scattered over a large area nevertheless in these larger cities of the south the majority of negroes are concentrated in the slums and blighted areas on the other hand in the larger northern cities negroes have always been more segregated within a small area than in the larger southern cities this has been due mainly to the operation of impersonal economic and social forces which has resulted in the segregation of other ethnic groups as well in slum areas the concentration of negroes in certain areas of border cities has been somewhat similar to their concentration in the larger southern cities with one important difference neither historical circumstances nor impersonal ecological processes have been decisive in determining their location with the result that it was in the border cities that the more important battles over residential segregation of negroes have been waged in view of the fact that negroes have been concentrated in the slums of american cities it would be expected that they would be housed in the worst dwellings as negroes moved into northern cities the ghettoes grew in size and became more crowded just before the united states entered world war ii the housing situation of the negro is indicated by the fact that about half of the negroes in northern cities lived in houses which needed major repairs or had serious plumbing deficiencies in the increased earnings of negroes during the war years enabled them to demand better housing but private housing schemes even with government assistance did little to improve housing facilities for negroes in amer cities klose negroes improvement in the housing of negroes appeared only when the federal government began to build lowcost housing projects and negro workers began to occupy these projects nevertheless these lowcost housing projects have been wholly inadequate to meet the housing needs of negroes in american cities then the problem of racial segregation in governmentsupported housing has been inevitable since racial segregation is inseparable from the negro ghettoes from all indications it is probably as true today as it was years ago that a half of the negro population in american cities live in substandard dwelling quarters when negroes began to migrate to cities in large numbers it was believed that their high death rate in urban areas would soon eliminate them from the american scene but in the s with the declining death rates and an increase in the birth rate of urban negroes it appeared that they were improving their ability to survive in the city the improvement in the vitality of negroes in northern cities was much better than in southern cities of course the increase in the birth rate of negroes in cities was due to the movement of large numbers of negroes of childbearing age to cities on the other hand the greater improvement in the vitality of negroes in northern cities than in southern cities has been due to better welfare and health provisions professor hauser has made a significant contribution to the study of the differentials in the mortality of negroes and whites in cities in a study of chicago it was revealed that economic status was an important factor in survival of both whites and negroes however among negroes of the lowest economic stratum per cent of males as compared with per cent of white males of the same economic stratum would die before years of age while per cent of the white females and per cent of negro females of the same economic stratum would die before the most recent materials on the fertility of negroes in cities indicate that the vitality of the urban negro population has improved during the past or years though it is still below that of whites this improvement is associated with the decline in infant mortality and in the proportion of childless couples who are the victims of venereal diseases and a decrease in various forms of family disorganization iv the migration of negroes to cities especially the cities of the north has accelerated the occupational differentiation of the negro population negroes have ceased to gain their living primarily from agriculture and have become an important element among industrial workers likewise they have become an important element in organized labor especially in the cioafl unions the most rapid and important changes in the occupational status of negroes have occurred in northern cities while in the cities of the south negro workers are still largely excluded from skilled and white collar occupations as the south has become industrialized white workers from rural areas are absorbed into the new industries while negroes must live at a starvation wage in domestic service and in unskilled labor or are forced to migrate to northern cities this is due partly to the fact that in southern cities negroes have no political power while in northern cities they are able to exercise considerable political power and the color line in industry and commerce does not exist as in the south in many northern cities negroes have entered practically the same occupations as whites and in recent years their entrance into clerical and other white collar occupations has been especially significant moreover many negroes are employed in white collar and professional occupations and other public services by the municipalities then it should be added that many negroes are elected to public offices in northern cities on the other hand in the south practically all negroes in white collar occupations are restricted to the institutions of the negro community this has resulted in an important difference between the incomes of negroes in northern and southern cities according to the federal census figures for for all cities in the united states the median income of a white family was and a negro family and for unrelated white individuals and unrelated negro individuals but the difference between white and negro families and individuals was much greater in the south than in the north in southern cities the median income of white families and unrelated individuals was while the median income of negro families and unrelated individuals was in northern cities on the other hand the median income of white families and unrelated individuals was about and that of negro families and unrelated individuals was between and the greater occupational differentiation of the negro population of northern cities and their higher incomes have made possible the emergence of a sizeable middle class in northern and western cities a conservative estimate indicates that per cent of the negroes are able to maintain a middle class way of life while in southern cities only about per cent of the negroes have incomes and education to maintain middle class standards in this connection it should be emphasized that in northern cities negroes have access to a standard american education to a larger extent than in southern cities and that there is more illiteracy among negroes in southern cities than in northern cities it has been mainly through education that negroes have achieved and continue to achieve social mobility the negro middle class which has emerged in recent years is composed mainly of salaried professional and white collar workers with a goodly number of the higher skilled workers the socalled negro business enterprises are insignificant both from the standpoint of employment of negroes and incomes moreover negroes are only beginning to secure employment as salaried professionals and white collar workers in industry and commerce yet the emergence of a negro middle class has created an important cleavage in negro communities in cities nowhere is this more evident than in the middle class negro neighborhoods that are emerging especially in the larger southern cities the movement of negroes to cities especially northern cities has been regarded as the second emancipation of the negro in a sense this has been true it has enabled them to escape to a large extent from the race prejudice and caste restrictions of the agricultural south it has enabled them to escape from domestic service and unskilled occupations and enter most of the same occupations as whites it has meant an increase in incomes and created a sizeable middle class all of these changes have been in response to changes in the economic and social organization of american life and as a consequence negroes have been faced with new problems in the competition of city life the majority of negroes have been confined to slums and forced to live in dwellings unfit for human habitation because of the lack of education and skills which are required by modern industry in which automation is becoming important large numbers of negroes are not only unemployed but unemployable therefore it is in the city that the masses of negroes with the added burden of racial discrimination are confronted with the frustrations of an industrial civilization many seek an escape from these frustrations in alcohol and in narcotics while others seek an escape in the numerous religious cults which range from spiritualism to a militant black nationalism thus it is in the cities that negroes are being subjected to the rigorous ordeal of american civilization the outcome of which no one can predict with certainty stronghold of yoruba culture the majority of the population of bahia state in brazil comprise people of african descent among whom traces of a longstanding yoruba influence are still clearly noticeable at salvador the capital city of the state of bahia vivid reminders of the african particularly the yoruba way of life are constantly met in every sphere of human activity for example in the field of the culinary arts one meets the inviting sight and appetising flavor of akara known here as acaraje as it is being fried in sizzling palm oil by bahian ladies on the pavements or in street corners all over the city other names of bahian foods which suggest african connections include arroz haussa mocoto which corresponds to the yoruba word mokoto that is stewed calves or pigs feet acaca which is also used in dahomey there are also various kinds of dishes which come under the classname muqueca a word used in lagos in the form of mukeke for referring to delicious savory dishes and the words feijao farofa mingau arroz doce canjica which travelled back to lagos with the return of the brazilians towards the end of the last century and with little or no orthographic change have become household words among the aguda of popo aguda that is the brazilians of catholic mission street igbosere road campos square and the environment sometimes referred to as the brazilian quarters these gentle but constant reminders of the african way of life are not confined to the culinary art they are visible in the religious observances of people of african descent in the placenames and other descriptive names of bahia in the womens hairdos and in the contributions already made by bahians themselves towards the production of a written literature in yoruba in the sphere of religion we have under general examples the different candombles that is the religious ceremonies of african origin held in various casas or centres scattered all over bahia where the gods of africa especially the yoruba gods sango oya obatala ogun osun ososi and others are worshipped by bahian men and women who sing yoruba songs and dance to yoruba drumrhythms the principal candombles include that of the senhora at sao goncalo in the retiro district of the city where the yalorixa yoruba iyalorisa bears the yoruba name osunmuyiwa after the great river osun which flows between oshogbo and ilesha in nigeria at the candomble at rua luiz anselmo in the matatu district the yalorixa is olga alaketo named after alaketu the king of ketu in dahomey whose ancestor was the first alaketu one of the seven grandsons of oduduwa and at avenida vasco da gama there is the candomble oxumare a name which recalls osumare the yoruba name for the rainbow in addition the egungun cult is very much alive in bahia on the island of itaparica on the other side of the bay the egungun rites are regularly performed they even have an alagba the title held by the head of the egungun cult in every yoruba town examples of contributions already made by bahians to the production of a written literature in yoruba include introducao ao estudo gramatical da lingua yoruba by professor edson nunes da silva who has himself recently visited nigeria and yoruba tal qual se fala by sr deoscroedes maximiliano dos santos son of senhora osunmuyiwa from this brief description of yoruba associations in bahia it is not difficult to understand why yoruba was chosen as the first african language to be taught at the university of bahias centre de estudosafroorientais on the invitation of the director of the centre i came to bahia in august to open the first course the foundation class which is held in the evenings is attended mainly by men and women of african descent who are working as teachers doctors businessmen and clerks the first anniversary of nigerias independence coincided with the completion of the first year of the yoruba course as the students had been practising a play oduduwa ati awon omo re oduduwa and his children i encouraged them to stage the play as a contribution towards our celebrations of the anniversary the support that i received from the director and the entire staff of the centre was superb the school theatre was placed at our disposal and the centres photographer designer and stage manager as well as the university choir all rallied round to give every ounce of the assistance needed working far into the night during rehearsals everybody seemed bent on making our show the best of its kind the afternoons performance opened with a brief summary of nigerias centurylong progress under british rule from the status of a crown colony to that of a sovereign state this was followed by my own personal anniversary greetings struck on the talking drum while the drum beats were translated into yoruba sentences by sr luiz sergio barbosa a member of the yoruba class and the yoruba sentences translated into portuguese by dr olga lydia da conceicao a lady member of the class then there was a short speech of welcome in portuguese and yoruba by professor taurino eduardio topazio sauze another member of the class the audience then heard a selection of nigerian music and accompanied by a commentary oduduwa ati awon omo re finally came a rendering in a magnificent style of nigerias national anthem the highlight of the days show was the play oduduwa ati awon omo re the reason is not difficult to find for this was probably the first time in history that an african play had been staged in bahia by bahians wearing african costumes and speaking an african language the colored yoruba robes i had carried from nigeria to london and from london to bahia but all the white robes were sewn here with local materials by brazilian tailors who borrowed my own white robes and used them as models i was particularly intrigued with the embroidery on the agbadas because while the nigerian tailors who made my own agbada kept strictly to convention using silk thread of only one color for each agbada the brazilian tailors sometimes boldly departed from this convention using threads of two or three different colors the colors blended so beautifully that i came to like the braziliansewn agbadas better than my own i was there for six months and saw practically all of africa i did not of course go to south africa i felt i would not have been welcome there but from nigeria i went to senegal the ivory coast to liberia ghana sierra leone uganda tanganyika kenya southern rhodesia tell us about some of the universities you visited i spent most of my time in contact with university people students and members of the faculty of course i also had associations with nonuniversity people a few politicians a good many professional writers and others the university system in africa differs considerably from ours the secondary school course is five years and the university course three years upon completion of this a baccalaureate degree is awarded is this applicable only to the english speaking countries no this is true also in the french speaking universities dakar for instance and the university college of the ivory coast you were in africa fortuitously at the time of the writers conference held at makerere university college in kampala uganda tell us about that from where i sat at this conference it was very successful it was surprisingly successful the one african writer of some reputation in this part of the world who was not there was amos tutuola the author of the palm wine drinkard he is not a young man and the eight hours flight from lagos to kampala would have been pretty hard on him but all the others were there chinua achebe the nigerian novelist wole soyinka the nigerian poet and playwright john pepper clark also from nigeria arthur drayton from trinidad yemi lijadu from nigeriathey were all thereand a brighter group a more intense and exciting group ive never seen langston hughes was there too and did a very representative job in presenting the problems which american writers face the problems which in some instances were similar to the problems being faced by the african writers several problems peculiar to themselves seemed to exercise the african writers first of all the problem of a second language a problem which american negro writersamerican writers in generalcertainly do not have they worried as to whether as africans they would express in english what they call the african personality after a stimulating discussion on this subject the tentative conclusion reached by the conferees was that whether they wrote in their native tongue or in the english language depended on the audience they wished to reach were there any french speaking writers present yes and those who write in the french language did not seem to have the same problems at least they didnt acknowledge having the same problems i think this is so simply because french colonial policy differed radically from that of the english the french said we will assimilate these people and although this was probably only a saying it had its effect on the africans who write in the french language they seem to feel that french is their language it is not a second language with them at all as you know for instance president leopold senghor of senegal who is a poet and philosopher as well as a statesmanwrites only in the french language would it then be your impression that far from regarding this as an impediment they regard the use of the french language as being an asset in creative expression oh yes they are very proud of the french language senghor believes and rightly i suppose from his point of view that the french language is the only language and so far as i am concerned he has expressed in the french language the african personality what about your own participation in the conference i must tell you that african publications have mentioned you as a prominent participant i was asked to keynote the conference and i spoke on the writer communication and response this was on saturday on the following wednesday langston hughes and i shared the platform and talked to the writers about those problems which american writersparticularly american negro writersface in the belief that the problems which americans face are in some instances similar to the problems they were facing for the most part we talked about problems of practical concern what does one do about finding a publisher does one employ an agent what does one do about publicity i hope the discussion we carried on was helpfulsome of the participants indicated it waswell i hope it was to what particularly were you addressing yourself in your keynote speech to the writers commitment i indicated that the writer to be a really serious writer had to be sincerely committed to something i tried to indicate that it did not matter very much what the nature of his commitment was some writers for instance have been committed to nihilism which is from my point of view completely untenable but their commitment has been sincere and they have certainly lighted up for some of us an aspect of life and living and the world which has been helpful another point that i tried to make was that writing after all in addition to being an art is a craft and that one has to learn his craft there is no such thing as being a primitive if you are a writer primitivism is in fact a negation of craft i got some argument on this point particularly in regard to the work of amos tutuola who is probably a much better craftsman than his work seems to establish did you find in the dialogue among african writers the pursuit of the same question that american negro writers often probe shall the african writer write about colonialism independence ie protest works or shall he just write as any other writer this came up in the conference and there was a very definite division must point out that the discussion of what the new african writers material should be was definitely tied up with the business of the second language there were those who said that the african writer in addressing himself to a nonafrican audience must engage in protest there were others who felt that the african writer should forget the nonafrican audience and write for his own people in which case his effort should be spent on building on the very great and rich oral tradition in african literature and some writers are doing the latter some of the most successful writers and some of the most talented writers like wole soyinka and john pepper clark are examples some of the other writers also talented like achebe and cyprian ekwensi are doing the other thing but in neither of the latter is protest so apparent that one feels as one reads oh this guy is just protesting their works impress me as being delineations of what is happening to them and explanations of why it is happening to them what about the african writers evaluation of their own work at the conference they were pretty tough on one another tough in the hope of promoting competence skill tough because they did not want the world to say that this that or the other piece of writing is a good job for africans so they tended to tear each other apart not in any spirit of nastiness but in the spirit of help i was particularly struck by this because some of the more established writers like ezekiel mphahlele like bloke modisanewhich leads me to say something about south african writers in a moment caught the devil and they took it in very good spirit as a matter of fact on about the fifth day the conference converted itself into a critical workshop this was very good hat was said about the south african writers the south african writers are i think in the deepest of quandaries most of them who were there are exiles living principally in england they want to appeal to the african audience in south africa hut they have trouble with censorship some of them are afraid that if they say what is in their hearts reprisals will he made against their families in south africa it is a serious problem which they face a problem with which it was my impression the other writers there could not possibly deal because theyre not in the same situation and do not really comprehendwho does comprehend whats going on in south africa these days regarding your remark about the writers being extraordinarily selfcritical what did they think was their present status in the literary world some of the writers at the conference are people whose reputations are more or less made in the rest of the world they felt nevertheless that such appeal as they have had may be an appeal based on the wrong reasons they are afraid of the probability that they are read in europe and the united states simply because they are new voices and not because they have anything important to say and they wish to avoid this they want to he read because they have something important to say in these new times was there an opinion expressed about doing works particularly dramatic works in african languages so that local groups might more easily perform them no there was not a discussion touching upon this did come up the drama group at the university college ibadan did an adaptation of shakespeares the taming of the shrew in pidgin english this disturbed some of the delegates to the conference for reasons which i can perfectly well understand before i knew anything about this performance i had made the remark at ibadan that pidgin english was to the british idiom what negro dialect was to the american idiom i went on to explain that dialect speech represented an early effort on the part of negro slaves to master the english language and was therefore legitimate and good since those days however it has become an element in the denigration of the american negro his capacity his ability to master a difficult language it has meant his assumption of ideas and expressions which are disingenuously his it seemed to me that this definition was applicable to pidgin english but at my lecture at ibadan during the question and answer period i was severely challenged by certain british members of the faculty so when the discussion of the adaptation of the taming of the shrew in pidgin english came up at the conference i was par ticularly interested to hear what was said by and large members of the conference were very disturbed that the british director of dramatics at ibadan had done this sort of thing was there any criticism of literature in terms of form and style on the one hand and subject matter on the other was selfevaluation based more on one than the other the mbari group of writers and artists from ibadan hold that the african writer will create new forms at the same time that he will probably create a new idiom or idioms this everybody seemed to accept in spite of the fact that it was pointed out that the creation of new formsforms which are amenable to the african personalitywill not be an easy thing to do genre have been established and only a real genius will be able to overcome the tradition that now exists after six months of this association brief though it was with african writers and their works what is your feeling about the prospect for literature and the theatre in africa my own feeling is that the african writer that african art expression in the theatre in poetry in the novel is now at the point where american negro art and expression was in the renaissance of the s and early s there is an exciting yeasting going on theyre finding their themes their idiom they are experimenting and considering that in many places they are being encouragedalthough not directedby government it would seem to me that the prospects for a great future are very good could you tell us what feeling you had in regard to your receptivity as an american negro writer and an american negro professor of english speaking to other africans my reception was fine i had naturally in the beginning a feeling of intrusion i certainly wanted nobody in africa to feel that i was pontificating i wanted them to know that i was there to learn i was received not only with great courtesy but great warmth i think i made some friends i certainly hope they realize that i consider them friends of mine in your talks to university students were there any particular questions which predominated the question i got most often was why dont more american negroes come out to africa the feeling seemed to be that the american negro had a great deal to offer them but of course they are proud people and they dont want anyone bringing gifts in a condescending way they asked why dont we have more american negroes teaching in our universities what about physicians what about technicians cant these people give us a year or two of their lives and their skills and their knowledge i think this was the most persistent question and i got it not only from university students and members of the faculty i got it from people in the street that seems to indicate at least a latent affinity between the african and the american negro oh yes they know for instance even in east africa of the american negro dentist who has been practicing in ghana for seven years they know of the small group of american negroes who have established an insurance company they know of the american negro who set up in ghana the first school for the deaf and dumb and who recently has been invited by the nigerian government to do the same thing and after that hes going to tanganyika they know these things it makes them happy the only complaint is that theres just not enough of us what did you gather was the reason that africans were interested specifically in having american negro teachers etc their feeling was that the american negro being of the same racial strain would be more sympathetic to the problems which they face that they could get closer to the american negro than to the european to the white man in general they made no bones about this africans will tell youand i heard this time and time againthat by and large the european in africa hears only what the african thinks will please the european but the african tells another african the truth i dont want to leave you with the impression however that just any negro will do you dont make it in africa simply because youre another africannor do you fail just because youre white you are accepted because you are a negro who has something to offer did you feel there was any marked yearning for knowledge about american negroes and american negro writing oh yes they know by and large all that is happening here in the statesin all forms of expression they can name american negro writers american writers in general they can name actors and singers and they know what these people are doing what they have done they also know of the sporadic movements that have been started from time to time linking the american negro to his african heritage they know about marcus garvey for instance they know that dubois called the first panafrican congress they admire these people tremendously and they feel although they recognize that the american negro is first of all an american that he needs to know a great deal more about his heritage than apparently he does who are the american writers with whom africans seemed most familiar they were certainly familiar with langston hughes they knew some of the work of arna bontemps particularly in east and central africa because arna had been out to the university college in kampala for a period of months helping the college organize its library they knew william faulkner a group of us one night had a session on faulkner they knew the older american writers whitman and emerson they knew strangely enough maybe not so strangelyjohn steinbeck and they seemed to know him better than ernest hemingway although theyd all read hemingway one of the interesting things about their knowledge of american literature is that it has been acquired on their own none of the universities have courses in american literature i pointed out to british members of some faculties that this was provincial of them especially in light of the fact that except for boris pasternak americans have in the last seven eight years taken the nobel prize for literature in the states we have a great and important body of literature i told them and you completely neglect it they didnt like the accusation but it was the truth one can assume then that if there are no courses on american literature there are none on american negro literature this is right and it is why african members of the faculty and african students were very happy to get the shelf of ten books including the works of richard wright langston hughes and james baldwinwhich i presented for amsac to various universities during my tour there were in fact many places many institutions i was unable to visit which heard about the hooks and have written to the lagos office asking if they could have them on the subject of another american negro writeryourselfi had spoken with a great deal of admiration to wole soyinka about your book the lonesome road when i was in lagos for a brief stay and was pleased to see that he reviewed the book a couple of months ago in one of the lagos papers did you see it yes a very flattering review im quite proud of it vm certainly thankful to you for giving us this time to talk about your trip may i say that in a little better than five years of amsacs existence your tour on our behalf has been one of the most telling things in the relationship between america and africa that amsac has sponsored the laudatory letters that have come in from universities and individuals about your visit testify to this we hope we will be able to undertake similar projects in the future mr breman and miss pool paul breman and rosey e pool both are dutchborn and live within walking distance of each other in london and have beenin mr bremans own wordson very friendly terms for the last years because of our mutual interests their mutual interests of course include the poetry of north american negroes although they are not associated at all in their current ventures mr breman confesses that his heritage project is not at all a moneymaking endeavor but he believes that it will be in timeproviding american negroes and englishspeaking africans become adequately interested in negro poetry following a ballad of remembrance mr breman published it already is available an anthology of some new names under the title sixes and sevens this volume is dedicated to the late harold jackman of new york the heritage imprint was chosen by mr breman because the poet is both the traditional keeper of cultural heritage and one of the more important leavers of cultural legaciesa position which especially in the case of the american negro could well become a key position the heritage series of four volumes of poetry may be ordered directly from mr breman in london or through booksellers an extra cents or according to the editions selected should be added to the check or money order for conversion fee incidentally mr breman is anxious to have it known that none of the volumes published by heritage will be subsidized by the authors rosey e pool has lived a rich and varied life she is paul breman is she was a teacher of anne frank a german prisoner during world war ii and later a resistance fighter her interest in american negro poetry extends back to when she discovered countee cullen she has been responsible for some eight books plus numerous translations a year ago she addressed the inaugural gathering at the lagos nigeria center of the american society of african culture on the subject new trends poetry by margaret burroughs it was the beginning of the christmas sea son and someone had plopped a prepaid ticket of on my desk for a party to be held over in hyde park it seemed from reading the copy that it was to be an interracial benefit for some good cause or other since it was saturday night and my steady date had begged off for the evening and i did not like to face the prospects of sitting at home on that special night looking at tv i decided to make use of the ticket and attend the party i do not know how white folks feel about saturday night but i do know that colored folks work hard all week and look forward to having a natural ball at least that one night besides it had been some time since i had been inside of one of those exclusive hyde park apartments and i felt like seeing how the other half lived again for a change when i had finished dressing in one of my exotic numbers which i feel play up my negritudehair eyes full lips and alli called for a livery to deliver me to the door i do not feel safe going into a white neighborhood unescorted and especially before christmas when people need money and dont care who they get it from as i was riding along i wondered if i would have any trouble with some white landlord getting upset because he saw colored visiting in his building i certainly didnt feel like fighting that kind of battle right then these landlords do not seem to understand that some white people have guts enough to have colored friends and that the neighborhood is not being invaded every time a colored person visits in a white building i decided that the christmas spirit must have taken hold for i had no trouble getting into the building i was received at the door very cordially by the host and hostess after chatting with them for awhile i found that she is a writer and that he is in the advertising business and further that they are prominent in a lot of dogood organizations which have to do with colored and white people getting along better together i liked their ideas right off for i too am for people getting along better together and i would like to see a lot more white people and colored people too like this couple not just talking about brotherhood but trying to live it i was pleased with what i saw everything was decorated real christmaslike with holly wreaths and bells and the people that i was introduced to both colored and white were all very nice i sat down in the living room and just enjoyed being surrounded by all of that fine modern furniture and having my feet buried in the soft persian rug i love nice things like that though i have not been able to afford them i just reared back and closed my eyes for a few moments listening to the christmas music playing on the fine bleached walnut hifi it sounded so good that i could hardly tell where the sound was coming from not wanting to sit in one place too long i got up and began to look at the original paintings hanging on the walls if you sit in one place too long at one of these interracial parties and you are colored pretty soon some white person will come over and insist on talking to you not wanting you to feel lonely or left out or to think that they are prejudiced they never seem to think that you just might be enjoying yourself being left alone these were all modern and abstract paintings real originals by artists like picasso bracque rothko and pollack i tried my best but i couldnt make much sense out of all those blobs lines and curlicues of paint the color was nice though some of the white guests came up and looked at them too they acted as if they could read those paintings like reading a book but not me even when i studied the history of art in school i couldnt make sense out of the nonobjectives i like representative art even if that does make me sound like a square i continued to look around the apartment and i must say that it was wellappointed or swelegant as a lady columnist in the colored weekly would say if she was writing it up it was just like the pictures that you see in the home magazines that people decorate their cocktail tables with i liked that place and couldnt help comparing it with my little old kitchenette i wondered how much rent they paid for it i went into the powder room which was right off the bathroom and locked myself in this was so fine that it could have been used for a living room someone rattled the door and i came out and walked down the hall to the dining room which was set up like a bar i could hear the christmas music back there from a speaker built into the wall it was very pleasant and i was feeling glad i came i ordered a drink and i was just sitting there at a corner of the bar sipping it and thinking of nothing in particular not even the race problem when i heard my name called hello there madge i looked around and coming straight toward me was a white woman with wavy dark hair at first i didnt quite recognize her because except for the color of the hair most white people look alike to me but a closer look told me who she was even though i had not seen this woman in over ten years oh sylvia goodrich i extended my hand its a small world isnt it how have you been now i had it her husbands name was bob and we all used to work together on the artist project in the good old days of wpa we used to visit back and forth because in those days people were not suspicious of you if you had colored or white friends they and a number of other white artists used to live down at thirtyfifth and cottage grove in a section called the arcade which isnt there any more then the project folded and i seldom saw any of those people any more only once in a great while and now here was sylvia i did remember though that she could talk up a blue streak but then it was nice to see someone at the party that i knew even if it was from a long time ago is bob with you i looked around no bob had some work to get out hes in map making now sylvia sat down sort of traoping me into the corner i was mighty glad to see her but i wished she hadnt squeezed me in like that i do not like being crowded by either white or colored people holiday greetings madge she said youre looking fine you look good yourself too sylvia after all of these years you are being kind said sylvia she peered at me closely and i felt as if she was counting every single gray hair and wrinkle that i had but you have not aged a bit trim figure smooth skin not a sign of gray how do you do it i dont have time to get old i laughed too much to do just trying to make ends meet inwardly i was thankful for my african and indian blood it seemed that with that blood you just didnt break as fast as the white people well there was one advantage then we went off into a lot of talk about the good old days and as i said before sylvia could really talk she was feeling pretty good and it seemed to me that she had had a couple before she got to this party i hoped that she knew how to hold her liquor for i certainly did not want her to embarrass me by acting up i do not like that from anybody either colored or white say madge said sylvia i just got back from the west indies you ever been there not that i know of i said ive heard its great down there though nice climate and all ive been going down for a few weeks every winter for the past several years said sylvia i love it simply love it especially haiti i compared my arm with hers you sure got a fine tan this time i said a little bit more and you could pass for colored sylvia took a hurried gulp from her drink and i wished i hadnt said what i did i thought id better change the subject for i do know that white people are very sensitive about being mistaken for colored even though they do bum themselves to a crisp in the summer trying to get a tan and the colored people who already have a tan put bleach cream on themselves trying to get rid of theirs also the white people get permanent waves trying to make their hair curly and the colored people use hot combs to try and get the curl out of their hair its crazy i think since i am quite satisfied with myself the way that i am the travel posters sure make it look good down there i said its indescribably beautiful said sylvia and especially the people they are colored all shades from blueblack to honeyyellow uh huh i bristled inwardly theres just about the same range here in south side chicago i hoped she wasnt going to start all that colorstuff talk i was sure that those west indians didnt get all mixed up like that by themselves i decided to let that one pass the music and dancing sylvia went on is just out of this world the rhythm of the drums simply possess me every time i hear them she began to tap on the bar with her fingers i began to consider how i could get out of that comer i was not going to have sylvia goodrich or anyone else bringing me down i supposed now that she would come up with some of that stuff about how colored people just naturally have rhythm if she did i wasnt going to stand for it i didnt care how many years i had known her i was getting ready to put her down right then and there i guess thats where katherine dunham picked up all that afrocuban dancing i said of all the islands madge she said seeming not to hear me i love haiti the best um hum i lit a cigarette and tried to blow the smoke out in rings like you said it must be very colorful i was losing interest in the subject fast you see madge sylvia was close up to my face now i maneuvered back and saved my drink from being toppled over the woman must have been halflit or something i thought she continued you see madge the reason why i love haiti so and the colored people is is because im part colored myself you i stared at her maybe i was the one who had had one too many yes like you madge im colored too she spoke louder this time and the person serving the drinks glanced toward us oh yes oh yes i said but dont be so loud about it i know how to humor people when they have had one or two drinks too many i patted her shoulder youll be alright in a little while sylvia her voice was steady and even and she looked straight at me youre wrong madge im not drunk or even high this is something that i have been trying to say for a long time now ive said it and it doesnt sound bad at all im colored she repeated im colored just like you there seemed to be a note of pride in her voice even i wondered if sylvia was trying to pull my leg or something in case she didnt know it i did not play these kind of games with white people did she think i was a fool or something if you stood her up beside lena horne lena would look quite colored and you know lena looks whiter than a whole lot of white people well i thought if a couple of drinks could make this white woman declare that she was colored then that was her own business but she really ought to know what she was letting herself in for before she went shooting off her mouth i sure was the one to tell her too because i have been colored for a long time and it is no bed of roses she must have known about all of that jim crow stuff that you had to go through but it was alright with me she was free white and over twentyone and she sure had a right to decide to be colored if she wanted to besides i had read about how so many lightskinned colored people passed over to the white side each year i guessed there was nothing wrong with some white people coming on this side and declaring themselves to be colored i am not prejudiced so it is alright with me you dont have to talk so loud i said no use letting everybody know your business sylvia seemed more relaxed now as if she had just put down a heavy load which no doubt she had do you mean to tell me that you didnt know or suspect something back in the old days she asked a few of our close friends knew i took sylvias hand well that christmas spirit has a way of sneaking up on you no sylvia i never had the slightest idea you see i have always just taken people as they come if theyre white theyre white if theyre colored theyre colored it never bothered me i spoke nonchalantly i was not going to let sylvia know that her little confession had shaken me in the least my grandmother sylvia confided further was a mulatto halfwhite halfhaitian negro welcome on over to our side honey i quipped but you sure could have fooled me i guess you did but youve been white so long whats the use of doing anything about it now its just that so many times i have wondered whether i made the right decision or not i have relatives in haiti and some in chicago too it is lonely being cut away madge i knew my cousins when i was younger and they knew me but when i entered college we moved and went over on the white side completely i see i shook my head understandingly dad was scotchirish he knew about mother and didnt care but mother sylvia was thoughtful i really shouldnt hold it against mother she wanted me to grow up having all the advantages she didnt want me to suffer all of the things that are just a way of life with colored people you really cant blame her for that it isnt easy but i sighed somehow or other we live prosper and overcome sylvias words rushed out like an unstopped fountain well bob knew and he didnt mind but he got a good job and i thought well that was when we moved out of the interracial colony on thirtyfifth and stopped inviting our colored friends over even someone might find out you know how hard good jobs were to find then she took out a cigarette and paused while i lit it for her she inhaled deeply i know it sounds like crying over spilt milk i guess it is i remember how hurt bob was when i had the operation bob loves children hes always playing with them on the street the colored ones too but i was afraid you know what people say about throwbacks i have heard i said but science has knocked that theory into a cocked hat a child of mixed blood is never darker than the darkest parent i guess my fears were based on an old wives tale she said well its too late to think about that now here bob and i are approaching middle age or as they say early maturity and materially we havent done too badly she laughed bitterly why we have everything she banged the glass down on the bar yes everything including misery yes yes i know i said trying to understand how anyone could be miserable having everything even if it did include a smidgin of colored blood madge im tired of running moving into new all lilywhite suburbs acting the way i think a white woman should staying away from my own blood relatives im sick and tired of it if youre tired then stop it i advised you said your husband didnt mind stop running and moving and pretending and just be what you want to be but i dont know where to start how to start finding my own identity sylvia said what do you do where do you go you could start by looking up some of your kin people i said nothing wrong in that its fashionable nowadays for white people to have colored friends and vice versa thats called brotherhood and being christmas this is just the season for it i could try to find them sylvia said bob has often urged me to look them up but after i had rejected them i was afraid i would not be well received her eyes lit up ill take the chance she said ill look them up i hear there are a lot of little cousins i know bob will enjoy playing santa claus for them with me thats the spirit sylvia i told her i think youll be able to work it out from here on in i gathered up my purse hear the caroling up front lets join them lets do said sylvia i hope i havent spoiled the party for you by burdening you with a recital of my problems not in the least i said we started down the hall toward the living room i was laughing sylvia took my arm and i didnt mind it at all whats so funny madge you see syl my great grandfather was white and in our family were not too proud of the fact but since you have confided in me i guess i can reveal the family secret to you that he was white asked sylvia oh no i said not that well what was it she asked we heard he was a horsethief i said merry christmas someone shouted as we emerged into the living room merry christmas sylvia and i answered and we were both laughing fit to kill lennie pain never worried lennie much but this time it was bad lying on the canvas under the glaring ring lights his mouth and throat were choked with blood his nose was swollen and hotly clogged making it hard to breathe but still he wasnt worried he ignored pain and was only angry with himself for the blood pain was a way of life with him ever since he was old enough to remember he had known pain in one form or other anguish frustration and hurt were common everyday things to a black man in a white world pain was black and all the hardship that went with it it was his mothers working and sweating in a hot laundry trying to feed and raise her child who ran wild in the streets it was his mother sick and out of work it was the white lady from the welfare department with her fine clothes and arrogant charity without which he would have been even hungrier than he was it was being born illegitimate and black too it was leaving school to find a job watching his mother shrivel up and die too soon it was being a good young fighter who never got his chance until he was old and his reflexes had slowed it was working as a stevedore by day and training by night and never being at his best physically it was seven children a harlem flat and the need to fight it was a lovely colored girl who deserved a better husband and the thought of her pain when he would not quit it was one hundred and fortyseven pounds of tired human fighting equipment that couldnt quit pain was lennie johnson he pushed himself to one knee and wondered what round it was then he stood up the referee was brushing off his gloves asking him if he were all right lennie muttered something about being okay okay was normal normal was pain lennie felt normal he looked across the ring at the hot eager white face of dave holly his opponent the welterweight champion of the world the referee left him and holly was at him again tough young and anxious the pain became more intense lennie shuffled forward meeting those furious well trained fists doggedly ignoring the beating the blood and pain he had to win he felt it he must he told himself stay with him baby dont let this white boy lick you stay with him you have been hurt before dave holly met him up on his toes beautifully balanced and coordinated as he dealt out pain with cold sure precision the bell rang back in his corner his handlers worked him over frantically trying to stop the bleeding wading through blood and scar tissue in an effort to stop what they knew they could only prolong how do you feel lennie he answered okay they knew how he felt but they wanted to be sure how bad it was where are we lennie the garden man whore we fighting lennie stretched his swollen bloody face in a painful grin im fighting the meanest man in the world they all smiled a little then he was okay get him in close where you can hit him with the right lennie baby hit him with that good right hand im tryin man im tryin they gave him some mouth wash he spit the blood and water out in the bucket the warning buzzer went off he stood up and someone shoved in his mouthpiece the bell rang he went out to meet dave holly and the pain the champion began where he had left off he came and went like the wind delivering beautifully executed combinations with tremendous speed and timing lennie tried everything he knew bobbing weaving feinting and always coming forward he used all his experience but he still couldnt get close holly fought like a thief never getting in trouble never off balance lennie felt an odd grudging admiration for the champion the kind an experienced craftsman always feels when he meets a man who really knows his trade dave holly knew his he fought from afar staying away from lennies only real weapon a lethal right hand lennie couldnt figure a plan of attack he couldnt get close to deliver that one good clean shot holly was there then he was gone he hit lennie with swift hard punching devastation then in the ninth it happened lennie got hit with a hook that tipped him over backwards it was an awesome blow delivered with terrific force and precise timing lennie fell on his back his head snapped back violently against the canvas the roar of the crowd rang in his already pounding ears through bloodied eyes he looked up at the glaring blue and white haze of ring lights over head he felt nausea he wanted to throw up his head was on fire with a throbbing aching pain he was cold above him everything swirled crazily in a putrid mixture of blurred blinding yellow and blue whiteness that clashed sickeningly with the crimson smear of his own blood his mind screamed at him get up lennie get up dont just lie there please lennie please get up baby he fought with his protesting tired body he had to get up his heart told him to get up when life knocks you down you have to get up even though the white man beats you to your knees you have to get up and hit back to hell with pain fight back suddenly his head was clear it was though he were young again he felt sharp and invincible he stood up fast the referee was there then the champion was on him again he drove lennie back punching furiously hitting mauling as he tried to end it dave holly became cocky and a little too anxious lennie played possum he let himself be beaten and driven back holly threw caution to the winds he had lennie in a corner he thought he had him pinned down for the kill and then discovered with sudden awakening panic that it was he who was pinned down lennie had finally succeeded in leading him to close quarters lennie threw the works smashing through hollys frantic unsure defense he hit the champion with two clean wicked hooks and the prettiest right hand he ever threw holly went down hard bringing the crowd to its feet screaming in disbelief the smoke filled arena was bedlam people bellowed delighted and angry obscenities they pounded each other on the back this was lennies biggest moment never before had he felt like this even as the referee pushed him away toward a neutral corner lennie knew he would never again know this feeling standing across the ring lennie watched dave holly struggle to his feet lennie got set to end it his chest and spirits heaved violently with pain and joy he knew he had his man he knew it he saw holly wavering unsteadily as the referee wiped off his gloves the end was near never had lennie felt as much like fighting as right now his body and mind tingled with sharp clear thinking readiness it was just a matter of time lennie knew it holly knew it and so did this roaring maniacal fight crowd as it stood waving hats and coats grinning laughing shouting and letting itself go crazy lennie shuffled out to end it holly retreated desperately he stalled he hit lennie with several light jabs to the head then all of a sudden lennie johnson stopped sh fighting the champion kept retreating wary of another possum trick lennies eyes went glassy and his hands fell uselessly and heavily to his sides his knees buckled pitifully then he pitched forward and fell face down with his hands still at his sides when his face smashed into the canvas he was already dead the pain was gone the wedding and the wonder first i saw him on the airwaves sitting by y a blonde young woman ii l thought there goes another good man all the bright rich or brilliant ones get captured by some blonde even my own son young as he is recognizes the special something sparkling from a golden gal dismayed i musedif they dont get them the first time they take them on the second goround walter thurgood and adam i recalled when mboya spoke on tv i could tell he was annoyed the interviewer a mike wallacetype sought to draw him out on subjects which it was plain to see the interviewer knew nothing about atiently yet like a coiled spring mboya answered eager to be free and out of there a quiet word or two to acknowledge the presence of his companion and perhaps make her feel at ease do you envy this woman to myself i queried yes i envy her by what right does she cling so comfortably to him why does he not confide in one of us one like me bore him did she not wiped his nose and spanked his hiney when he was bad where was this english lady when they mistook him for a mau mau would she have stood beside him then yet where was i would i have stood beside him then this blonde has just as much right to sit beside him as you have said to me and think would you not like to have a blonde beside you reflecting i answered yes tonight i would be happy to have anyone beside me blonde or black i am so lonely i felt ashamed when i saw pictures of his wedding there she stoodthe brideall of ten years his junior black and slender as a reed i was still dissatisfied hes brilliant i sputtered to myself hes handsome stalwart noble in carriage why could he not have found a beauty perhaps shes beautiful inside i thought consolingly but he deserves a beauty one can see in disgust i cried to me o hypocrite let this dear man lay he is a stranger to you this mboya what if he knew about this foolish game you play and then i saw the closeup the lovelight oer her face it did enthrall to me i said perhaps this fellow found a beauty after all the revolt of louis e lomax the negro revolt bring himself to abandon it when he found so little genuine evidence of honesttogoodness revolt as most of us understand the term instead he searched until he found in the britannica world language dictionary a definition that was bound to fit ie an extensive or drastic change in a condition method or idea a definition of revolt broad and vague enough to apply equally well to abstract painting the bessemer converter the invention of printing the social security system and the medieval guilds is surely broad enough to include louis lomax for what seems to have happened is that lomax has updated and adapted to modern communications an ancient and sometimes indispensable negro art fooling white people if in the process a few colored people are also fooled this is only to be expected his success in fooling his publishers appears to be total their conviction of his expertise in racial matters is such that they apparently felt it unnecessary to exercise even routine editorial diligence in processing the manuscript otherwise how account for such unnecessary if minor errata as seven naacp regions on page and six on page placing the freedom rides in p dating the civil_rights act in p misspelling the name of lomaxs friend otto mcclarrin in his acknowledgments lomax calls him mclaurin and references to the negro american labor council as the american negro labor council p to cite a few it is barely possible of course that harper and brothers did not much care in their and the authors anxiety to get something out in a hurry that might profitably tap the current popular interest in negro affairs the niceties of accuracy and thoroughness may have seemed only bothersome hindrances to a fast market and speedy royalties it is distressing of course that matters of the greatest moment in which so many dedicated people are heavily and sacrificially engaged should be made the plaything of this kind of cynicism but there is an unhappily long tradition behind it in this country as well as in others aside from the moral distress there is reason for distress on practical grounds greshams law prevails in the world of letters as well as in monetary circles and every meretricious work on an important subject makes it harder for serious and competent treatment to get a proper hearing and finally there is the sadness of knowing that the author of the negro revolt might if he would write an analysis of real significance and of genuine value in the cause which he espouses with such apparent sincerity in his preface to the crucial decadeand after eric goldman describes a procedure he followed one which ought to be an inviolable text for the conscientious commentator naturally in writing of events so recent and controversial i have been especially concerned about the danger of factual inaccuracy beyond the usual scholarly checks i tried to ward off error through a direct appeal to the participant in the story whenever it seemed to me feasible or sensible i sent a copy of the appropriate manuscript pages to the man or woman i had written about and asked for a check on my facts and i did this without regard to whether the person was a waiter or a world statesman and without regard to whether i had written about him favorably or unfavorably goldman of course retained his own responsibility for his work and did not necessarily accept the responses at face value but he reports that many genuine errors were caught lomax repeatedly seeks to give the impression that he consulted frequently and at length with the persons of whom he wrote and that if any misinterpretations have crept in the fault is not in any lack of diligence on his part but rather in the deviousness or confusion of his sources since he seldom departs from a tone of assured finality generally representing himself as privy to vast inside knowledge hidden from ordinary mortals this pose will undoubtedly convey extreme plausibility to many of his readers many of these also will be strongly persuaded by his veiled warnings that the objects of his criticism will of course deny everythingafter all what would you expect if a personal reference may be forgiven there is a perfect example on page of the kind of error which eric goldmans procedure would have avoided laboring at his untenable thesis that the naacp national leadership is antithetic or at best indifferent to the worth of direct action techniques lomax asserts that i regard sitins and freedom rides as incompatible with the fundamental philosophy of the association the basis for this is a somewhat garbled version of a statement in which i said that the naacp can hardly advocate a policy of mass civil disobedience under contemporary ie nonrevolutionary conditions the latter is indeed my view but all that lomaxs misuse of it shows is that he does not know what mass civil disobedience is it certainly does not encompass sitins or freedom rides which are efforts to make the law applicable not to defy it that they violate local and state law is simply an interim corollary of our federal system and a simple telephone call could have cleared up lomaxs confusion in a few minutes the foregoing is a single one of the scores of errors halftruths distortions and outright fabrications with which the lomax discussions of the naacp are loaded i do not apologize for my preoccupation here with his treatment of the association it is obviously his chief target and the stated object of his synthetic revolt by negroes against the established leadership moreover those portions of the book in which he momentarily dwells on other matters for example the rehashed capsule history of the negros struggle that takes up the first fiftyodd pages the two final chapters and the halfdozen appendix tables culled from government sources as an afterthought add nothing to his primary argument and bear all the earmarks of being there as padding it would require half as many pages as lomaxs book contains to correct all the perversions of fact to be found in the negro revolt there is a problem also in selecting certain of them to refute should the criterion be the enormity of the distortion or the inherent importance of the item being misrepresented the futility of hoping in any case to catch up with all the readers who will have been misled is equally apparent nevertheless conscience demands that attempt be made to set the record straight in at least a few instances and these follow chosen more or less at random lomax the precise legalism of the naacp while gaining spectacular courtroom results had made relatively little practical headway p this is a monumentally silly statement especially when taken together with the observation in the same paragraph that direct mass action had paid off handsomely for negroes at montgomery for on page lomax notes that it was the naacps lawsuit which ended bus segregation in montgomery a year of mass action there tremendous though its broader significance was never succeeded in doing this the precise legalism was what turned the trick lomax the sitins and freedom rides have relieved more common indignities for more common people in two years than legalism has accomplished in a quarter of a century p a quarter of a century goes back to in that time the white primary decision of relieved over a million southern negroes from the indignity of not being able to vote legalistic pressures brought freedom from jimcrow military units to hundreds of thousands of negro servicemen legislative pressures brought statewide prohibitions of racial exclusion from restaurants hotels and recreational facilities to millions of negroes in the north and west the supreme court decision outlawing school segregation despite the intransigeance of the deep south has nevertheless removed enforced segregation from the backs of several hundred thousand negro pupils in such states as maryland missouri west virginia and the border states to say nothing of course of the negroes of montgomery who were relieved at one stroke of the humiliation of segregated buses by the aforementioned naacp lawsuit the list could be extended but so preposterous an assertion should not require even this lomax he james farmer was the author of the naacps nationally voiced suggestion that negroes withhold their patronage from certain chain stores p it does not detract from james farmers contributions to the fight to state unequivocally that this was not so roy wilkins directive of february was exclusively a wilkins product conceived and drafted before anyone on his staff had any inkling of it lomax the major issue of the naacp convention was whether the naacp would as a matter of official policy employ direct action to storm further the bastions of segregation p on the contrary there was no such issue at that convention aside from the fact that the naacp has used direct action for years as a matter of official policy the convention devoted an entire evening to eulogizing naacp youth units in wichita oklahoma city and st louis for successful sitin activity during and early there was a seriously contended issue at the convention however the robert williams case and lomax typically twists it to fit his thesis according to lomax williams was dismissed as president of the branch in monroe n c for having advocated that negroes defend themselves by arms if necessary the national office claims lomax affirmed the right of selfdefense but did not feel that branches should state this as a general policy p but the issue in the williams case was never selfdefense and lomax knows this very well williams had called on negroes to meet lynching with lynching and had urged them when justice miscarried to declare and execute judgment themselves on white offenders he resorted to the selfdefense pretext only when it seemed that it might help him get out from under what he had actually said lomax in a desperation move when faced by prowilliams forces on the convention floor the naacp leadership called in mrs daisy bates then riding high as the heroine of little rock p no one called in daisy bates who is nobodys trained seal her impassioned and effective plea for the leaderships position was her own idea and it owed a great deal to the revulsion she had felt two nights earlier while listening to williams speaking on a harlem street corner lomax only in the last decade have negro contributions to the naacp matched those of white people p for at least the past thirty years the great bulk of naacp income each year has come from membership payments and branch fundraising and relatively little of this money has been of white origin lomax as evidence that the naacp is on the downgrade its membership was several thousand less than in and for the first time in years the national office is running a deficit and must draw on its reserves p the net membership loss for turned out to be around a drop of about three per cent increases in southern membership largely offset losses in some recessionhit northern cities as for the deficit one would hardly boast about it but it was by no means the first in years marked the fourth or fifth year in which the operating deficit exceeded and it was a smaller one than in either or these deficits be it noted occurred in years of successive income peaks the association has consistently taken in more money in each of the last six or seven years the explanation of the deficits is simple every year the naacp has expanded its activity to meet the expanding needs of the civil_rights struggle and it has had to cope with the multiple rising costs of engaging in such activity one could go on and on but a halt must be called somewhere though strongly tempted to deal with lomaxs fanciful conception of naacp organizational politics i shall confine myself to a final item lomaxs considered estimate of what the naacps program consists of stripped he asserts of the prestige heritage and lore the program consists of an excellent lobby in washington a good research department an ability to lodge protests in high places some modest efforts toward school desegregation in the south and lending a helping hand to negroes with racial troubles this is all that lomax selfassertedly an active member of the jamaica n y branch one of our best can find after scrupulous search and inquiry so be it but lets examine a bit of this superfluous prestige heritage and lore for example the naacps voter registration work employing two fulltime southern field workers since and costing by the end of over with fullfledged campaigns conducted at least once in each of more than cities and towns resulting in a carefully estimated additions to the voting rolls but for lomax to mention this would of course spoil much of his chapter in which he alleges that the kennedy administration had to bludgeon the naacp into doing something about voter registration for example the endless daytoday job of keeping this organization viable so that the unquestionably excellent lobby in washington can have a punch behind it a score of state and regional field secretaries maintain constant vigilance over the state of civil_rights in their areas they stimulate and guide branches in the carrying out of action programs and they are always on the scene when trouble breaks for example the extensive program of school desegregation in northern communities active school integration programs in cities with lawsuits under way in fifteen more for example the hundreds of job discrimination complaints investigated and filed with government agencies and the ceaseless pressure maintained by the naacp labor department on scores of employers unions and the presidents committee on equal job opportunity for example the career guidance work of the naacp youth department to say nothing of the work of its youth units in breaking down job bias by direct action in durham jacksonville savannah kansas city and a dozen other places to say nothing of the fact that the major portion of all the sitin activity was carried on by naacp youth councils and college chapters for example the painstaking work of instructing and guiding local branches in the intricate business of combatting discriminatory practices in housing and urban renewal in the most effective manner requiring the full time of a special assistant for housing for example a public relations program which bears a large part of the responsibility for public enlightenment on the true state of negrowhite relations through its press and wire service and its dayin dayout counselling of those whose words must carry the message out via this and all other media of mass communication may heaven continue to increase such prestige heritage and lore for without them the common struggle would be increasingly desperate in all truth the negro has been in revolt against the physical shackles that bound him and the legal and social shackles that have hampered him ever since the first slave arrived on these shores there is no new revolt against secondclass citizenship although there is clearly in sight the massive involvement in the struggle which has been a cardinal objective and an endless hope of the naacp since its founding nor is there anything new about the negros questioning of his leadership this too has characterized his upward way from the beginning and god willing it will be so as long as the battle lasts to those who doubt i would say only that the naacp will let neither just pride in its monumental achievements nor momentary dismay at the carping of illinformed or malicious critics deter it in the slightest from going on with its job with speed and vigor until the job is done the ole miss epic here ive been saying all these rather unkind things about senator eastland of mississippi ancj turns out hes a champion of civil_rights in fact as chairman of the senate judiciary committee hes dispatched investigators to ole miss to see whether anybodys civil_rights have been violated by the federal marshals the investigators are experts as they happen to be mississippians themselves so it sounds like a grand investigation i figure the investigators will produce a great documentary film entitled operation abolitionist the villain of course is this great hulking pound negro named mr james meredith played by mr sonny liston the hero is a governor barnett played by mr tab hunter with grayed hair the federal marshals will all be played by that german actor who usually plays general rommel as the movie opens mr meredith a mafia member on the lam is trying to bully his way into ole miss because he has secret orders from the kremlin to ravish every one of the young ladies in the alpha omega sorority played by miss ann rutherford along with their alumnae advisers miss greer garson and thereby convert all southern womanhood into black muslims who are really agents of the international jewish conspiracy in blackface at first mr meredith is on the verge of success by torturing and stomping on seven frail aged crippled registrars he seems about to storm his way into undefiled ole miss the students while loyal americans at heart are apathetic and do not exercise their inalienable civil right of lynching mr meredith but at the last moment in charges the governor on a white horse tadah he is a wearing a rebel cap and a confederate flag cowed by the sight alone mr meredith starts to slink away intending to return to his usual work of slipping heroin into the milk bottles of hospital nurseries when disaster in stomp goosestepping federal marshals wearing hobnailed boots nazi field jackets and spiked helmets they have been dispatched by the mafiacommunistblack muslimjewishnazi conspiracy which secretly controls the white house unloading their portable forge and collapsible steel ring they forge a steel ring around ole miss then in the dark of night a tiny pinkcheeked curlyhaired southern boy looking for his mommy toddles up to the federal commander played by genghis khan the federals immediately open fire with dumdum bullets wiping out the little lad and the entire alpha omega sorority closeups the documentary closes with a moving peroration by general walker played by general walker who says this is not the way to cuba he h not only will this be very believable in mississippi but it shows what a champion senator eastland is of civil_rights you know the whites get the rights and the negroes get to be civil or else by sekou toure objective interpre ck tations are at the root h of one of the prow e found misconceptions that prevent a true understanding of africas problems and the concerns and activities of her peoples for the interpretations made by foreign specialists in african affairs are as a rule based on the conditions of their own social milieu and thus take little account of the specific conditions of the various african societies if the problems of africa are to be understood analyzed and solved we must take into consideration the historical economic social moral and cultural conditions which shape africas particular identity in the worldelements of the african evolution in which total emancipation of the african peoples remains the main objective an attempt to solve specific african problems out of context according to some halfunderstood universal concept neglects the especially important social factors such an approach assumes that science has reached its limits that mankinds present knowledge is absolute and immutable and that in these matters there is nothing further to be expected attempted or desired it implies that human society having reached maturity begins to decline on the contrary everything indicates that it is still full of contradictions and imperfections and that these are the causes of its difficulties its crises and its disequilibrium thus the course of progress far from being limited is infinite in time and space it is absurd to suppose that an american laborer can think and act in the same manner as the president of a great new york bank it is just as absurd to conceive of the african or the african nations acting in terms that are supposed to be universal but actually are only relative depending on particular historical or social conditions there are no simple solutions to human problems nor will there be while vast differences in living conditions keep peoples apart while agricultural and industrial overproduction constitutes a permanent problem in the most highly developed nations and while a tragic lack of consumer goods and equipment remains a serious peril for the peoples of the underdeveloped or undeveloped nations poor peoples underdeveloped nations have needs and demands which are essential to the fulfillment of their hopes and which have nothing in common with those of the highly developed nations and their rich populations it is not strange that all peoples want security and seek to improve their standards of life t for mans universal aspiration is for progress social justice freedom prosperity and peace but each of these aspirations has a particular order of urgency for each people and draws on infinitely varied potentialities and capacities because of their historical past and their present state of underdevelopment asians and africans obviously have more in common with one another than with europeans however it is not from this point of view and with these given facts that we must study the problems posed by the relationships between peoples if we wish to avoid emphasizing the rift in the world and increasing the imbalance which already exists in society these problems it need hardly be emphasized concern all peoples nations and individuals powerful or weak rich or poor hence it is pointless to expect the african farmer with his rudimentary tools his pathetically inadequate productive capacity and his miserable living conditions all of which may be interesting from an exotic point of view but in human terms are tragic to think and act like a factory owner and it is pointless to expect the guinean wageearner whether whitecollar or factory worker to think and act like a general motors employee or like a worker in a metallurgical combine in a socialist country in different social conditions the same words refer to different realities and these differences sometimes are very great but to infer thereby that nations cannot understand each other does not advance the solution of the problem one inch the fact that african crows are black with a white collar does not keep them from being crows any more than the green plumage of africas pigeons keeps them from being pigeons to understand both the language of africa and its true content we must seek to find in its words expressions formulations not the abstract character of a dialectic but the substance and reality of the life they express this life is made up of human imperatives social demands and vital material needs and these become increasingly explicit and urgent as the awareness of the african peoples develops and is able to measure the social injustice that characterizes their human condition the extent of the movement for national liberation which has suddenly brought rebirth to a whole continent and made it part of international life bears witness to the volume and strength of this collective awareness it is not by putting angolan heads on bamboo stakes that the portuguese colonistsor for that matter colonialism in generalwill stem the tide of this growing awareness there would be too many heads to cut off for that actually an important evolution in history is taking place and its consequences direct and indirect will increasingly influence the evolution of world society as a whole indeed the liberation movement will modify the international structure more profoundly than did the two terrible world wars the colonial and semicolonial countries although containing the majority of the worlds population had only geographical existence they appeared on the map of course but their straitjacketed peoples were regarded as unimportant because they were dominated and enslaved by others in appearance they remained mute and motionless but in fact the conviction that a struggle for freedom was necessary was stirring within them today most of these peoples have won back their right to a free and worthy existence the shameful racial segregation rampant in south africa will change nothing on the contrary it sharpens the awareness of the african peoples and strengthens their character it will harden them still more when the inevitable showdown with the afrikaaners with their racist and reactionary views forces the african peoples to face up to this problem steel is tempered by heat will not the same prove true of peoples the more they are restrained and oppressed the more able they become to fulfill their historic destiny the more they are threatened in their liberty their personality their dignity their hopesin their very livesthe more powerfully they arm themselves for the battle to regain and keep their freedom and use their sovereignty in order to satisfy their needs and assure their survival and development thus the struggle for independence whatever the form whatever the means had just one meaning for the african peoples to acquire the first tool to open the way for them to solve their problems as human beings fully conscious of their responsibilities for anyone to imagine that everything is accomplished and that efforts can cease with independence which in any case can still remains to be consolidated in most of the african countries is to close ones eyes to the human evidence to contradict the evolution of history and ignore the existence of poor nations which realize what injustices they have suffered and burn to exploit their hidden potentialities the equilibrium to be thus attained is not one between antagonistic forces so much as a harmonization of the worldwide levels of development for us the element of need prevails over more philosophical and even ideological factors for the human needs of which man is consciously aware and which are part of his very being constitutes the true motive force of history the intensity of this force is a function of the forces which hamper and combat it it is vain then to hope that africa will evolve according to any specific form which might be im posed upon her contrary to her own wishes or understanding she will evolve within her own authentic framework and in accordance with her own personality until her economic conditions lose their particular characteristics and become normal it is futile to talk of protecting africa or to give her alms which will salve the conscience of some blunt temporarily the awareness of others and perpetuate inequalities between peoples by maintaining differences in their living conditions and it is futile to try to trace any one path that africa must follow africa must be left free to follow her own historical path starting from the imperatives of her destiny and taking into account the requirements of a fraternal and united world in other words it is a question of affirming our africanity that is to say our personality without attempting to dress it up in western or eastern costume what must be constructed harmoniously and rapidly is an africa that is authentically african africa has her own needs concepts and customs she does not seek to deck herself out in borrowed clothing that does not fit this destiny while presupposing the total disappearance of colonialism the liquidation of imperialism and the establishment of a society free from privileges also opens new and inspiring perspectives of justice progress and universal peace need we recall that by hold ing onto their present privileges and technical superiority the highly developed nations are depriving themselves of the creative talent and productive capacities of hundreds of millions of people in the underdeveloped nations already the modem worlds scientific capacities can no longer be measured country by country more and more the utilization of recently discovered scientific methods calls for the cooperation of several countries indeed of all countries together in view of this it seems bitterly ironical that progress upon which mankinds greater happiness depends is hampered less by lack of knowledge than by the sealing off by certain selfish peoples of information about their scientific discoveries experiments and achievements as a result of their substituting the will to power for the will to progress human happiness and the interests of nations are deliberately and irrevocably sacrificed paradoxically it is in the name of safeguarding human happiness and the interests of peoples that men choose the perilous path of military power leading perhaps to the end of humanity so far as africa is concerned this situation leads to something that is tangible and easily grasped compared to other continents africa is relatively retarded but to what is this backwardness attributable to some natural inequality between black man and white no for there are black men who by their culture have an intrinsic value superior to that of certain white men hence in so far as individual capacities are concerned there is no such thing as intellectual inequality among men whatever their color or race inequality exists solely in living conditions in the accidents of history that is to say in the political economic and social conditions that have dictated and still dictate the levels of development in different parts of the world this is true of the political situation within a nation in which political considerations have hampered national development as in european countries like spain portugal and greece it is true of the economic and social situation where foreign intervention has resulted in exploitation and social oppression as in any country subjected to direct or indirect foreign rule but does the inequality exist in the realm of intelligence we say categorically no does it exist then in the ethics or social theory of the two groups facing each other again we say no africa is not backward in the moral and spiritual domain in truth the african is keenly aware of the difference between good and evil of justice of liberty of solidarity of the virtues of work and human charity as well as universal peace he has the same sense of his responsibilities as do the inhabitants of europe america asia or oceania he has with some slight variations the same scale of values hence we cannot consider that he is even provisionally backward either morally or spiritually if there is inequality then it can result only from economic conditions far from being an inherent defect it is the consequence of the low level of scientific technological and financial development of our countries and although in these respects africa is backward compared to other continents she must not on that account underestimate her human personality her economic moral and cultural values her spiritual force or the contribution she can make to world civilization in the past decade africa has become well aware of her lag in material things and is eagerly seeking to attain the level of development of the highly industrialized countries when we analyze the ills that have beset the african indeed the whole black race we are obliged to admit at once that economic factors are what have favored slavery the deportation of our populations racial discrimination colonization and today neocolonialism africa has been exploited and oppressed for economic motives her legitimate desire for rehabilitationsocial moral culturalmust be fulfilled by her economic development we of course know that the world today is interdependent and africa which cannot live in isolation does not intend to remain at the margin of this modern world she thinks she is entitled to benefit from the experience of other nations as well as from the fruits of her own efforts in turn she must contribute actively to the creation of a world society in which each nation while retaining its own personality will be considered on an equal footing with the others and will like them take on its proper share of international responsibilities africa has been carved up and divided the evil of colonialism has not consisted just of exploitation and discrimination but of loss of liberty and seizure of sovereignty only when a people proclaims its independence therefore and exercises its sovereignty can it put an end to every form of exploitation by establishing democratic institutions freeing creative initiatives and assuring individual freedom by social progress colonialisms greatest misdeed was to have tried to strip us of our responsibility in conducting our own affairs and convince us that our civilization was nothing less than savagery thus giving us complexes which led to our being branded as irresponsible and lacking in selfconfidence our greatest victory then will not be the one we are winning over colonialism by securing independence but the victory over ourselves by freeing ourselves from the complexes of colonialism proudly expressing africas authentic values and thoroughly identifying ourselves with them thus the african peoples will become fully conscious of their equality with other peoples the colonial powers had assimilated each of their colonies into their own economy the french colonies were an economic branch of the french economy the british colonies were an extension of the economy of great britain between guinea and sierra leone between french guinea and portuguese guinea there exist common traditional bonds of custom history and economy yet no economic relations existed between them for each was a tributary of the colonial powers market exclusively we know that we must rebuild africa to win and proclaim a nations independence but keep its old structures is to plow field but not sow it with grain for a harvest africas political independence is a means which must be used to create and develop the new african economy our continent possesses tremendous reserves of raw materials and they together with its potential sources of power give it excellent conditions for industrialization this is why though it would be unrealistic and irrational to think of associating the african nations with the european common market or any other form of economic monopoly it is to be hoped that an african common market will be organized which eventually can cooperate on a basis of equality and solidarity with other economic zones african unity is no more a goal in itself than was independence it simply is a means of development a force of interafrican cooperation it is indispensable because of the unjust nature of the relationship between the underdeveloped african nations and the economically strong nations the equality of this relationship must be improved in order to overcome the social inequalities and differentiations in the present levels of development throughout the world the highly developed nations have economic relations among themselves either of cooperation or of competition but their relations with the undeveloped nations are those of exploitation of economic domination the direct colonial exploitation of former days is being succeeded by exploitation by international monopolies and this has a tendency to become permanent paradoxically it is the underdeveloped nations exporting raw materials and crude products which contribute an important share of the costs and the social improvements from which workers in the fully developed countries benefit the nature of our economic relations on the world market can be easily illustrated in the matter of customs tariffs for instance let us glance at a few figures in the period to the exchange value of raw materials and crude products in relation to industrial products fell percent although from to this rate had already fallen percent in relation to the market the extent of the decline on the international market is shown by the following statistics immediately after the war the average per capita income in the usa was dollars per annum while in the underdeveloped countries of asia africa and latin america it was dollars fifteen years later the average annual per capita income in the united states was dollars and in the underdeveloped countries barely dollars thus while in the most developed part of the world the average income was ten times larger than that of the underdeveloped countries which represent the vast majority of the world territory and population this difference has now risen to seventeen times since the war the world average per capita production of food has increased by percent but in africa the production per capita has fallen by percent in latin america it has increased by percent in asia by percent and in developed western europe by percent immediately after the second world war the underdeveloped countries participation in world trade exchange was percent however by its share was reduced to percent in to percent and in to percent in the course of the last ten years alone the prices of industrial goods in international trade have increased by percent while the prices of raw materials have fallen by percent in other words the underdeveloped countries exporting raw materials were towards the end of the fifties purchasing one third less industrial goods for a determined quantity of raw materials as compared with ten years earlier in the light of these circumstances it is easy to understand that the economic unity and monetary independence of africa do not signify as has been naively suggested that guinea will be permitted to sell its coffee to the ivory coast its palmkernel to dahomey and its bauxite to ghana it signifies that as africa enters the international market as a producer all steps must be taken to establish a fair relationship in the active forces which dominate international trade replacing the position of dependence to which the underdeveloped nations are subjected now the mere fact that there are cries of alarm about the production of coffee cacao or peanuts while there is silence about the products for which the demand is increasingly active but whose prices remain stable such as diamonds gold oil radioactive ores zinc and copper illustrates the mercantile nature of the economic relations between the highly developed nations and the nations producing raw materials in the total tax on coffee imported into france was per cent of its import value it was per cent in germany and per cent in italy was it really a question of protectionist measures in the case of coffee or of discriminatory taxation it is a fact that in this same period the price of gold was lower on the french market than it was for instance at siguiri in guinea as a result of surtaxes designed to prevent its sale locally actually the difficulties appearing within the european common market with regard to the renewal of association agreements made by certain african nations prove that it is not the form of the economic relations that must be changed but their very nature here as in other realms the interests of the african peoples are one and the awareness of this unity is rapidly becoming more and more explicit the african nations are realizing that in order to solve their urgent social problems they must speed up the transformation of their trade economy and if this is to be done through industrialization it cannot be done within the limits of our national microeconomies but unconditional integration into a multinational market consisting of highly developed and underdeveloped nations negates the possibility of industrial development in advance it could only be the association of horse and rider if they are to complement each other economically the development of all associated nations must be carried out according to their united needs and common interests any concept which imposes implicitly and a priori a particular orientation and framework on the development of the various nations cannot work for it does not bring a radical solution to the nature of the economic relationships involved or to the general problems facing integrated human communities the leaders of the european economic community seem not to be aware of all this at least as far as africa is concerned and make no secret of their desire to achieve a political community of europe which cannot be reconciled with africas desire for political independence africa remains as grimly hostile as ever to the division of africa which began with the congress of berlin in the unity so much desired by all africans will not be achieved around any one man or any one nation but around a concrete program however minimal the rules of the union must favor and reinforce generally accepted concepts equality of all nations large or small fraternal solidarity in their relationships the common use of certain resources and respect for the character and institutions of each state not only must there be no interference in the internal affairs of any state by another but each must help to solve the others problems if we do not rapidly achieve such a framework of solidarity permitting the peaceful evolution of our countries we risk seeing the cold war enter africa and divide the african states into antagonistic forces and blocs jeopardizing their whole future in common the evolution of our countries in peace and harmony requires a high degree of cooperation we have always thought that africa should be considered like the human body when a finger is cut off the whole body suffers the growing awareness that we all share the same future must make us increase our efforts for this cooperation for solidarity and active and conscious african participation in world progress when we speak furthermore of rehabilitating the african man we do not indulge in a racist doctrine but act in accord with a historical and moral imperative we have suffered too much from the malice and scorn of others we must act so that they will respect us in the future and this we shall do by respecting ourselves and honestly and competently exercising our responsibilities it is a problem of human dignity and of conscience some have claimed to see political antagonisms in the formation of various african groupings actu ally these were the first concrete manifestations of unity and were inspired by human and historical necessity skepticism notwithstanding this tendency toward unity will increase political choices which do not correspond to the needs and aspirations of our peoplesand it is important that this be understoodwill inevitably fail as for what face a united africa will wear whatever the choices she makes in her orientation it will not be turned either against the east or against the west it will be above all and essentially directed toward the emancipation and progress of africa and her peoples in our struggle for freedom there is no room for negative choices but only for positive thought and constructive action what will be destroyed or defeated in this struggle are those things that historical necessities human needs and the forces of progress consign to destruction and oblivion to attempt to interpret africas behavior in capitalist or communist terms is to neglect the fundamental fact that africas present condition corresponds neither to the given facts of capitalism nor to those in the building of communism africas way is the way of peaceful revolution in which the morality of an action counts much more than its form and conditions that some believe socialism corresponds best to the aims of the african revolution while others suppose it is preferable despite the lack of national capital to espouse capitalist principlesthese considerations will not in the last analysis prevent our peoples from deciding their own fate it is they who are called on to make the sacrifices and the creative efforts necessary to ensure africas development their awareness is sufficiently keen to enable them to choose the way they want to go in deciding these matters our peoples will take account of the realities of the twentieth century the tremendous possibilities of future human achievement as well as the knowledge experience and discoveries accumulated in the course of past centuries their commitment will correspond to their hope of future benefits it will be one which makes a real contribution to general progress in peace and human happiness african neutralism then is not shameful indifference a sort of political demobilization on the contrary it is the expression of a lively faith in a happy future for mankind it is something active a participating force an active agent in the struggle for the achievement of a world societyemancipated fraternal and united let us hope that the highly developed nations and peoples can understand this historical movement in its universal significance and that they will take full part in it in the conscious desire to help build a free and prosperous africa in a world of peace and brotherhood the south dissents from me some say that i dissent from the south i p but as strange as it sounds i am hardly conscious of dissenting from the south at all it dissents from me im reminded of the old marching song theyre all out of step but jim apparently i march to a drummer they dont hear or hear but fitfully and dimly if i thought they didnt hear him at all i wouldnt be trying to indicate his drumming i think they do hear him however because hes a southern drummer though with universal reverberations at least he seems so to me the music i march to is as southern as the scene beyond my window this late august morning a scene observed first more than sixty years ago the shadows among the pines the sunlight touched with a haze that betokens autumn the deep woods beyond and the steady high singing of cicadas in the trees so southern that it rises from the earth itself and from my heart on my fathers side i belong to the fifth generation of south carolinians on my mothers the sixth my fathers people were from the s i think small farmers my mothers from about plantation owners historically this was the south farm and plantation balanced each other it was this uncertain and changing balance that helped to give the south its character with the marriage of my parents these two forces joined this might not have been significant if they hadnt been typical of their economic and cultural backgrounds w my father was the yeoman farmer on the make aggressive hottempered democratic impatient of the complacent plantation people around him in true jacksonian spirit he used to say every man is as good as every other man and maybe a dern sight better my mother was quiet assured with a warm paternalism appropriate to the plantation too richly endowed to be complacent but from a complacent background too vital to dream of the past but with the past clinging like an aura about her it was her brother who once remarked to an aunt ideals are a sin alice we should love god now it also happened that i inherited almost equally from each of my parents the acquiescence of my mother the aggressiveness of my father these two opposing attitudes have so fused in me that there is no conflict though there is perhaps a tension i am interested in the old and the new in continuity and change i do not expect the form of the future to copy the form of the past this would leave no room for creation i search the past for creative hints my mother and my mothers plantation gave me the sense of order attainment rest and though my fathers driving ambition never let me think that the plantation might be carried into the future unchanged it never blinded me to the kind of thing i sought order attainment rest i move into the future therefore unhampered by the forms of the past but guided by the spirit the past has revealed to me whenever my fathers urgency carries me forward too fast i hear my mothers quiet words now jamieshe was a mcbride and whenever the complacency of her people slows me down i hear my fathers voice all right son lets get on with the job but theres even more than this though my father and mother were of opposing temperaments and backgrounds and the air was sometimes tense between them i never doubted that they loved each other devotedly it was this enveloping love that fused within me the two so opposing parts of my nature creating thus a harmony from what might have been a fatal struggle i have therefore moved through the world seeking primarily the form of love i sought it first in individuals i seek it now more largely in the south and perhaps even in the world the main problem in the south is what is the form of love here what is to be loved here that there is something indeed much i have no doubt for i look backward through my father and my mother and see through and in them the south in spite of all its absurdities the balanced south and it is nonsense to think there is little to be loved here this is one of our great weaknesses we do not love the south enough i know were passionate about it we feel were devoted to it well fight for it at the drop of a hatand drop the hat ourselves but its a defensive love a love expressed too often as distrust and fear of outsiders a love that does not know its object a misdirected ignorant love what is loves true form in the south if we had more to cherish we should have less to attack as for my defending the south im too busy in the spirit of my father trying to bring it nearer to what in the spirit of my mother i feel it is im not trying to reform it i have little interest in such a moral problem im trying to form it to help it find its form for it can be argued that the south has never come into its own never reached maturity never become the great region the devotion of its people should have made it its problem is the aesthetic one to imagine and become what essentially it is this problem the south should be able to face for she was always rather long on mannersand aesthetic interest and short on morals as for the souths failure to attain maturity this is related to the fact that the region began to become conscious of itself in about at the time of the missouri compromise this political event made it clear to the south that it differed from the rest of the country but the awareness came chiefly from a sense of outside hostility a hostility shortly to become tense and vociferous under the leadership of william lloyd garrison the south had no quiet time in which to become selfconscious it really became so only at the moment of its destruction and as the lost cause it is impossible therefore for contemporary southerners to look backward and say that at such and such a time we were what we would like to be of course this is a foolish wish anyhow no individual or people can go back to an earlier day but our contemporary southerner cannot gain from the past even the image of what he once was for he never really was he was always under great pressure becoming until in his adolescence he was destroyed we are still in our adolescence of course from the european point of view all americans are here the south has the great advantage over other american regions she has a history of such tragic depth and varied nature that she stands now upon the very brink of maturity she could grow up overnight she could come to herself and then her deep and swirling emotions would take form then she would know who she is and where she is going she would distrust and hate the world less and love herself more she would find a form conducive to love her true form wherein perhaps would be combined as we shall see the urgency of my father and the peace of my mother i should like to help her do this my mothers people looked backward my fathers forward within twenty feet of where i now sit on the piazza here at rip raps i heard my mothers mother say shortly before she died in that she had never been reconstructed and didnt intend to be one of her sisters a maiden lady was an early teacher of mine there was no u s flag above the schoolhouse but the inner walls of the tiny building were plastered with the various confederate flags and every friday after lunch we sang confederate songs for the most part however the lost cause aroused in me only a faint nostalgia which i still feel back at home however was my father his mother and her brother a graybearded confederate veteran and their eyes were on the present and the future my fathers mother wa still sitting on the piazza at ninetyfour watching the buggies pass along the public road at the far edge of the field waiting for ten oclock and the morning paper my granduncle the old confederate attending the charleston exposition in was so enthralled by all the possible inventions sketched there that he wanted to live twentyfive fifty even a hundred years longerindeed he said hed like to live to see the whole thing wound up what was i to do balanced thus between the past and the future i did what the south more or less has always done i lived in the present of course every child does but i never got over it because of this emersons aphorism when i came upon it hit home life only avails not the having lived because of this at twentyeight i was examining the poetic experience under john erskine and at thirtyeight lecturing to a college group on the poetry of life though i did not know it then this was a basic southern interest the south has had few poets why partly because she was always trying to be poetic life itself living the present moment always appealed w j cash calls this our hedonism time which moved slowly anyhow through the hot summers and the mild winters moved more slowly because men enjoyed looking at what they saw and passing the time together if the south still possesses even for strangers some indefinable magic it is because southerners have cared for it observed it and however inadequately and foolishly loved it in brief have created it it is their poem when therefore i began to study the poetry of life trying to understand how certain moments take form and imprint themselves upon our mind i was only holding up for examination the moments the south had always cherished meanwhile i had been led beyond the poetry of life into its tragedy led again by john erskine who introduced me to unamunos the tragic sense of life led by unamuno who told me what was happening to me but led i am sure not simply as an individual but also as a southerner a romantic desiring the impossible a stoic awaiting the inevitable i remember my fathers saying to me approvingly in the spring of when i was first in love son you make me feel young again youre as big a fool as i was but i also remember him sitting on the front piazza in a may of my boyhood watching the storm beating down the yellow oats and never saying a word still silent he got up and walked indoors but even before this when i was a little boy i had stumbled upon a strange sense of the sadness of life my parents spoke occasionally of someones having lost a child i didnt know what they meant but since if children were to be lost the dark endless woods back of the house would be the place for losing i imagined them there and not frightened but each of them alone the woods starred with lost wandering children was this image some faint premonition against the time when i myself should be lost in the dark woods of the world was i inoculating myself against sadness long before its coming more important than this was i entering life with the pathos of an old defeat enshrined in my grandmother and in the still unfurled confederate banners hanging like a mist about my boyish head however i came to realize the tragedy of life whether simply as an individual or also as a southerner conditioned by southern history i came to realize it and finally to pass in some measure beyond it when my loss accentuated perhaps by my boundless romantic desire became great enough i put off the heavy armor of stoicism i had seen my father wearing admitted at least to myself my own defenselessness and chose to walk naked in the world with this came a kind of compassion both for myself and for every man poor devils all perhaps i became a christian at least as good a christian as i had been a stoic several years before this i had been called by the minister of our presbyterian church a good pagan this was after he had read an essay of mine the religion of a countryman i think he was right for the religion i described there as my own was the religion of a paganus a countryman who was deeply aware of the more than human forces that hung silent or clamorous in the sunlight or the storm but practically unaware of the compassion that according to jesus lies beyond all human expression even in the heart of god but now in my new sense of compassion for myself and for all men i came to feel that compassion was a universal quality now for the first time human hopes hung like bright veils in the air qualifying the sunlight now for the first time i understood a faint premonitory experience i had had as a boy of twelve it was a coldish morning in september the first day of school my brother my mother and i stood on the back piazza looking across the yard through the pines to the barn and the rosy dawn we had drunk a cup of coffee together mother having brewed it for us and she was now sending us out to do the milking as a little boy i had called her mother lady in this september moment there was something oh so faint of the lady in the dawn something of the dawn in the lady now twentysix years later i was sure of it one spirit pervaded them both the god of the fields and the god of the fireside were one therefore when some years later i came back to live in my boyhood community it was now not simply the site of the home wherein i had learned from my father urgency from my mother peace it was also mortised in the granite of the globe with a window looking out upon the universe it was the place where i had first seen and therefore most deeply felt though for a long time not understood the lady in the dawn and the dawn in the lady how could i dissent from all this that would be insanity i should be dissenting from myself my parents the south as i understood it even the universe itself but i do dissent from the south at least from much of the contemporary white southon the race issue perhaps it is clear now since i have listed the things i assent to why i am not disturbed by my dissent from so many white southerners on this issue the trouble is of course that dissent on this issue is for them dissent from the south itself i think they are mistaken though the race issue is related to practically everything in the south it is not the south nor is segregation that tentative solution of the issue our way of life as it has been called i think i have said enough implicitly or explicitly about the south to indicate why i cannot believe this though i am opposed to segregation i did not myself raise the issue im not enough of an idealist for forty years i went along with the custom of the country only occasionally aware of its existence and then with little concern but when timeto be exact the sraised the issue i faced it and decided against segregation why i had decided against it without knowing it a half dozen years before in that tragic moment when having lost as i thought all i became aware that in this tragic situation i was a human being and found myself moved with compassion both for myself and for all other men in that moment only people mattered there was no hint of race when therefore race became an issue for my fellowsoutherners it was not an issue for me i had learned that i was a man a destiny heavy enough without burdening it with the issue of race so far as i was concerned to be rid of segregation which emphasized race would be good riddance why does it not seem good riddance to so many southerners partly because they do not see the south as i see it to them segregation is the core of the south to me its an excrescence which is it regardless of the number of white southerners who believe or think they believethat segregation is the core of the south time and not too much of that will prove it an excrescence for this is the predominant will of the negroes of the nation in a sense of the world its the civil war situation all over again even after every confederate had killed his accepted quota of ten yankees the yankees still came so today the forces against the standpat south are too strong so far as the passing of segregation is concerned it doesnt make much difference whether i assent or dissent but so far as the success of the south is concerned it does make a difference we are going into a future vastly different from our past even if we have to be forced into it but this is little comfort to one who loves the south i should like for us to go with heads up even with banners flying though not the dear confederate banners of my boyish days but in order to do this we must understand ourselves what we are and can become what part therefore we can play in the modern world we must shape ourselves in the form we desire i said earlier that the south with all its passionate regional devotion had never understood itself here are energies not only going to waste but also being used to shackle us to a frozen past we think we believe that segregation is the core of our life i do not think we really believe it we are using words if we could see the south for what it is a region where men have striven greatly endured greatly and yet have managed through it all to keep a sense of human values a sense of personal relationships so lacking in the modern world a sense even of manners in a world gone mad for material gain a sense of humor sometimes playful sometimes wryif we could see our tragic history whites and negroes involved together in more than two centuries of defeat partly selfinflicted partly inflicted by the world then we should come to realize that we have resources here valuable to both the nation and the world and that segregation is not one of them i dissent from this narrow limited view of the south i assent with all my heart to the south that my life here has revealed to me the incomparably rich south i have just suggested we have been haunted by a past lost beyond recalling but lingering still on the far hills of memory when we turn to the present especially if it be summer romantic sentimentalists still we fill the landscape with beauty queens a dime a dozen without ever realizing what were doing a womans beauty is a stormtossed banner it was yeats who said itand under it wisdom stands there is wisdom in the broad slumberous landscape of the south wisdom in the feeling we have for manners the way you do things the way you hold your mouthwisdom in the appearance and the carriage of men and women there was a touch of splendor in the old south though we paid too much for it perhaps some of it remains we are moving now into a world where we could have it without penalizing anybody have we forgotten the quality these are random suggestions poured out pellmell the point of it all is my belief that most of us even though intending the best are false to ourselves false to our history false to the great possibilities that lie around us defending segregation as our way of our life we sell the south short have we lived here three hundred years to accomplish only this i dont believe it can the south be persuaded to accept such an integration i dont know would i have come to it myself if life hadnt pulled me up and made me consider however much i was prepared both individually and by my upbringing as a southerner to receive this interpretation i came to it out of my own tragic experience through that experience i learned the power that lies in failure understood and accepted but by that experience i was prepared to recognize the enormous resources that have accumulated in the south through centuries of frustration and defeat can we understand the potential power that lies at hand for a defeated people unless we ourselves have been defeated again i dont know but then we have all been defeated in greater or less degree and we still face the sunrise this is one of faulkners themes endurance this the south has the white south and the colored south the south theres a classic story about one of jacksons famous footcavalrymen in which endurance and wry humor are incomparably mixed the general riding back along the column came upon a soldier too old to fight nearly gone but still slogging well soldier said the general i hope youll make out yes general yes ill make it but generali hopes to god i never loves another country committed to a cause ruined in its service he could still smile at his own devotion i am not ready to believe that the region that produced a soldier like thatand he was one of many cannot produce the men to lead us proudly into the modern world
by isabelle rivierez with louis e lomax i am the child of a mixed marriage and i will never forget it even if i tried the peoples of the worldboth white and negro would not let me my father hector rivierez is a lightskinned negro from french guiana in south america my mother born violette barbaut is a blueeyed blonde from france the contour of my face and the texture of my olive skin show that i am a negro and the child of a mixed marriage hardly a day passes that somebody doesnt ask me what its like being halfwhite and halfblack quite candidly it is no picnic in paris where i grew up fathers brown skin and mothers blue eyes seemed as natural to me as the sun and the moon like the eiffel tower where i played the champ de mars park where mother and i strolled they were fixtures of my childhood world it never occurred to me that our family was odd i knew that i was darker than mother lighter than father and not exactly the same color as the other children on my block i knew i was different but if your father is negro your mother white and you are three years old being different is the most natural thing in the world little do you suspect that one day this difference will cause you pain i was born on december six months after the germans occupied paris but our home along the avenue de la bourdonnais was a warm and secure place fathers law office was located in our sevenroom apartment thus he and mother were always home and their presence sheltered me i saw no difference between the blacks and the whites jews and gentiles who were fathers clients then one day one of fathers clients a jew came to our home crying his entire family had been wiped out in a nazi concentration camp only he had escaped as i listened to his tragic story i realized for the first time that being different could mean trouble even so the coals of racism had not seared me that was to come later we spent our summers at our country home about miles from paris all of the villagers were white but we had no problems i remember joining with the children of the village as they lined the road to welcome the american troops negro and white en route to liberate paris from the nazis we felt all was well with the world needless to say we were wrong at least i was two years later at the age of six i realized how wrong i was it happened during my first days in school the children gathered around me nigger some of them shouted gypsy others taunted i did not know what either word meant i only knew that i was being called something bad i got mad i fought with my tormentors they fought back when they realized that namecalling angered me the incidents increased when i asked my father what these names meant and why my fellow students attacked me he explained as clearly as he could still trying to shield me from the raw side of life you must not fight father told me you must learn to be proud that you are colored but mother is not colored she is white should she be proud also yes father said you and i should be proud that we are colored mother should be proud that she is white that is the way god made us some roses are red others white but they are all roses and they all smell sweet the same is true of men the color of their skins has nothing to do with the quality of their hearts minds and souls i was colored and i was colored in a world where color may not basically matter but where men make it matter this is the first shock a child of mixed parentage experiences despite the fact that she is halfwhite and halfcolored she can never be white some children of mixed marriages pass for white hiding their negro heritage in order to escape the pain of discrimination this i could never do i am not ashamed of my color and while still at my fathers knee resolved never to hide it i learned to ignore my fellow students when they called me names once they realized they could no longer hurt me the namecalling stopped yet despite my outward calm the race question had become a vital part of my inner life i wanted to know more about my father and mother i realized that theirs was not just another marriage mother felt my concern and through a se ries of long talks i came to know the story of their love and marriage father had come to paris to study law mother was also a student there they met and fell in love it was not easy for them mother explained to me their parents objected to the marriage each family wanted its child to marry within his own race they were warned that society would ostracize them even their friends reminded them that their children would be born into the no mans land of being neither black nor white nevertheless they were married love knows no barriers mother told me i would not let the prejudices of others rob me of lifes sweetest experience there were other negroes in paris but they were not torn by the conflicts that wracked me they were as aware of being negro as i was but they had come by that awareness via a different perhaps more natural route i felt i was a negro by force not by birth that i had been made negro by an arbitrary ruling that only children of two white parents can be white i soon became bitter and difficult to get along with by the time i reached secondary school i had become a problem student i was not the only colored student in the school but i was the only nonwhite in my class one afternoon i could bear it no longer i was sitting along the back row in my sewing class i hated the teacher and i resented the gulf between her and me shattering the silence of the room i sang at the top of my voice this place is full of filth only i didnt say filth it is boring and i want to go home the teacher almost fainted then her shrill voice rang out isabelle and silence returned to the room as i was sent to the principals office and expelled from school that was not an easy day for my father who by then had been named to a high french government post in ubanguishari now the central african republic we talked alone perhaps more alone than we had ever talked before it was more than a father talking to his daughter it was a negro father talking to his negro daughter isabelle he said part of being negro is that you cannot afford the luxury of misbehavior people expect you to misbehave you start out with the odds against you you are constantly in the process of proving yourself following this incident my parnegro i had been to africa i had seen black men i sympathized with and fought for their cause i felt colored yet i had not found a sense of true identity there like nonwhites everywhere i was thrilled by the african freedom explosion which has given a deep feeling of pride to the colored race myself included yet i could not think of myself as african somehow there is a cultural gap between the africans and me i needed to find people of my own color who read the books i read love the music i love and who generally accept the same spiritual values that i accept if i could not find such a feeling of brotherhood with the africans where would i find it in the summer of my parents and i visited fathers home in french guiana there i felt the chilly correctness with which many people of this negro country received my mother and for the first time i realized too that the sword of racism has at least two edges now that i look back upon it i am glad that i saw racism in reverse it saved me from more bitterness perhaps even hatred for the nonblacks of the world after father returned to paris mother and i went to america in miami beach florida we lived in the best hotelswithout incident then we went to new orleans that did it patrons dropped their food on the floor as we walked into the hotel restaurant fortunately we had not made reservations there we were simply passing through and had arranged to check our bags while we went sightseeing we traveled from louisiana to new york overland partly by bus at long last i saw the raw segregation and discrimination i had read about on one occasion i sat in a seat directly behind the bus driver he eyed me cautiously sizing up my light olive skin and long silk black hair finally he mustered enough courage to ask are you white or colored his manner and speech were polite obviously he wanted me to laugh it off by saying i had a deep suntan i am a french citizen i replied but i am a negro then i remained in my seat i have never ridden with a more confused and shaken bus driver but i saw more than segregation i saw the american negro i began to read every negro newspaper and magazine i could find a detailed account of the sitin demonstrations filled me with more selfpride and race pride than i had ever felt before i heard jazz not for the first time but in its native setting and i felt a response that could never express itself in france these are my people in spirit mind and purpose i have found a sense of identity when mother flew back to paris i remained in new york as secretary to one of the african delegations to the united nations strangely it was not until i began to move among american negroes that i fully realized what it means to be the child of an interracial marriage being the child of a mixed marriage is more than just being negro luckily i am now a grown woman i can make my own way and the fear of rejection by negroes as well as whites does not haunt me i know many children of american mixed marriagesand their experiences have not been pleasant would i marry a white man yes if i fell in love with one if i married a white man however i would not live in the united states not that the race problem would concern me but i honestly feel it would cripple my child forever american negroes are on the rise their own desegregation victories and the african revolutions make them increasingly proud of being negro for the most part however they are not yet ready to accept interracial marriage needless to say the masses of american whites are not ready to accept it either i have dated both negro and white men in new york i look upon them as individuals rather than as racial types yet when i think of marriage i think of children i know children of mixed marriages will have a difficult time regardless of where their parents live yet interracial marriage will not only continue it will increase mother was right love knows no boundaries and from the union of these brave lovers will come a generation of children that may well cure the racial pains that so contort our era wrestling rings down the color curtain what jackie robinson vottydid for racial integraa vv jftion baseball a big vs dyearold negro wrestj er namecj bearcat wright has done for wrestling bearcat who lives in new yorks harlem and has become the hottest negro wrestler in the past year had to pull a spectacular stunt in the middle of before the authorities of wrestling in gary in diana recognized that he meant what he said he was tired of being allowed to only wrestle with other negroes in segregated cities one night they had a sellout because they had previously announced that i was to wrestle a topflight opponent he recalls i was scheduled to be against a white man but when i arrived i found they had another negro for me i won the match but i felt let down i was back there the following week again once more supposed to wrestle a top contender again they gave me a negro thats when i decided something had to be done i made a little speech to the crowd in the arena i told them i would not appear anywhere again that i was not allowed to have mixed matches mainly because there was only a handful of negro wrestlers bearcat also feltjustlythat since until that time the negroes in wrestling consisted mainly of his own buddies it would not be an honest match as far as he was concerned as he could certainly not try very hard to knock the block off one of his own pals after my speech i got a letter saying i was suspended from wrestling in that area at the same time the naacp informed me that a committee had been formed asking that area to open up mixed matches surprisingly enough there was no real problem my suspension was lifted and slowly mixed wrestling has been opening up everywhere that it wasnt permitted before and negro audiences have been increasing too bearcat doesnt say it but it is known that he might not have had as easy a time convincing promoters of his stand if it had not been for the groundwork that another wrestlerwhitehad done in delighting negro audiences the great antonino rocca uncrowned leader of all wrestlers has long proven that negro audiences will pay money to see someone they like and after the many recordsmashing gates they have helped to swell for rocca since a number of spanishspeaking afficionados of wrestling in the east are negroes it was easy for them to include bearcat in their attention as well rocca has insisted for a long while that good wrestlers like bearcat and his tagteam partner sweet daddy siki are an added attraction to wrestling in mixed matches just before this article was written a longtime dream of bearcats came true he was signed up for a title match with international wrestling champion buddy nature boy rogers whereas rocca sticks strictly to the rules never starting a match before the bell rings rogers is a villain in every sense of the word knowing this wright has long had a chip on his fists from seeing rogers dirty tricks knowing that the socalled champ goes all out to hurt anyone and everyone who stands in his way in the ring whether it might mean breaking legs arms necks hearts or rules on the occasion of this title match while the two opponents were waiting for the event to start a roar of the crowd warned wright that rogers was creeping illegally up on him with mayhem intent not waiting for his own wrath to subside bearcat grabbed rogers arm twisted it and rammed the elbow into a metal part of the ring the elbows ligaments nerves and tendons were so badly injured that even after an operation it was not known how long it would be before rogers could get into action again one thing is certain the fans all raceswill demand a return meeting of the two and the promoters will be assured of the usual full house for this grudge match the name bearcat is not manufactured at least not by its wearer he was born in omaha nebraska the son and grandson of a prizefighter bearcats father also named bearcat as was his father before himfought five champions primo camera jack dempsey jack johnson max baer and mickey walker the mickey walker bout was to decide a dispute as to whether a good little fighter could beat a good big one walker proved he could although the younger wright was christened and he hates admitting this edward michael wright he now pays his income tax as bearcat so we guess thats his official moniker young bearcat had professional boxing matches undefeated he was when he started and the promoter arranged to give him a week training expenses whenever he did have a fight they would deduct the with the result that he would wind up still in the red after a while he found himself in great condition always a winner but a wreck financially one day the promoter asked if he knew anything about wrestling he admitted that he had wrestled some in school and was thereupon invited to work out in the gym with some wrestlers finally the promoter got him a few bookings in the hope that he would make enough money to be satisfied with his boxing matches but the hope boomeranged the first wrestling match i had i got for myself bearcat remembers nobody to cut in no one to pay no training expenses do you blame me for ditching boxing for fulltime wrestling although he has done well as a single the fans like to see what are called tagteam matches in which two men on one side alternate when tagged by each other with wrestling one of two men on the other side for the past two years bearcat has been partnered with sweet daddy siki who rates nearly as highly with the fans as bearcat does he is even on the big wrestling calendar for that is sold by the capitol wrestling arena which is top rating in any wrestlers language i got my ring name in an odd way sweet daddy remembers in i was in montreal canada the second time i was there a girl in the audience kept shouting sweet daddy sweet daddy the next week i found she had spotted her friends throughout the audience shouting the same thing a few nights later i got into the ring and was turned around looking at the crowd when i heard the announcer say in this corner weighing pounds sweet daddy siki he was stunned but he liked it and has used it ever since his real first name now dont scream is reggie since bearcat and sweet daddy teamed up even when theyre singles promoters try to have them on the same card youll find this happening very frequently that the same two wrestlers will travel together and appear on the same card usually one is the wrestler responsible for making travel and hotel arrangements and getting both of them to the arena on time a kind of buddy arrangement that pays off in fewer disappointments and nonappearances for the promoter bearcat and sweet daddy are unique in their styles of wrestling both of them like to butt their opponents on the head with their own heads in addition to which bearcat has a shouldershuffling and musclelimbering routine that is comic to watch but effective as a stumper for an opponent trying to grab him bearcat says he is a member of a group of people descended from africans who are built much like himself they are all very lean very tall he is weighs and quite agile one sports writer put it that bearcat has the strength of a bear and the agility of a cat which certainly fits in with his name when asked if wrestling is phony bearcat and sweet daddy have different answers to prove it isnt if its so phony how come professional football playerswho only make tops a year and certainly have the build how come they dont give up that pennyante stuff and join us asks sweet daddy because they know darned well its a rough tough business wrestling is and no holds pulled i get sick and tired of having people say wrestlings a fake bearcat growls youve certainly seen plenty of football games did you ever call them fake just because a halfdozen of those big linemen who weigh nearly pounds each jump on a small guy carrying the ball and a few minutes later he gets up seldom the worse for wear and makes a touchdown nobody ever calls that suspicious so why do they say anything is wrong with wrestling we get hurtas you know but we dont publicize it we do that so the public wont be afraid to come to our matches so they wont be afraid of the gore seldom are we damaged to the point of bleeding since we are supposed to use only the flat of the palm to strike the face but the twistings the dropkicks the backbreakers the stepovertoeholds all of these can inflict bad damage and often do if you get a wrestler who just wants to win and doesnt care how he does it people forget when they say we pull punches that wrestlers perspire did you ever try to hold on to a slimy wet smooth surface a blow can slide off that way too but the occasional ringsider who is looking to find something wrong will say phonyfake they should be as honest as we are thats all i can say although bearcat and sweet daddy are still comparatively new to the big money they arent complaining in wrestling you start in the small time hitting the small circuits with the smaller arenas and you receive only a percentage of the gate the more your following grows the bigger the gate the bigger your cut when bearcat had his first match with buddy rogers at comiskey park chicago in it was a gatethe first one at that price for rogers either to date however nobody has beaten antonino roccas many gateswelling matches but theyre all trying so far has been bearcats best year financially when he made about for he expects it to be about less because he couldnt refuse the demand for him to return to some of the smaller arenas where he made his start sweet daddys take in was and this year he expects it to be about the same bearcat and sweet daddy wrestle five and six nights a week and travel so much they might be on the west coast one night in chicago another night or canada or florida what they really like is music but what a difference in tastes bearcat likes jazz and classics sweet daddy goes for rock and roll calypso pops and some jazz in fact he has a record of his own out that he sings rock and roll shimmy shimmy partner bearcat is quite a food addict too he has a set of gourmet cook books and loves to fuss around the stove as well as to eat but he refuses to eat anything fattening he likes good lean meat but fancies vegetables so much that at this writing he is seriously thinking of becoming a vegetarian he also studies yoga they no longer have time for gymnastics sweet daddy eats anything as long as it is food he admits they never eat after two in the afternoon on the day of a match and they never eat before going to sleep saying its the worst thing in the world to do for a hobby other than music bearcat has some pacing horses race horses in a sulky he owns some in batavia new york with a little farm there and hopes eventually to take off wrestling during a racing season so he can race his own horses sweet daddy goes in for fancy cars he had a sl mercedes benz grey but bearcat made him get rid of it because it only seats two one night they had a friend along and no place to put her so bearcat had to ride in the trunk that was that now sweet daddy has a caddie convertible so bearcats head doesnt hit the roof sweet daddy also has a runabout an isetta with the opening in the front in bearcat picked up a new hobby all his life he had wanted to fly an airplane when he left the new york area a year ago he decided here is my chance and bought himself a place singleengine cessna and learned to fly it afterwards he occasionally takes it for a short hop to another town but refuses to solo at night sweet daddy just refuses to fly anything but a jet or wont even go jet if he can go on train within a reasonable time bearcat and sweet daddy think a wrestlers life is the only life for them they point out that all matches end in the ring as they dont believe in wasting their energies fighting without pay anywhere else bearcat also asks people to consider the difference between boxers and wrestlers have you ever wondered about the fact that boxers go around having a high old time for weeks or months between bouts then take a scant five or six weeks to get in trim while wrestlers have so many matches so many nights a week that theyre forced to keep in condition all the time does that sound like trickery if its the kind of sport where youre told what to do why bother keeping in condition bearcats other favorite subject is prejudice talking about that understand there is prejudice everywhere in the world i am not speaking as a minority member i am speaking as a world viewer i see one race hating another one religion talking against another i dont see any reasonoutside the ringfor hating anyone in fact they opened up a new way of living for my people when they opened credit myself if theres anything im not its prejudiced when i see people i dont see colors or denominationsi only see humans wrestling has become a new way of life to many negroes who are also becoming stars in the field tagging behind bearcat and sweet daddy in the listings of top negro wrestlers and the areas they work out of are bobo brazil who works out of indianapolis and is one of the best sailor art thomas who has become quite popular in the east luther lenzie who usually stays around oregon and california dory dixon who is from jamaica but works out of texas shag thomas also out of texas and rick waldo who usually stays in the foreign areas such as australia japan new zealand and sao paulo sweet daddy originally came from jamaica too but lived so long in los angeles that hes practically forgotten his beginnings one thing that no negro in wrestling can overlook when people forget the color of their skins the only other color they can see is the greenbacks that come in the gates of the arenas where they appear the bugle blows for good jelly the other day the local hr ce raided a negro arbecue and beer joint nd arrested nine peo wiirwpje raj j anj arrests came as something of a shock to the owner i dont know lt why theyre bothering me said henry good jelly jones restaurateur bootlegger and politician it aint election time but bother him they did and because good jelly or just jelly to his friends is something of a local celebrity these days there was a sizable press section on hand for his trial the reporters were not disappointed good jellys wife when asked whether a gallon jug was the same jug found during the raid answered i dont know jugs dont have no names later the white prosecuting attorney asked her why she found it so easy to answer defense questions and so hard to understand his mr city attorney said robert lilliard her negro attorney shes a little confused by all your highclass words you just talk like we talk down at good jellys and well be all right highclass words snorted the city attorney whats so highclass about the words white corn the case came out as everyone knew it would the charges against good jelly and his friends were dismissed for if good jelly has a striking ability to get into trouble he has an even more remarkable ability to get out of it fifteen times he has been called before the bar of justice in recent years fourteen times he has been set free the explanation of this enviable batting average lies deep in the structure of southern politics the negros role in it and the specific power structure of nashville henry jones with his golfers cap big flashing smile and long police record is a power he is among the last of the ward heelers very simply he controls the votes of a large number of unbelievably poor people and for a minimum of service protection and financial reward he delivers these same votes without the slightest concern for ideology in nashville he is the negro whom many negroes like least to think about he is the negro whom many whites like most to think about in his own blunt word he is a nigger what is worse that is all he wants to be respectable negro society shuns him yet to some of the negro poor he is perhaps the only truly big man in their lives good jelly first became interested in politics at an early age because he was an uneducated negro there were distinct limitations to the ambitions he might reasonably entertain and yet many people who govern his city and who dedicate schools and other buildings in the highest of ideals are perfectly willing to deal with him call him a backdoor negro said one white leader they wont have their picture taken with him and they wont pose with him even at negro functions but they know how to get hold of him when a white man once complained about jellys police record and about his bootlegging and the fact that he has many friends among politicians a negro answered thats the way you people really want him it is hardly surprising then that the complexities of playing the system at both ends have produced two jellies they are separate but equal jellies there is a jelly for whites and a jelly for negroes the whites jelly is an ingratiating uncle tom laughing smiling hiding from any slightly serious question or threat behind the big smile and a joke in which old jelly is always the butt the negroes jelly is something different he is kind he has clothed many of his people housed more and fed them all if he calls one and gives him the key to the big black cadillac and says its time to move the caddy the man is honored by the assignment if he calls eight of them together and says that the newspaper wants their picture and that he jelly approves of the idea then a picture of eight smiling faces is taken if he tells them to vote this way or that they vote this way or that i carry a lot of weight around here jelly admits bout half the people in this precinct i control two hundred three hundred people theyre my people good jelly is a dark stocky man of about fifty whose use of minstrelshow techniques in front of whites is a legitimate heritage as a young man he left his nashville home and joined the cast of the mandy green from new orleans minstrel show the poor mans version of the famous silas green show for mandy green he traveled the south as what he calls one of those blackface comedians and i was pretty good then he returned to nashville where he became associated with the then ruling negro ward heeler pie hardison i was pies chauffeur he thought i was a pretty good fellow and i was a good driver and a good talker and so he got me into politics one time pie said i ought to be in there pitching for the mayor and i said if you want the mayor then im pitching one hundred per cent and so i got him the votes pie hardison is gone now and his heir does his pitching from a small hut off a dark alley deep in the negro slums in a small halfmasonry halfwooden cafe he cooks bootlegs and politicks there is one small sign over the doorit is upside downand it says best jelly says this is not the name of the cafe that the name is jones barbecue it is a small cafe and there are no menus only signs on the walls at one end of the cafe white beans cost twentyfive cents at the other they cost twentyone cents there with regular violations of local whiskey laws we have some whiskey but we dont have no beer we have to send out for the beer he operates his machine the restaurant is essential to his success as a politician for good jellys machine has been described by one reporter as the lame the sick the poor and a few of the penniless good jelly himself says down in this part folks dont have but a little money and so they come over here when they have a little and we feed them and they come over here when they dont have any money and we still feed them i dont turn them down i always feed them and i get them a place to sleep most times right here and get them to a hospital and even a job sometimes they get what i got these folks and they dont forget if the voters dont forget neither does good jelly he keeps a thorough file on each of his debtors name favors granted addressor frequently the address of someone who will know where to find the debtor before election day good jelly will make sure all his friends are registered he will also send out cards reminding them of their civic responsibility come election day and good jelly takes out his big cadillac and herds his people to the polls he likes to start early it gives him more time later in the day for rounding up slackers ill tell you why good jelly has got so many friends said robert lilliard the negro attorney who is also a city councilman a lot of these politicians just like him you can really count on jelly if hes for you why you can check his precinct the next day and his votes will be there if you treated him right good jelly himself says that he asks little for his interest in politics im for any man thats a good man he is fond of saying how does he tell whos a good man i read about this man see and i can tell if hes for me i want to know all the issues is that all what issues a lot of these men they want to be politicians and so they come and see jelly and i see how friendly they are and theyre pretty friendly theyre good men we talk about these issues all of these issues he repeated emphatically im for any man thats a good man other interpretations of good jellys political motivations have been offered from time to time id say he gets an average of about for an election one white politician told me it depends on a close local election with a lot at stake i expect hes gotten or more maybe a thousand how much money did you get for the sheriffs race i asked him pointblank money money i wouldnt do none of that he said the man he come down here and he was a good man and he said how he wanted to do right it is not without a touch of regret that many white politicians worried by the new power of the sitin leaders and the young negro ministers foresee the demise of good jelly and his kind you make the deal with jelly one politician said and thats it you dont have to worry about him coming downtown with a bunch of his damn people and sitting down at some nice restaurant or calling the damn newspapers and announcing hes going to picket some company for better jobs jellys all right take care of him on the drunk and disorderly and that kind of thing and thats it he comes through i asked we take care of him and he takes care of us the man answered it was of course inevitable given a oneparty electorate in which factions outweigh issues in local elections that more than one faction would sooner or later make demands on good jellys talents thus for the past two years he has been caught right in the middle of the factional fight between the forces of the mayor and the forces of the city judge who might one day like to run for mayor in the past good jelly usually swung with the judge but as a student of local politics you never know who will be your next ally and similarly your next enemy he steadfastly refuses to burn his bridges i been a deeply strong supporter of the mayor im not mad at him he knows ol good jelly similarly as a student of the science of local law enforcement good jelly is hesitant about turning on the police the police he says they see im a pretty good fella and like im trying to do the right thing and theyre all right i like the police a showdown between the two factions came during last years election for sheriff the mayors forces favored the incumbent the other forces including the city judge favored his opponent police and sheriffs deputies swarmed over good jellys cafe all week long several times jelly was threatened with arrest he placed signs for the incumbent in his cafe but the policemen couldnt watch everywhere while they sat and talked with good jelly in the front of the cafe mrs good jelly slipped out the back and voted the jelly machine for the opponent who carried that precinct five to one jellys lack of concern about civil_rights galls many young negroes in nashville if john kasper were running against thurgood marshall and it was a local race and the right people went to see jelly for kasper thats all it would take said one negro bitterly jelly himself has said my folks theyre not the integration type theyre not interested in all that all they want is a little food attorney robert lilliard has explained jellys continuing popularity in just about the same terms those folks they arent going to eat at woolworths or grants or anything like that but they got to eat jellys the only thing those people have and he looks mighty good to them but even lilliard concedes that sooner or later other political leaders will supplant good jelly jones and his kind among the negroes you take this city growing all the time and the city limits going out and the negro making a little more money all the timea thing like jelly got its getting to be less and less important all the time five ten years from now there probably wont be any good jelly pretty soon both sides too busy worrying about this middleclass vote to pay for jelly thats where the next battle will be a girl with guts ive told noisy night club patrons to shut the heck up nina simone readily admits and there have been times when i walked off the stage in the middle of a concert because the audience was discourteous the sensational songstress who is a bundle of talentand of temper and temperament say her criticshas long conducted a personal vendetta against boisterous night club and concert customers this earned her the dubious honor of being the bad girl of show business but ninas unorthodox crusade ultimately paid off today she can look back on the days when my conduct wasnt too hot with a wry sense of humor it got to the point she smiles where people would come out just to see what id do next then early last spring something occurred that forced her detractors to revamp their uncomplimentary estimates of her onstage conduct two performers one a young pop singer the other an opera starwere involved in widely separated incidents that made headlines and proved to nina that she was not fighting a lonely battle the historic event was headlined in variety the bible of show business patronperformer tensions anew as mathis nina simone walk out the article noted that performers are demanding more respect from audiences and will take active steps to get it on march th backed by a trio of musicians nina opened at the roundtable a club on manhattans swanky east side when the group appeared on stage the patrons were busy dining as the first number was announced the clatter of dishes the clink of glasses the laughter and chatter barely halted then the noise continued unabated nina gave the downbeat and began to play but she did not sing for the second number she again played an instrumental and for the third and fourth between numbers nina resorted to her own personal method of heckling the hecklers she tossed acid comments at the audience she sang snatches of her hit song porgy changing the lyrics to chide the noisy audience for two more nights this continued then by mutual agreement between nina and the club management the twoweek engagement was cut short looking back on the incident nina feels she handled that particular audience with kid gloves there was a time she says when i would have walked out without saying a word what made this incident memorable was the fact that on the very same night down in san juan puerto rico johnny mathis stalked off the stage of the club tropicoro rattled by uncalled for remarks from the audience johnny performed for a scant fifteen minutes before turning his back on the hecklers and cancelling his twoweek engagement it so happened that a few days later in hopkinsville ky opera star rise stevens was forced to interrupt her concert to shush a couple of giggling schoolgirls there were also a number of persons in the audience who were listening to a local basketball game over transistor radios to some show business veterans these events were proof positive that todays entertainers are no respecters of the timehonored tradition the show must go on but to nina they were vindication of the long lonely and so often unappreciated fight she was conducting but she disclaims credit for being the originator of this technique for squelching hecklers i dont know who should get credit for being first to insist that performers are not just court jesters but are due some respect for years charlie mingus was called all sorts of names was accused of being hateful and of always pitching one but all he wanted was to be heard miles davis thelonious monk and several others have reputations for not hesitating to make clear their contempt for unruly audiences nina simones deepfelt desire to be heard with the respect due an artist goes back to her childhood in tryon n c where she was born eunice waymon some years ago her mother was an ordained methodist minister and it was at the local church where she conducted services that ninas musical genius first received public acclaim at the age of four the tiny prodigy was picking out tunes on the piano and at seven she became organist of her mothers church as well as a member of the choir i studied classical music for fourteen years nina explains and i was taught at an early age to respect an artist in any field when someone is rehearsing there must be no interruption at a concert hall one must be neatly dressed and observe proper decorum i grew up assuming that anyone acquainted with the social graces would be aware of these basic elements of good conduct thats why i could never get over the shock of coming face to face with badly behaved audiences my idols were marian anderson alexander boleslawski and horowitz one would never think of being rude when one of these artists is performing and while all entertainers may not be considered artists they should be accorded the same respect this insists nina simone is the reason behind her oftcriticized onstage conduct thats all i ever wantedrespect i would actually feel degraded each time i had to scold an audience i didnt get a kick out of it no matter what people say with a rueful smile nina admits sometimes i got results other than what i wanted but gradually audiences began to catch on once at roberts show lounge in chicago i told off a noisy couple in the audience then the next time they created a disturbance i did only threetnumbersbut in such a way that the rest of the audience got the message i was angry i walked off without saying a word well utter confusion followed then i heard applause and people calling for me to come back when i did i didnt say a word just picked up where id left off even more graphic proof that her unique method of handling hecklers had the backing of a growing number of persons came last summer at the huge jazz festival at madison square garden sponsored by the new york daily news by this time nina recalls i had a reputation for being too demanding too outstanding hard to get along with when i went on stage and began someone yelled down from the balcony it was a smart remark something about not being able to hear me oddly i didnt get angry or upset i just said into the microphone you up there in the darkcome out in the light and repeat that well that broke the audience up they were immediately on my side for once i got more positive than negative reaction to what i was trying to do the next day in the daily news there was an article praising me nina admits that although conditions are better now and the public has rallied to her cause she previously was put on the carpet by club owners columnists even close associates but as she shrewdly observes everybody loves a winner nina is accustomed to fighting against odds she has had only one hit in the popular sense recordi loves you porgy for colpixbecause she refuses to compromise her art and go commercial ive lost money because of my stand but i cant help it interestingly enough nina simones earning potential has skyrocketed although her work schedule is greatly curtailed a polio scare early in brought the sharp realization that there was more to life than making money fortunately ninas ailment was later diagnosed as something other than polio but during her brief hospitalization she had time to think to reexamine her values even though she can command fees of a week for as often and as long as she cares to work nina decided to work only two weeks out of a month appearing only in night clubs of her choosing making records and filling concert engagements she lives a comfortable relaxed existence in her large apartment floors above central park west overlooking central park and at this point in her career is very pleased with the way i feel inside she has her eye on a future career in films and with good reason currently featured in columbia pictures notorious landlady starring kim novak and jack lemmon nina was highly impressed by the fact that for three minutes work in the picture she was paid as much as she would earn in a week in some other medium although she insists that her recently won battle against night club hecklers was on behalf of all performers and had nothing to do with the race question nina has some very definite ideas about the stirrings of national pride in africa asia and in this country as well my only regret she says is that there arent more negro artists more negroes in all fieldswho have the courage to stand up and speak out on this race issuethe things they dont like the things they do like we need more such as those kids in the south thank god for them the failure of the negro intellectual during the past forty years the relations of negroes to american society have undermsrvrvsm gone funj amental changes the tempo of these changes has been accelerated during the past two decades the changes in the relationships of negroes to american society have been the result of changes in the economic and social organization of american life which have in turn had their repercussions upon the negro community and its institutions as a result of the changes in the character of the negro community all the platitudes and cliches about negroes and race relations have lost their meaning and relevance the changes in the negro community and american society have reached a stage where we are beginning to see in rather clear outlines the real problem of negroes in american society there can be no question at the present time that the negro must be integrated into the american community but the integration of the negro into the economic and social organization of american life is only an initial stage in the solution of some of the problems of the negro there still remains the problem of the assimilation of the negro which is a more important and more fundamental problem it is with this second problem that i am primarily concerned but in order to clarify the issue it will be necessary to make clear the distinction between integration and assimilation it is relevant at this point to say something concerning integration and the negro community in the generally accepted meaning of the term integration involves the acceptance of negroes as individuals into the economic and social organization of american life this would imply the gradual dissolution of the negro community that is the decline and eventual disappearance of the associations institutions and other forms of associated life in what constitutes the negro community we do not expect anything approaching this to occur in our life time moreover any discerning person will be aware of the fact that certain aspects of the organized aspects of negro community life will be affected sooner and more fundamentally than other aspects for example negroes have always been forced to depend upon the ecomonic institutions in the american community for employment and a living despite the vain hopes that negroes have had concerning negro business as a means to economic salvation and independence the integration of negroes into the industry and as white collar workers into the manufacturing and commercial institutions of the country has increased the economic welfare of negroes and provided them with more business experience than all the socalled negro business enterprises in the country on the other hand there are certain cultural institutions such as the church and the fraternal organizations that will not dissolve or disappear however it has already appeared that in those sections of the country where newspapers carry news about negroes as normal human beings and negro reporters are employed the circulation of negro newspapers is declining i mention these facts concerning the negro community because it is necessary to emphasize the fact that integration involves more than individuals but the organized life of the negro community visavis the organized white community how does integration differ from assimilation assimilation involves of course integration for it is difficult to see how any people or group can become assimilated without being integrated into the economic and social organization of a country but assimilation involves integration into the most intimate phases of the organized social life of a country as a consequence assimilation leads to complete identification with the people and culture of the community in which the social heritages of different people become merged or fused in charles francis adams stated in a lecture in richmond that the theory of the complete assimilation and absorption of all peoples because of the absence of fundamental racial differences had broken down in the case of the negro the negro according to adams could only be partially assimilated or in our language integrated but not assimilated when he spoke of absorption he was evidently referring to amalgamation in recent years there has been much talk about the integration of the negro but hardly any attention has been given to his assimilation there have been some wild guesses about the amalgamation or absorption of the negro and his disappearance in to years it is to the question of the assimilation of the negro that i want to devote the remainder of this talk it may seem strange if i tell you that the question of integration and assimilation of the american negro has not been considered or raised by american negroes but by african intellectuals only recently at a luncheon in washington an african intellectual spoke on the subject and afterwards asked me to write an article on the subject but the contrast between the attitude and orientation of american negro intellectuals and african intellectuals was revealed most sharply at the congresses of negro writers held in paris in and in rome in at these congresses the african and i might add the west indian intellectuals were deeply concerned with the question of human culture and personality and the impact of western civilization on the traditional culture of negro peoples it was to be expected that african intellectuals would be concerned with such questions but the amazing thing was that american negro intellectuals who were imbued with an integrationist point of view were not only unconcerned with this question but seemingly were unconscious of the implications of the important question of the relation of culture and personality and human destiny i insist that these are the fundamental questions with which all thinkers should be concerned and that it is unfortunate that americans have not concerned themselves with these questions the lack of interest in this important question or lack of understanding of it is responsible for much of the confusion in regard to integration which is changing the entire relationship of the negro to american society as far as i have been able to discover what negro intellectuals have had to say concerning integration has been concerned with the superficial aspects of the increasing participation of negroes in the economic and social and political organization of american society practically no attention has been directed to the rather obvious fact that integration involves the interaction of the organized social life of the negro community with the wider american community moreover there has been an implied or unconscious assimilationist philosophy holding that negroes should enter the mainstream of american life as rapidly as possible leaving behind their social heritage and becoming invisible as soon as possible this has been due i think to the emergence of a sizeable new middle class whose social background and interests have determined the entire intellectual orientation of educated negroes in my black bourgeoisie i have considered this phenomenon and it is unnecessary to go into the question here there are certain phases of this phenomenon which are relevant to this discussion the first aspect is that the new negro middle class is the stratum of the negro population that is becoming integrated most rapidly because of its education and its ability to maintain certain standards of living in its hope to achieve acceptance in american life it would slough off everything that is reminiscent of its negro origin and its negro folk background at the same time integration is resulting in inner conflicts and frustrations because negroes are still outsiders in american life despite integration the middle class in escaping from its sheltered and privileged position in the negro community has became more exposed to the contempt and discriminations of the white world thus the new negro middle class is confronted with the problems of assimilation and their intellectuals have not provided them with an understanding of the problems this lack of understanding on the part of the socalled intellectual fringe of the new middle class is due partly to the general antiintellectualism of this class and partly to the desire to achieve acceptance in american life by conformity to the ideals values and patterns of behavior of white americans this is no speculation on my part every study that has been made reveals that they think very much the same as white americans even concerning negroes moreover socalled negro intellectuals continue to repeat such nonsense as no race has made as much progress as the american negro in the same period and that his remarkable progress has been due to oppression yet anyone knows that after years american negro intellectuals can not measure up to african intellectuals it was the white scholar buell gallagher in his book color and conscience who showed clearly that negroes in every part of the world where they enjoyed freedom had achieved more intellectually and artistically than the american negro all of this drive towards conformity to dominant beliefs and values is implicit or unconscious striving of the middle classes to become assimilated the great difference between the orientation of the african intellectual and the american negro intellectual is striking when one considers their starting point in their analysis of the position of the people for whom they are supposed to provide intellectual leadership all african intellectuals begin with the fact of the colonial experience of the african they possess a profound understanding of the colonial experience and its obvious effects upon not only their traditional social organization but the less obvious and more profound effects upon the culture and the african personality the american negro intellectual goes his merry way discussing such matters as the superficial aspects of the material standard of living among negroes and the extent to which they enjoy civil_rights he never begins with the fundamental fact of what slavery has done to the negro or the group which is called negroes in the united states yet it is as necessary for the american negro intellectual to deal with these questions as it is for the african intellectual to begin with the colonial experience the american negro intellectual is even more remiss in his grasp of the condition and fate of american negroes he has steadily refused to recognize what has been called the mark of oppression it was the work of two white scholars that first called attention to this fundamental aspect of the personality of the american negro moreover it was the work of another white scholar stanley m elkins in his recent book on slavery who has shown the psychic trauma that negroes suffered when they were enslaved the pulverization of their social life through the destruction of their clan organization and annihilation of their personality through the destruction of their cultural heritage sometimes i think that the failure of the american negro intellectual to grasp the nature and the significance of these experiences is due to the fact that he continues to be an unconscious victim of these experiences after an african intellectual met a group of negro intellectuals he told me that they were really men who were asleep all of this only tends to underline the fact that educated negroes or negro intellectuals have failed to achieve any intellectual freedom in fact with the few exceptions of literary men it appears that the ne intellectual is unconscious of the extent to which his thinking is restricted to sterile repetition of the safe and conventional ideas current in american society this is attributable in part of course to the conditions under which an educated and intellectual class emerged in the american society this class emerged as the result of white american philanthropy although the situation has changed and the negro intellectuals are supported through other means they are still largely dependent upon the white community there is no basis of economic support for them within the negro community and where there is economic support within the negro community it demands conformity to conservative and conventional ideas witness for example the vote of the national medical association in new york city against placing medical care for the aged under social security the action of this group might be attributable partly to ignorance and what they conceived to be their economic interests nevertheless it was done under the domination of the american medical association which ignored the whining complaints of negro doctors against racial discrimination i could cite other examples which more clearly represent the absence of intellectual freedom in regard to national and international issues most negro intellectuals simply repeat the propaganda which is put out by people who have large economic and political interests to protect of course negro intellectuals are in a different position from the standpoint of employment if they show any independence in their thinking they may be hounded by the fbi and find it difficult to make a living at the present time many of them find themselves in the humiliating position of running around the world telling africans and others how welloff negroes are in the united states and how well they are treated one is reminded of the words of langston hughes in his recent book ask your mama where he says that the african visitor finds that in the american social supermarket blacks for sale range from intellectuals to entertainers thus it appears that the price of the slow integration which the negroes are experiencing must be bought at the price of abject conformity in thinking one of the most important results of the lack of freedom on the part of negro intellectuals has been their failure to produce men of high intellectual stature who are respected by the world at large we have no philosophers or thinkers who command the respect of the intellectual community at large i am not talking about the few teachers of philosophy who have read hegel or kant or james and memorized their thoughts i am talking about men who have reflected upon the fundamental problems which have always concerned philosophers such as the nature of human knowledge and the meaning or lack of meaning of human existence we have no philosophers who have dealt with these and other problems from the standpoint of the negros unique experience in this world i am not talking about the puerile opportunistic rationalizations of the negros effort to survive in a hostile world the philosophy implicit in the negros folklore is infinitely superior to the opportunistic philosophy of negro intellectuals who want to save their jobs and enjoy material comforts the philosophy implicit in the folklore of the negro folk is infinitely superior in wisdom and intellectual candor to the empty repetition of platitudes concerning brotherly love and human dignity of negro intellectuals who are tyrants within the negro world and never had a thought in their lives this brings me to say something of what negro intellectuals or scholars have failed to accomplish as the intellectual leaders of negroes they have failed to study the problems of negro life in america in a manner which would place the fate of the negro in the broad framework of mans experience in this world they have engaged in petty defenses of the negros social failures but more often they have been so imbued with the prospect of integration and eventual assimi lation that they have thought that they could prove themselves true americans by not studying the negro since integration has become the official policy of the country they have shunned more than ever the study of the negro they have remained intellectually sterile while propounding such meaningless questions as should negro scholars study the negro should negro painters paint negro subjects should negro writers and playwrights write negro novels and plays about negroes this is indicative of the confusion among negro intellectuals but more important still it has meant that negro intellectuals have cut themselves off from a vastly rich source of human experience to which they had access it is scarcely believable that the only significant studies of negroes in politics have been the work of white scholars i have already mentioned other fields of interest in which scholars have made significant contributions of course some of this failure has been the result of ignorant administration of negro schools which have refused the intelligent proposals of negro scholars let us take the case of conants book slums and suburbs which deals with the tragic position of negroes in america as long as years ago i pointed out that urbanization had changed the entire relationship of negroes to american society and that comprehensive and fundamental research should be done on negroes in cities but those negroes who have controlled the destiny of negro intellectuals ignored this and even today no negro college or university is concerned with this fundamental problem conants book which reveals the poverty ignorance and social disorganization of negroes emphasizes a phase of the integration and assimilation of negroes to which i have only vaguely referred it deserves special attention in what i am undertaking to discuss not only has conant devoted attention to the position of negroes in slums but i have noted that ashmore has published a book dealing with this problem and the frustrations of the negro middle class the significance of the large proportion of unemployed impoverished and socially and personally disorganized negroes in cities for our discussion can not be overemphasized it shows clearly that whereas a relatively large middle class is emerging in our cities at the same time a large degraded proletariat is also appearing it reveals the wide economic and social cleavage which is becoming more manifest between the middle class and the masses of negroes these negroes have little education practically no skills and what is more they have never known a normal family life because of their lack of socialization they can hardly take advantage of the educational institutions they are unprepared for employment in an industrial society and they are unfit for normal social life conant is afraid that they will become susceptible to communist propaganda but he does not know negroes if they were to become communist their lives would be organized about objectives and goals which would have some stabilizing influence but most of these negroes will become the victims of liquor dope and disease and they will engage in all forms of crime and antisocial behavior those who seek an escape from their frustration and bewilderment will not join communist movements they will join all types of religious sects and cults some of which will have nationalistic or racial aims in fact the growth of the black muslim movement represents disillusionment on the part of negroes concerning integration and a repudiation of the belief in assimilation which is so dear to the middle classes recently we have been hearing about the revolt against the leaders of the negro the most significant sympton of this revolt has been the revolt of negro youth against the old respectable and conventional leadership which acted as mediators between the negro community and the white community the most dramatic aspect of the revolt has been the sitin movements which are a direct attack upon segregation the aim is in tegration and utimately assimilation if i gage correctly the aims of the leaders this seems to emphasize the failure of negro intellectuals they can only see assimilation beyond integration but there are problems of american life that negroes will have to meet in becoming integrated and assimilated and they concern the economic and social organization of american life i pointed out at the beginning that whatever change had occurred in the status of negroes was due to changes in the economic and social organization of american life american negro intellectuals seem to be unconscious of this fact and seemingly believe that integration and ultimate assimilation will solve the problems of the negro it is very important for our discussion on integration and assimilation that the leaders of the nonviolence technique have gone to india for philosophical and ideological justification of their revolt against segregation and discrimination in american society that the technique should be nonviolent is natural since negroes who are outnumbered by whites and threatened by the armed might of whites could not resort to violence or revolutionary tactics i do not think that it represents any moral superiority on their part moreover i do not think that gandhism is really applicable to the negros situation in the united states nevertheless i recognize that it achieves a certain moral respect ability because of its religious basis this is especially important where negroes confront the guiltridden respectable white middle classes in analyzing the movement and in seeking its religious and moral inspiration we should recognize that it has its roots in the religious experiences and culture of the negro folk the leaders may speak in philosophical and ideological terms that are drawn from an alien culture but the dynamics of the movement are to be found in the religious experiences of the negroes when negroes are forced to face hostile white mobs they do not sing indian hymns they sing negro spirituals and the hymns of their fathers which embodied the faith of their fathers in a hostile world that the negro leaders should turn to an alien culture for the philosophical and ideological justification of their revolt shows the extent to which negro intellectuals are alienated from the masses it is also an indication of the failure of the intellectual leaders to perform their role in relation to the negro they have failed to dig down into the experiences of the negro and provide the soul of a people with exceptions and i will name langston hughes as a conspicuous example they have tried to escape from the negro heritage it was their duty to put this heritage in history books in novels and in plays in painting and in sculpture because of their eagerness to be accepted as americans or perhaps sometimes because of their fear they have written no novels and plays about denmark vesey harriet tubman or schields green who went with john brown they have accepted supinely as heroes the negroes whom white people have given us and told us to revere even today they run from dubois and paul robeson in view of the negros history the negro intellectual and artist had a special opportunity and special responsibility the process by which the negroes were captured and enslaved in the united states stripped them of their african culture and destroyed their personality under the slavery regime and for nearly a century since emancipation everything in american society has stamped the negro as subhuman as a member of an inferior race that had not achieved even the first steps in civilization there is no parallel in human history where a people have been subjected to similar mutilation of body and soul even the christian religion was given them in a form only to degrade them the african intellectual recognizes what colonialism has done to the african and he sets as his first task the mental moral and spiritual rehabilitation of the african but the american negro intellectual seduced by dreams of final assimilation has never regarded this as his primary task i am aware that he has carried on all sorts of arguments in defense of the negro but they were mainly designed to protect his own status and soothe his hurt selfesteem i am talking about something entirely different i am referring to his failure to dig down into the experience of the negro and bring about a transvaluation of that experience so that the negro could have a new selfimage or new conception of himself it was the responsibility of the negro intellectual to provide a positive identification through history literature art music and the drama the truth of the matter is that for most negro intellectuals the integration of the negro means just the opposite the emptying of his life of meaningful content and ridding him of all negro identification for them integration and eventual assimilation means the annihilation of the negrophysically culturally and spiritually guy johnson has written recently that in the next years there will be more integration but far less than the negro hopes for and as a consequence there will be much frustration moreover as park once wrote the negro will be treated as a racial minority rather than a racial caste i am inclined to agree on the whole with this prediction especially for the south but even in the north where negroes will achieve greater integration i can not envision any assimilation in the foreseeable future the best evidence of this is the manner in which the centennial of the civil war is being celebrated the important fact about the civil war is the emancipation of the negro and lincolns achievement of worldwide immortality as the emancipatornot as the savior of the union which was a local political event yet the nation has ignored and repudiated the central fact which is the most important element in the boosted moral idealism of the united states the negro is left out of the celebration both physically and as a part of the heritage of america the civil war is supposed to have been the result of a misunderstanding of twobrothers white brothers of course and the emancipation of the negro is forgotten confronted with this fact the negro intellectual should not be consumed by his frustrations he must rid himself of his obsession with assimilation he must come to realize that integration should not mean annihilationselfeffacement the escaping from his identification in a chapter entitled what can the american negro contribute to the social and economic life of africa in the book africa seen by american negroes i pointed out that the american negro had little to contribute to africa but that africa in achieving freedom would probably save the soul of the american negro in providing him with a new identification a new selfimage and a new sense of personal dignity i want to emphasize this by pointing out that if the negro is ever assimilated into american society his heritage should become a part of the american heritage and it should be recognized as the contribution of the negro as one recognizes the contributions of the english irish germans and other people but this can be achieved only if the negro intellectual and artist frees himself from his desire to conform and only if he overcomes his inferiority complex it may turn out that in the distant future negroes will disappear physically from american society if this is our fate let us disappear with dignity and let us leave a worthwhile memorialin science in art in literature in sculpture in musicof our having been here how marian anderson blessed my life never have i been one to seek out celebrities somehow it didnt appeal to me to join a noisy milling throng secure an autograph or to shake the hand of a famous personagenever except once i still contemplate on the urging which propelled me backstage that night in milwaukee in my husband was teaching in wauwatosa a suburb and our budget was tautly stretched of necessity fifty different ways so it was that when a neighbor approached me with a paid admission asking me to accompany her to marian andersons concert at the civic auditorium i was doubly thrilled thrilled because the love of music was an integral part of our lives and happy for this opportunity as we hadnt been able to afford many concerts but there was a stumblingblock to my acceptance which my husband duly pointed out some years earlier i had lost a child and had been advised i would probably never have another now i had become fruitful again and the doctor had circumscribed nearly every move i made prohibiting me from stairs from crowds from wearing heels and from becoming weary i desired this child with all my being but i also yearned passionately to hear this wonderful woman in person so to all my husbands arguments i promised to be careful careful it was a joy to be in a crowded hall again and observe the people streaming in from every direction there were both negroes and whites some from each group were garbed in glamorous evening attire others were dressed in casual street clothes while there were some who looked downright shabby i found myself thinking how marvelous and right it was that all these folk representing the entire ladder of financial standing and many walks of life should be congregating for this occasion i knew that there were some of our colored friends who probably came from the dilapidated coldwater tenements which are the blight of every metropolis this appearance of one of their own would serve as a challenge for courage and the memory of this evening would linger with them as the afterglow of a brilliant sunset seen across barren plains i knew that there were whites present to whom this evening was just another event of the social season who would return to their exquisitelyappointed homes with no thought as to the farreaching implication of social equality presaged by this artists appearance i also knew that there were some like myself who loved beauty in any form be it wrapped in brown or in white covering the lights were dimmed the usual hush descended over the entire assemblage the curtains parted to reveal a plain empty stage empty save for a little man seated at a grand piano and miss anderson herself standing tall still almost forbidding in her bearing her gown floor length was of winecolored velvet simply fashioned with long sleeves and modest decolletage welcoming applause thundered throughout the vast building and still the artist stood quietly almost statuelike there was no effort on her part to sell herself to the audience by the customary sweeping curtsies and sparkling smiles most performers employ only her somber eyes betrayed her interest as they swept over the sea of upturned faces and when the ovation finally died away she merely lowered her head in acknowledgment before signalling her accompanist to begin time stood still for me as she sang opening her mobile mouth to emit glorious warm rich tones and as the full purity of her voice reached out to embrace each person present one realized that this lady need not resort to stage mannerisms or gestures her gift was her lovely instrument which she gave unreservedly in a varied offering of classics german lieder and spirituals she herself was only the channel through which beauty flowed constant and moving encore followed encore until she finally sang schuberts ave maria the crowd attentive before now was spellbound with the silence so pronounced one could have heard a pin drop as the last note faded away a holy solemnity seemed to pervade the place i mopped my wet cheeks then glancing around saw tears on other faces both brown and white this group who moments before had been wildly cheering was suddenly on its knees gradually people arose until everyone was standing in silent tribute to this masterartist and then they began filing out as if from a place of worship my neighbor and i had reached a sideexit when i impulsively turned to her and said lone i must go backstage and tell miss anderson what inspiration and courage her singing has given me i must tell her do you mind she looked at me so very ponderous and awkward then at her watch well your husband did say not to be too late you know yes i know i know but ive never felt so moved in my life it wont take too much longer i pleaded she smiled indulgently after all pregnant women often get extreme ideas all right ill go along she answered the line of greeters was longer than i had anticipated and i shifted my uncomfortable weight from one swollen foot to the other while my friend looked more and more disapproving but slowly we approached the great lady and i mulled in my mind the verbal bouquet i would present her when i finally stood before her no words came she was taller than i so that she gazed down on my tentshaped figure and her dark liquid eyes seemed to hold a composite of all the sadness and compassion in the world then her large strong hand grasped mine and all my flowery words slipped from mind any i heard myself murmuring brokenly ohmay god bless you onstage she had only offered fragments of smiles but now she suddenly flashed a wide one which lighted her entire face her reply remained with me like a benediction all through the next difficult days thank you he will be blessing you too before long and he did as two weeks later a lovely girlchild was born to us by rights this story is finished but an epilogue must be added in order to show how miss anderson not only inspired and encouraged me then but later gave me comfort nearly two years ago my mother was in our home slowly dying from cancer one sunday night marian anderson made a guest appearance on tv and i turned up the volume so her voice would reach mama in the bedroom l sl when the warm rich voice began singing hes got the whole world in his hands i slipped to mamas door to see how she liked it i paused unobserved as i saw a thin bony hand upraised while i heard mama say with conviction and hes got me in his hands too the memory of that scene etched indelibly on my mind comforted me often after mama left us again marian anderson unknowingly had blessed my life agony in angola angola has been in a q state of virtual civil k war since march gr when heavy fighting between angolan nationalists and portuguese whites broke out in the northwest section ol that west africa colonythe prize possession of portugal for over years in all some whites and about africans have been slaughtered an estimated africans have fled to the neighboring congo for safety because of tight censorship control clamped on the press in angola and in lisbon by portugals premier antonio de oliveira salazar few dispatches concerning the angola trouble have been able to reach the outside world the onthespot reports that have found their way into american newspapers and magazines can to a large degree be credited to the zeal and forthrightness of protestant missionaries and african pastors and teachers who have suffered greatly at the hands of portuguese civilians and military angola with its million africans and whites is portugals cinderella colony times larger than portugal herself under the harsh portuguese rule the exploited angolan africans have gained little economic advancement and few educational privileges there has been no political participation by the people either african or white the lot of the average african under portuguese rule has not changed substantially in years the presence of the protestant church in angola has been one of the brighter spots in the existence of that nations africans for more than years protestant missionaries have been at work there teaching in schools operating hospitals building modern villages raising crops and most of all spreading the gospel the missionaries have often been the only people angolans could turn to for counsel in angola missionaries and africans became close companions and worked and worshiped together few portuguese whites ever dreamed of such association with the africans thus when trouble broke out last february and march inevitably the protestant church was suspected of having supported the nationalist movement this suspicion grew when africans attacking whiteowned plantations and homes bypassed protestant stations the protestant church in angolaespecially that part of it supported by american methodists and british and canadian baptistshas suffered greatly at the hands of portuguese who have entered on something of an antiprotestant crusade the methodist church has suffered considerably more than other denominations and churches work ing in angolawith all the damage done by portuguese whites who blame that church for much of what is happening the methodist board of missions in new york estimates that at least of its african pastors have been killed either by portuguese civilians or by military forces some after hurried trials others without trial in half of the methodist area in angola the luanda area african pastors and teachers reportedly are in prison have fled with their people or have been killed only are accounted for and known to be in no immediate danger the church has lost one of its top district superintendentsguilherme pereira ingles who had developed and served one of the largest methodist districts in all of africa according to reports he was shot in the leg and taken to quibaxi for imprisonment after a hurried trial he was shot to death his body was loaded in a truck with others who had suffered a similar fate then dumped into the dange river armed white civilians have destroyed or seriously damaged many of the denominations churches schools and centers in the capital city of luanda seven schools and chapels and one social center with clinic kindergarten and nursery services were destroyed last year bishop ralph e dodge toured methodist mission stations in angola as he did again recently alarmed at what he saw on that first visit he warned that the portuguese were in serious trouble one paragraph of his report to his board in new york gave this graphic picture of angola before the revolt started there are few colored or african lawyers and doctors assimilados hold important posts in one or two government departments and thats all schooling is still left almost entirely to the missions on a voluntary basis the protestant church alone has educated more africans angolans than the government russia is making propaganda broadcasts in portuguese and the voice of america is hardly heard because it comes at an hour when most africans are in bed causing great concern is the seeming isolation of american consular officials they seem to be quite confident that nothing is going to happen to portuguese africa an attitude understandable when they have almost no contact with the african people the outspokenness of the protestant churches in angola against the current abuses practiced in that west african nation by the salazar regime of portugal has surprised both friends and opponents here to fore the missionaries have suffered in silence with the people of angola all at once they have become vocal in bringing recent events in angola before the conscience of the civilized world for judgment indignation at the regime of antonio de oliveira salazar arises from four main sources brutal treatment of africans terrorist tactics and intimidation religious discrimination lack of forthrightness in official dealings let it be said that over the past years a sizable reservoir of good will has been built up between most protestant leaders missionary and african and the local portuguese european population in fact close and lasting friendships have been formed no one can be fair and honest without acknowledging many excellent qualities in the portuguese people generosity hospitality lack of strong racial prejudices and so on few are the leaders of the protestant churches who have not benefited from these commendable qualities during their stay in portuguese africa individual portuguese citizens have gone out of their way to be friendly to a passing stranger and in remote areas have opened their modest homes at any hour to anyone in distress protestant leaders readily acknowledge their gratitude for innumerable kindnesses shown them by gracious portuguese colonists and officials it is this graciousness on the part of some of the portuguese which has until now kept the pressure of resentment from rising to the breaking point it should also be said that the protestants in angola do not condone violence perpetrated by africans any more than they do that perpetrated by the portuguese no matter how severe the provocation the truly christian position must be one of nonviolence the fact that in angola the provocation finally went beyond the africans endurance can be understood without any attempt at justification protestant church leaders there emphatically deny that they had any part in planning the bloody revolt or that sizable numbers of protestant christians participated in the massacres but that the brutal retaliation of white portuguese against all africans and especially against the educated protestants has evoked a fairly solid block of protestant opposition cannot be denied although angolas protestant churches have ministered to the spiritual needs of europeans as well as africans few europeans have affiliated themselves with protestant churches portugal being a predominantly roman catholic country has favored people of that faith for decades consequently most of the work done in angola by protestants has been among africans missionaries have grown to understand admire and trust the african people without being blind to certain weaknesses and the need for spiritual as well as intellectual economic and social development which the latter encouraged against protestant property the methodist mission in the center of luanda the capital city suffered a mob attack under police escort this was followed by others elsewhere in luanda and in other parts of north central angola many churches and schools were destroyed by white terrorists it is rumored that even the government now recognizes that it permitted mobs to go too far in destroying church property following the unfavorable american vote in the united nations but it was more than reaction against the american vote that triggered the vandalism for years portuguese plantation owners had resented protestant schools which they said brought about a reduction in the number of laborers resentment had been rising against the protestant educational program in which a limited number of africans were preparing for university training and an even smaller number were already studying in portugal and elsewhere the general wave of terrorism which followed the march revolt in the north provided an opportunity for the embittered europeans to get even with the protestants for limiting the supply of cheap labor through an effective if limited educational program after the mob violence by europeans the feeling rose among missionaries that if the police permitted such action in the capital city there was not much to be gained by continuing to remain silent thus the story of property damage so much less significant than the loss of life estimated at africans and whites was also presented for world judgment a third factor one which has long offended the protestant discrimination in portuguese africa protestant tax money along with that of other groups is used to subsidize the work of the roman catholic church protestant marriage and baptismal certificates have never been officially recognized thus protestants are forced either to deny their own faith in seeking a repetition of the ceremonies in the catholic church or to forego the needed documents the children of protestants married in evangelical churches are officially considered illegitimate the salazar government fails to recognize protestant churches as legal entities and usually refers to them as sects for the past quarter of a century the portuguese government has permitted few if any protestant missions to be established in angola whereas the program of expansion by the roman church has been facilitated to such an extent that protestant workers have had to take jobs constructing catholic churches in protestant communities in one portuguese territory no protestants can train as teachers because all teachertraining facilities have been turned over to the roman church and protestants are excluded from all such facilities a very illuminating new book protestantism in africa by professor jose julio goncalves concludes that while protestants should not be opposed openly they must not be encouraged or they would grow too rapidly therefore the only feasible way to handle the protestant problem is to discriminate against protestants and that is just what the salazar regime has done for years though it has laws proclaiming to the world that it endorses freedom it instructs its agents to interpret those laws so as to thwart the protestant witness the deviousness has been an offense against the protestant conscience which believes in dealing with all religious groups openly and on a basis of equality a fourth factor which has been hard for protestants to understand is the lack of forthrightness on the part of the salazar government in one protestant missionary asked for permission to open a new mission although the matter was pursued in both luanda and lisbon no reply has yet been obtained lisbon laying the blame on luanda officials and vice versa a request from another missionary to establish residence in mozambiquecosting him more than in fees for translating into portuguese all documents from birth certificates to university diplomashas after a wait of five years been neither granted nor refused this lack of frankness is very hard for protestant missionaries to comprehend the portuguese have some laws which are among the best in the world but interpretation is left to the whims of petty officials who openly declare that they are the law interpretation of the laws varies not only from place to place but from day to day depending on individual officials mood and motivation thus it is that constant confusion prevails one official will give one interpretation and the next will give another in one instance a friendly official authorized a school to be built after the foundations were poured and all the materials purchased his successor refused to recognize that permission had been granted so for five years the material has stood beside the completed foundations waiting for a new and more amenable administratorin the hope that he will reverse the decision of his predecessor protestants who normally give and expect a straightforward reply are constantly frustrated by the referral technique and all the continual delays it is not the little frustrations however which have caused the protestant leaders to adopt a stiffening attitude toward the salazar government but the fact that the world should know what is happening to human beings living behind a jungle curtain floridas first distinguished author or many years when jrj giving talks in florida p j i have pointed out that there is only one first w c i ass nativeborn florida author who has written any even small body of work about the state marjorie kinnan rawlings philip wylie and all the others were born elsewhere and adopted he florida scene the exception was zora neale hurston seldom on inquiry had any of the audiences ever heard of her or known any of her work at that point i revealed to the white southern audiences that zora was a negro as i announced this i looked around for the nearest exit i never had to use the exit and when i told this to zora she roared with laughter on february at age zora died in fort pierce florida in poverty and obscurity she is a prime example of the excellent american writer who in our smashhit or virtually nothing kind of literary civilization gets lost in the shuffle far more recognition should be given to such writers and i ask permission to give this to zora i regard her early books their eyes were watching god jonahs gourd vine and the florida parts of mules and men depicting life in the turpentine camps to be in the top rung of american writing certainly as good as anything anyone has ever written about florida and take another look at those titles they are as exceptional as the wonderful imagery she possessed and gave to her readers as real as the hurricanefrom the viewpoint of the negrowhich she pictured among her people in the vegetable raising district around lake okeechobee zora not only could write but knew what she was writing about her autobiography dust tracks on a road won an anisfield award for better race relationships she knew how to express herself the peak of her economic careerand it was mt everest rising from the plainwas the short period during which she worked as a writer at paramount in hollywood when i asked her what she thought of california she wrote back true to her native florida i like my land lying down how did this girl born without her permission in possession of a black skin in a backwoods florida town make a place for herself in the world her handicaps would seem to be almost insurmountable eatonville her birthplace is a remote community of a few hundred negro people in northcentral florida not far from orlando it is a place of dirt streets incredibly colorful negro cabins set beautifully beneath towering live oaks dripping with long beards of spanish moss it was the first incorporated negro town in the united states and one of the very few which is entirely negro zoras father was a baptist minister he was able to augment her primary education to such an extent that she was able to work her way through two years at howard university in washington d c by serving as a maid then she won a scholarship for two more years at barnard college and became the second negro to be graduated from that school during this period she supported herself by being secretary to fannie hurst when she and miss hurst travelled and wanted to eat in restaurants from which negroes were barred miss hurst introduced zora with an air of great mystery and vast importance as the princess zora and there was never any difficulty it being assumed that zora must be royalty from the far east after barnard zora studied anthropology for three years working under dr franz boaz and for this work morgan college at howard conferred upon her the degree of littd she worked in the anthropological field off and on for most of her life her studies and reports on voodoo in the united states and haiti are definitive on the subject and one of them when her research penetrated too far nearly got her killed meanwhile she also wrote on general subjects and her writings included novels to live during this usually penurious period she taught at north carolina college for negroes during these years she was also awarded two guggenheim fellowships and a rosenwald grant zora was rather short and squat and black as coal she didnt look and sound much like a doctor of literature but more as though she could do a good days washing she was filled with an effervescence for life seldom seen in the human race she had an abrupt explosive laugh that burst like a bomb she always had some new idea or project she enthused over some she actually carried out it was both exhilarating and tiring to be with her for she caught you up in her ideas to the point of exhaustion she herself never seemed to feel she was absolutely and completely improvident saving what little money she ever earned was a repugnant idea to her when she did save it was to pay for some new project such as an abortive one of mystery involving an expedition to honduras which she financed and from which she returned flat broke i never could find out just what that project was about probably it was one of the harebrained kind she sometimes developed she couldnt help being sensitive of the color line but her sensitiveness was of another kind than the usual it was never bitter she was always proud of being a negro and once told me she wouldnt be white for anything in the world she wrote in her autobiography my own circumference of life is there i give you all my right hand of fellowship and love and hope for the same from you in my eyesight you lose nothing by not looking just like me you who play the zigzag lightning of power over the world with the grumbling thunder in your wake think kindly of those who walk in the dust and you who walk in humble places think kindly too of others consider that with tolerance and patience we godly demons may breed a noble world in a few hundred generations or so zora not only preached this with some biting irony but also carried it out gently in the life she loved to live with zest once when she was visiting me and my wife at our florida home and we had asked her to stay to dinner while the meal was being prepared a white caller came to the door zora seeing him before we did stepped away so that the man would not see her afterward we told her that she need not have done this she said that she didnt want to take any chance of embarrassing us we did not always get on as well as that after the honduras debacle she wrote to me from miami that she did not have eating money but she had the promise of a job in new york if she could raise the fare to get there i sent her a few dollars and advised friends in miami of her plight they got together and raised enough for her fare instead of using it for the avowed purpose she did not go but remained in miami when i remonstrated with such behavior and scolded her she wrote back that she had read just at that time that i was going through the trying process of having a book published because of this she understood why i was so testy and she forgave me for being put out with her at the time i was prone to think that perhaps too many scholarships and fellowships and grants might have been given her generating the conviction that others should support her and that there should be a limit to such grants perhaps i dont know i got over my aggrievement when i learned with amusement that she had gone to work in a miami beach house as a domestic and that her employers one day had found out who she was by reading an article she had written in a copy of the saturday evening post on their livingroom table then i remembered how one day she had shown a single spark of defeatism over her color she had told me she had written an article but she didnt think that the saturday evening post would buy one from a negro i told her that was the only stupid thing i had ever heard her say because of it i wouldnt write a note to the post for her for if i did and her article was accepted she might even erroneously have some question in her mind she was to send it to them and find out for herself the post bought that article and others commercial writing however did not consistently appeal to zora because she didnt care enough about making money still filled with ideas and schemes rarely based upon getting rich she drifted to the fort pierce area of florida during her two last years she earned a precarious living as a substitute teacher at lincoln park academy there and contributed to the local negro paper the chronicle then she had a stroke that halted work on a new book she was writing she spent the last months of her life in a county home her funeral at a tiny negro funeral home in fort pierce was attended by over people sixteen of them white the mourners overflowed the small hall out onto the porch and then into the yard there was a little printed program entitled funeral rites of the late zora neale hurston which offered a brief biography the order of the service and the names of the pallbearers and flower girls who were some of her students expenses were paid by contributions many from those who never knew her the local negro population did not need a white florida writer to be there to speak an appreciation to tell them who zora neale hurston was she was someone they may not have understood too well but they knew she had pulled herself up by her bootstraps and done something not many white people ever do the wonderful understanding of negroes for the human race born perhaps of their necessity to tolerate it was never better expressed than at zoras funeral when these people among whom she had lived so briefly nevertheless stood by one of their own the editor of the paper for which she worked said zora neale went about and didnt care too much how she looked or what she said maybe people didnt think so much of that but zora neale every time she went about had something to offer she didnt come to you empty the minister said when people learned i was going to preach about her they asked me what can you find to say well i can find a lot of things they said she couldnt become a writer recognized by the world but she did it the miami paper said she died poor but she died rich she did something the main hymn sung at the service was hell understand and say well done an exact appraisal of the situation the single jarring thing and that meant reverently was the way they dressed her in a short frilly pink dressinggown with frothy pink mules on her feet an incongruous garb for one so real and earthy i can hear zora herself commenting on it and saying she wouldnt be caught dead in such an outfit i am sure she would have added her favorite statement as she loved to roar gleefully i aint got but two things to do stay black and die she has achieved her purpose part of it with some magnificent writing she is out of circulation and all her books are out of print one cannot be rectified the other should be by tommy l mack between rounds the b y twelve active members a of the leimert chess ihj club contributed fif teen dollars each to the naacp for the third quarter then completed arrangements to fish and golf at lake arrowhead during the last two weeks of august our western avenue barber fred clay suggested getting back to the business of chess when reverend jess patterson asked for a short delay to collect from each member fifteen dollars more for the freedom riders of core fred switched his cigar to the other side of his mouth and reminded jess he had just collected two hundred dollars vacation expenses from everybody furthermore he had had an empty chair for two months now the group sat silently after the minister explained the need for additional contributions then he said quietly well gentlemen if we cant support them with a little cash i motion we spend our vacation in the south ed smith who had taken over his fathers grocery store and was in the process of building the first negroowned supermarket in los angeles was the first to contribute the fifteen dollars followed by builder steve wright who was trying to integrate a new development professor hubbard was last to contribute before returning to his table he asked gentlemen everyone has already given of his money but why shouldnt we also go i quit placing my chessmen and was aware of a shifting uneasiness pervading the room why the hell should we spend our vacation in jail replied the barber there are other ways of going about those things he didnt answer what other ways but steve wright who from previous discussions had some support for his plan suggested we back his building company in negotiating financing through a local savings and loan association and with the negro press supporting us we could begin breaking down the walls of housing discrimination in california the minister said the situation was more grave in the south and our obligation was clear positions comprising elements of truth which conscionably could not be dismissed were reiterated but with no indication of resolution finally dr rogers ended the meeting by suggesting we ponder the matter and reach a decision at a later time i drove slowly along the sparsely lit westside streets realizing steves remarks were more meaningful as i observed fewer houses and an increasing number of large apartments which seemed even more crowded because of the darkness i entered and closed the door quietly enough but i expected dorothy to call to me because we usually had a late dinner on thursdays after club meetings a light from the bedroom cast its brightness across the dim hallway then i saw the thin hands of the black forest clock and realized she must have eaten long ago a magazine on child care had slipped from her limp hand to the floor the other hand rested on the fold of the bedspread which sloped from her swollen stomach i felt that any project which might take me away from her at this time could be summarily dismissed i switched off the reading lamp and went to bed quietly relieved no one had asked my opinion on the question of a freedom ride to the south at breakfast dorothy seemed nervous as she sipped coffee and waited on me it was almost time to go before she told me she had lunched last tuesday with professor hubbards wife then she asked what was your position on the freedom ride project i havent given it any serious thought dear seems a fine thing to me she said as she handed my coat i brushed her hair aside and kissed her forehead as i left for the hospital whitedressed orderlies wheeled quiet stainless steel carts containing used breakfast dishes through the brightly lit corridors ward nurses were preparing to give bed patients individual therapy as i picked up the distribution from the message center before going to my office absently i initiated circulation copies then found a new case i opened the file but kept wondering if anyone in the club actually would ride to the south and i was annoyed because dorothy apparently had discussed the matter with professor hubbards wife and had not mentioned it to me my irritating discomfort increased somewhat when the dermatologist came into my office and sat crossing his legs got your crystal ball mr miller he asked maybe a little common sense will help the expression on his face reflected my tone of voice rough case i explained whats the problem a kid in the prison ward what is he doing up there pumped his stomach he paused and recrossed his legs they said he stabbed another boy who is in emergency now oh i see he broke out in a rash at the prospects of police interrogation so i asked them to postpone questioning until tomorrow thought you might have a chance to look in on him and give me your report whats his name he hasnt told anyone wont tell who his family is either dr walton said a little more information was on his chart then left for a conference i returned to the new file planning a tentative appointment then phoned the receptionist notifying her of my destination and took the elevator to the prison ward on eight the guard greeted me and unlocked the door after a brief exchange i indicated i wanted to talk to the patient alone he was standing by the window the flannel hospital pajamas fitted his stocky body loosely his wavy blond hair was meticulously combed red welts stood out from his face hello what the hell do you want help if i can i dont need your damn help i looked at his bed chart his stomach had been pumped of barbituates the skin disorder tentatively diagnosed as a reaction from nervousness manifested with fear was under observation my name is your name is sam and you look like an attendant im a medical social worker and my name is robert miller the boy was silent i repeated the next question twice then real ized he had heard me but was not going to talk any more it was just as well i thought under the circumstances even an initial interview could be aggravating but since he was no longer defensively verbalizing i thought it safe to ask for his cooperation he remained silent and there was no discernible change in the defiant expression on his face when i asked his name i suggested his parents would start checking the hospitals and police stations when he didnt come home tonight the boy turned toward the window i knocked on the door and the guard unlocked it i told him loudly enough for the boy to hear to contact me if the patient made such a request he nodded and closed the door there was no doubt the boy was quite frightened and was courageously trying to conceal his fear with aggression i felt certain also that my being a negro made it easier for him i stopped at my office and phoned emergency they told me todd duncan was the name of the boy treated earlier for knife wounds he had been transferred to ward two the nurse told me todd was in as she opened his file she said his right lung had been punctured by a sharp instrument he had a slight temperature from infection and was now in an oxygen tent she returned the file and added his parents had been there all night there was a small brown lady sitting on a cushioned chair in the corner of the waiting room i dragged my foot once not to startle her and she raised her head her red eyes were nearly closed by puffed eyelids she lowered it again i introduced myself and apologized for intruding at such a time but explained i was interested in the circumstances surrounding the incident its all right mr miller im cried out she said i might as well talk about it some after a moment she began as if she had already gone over it many times todd went back to los angeles she paused but before i could ask she explained they lived in glendale and had been plagued since the day they moved into that typical american community i remembered the newspaper accounts the dailies reported it was allegedly some teenagers who disturbed the peace protesting the addition of a negro family to the all white community the negro weekly reported some teenage hoodlums and other irresponsible citizens had smashed windows burned a cross on the lawn and honked automobile horns during the night outside the home of a negro family recently moved to glendale it added that the police behaved in the usual way in such cases the woman said she had been frightened for todd and asked him not to go i guess the kids are a little different from us mr miller i need time to think your parents should be notified yes they should be his voice rose they should be here he said pointing at the floor but theyre not theyre not even in town he shouted theyre too damn busy being successful to care about me he sat on the stool at the desk nervous tension and anxiety had caused the small red welts to reappear on his chin and about the sides of his face my name is howard lancaster he said calmly i had to lean closer to hear the quiet voice repeat his parents name and address so i could note them then in the same tones he spoke of the disorganization and the resulting coldness of his home life his father was a public relations expert for an electrical company and he traveled extensively his mother was a buyer for a downtown fashion agency both were frequently away from home at the same time as was the case this weekend it was during these times he had begun using seconal to soften the loneliness of rejection howard concluded he was unappreciated and was an unimportant member of his family the boy turned from me but i knew he was crying i phoned howards address to the investigating officer who was in the process of questioning witnesses regarding howards companions the only thing on which all of them agreed was there were a total of three white hecklers one of whom pushed todds girlfriend i asked for her address then went to see her i spoke but the two boys their ball and gloves beside them sat in silence on the lawn of the blue stuccoed duplex i pressed the button twice before the large oaken door was opened by an eightyearold holding a baseball cap in his hand he stood to the side of me telling his friends he still couldnt come out then he turned and called deanie and wandered outside adjusting his cap on his head nadine lewis was an olivecomplexioned girl with thick black hair draped about her shoulders her hazel eyes had been crying i told her i was from the hospital and her eyes brightened i considered that todd had an abnormal temperature and he needed help to breathe under the circumstances i could only tell her we would have a report on his progress tomorrow it was all my fault she half whispered as she sat on the sofa will you tell me how it happened miss lewis i asked and sat in a chair near her it started because of my clumsiness i guess some white guys were heckling us and i suppose the blondhaired boy was kind of drunk and was showing off anyway he came over yelling at us to get out then he bumped into me knocking me off balance toddwas near and he caught me she paused and continued the other kids probably thought something was going on and rushed over his friends also came over and thats when it must have happened were you pretty close to the blond boy during the whole thing yes you see anyone with a knife no she replied then added i didnt know anyone had gotten hurt until i saw two of them running some of the kids were kneeling over todd and the others were holding that drunk one she paused finally the police came we were both silent for awhile then she said that since the incident a hundred more students had come by her house to register for the students for civil_rights now association and they would begin picketing monday we could use a little more guidance mr miller but nothing is going to stop us from enjoying the full citizenship which is our right under the constitution i felt as uncomfortable in nadines presence as i had felt with mrs duncan yet i was impressed with nadines determination which was something akin to the will of a man dying of thirst in a desert as long as he saw a mirage he would not cease to struggle but making an illusion a reality was a monumental task i guess thats why i hadnt tried it individually or with a group and though ive been moderately successful i knew the social climate had been such that my full potential had already been aborted i could have wished her luck that the project would be successful or safety in the face of mobs threatening physical violence instead i said it was going to be a hard task and hurriedly left when i returned to the hospital there were two messages for me one from the police informing me they would clear with the hospital later today to take howard to juvenile hall and that his mother had returned home the other was from howard asking me to come see him he greeted me before offering me a seat at the desk then returned to his bed the springs sagging beneath his weight i told him his mother had returned his head slowly nodded she was a part of it mr miller he paused and continued she was with some of our community leaders when they met at at one of the fellows house and he overheard them discussing ways to get the negro family out of the neighborhood did you get to know todd i asked no he replied i saw him in his yard a few times then about a week later we were in the car and he came out of his house with this big sign sit until served so we just followed him howard stood with his back to me and began explaining it was his intention just to frighten todd when he was interrupted by a knock on the door the guard with two folding chairs preceded a stylishly dressed lady who embraced howard and a man in a wrinkled suit carrying a small briefcase im robert im mrs lancaster and i want howard out of here the woman began my attorney has already explained you havent a single reason to hold him here his release might have been arranged mrs lancaster if the police had been able to contact his parents well im home now she said so everything is all right and i dont have any time to be wasting around here a boy has been stabbed mama said howard quietly you didnt do it she said but i was partially responsible and i was with them when they did it you didnt do it she repeated but i know who did both mrs lancaster and the attorney came to their feet you stay out of this mrs lancaster said i think you should talk this over with me howard before you say anything else said the attorney ive already thought it over the boy said in monotones and i know we were all wrong but its all over now howard said mrs lancaster no its not all over he yelled they think i stabbed that boy youre innocent let them find who they want im going to tell them howard persisted no howard we live out there thats why i should tell mama i forbid you she snapped his quiet firm voice broke the silence bill hopkins daryl long and joe joseph stewart had the knife the nurse said the oxygen tent had temporarily been removed the infection had been cleared and she permitted the parents to see todd briefly now mrs duncan was sitting in the same place her husband and her mother had joined her and they refused to go home though the nurse told them todd would be all right he opened his eyes as i called his name i told him nadine and the other students were continuing the demonstrations and there was a weak grin on his discolored face finally he said id be with em if we hadnt had trouble last time did you know those boys i asked him they burned a cross on our lawn he answered you know which one stabbed you he nodded affirmatively was it howard lancaster i dont know their names the blond one no at the hearing three weeks later howard and todd identified joseph stewart as the one who did the stabbing joseph was ordered to the california youth authority his companions bill hopkins and howard lancaster had had fewer prior police contacts and a subordinate role in this incident both were ordered placed in a forestry camp all the parents were counselled and admonished i said goodbye to howard and followed todd and his parents out of the court building where nadine and the other students rose from the shade of the fan palms and quietly greeted him in the hot august sun i drove home in anticipation of dorothys approval of my decision later i would tell the chess club of todds courage and of his enterprising parents whose move was equally important and probably more fundamental because full citizenship is impossible without fair housing from which all else could emanate i felt a committee to develop wrights housing plan would be selected that night after which i would motion the remaining members take a freedom ride to light the lamps the vividly discomfitv f ing insight into what it i rfeels like to be a negro sla in he south and i n w r deed through the united states is disturbing many bookreading whites and roiling us up into a state wideeyed aghast and protesting by turns the relentless finestyled and bitterly entertaining melancholy of say james baldwin plunges the white southerner into wretched shock somewhat alleviated by hot surges of indignant identity with negroes if one is addicted to mr baldwins essays his insistence on showing us his plight is also likely to evoke an occasional cry for mercy like please mr baldwin we all got troubles valdostabom louis lomax is a rather more treacherous writer to read and talk with mr lomax writes sometimes so candidly and in such fresh style of the unsuspected anguish of the negro lot that one is charmed and amused at the satire and force of his prose only to be felled by his insistence too that we behold the perverting misery of race discrimination he talks with an exuberant and amiable vitality in a disarming accent still redolent of south georgia and just when you think everything is going to be all right because he is such a friendly fellow his heavylidded eyes darken and deepen with an impaling effect to tell the uncomfortable truth as he hopes somberly that white people will learn to love before the negro learns to hate other new novels and essays and texan john howard griffins shocker black like me about his southern adventures in negro disguise confront us with unimagined depths of pain and anger among negroes and yet in the dourest and most persistent of the negro writers there seems detectable a thin strong theme of wary optimism about the south a hope for freedom friendship and equality unprecedented between two races living together this great high hope so cautiously suggested by negroes is also entertained by thoughtful white southern writers in a frequently quite emotional assertion of the similarity and natural compatibility of negroes and whites down here the late w j cash patron saint of southern white selfcriticism observed with an intensity comparable to mr baldwins that negro entered into white man as profoundly as white man entered into negro subtly influencing every gesture every word every emotion and idea every attitude and with a biting sorrow comparable to baldwins acutely intelligent and humorshot gloom suggests a southern personality common to negroes and whites which might liberated from our awful shackles make a free and affectionate society in the symposium the south i erner as american l d reddick a negro scholar points out temperamental likenesses between dixie whites and negroes in speech gait food habits and orientation toward life we talk and laugh the same way make the same judgments and weep at similar sentimentalities says reddick quoting charles black that southern whites and negroes are bound in a special bond in a peculiar way they are the same kind of people even their strife is fratricidal james mcbride dabbs in the southern heritage wrote through the processes of history and the grace of god we have been made one people and it is disastrous to talk and act as if we were two if on the contrary we would play the game wholeheartedly together if we would be our deepest selves there is no telling what great age might develop in the south mr dabbs with a white southern love and audacity exceeding any negro literary optimism i know of also wants southerners to rise to the level of loving passionately our rich and varied configuration of people black and white as we love our earth and landscape in which case we should not only solve our greatest problem one of two major problems of the world today but our age would become a challenge to generations yet unborn another writer leslie w dunbar in the autumn virginia quarterly review looks beyond the hope of messrs cash baldwin lomax and dabbs to his own southern white assertion i believe the south will out of its travail and sadness and requited passion give the world its first grand example of two races of men living together in equality and with mutual respect the souths heroic age is with us now maybe mr baldwin and mr lomax ought to come on back home i tremble to consider mr baldwins response to a suggestion that the deep south is his home but he has confided that his alabama parents just barely made it to new york in time for his birth and that traveling south was strange to come back to a place youve never been still his deep south origins and happenso birth in harlem are sufficient for any ancestorworshiping southerner to claim him as rightfully our own anyway it occurs to me that the stingy shy but very eager beginnings of our first grand example to the world are preparing a place a home where all of us may feel like people instead of like whites or negroes this is apparent in the desegregations popping out all over the south so fast you cant count them and the community pride relief elaborately casual acceptance and occasional glad burst of good manners which accompany the forced change maybe mr baldwin amid his own kind of folks who know so well his intelligent gloom and comic ironies might mitigate his melancholy and enrich his wary hope and perhaps the compatibility of white southerners who already love before mr lomax hates might invite and expand his natural and indigenous southern exuberance and idealism maybe not next week but it may not be long before our rich and varied configuration of people black and white will meet as these writers already have to clean repair furnish and light the lamps and fires in our common home garden party at lastourville the lambarene airstrip is no idlewild every time a plane circles you know it is the plane dark heads everywhere lift toward the sky as for the second coming in the land rover we bobbed along the dirt road waved at from the huts and arrived at the airstrip what looked like a hundred people mostly africans were waiting for the plane men in their sunday best in orange trousers and yellow silk shirts women in crazyquilt wraps their children on their backs dignified black officials with their untutored wives vous etes avec une femme ou avec deux the steward asked and crowds of bigeyed children two particularly elegant specimens in rumpled jacketsone with a hawaiian sport shirt underneath another in a jaunty racing capstood a little apart from the crowd after a short time we all scrambled into the old dcthe ingredients for a fine and brotherly jelly if a few screws got loose the captain walked through the cabin a thin somewhat bent and unhappy looking fellow of about fortyfive with a small mustache and eyes which looked disgusted and also a little yellow i remember thinking gastric ulcer bad liver he paced all the way down the cabin and said angrily to the steward get them all up front cant you see we are overweight our point of gravity is much too far to the back all the people behind me were somehow pushed beyond the door which divided the fuselage in two whether they were sitting lying or hanging ill never know for although the door flew open every minute it was kicked closed again too quickly to see what was going on behind it we were flying already and there was the river the schweitzer hospital and the godawful jungle stretching endlessly the stink the heat and the anxiety were almost unbearable there would be three stops before brazzaville at the first stop some africans got off to go to their villages and a few white passengers joined us the second stop would be lastourville the plane touched down and made a sort of jolly jump on what is called a runway in this part of the world we piled out as the chickens and goats scattered before the invasion from outer space the dinnerjacketed gentlemen and their wives and many others clambered into a truck which served as the local limousine service the other passengers walked out of the sun to spend the half hour for loading and unloading in the shade of one of the three small buildings which formed the only shelter on the airstrip the main building was about twenty feet long and one story high with four glassless windows and no door on it in faded lettering was painted lastourville two smaller sheds carried respectively the words meteo and t s f we sat in meteo because there were a few chairs and a bed a few minutes later madame meteo very pretty and young walked in with a child at her breast she sat down to complete the feeding smiling at us only then i noticed that this was not a waiting room but the bedsittingdrawing room of mr and mrs meteo mr meteo also came in soon sat down and said well youll have a long time here more than half an hour i asked ah oui monsieur he said maybe tomorrowhe had the beautiful ivory smile of africaand went on i have just radioed to brazza but whats happened i asked bewildered something wrong but didnt you notice you smashed two wheels of your landing gear coming down i went out and saw indeed that there were more people standing around and under the plane than usual for on an african airstrip there are always a number of unauthorized visitors watching the proceedings of fueling loading and unloading a few of them with lighted cigarettes in their mouths there was very little left of two of our three wheels and the jolly little jump at the landing might well have been our last one the answer that came back from brazza obviously said that it was sunday and que voulezvous cest la periode des vacances but tomorrow morning they would send a plane to pick us up nobody was excited the eighteen passengers merely shrugged their shoulders and the captain found a bottle of whisky we sat in our dead plane waiting for the flight engineer to come back from his explorations in the town of lastourville about five miles away after a while i went for a walk down the road to look at the few mud huts before the first one a woman sat on her haunches a bronze statue she looked at me impassively in front of the second hut an old woman her breasts bare was delousing her daughter the third hut bore a sign with a name and under it ancien combatant an old man in yellow trousers the remains of an army tunic and a faded scarlet fatigue cap on his gray curls arose from a box in his bonedry dirt front yard and saluted gravely his neighbors one in a nightshirt the other in old blue shorts grinned and we exchanged a few words in french in the trembling heat we must have been apparitions to each other back at the plane my fellow passengers were still drinking whisky it was stifling i sat down and read an old parismatch the captain looked a little less grim after his third whisky do we sleep in the plane i asked him maybe he said we have two ddt bombs the steward consoled us pleasantly i know i said because they had fallen on me during the jump there was the sound of a jeep in the distance and the navigator came back he had a bottle in his hand with the compliments of the commissaire de district who was also trying to arrange lodgings for us for the night but it was difficult for lastourville only had four european families there was plenty of space for the african passengers however another truck arrived and we were taken to the heart of the village the road went downhill past the huts i had already seen and kept on going downhill for five hundred feet through a dark funnel of dense virgin forest then all at once we were at the end of the funnel a vast valley spread out below with the wide ogowe river winding through it and rows of mountains receding into a blue background behind it as in a medieval painting deep down in this shangrila a few neat houses african customs of his region but the animals interested him more on his walls were beautifully framed pages from buffons histoire naturelle and most of the books on his shelves were about animals animals are my passion he said as he got up lightly for such a heavy man and waved us to the buffet which had been prepared and here hundreds of miles away from the next settlement in a funnel of virgin forest on a large mahogany table covered with damask waited an exquisite buffet froid you were unexpected and i am sorry but you will just have to take potluck smiled the commissaire waving his arm toward caviar mallosol pate de campagne foie gras thon a la portugaise and thick slices of cold roast beef there were freshly fried potato chips and many more complicated and tasteful things and warm fresh french bread there was an endless supply of mellow bordeaux and a particularly fruity cool moselle wine had the plane really miraculously made so safe a landing or had we already ascended to some afterlife standing around a table piling plates with delicacies in front of wide open doors with the soft murmur of cataracts below and a too esthetic crescent moon over the palm trees after supper we returned to the terrace and more drinks were served in the stillness of the equatorial evening we were all enveloped in irreality how long shall we still be tolerated on this continent mused the priest sipping his cognac i dont know said the commissaire but i wouldnt know what to do in france that i can tell you theyll still need us for a long time to come growled the texaco dealer they arent reasonable enough to see that said the radio man their leaders know that they couldnt operate a radio station that they couldnt drill the oil wells that they havent one single economist but the young hotheads think they can do everything because they are completely ignorant and the russians will try to confirm them in their beliefs and take over we dont want to exchange a mild tyranny for a harsh one said the african journalist we know very well that we got an education from you that without your engineers technicians and doctors we are sunk we need you administratively medically technically but then i am a moderate and i know it yes said the texaco man you know it but still you want your independence dont you and expect us to pay for everything fill the gaps in your budget defend you and give you every service for free do you think that can go on forever what is your press doing to make it clear to your people how much you need us if we get out youll go back to the jungle in a few years time look at the congo he said triumphantly i am told that leopoldville is already beginning to be overgrown with jungle youll start eating each other again the lumberjack joined in viciously i think we wont said the journalist quietly we know it will be difficult but we have men of good will we are divided in tribes and we cannot sweep away the old customs but we have more than we ever had we have a french as a common language we can communicate with each other we want a civilized way of life even the village people want it maybe they dont quite know yet what efforts it will demand of them and your politicians wont tell them either said the pilot mixing in for the first time they are just fighting about who will get the greatest power the biggest car and the most trips to paris or the united nations they will learn and our people will learn to distinguish between them the journalist replied our people are tired of being black subproletarians they feel the need to live like other human beings you have taught them that need if you have taught them anything we may have taught you many needs said the priest maybe you were better off before we came we have taught some of you in order to make you clerks in our offices and mechanics for our caterpillars but we have failed to raise the level of the family for how few girls have we trained it is true your people havent cooperated very much now you want bicycles radios and sewing machines and cameras and you think that is culture and im afraid youll sell your soul to whoever promises things to you you are thinking of the russians again mon pere said the journalist with a smile i grant you that where there are frustrated discontented politicians and povertystricken populations the communists have their chance but we dont want them the chinese communists have done fantastic things in the few years they have been in power but we dont think their example could possibly work in tropical africa on the other hand i grant you that we want the things you have we want housing food hospitals and education especially education but above all we want human dignity you never gave us that did you you took it from us you didnt mind doing things for us but never with us you despised us really now we want to build our countries ourselves for we have learned that we are human beings like you if anything more human than you for a few moments nobody spoke then the priest said what i worry about is that you have no tradition of responsibility except to your clans you have no tradition of the brotherhood of man except within your tribe and we have not been able to instill it in you the african smiled again arent you a bit optimistic about the honesty of your own politicians and your european history as i read it is not exactly a demonstration of brotherhood between your tribesmake it african and it will be different compounded of old and new theirs and ours not a mixture of both heritages but a new compound if this new product frightens us and we cannot accept it we shall lose the continent spiritually politically and economically and it will seal our doom for africa is awake now my host was petting his friend the baboon the moon had disappeared and a hot heavy breeze was blowing on the terrace the guests dozed over their drinks is africa really awake the commissaire said pouring himself a last cognac or do we whites just think so because we are falling asleep he looked at me with a bitter smile and lifted his glass happy dreams mon ami by roy gibbons drdaniel hale williams noted chicago negro surgeon made headline history in he won international acclaim that year as the first surgeon ever to operate successfully on a living human heart an organ previously regarded as forever inaccessible to the surgeons knife this skilled and gifted man died in at age known affectionately as doctor dan he was among the founders of provident hospital and a charter member of the american college of surgeons numerous honors came to him during his productive lifetime in which he also won distinction as a professor of physiology and a brilliant diagnostician in addition to sparking the construction of provident he likewise led the way in setting famous freedmens hospital washington d c on a sound medical foundation as its surgeon in chief dr williams numerous achievements as a medical educator and pioneer are among great contributions which marked the emergence of scientific medicine just before the turn of the century and added to chicagos luster as an internationally renowned haven of healing historians say back in the summer of tempers rose in a saloon not far from provident hospital where dr williams also was that institutions first surgeon in chief the disturbance soon became a brawl a man was stabbed and rushed to the hospital the victim a negro expressman named james cornish was unable to tell the length of the knife blade which had pierced his chest dr dan the red headed negro physician examined the wound and concluded that the blade had entered the mans heart in those days this was considered an inevitably fatal injury the xray had not been invented dr dan therefore had no way of determining by examination how serious the wound was standard practice in those days was to avoid treating internal wounds in the region of the heart to save the mans life dr dan had to venture into unexplored territory there was no penicillin or other wonder drugs blood transfusions had not been developed only crude anesthetics were available and these were not always reliable in those days too if a patients lungs collapsed during surgery there was no method such as exists today to reinflate them automatically everything pointed to repeating the failure experienced by a few daring doctors who had tried entering the heart and failed however as history now records the event a saving quality was present at the disaster scene in the form of a special surgical genius possessed by dr dan he accepted the challenge and the operation was begun as one biographer recalled everyone present must have shuddered when the intrepid surgeon put the point of his scalpel to cornishs inert body dr dan had sent word to a few medical colleagues inviting them to witness the operation six doctors four of them white and two negro crowded into the small operating room first dr dan made an entrance about the size of a knothole into the stricken mans chest this provided a kind of miniature trap doorpermitting him to peer inside just as he had assumed one of the internal arteries was damaged the continued bleeding of that blood vessel would have caused cornishs eventual death with great deftness dr williams tied off the injured vessel and held apart the wound in the heart sac while he examined the fluttering heart muscle the assailants blade had reached that structure too had it penetrated even a fraction of an inch deeper cornish would never have reached the hospital alive fortunately there was little bleeding from the heart itself and dr williams decided that the heart muscle required no stitching he irrigated the wound with a degree fahrenheit salt solution then he grasped the fluttering edge of the severed heart sac with a long forceps he held the edges with considerable difficulty while sewing them together with a suture of fine catgut the trail blazing operation was over three weeks later cornish was again brought into the operating room this time dr dan made a inch incision in the mans chest and through the opening drained off five pints of bloody serum which had accumulated in the pleural cavity there were no signs of infection however and days after he entered the hospital the once dying patient was discharged as cured he was reported still in good health years later with apologies to pepito threetables away sitv ting in the sun the two girls and the blond young man sipped iced vermouths and chatted around them all the languages of western europe crackled and cooed i could not hear their voices but it was easy to tell they were americans the girls as cool and comely as mannequins in orange juice ads wore just a trace more makeup perfectly applied than the other women the man crewcut and cleareyed wore polished cotton chinos on his long casually outstretched legs and there was about all three the glow of good food and good care and unlimited soap and water in palma de mallorca in the late afternoon after siesta time the tourists and international idlers flock to plaza gomila and sit at tables of the outdoor cafes and gossip and drink aperitives and plan their evening dissipations occasionally i sat in the plaza too in the shade for my father and mother had the foresight to relieve me of the necessity of torturing my skin to bake it brown i was sitting there with friends a frenchman and a dutch woman discussing the palma opera season a week away over syrupy palo tunel with soda another acquaintance an englishwoman was to be prima ballerina in the opening opera aida she was a charming woman once very well known long ago she had danced with pavlova and that was why we three were planning to be down front on opening night malicious well maybe but it promised to be quite a show and then glancing up my eyes met those of the blond young man toasting in the sun he smiled and nodded i turned to see who was behind me only a table of spaniards fervently discussing pesetas the favorite national pastime next to futbol and bullfighting no he was smiling and nodding at me i smiled and nodded right back then went on talking about the superannuated ballerina a moment later i glanced up again and the young american was still staring pensively now but seeing me look up the milk and fresh fruit smile flashed quickly over his face he nodded again this time i didnt reciprocate once was enough no point in being ridiculous but i wondered fleetingly what he was up to what his angle was in palma one never knows i soon found out before i caught a ship and took off for west africa i lived in a salmoncolored miniature villa in the middle of a huge garden where flowers and fruit bloom all year round there isnt another house like it on that sunsprayed blueandpastel island there are hundreds of villas yes fabulous estates places fit for kings and often actually occupied by the remnants of europes exiled nobility but none so small and compact and delightfully romantic as mine when i returned from africa rich in experience but virtually penniless my lovely villa was in the hands of someone else fortunately a friend i was invited to put up in what had been a few weeks previously my own guest room water a bit deep for him anyhow i saw you sitting in the square and i made up my mind to tell you that im sorry i bothered you it was just on my mind all the europeans keep asking me about it and telling me they cant understand how things like that can go on in america hell i cant understand it either i could sympathize with him europeans had showered me with so much unwanted sympathy over little rock and assorted racial incidents that i had contemplated passing as a guinean however i reflected how capriciously ironic of fate to implant in this golden innocent the toxic seed of a nations guilt suddenly i had an impulsive idea considering the status of my wallet it was madness say do you have to get right back to your friends i asked how would you like a drink well im meeting the girls later on he hesitated a moment you dont have to buy me a drink he said but id like to what do you say sure i feel like i need one he said with a quiet sigh i led him to the nearest bar and we both ordered cognac we sat on the patio looking northward across the gently rolling sea and we talked until long after the moon rose over the bay of palma on a clear night its an exquisite sight and it was a clear night all the while i kept thinking of pepito and hoping he wouldnt mind too much my not coming home to get him but then there was no need to feel too conscience stricken pepito had all that wonderful garden to romp around in
inside nigeria many foreigners have often seen nigeria with her million people living in square miles of territory not only as a large and exciting country but also as a selfconfident democratic and stable country in which freedom and moderation are the chief determinants of national life no doubt there is some truth in this evaluation although the political stability has often hidden the lacklustre political leadership and venality within a countrys maturity nehru has said is measured by the questions it poses to itself and its failure is often due to its posing the wrong questions just now nigeria politicians talk of tribes chieftaincies and religion while the basic socioeconomic problems of the dayfull employment and social reconstruction for instanceinterest but a few moneybags appeal to them more than lofty thinkers yet the spiritual life of europe today belongs to christ and marx not croesus or charlemagne of asia to buddha rather than famenane or genghis khan and without the creators of vision to guide them the people are doomed to decay the federal government of the northern peoples congress npc and the national council of nigeria and the cameroons ncnc has all the virtues and vices of coalitions especially one between a feudal and a socialdemocratic party there is caution and there is confidence but speed and imagination are often iacidng while the npc is shedding some of the worst excesses of its feudal philosophytribalism and class demarcationat the national level the ncnc has had to abandon much of its socialist dreams of the agitational days before independence for both sir abubakar balewa the npc prime minister and dr nnamdi azikiwe expresident of the ncnc and now nigerias governor general want to see the ni gerian constitution work and therefore they use their influence to dampen the eagerness of their more extreme supporters who want a change in the status quo although their regional colleagues feel themselves free to experiment along feudal or socialist lines as they wish in their sphere of influence ironically the conservative orientation of the federal government has driven the fascistinclined action group opposition more and more to the left so that today the party which in abjured any consorting with foreign ideologies and five years later saw republicanism as the daydream of a lunatic fringe of the nationalist movement has become a great champion of socialist nationalisation and now advocates a republican constitution for nigeria and a union of african states the ag which in the federal election campaign advocated a prowestern foreign policy for nigeria is today urging for a positive neutralist line and friendly relations with the communist states the party is committed to a policy of creating three more states out of the existing regions three in number and it therefore sees the recent decision by the nigerian parliament to establish a fourth midwest region as a triumph of its policy curiously enough it was the ncnc which under dr azikiwes leadership spearheaded the struggle for nigerian freedom and laid the foundations of its socialist and republican traditions but under the necessities of office today finds itself fighting a rearguard action against the forces of political radicalism in the country like the social democratic parties of western europe the british labour party french socialist party the german spd etc whose dilemma it is facing todaya choice between the old capitalist enemy and the new communist ogre the ncnc is now fighting shy of nationalization of the basic industries and the establishment of a republic what with its recurrent internal crises and lack of clarity as to objectives it has ceased to enjoy that overwhelming mass appeal which made it the truly national organization in the heyday of its struggle for national freedoma fate that has met the pakistan muslim league and the sudanese umma party whose ineptitude and corruption invited a military dictatorship in their country a few years after independence to recapture the massive popular support of its agitational days the ncnc must needs establish high standards of integrity and austerity such as dr nkrumah is currently imposing on his cpp colleagues in ghana in place of the acquisitive and exhibitionist propensities of the leaders the party must no longer mistake mediocrity for moderation and must ensure that its standardbearers are not men of thermidor little men of great inheritance who are not seasoned in the struggle or attuned to the powerful forces now moving the continent of africa today many nigerians and their foreign admirers have often pointed to the size of the country as a criterion for its leadership of africa but size alone is not enough and to advance nigerias claim to african leadership she must not only have something to give to others in the sphere of goods and ideas but also she must produce great leaders frances greatness was once focussed on a louis xiv or a napoleon as indias contemporary influence in world affairs can be attributed to the greatness of her nehru in africa the struggle for independence has thrown up a number of towering personalities nassar in egypt houghuetboigny in ivory coast sekou toure in guinea jomo kenyatta in kenya nkrumah in ghana and so on has nigeria produced a dominant national figure who can be said to exceed these in greatness or who with her vast national resources behind him can assert the nigerian personality on the world stage to the extent for instance that an nkrumah has done for ghana or a mao tse tung for china many nigerians will say that dr azikiwe is the man and at one time there could have been no doubt as to the greatest african of them all but when in nigeria the people reflect their uncertainty in the multiplicity of their national leadership prime minister balewa is always mentioned along with governor general azikiwe and northern premier ahmadu bello leader of balewas party the northern peoples congress while opposition leader obafemi awolowo and the other regional premiers michael okpara for the eastern region and samuel akintola for the western region closely trail behind with diverse followerships and ideologies on top of this a sizable number of extreme radicals reject the leadership of all six and so africa does not know nigerias man of destiny just because nigerians themselves do not know him to lead people one must be able to reflect their inmost moods and interests in all parts of africa today there is an irresistible demand for independence for selfexpression for developmentan instinctive desire which some englishspeaking nationalists have described as the assertion of the african personality and the frenchspeaking africans see in terms of negritudeand it follows that no nation will be accepted as leader of contemporary africa which does not reflect this moving desire of africans everywhere to assert themselves after many centuries of imperialist degradation this mystic faith in independence has also an important corollary for many african nationalists the unity of africa and breaking down of the arbitrary barriers imposed by the th century scramble for africa by european powers it does not matter if this desire for union is seen by the realists as a mere daydream for dreams are the stuff out of which great realities are woven and in our lifetime we have seen idealist dreams about socialism and the freedom of afroasian nations realised to a marvellous degree what is more regional groupings are sprouting forth in both east and west of the continent and recent conferences in tunis monrovia addis ababa and cassablanca indicate that the idea of african unity is gaining ground all over the continent the question now is has nigeria this strong mystic faith in african unity and independence i am not sure that she does as yet at least to the degree necessary to inspire others to dare for these great ideals the popularity which countries like ghana and the united arab republic enjoy among many africans derive from their pulsating faith in the cause of african unity and independence even of african socialism thus when egypt challenged successfully the might of anglofrench imperialism over the suez canal in or ghana rushed aid to distressed guinea congo and south african nationalists she elicited the admiration of ardent nationalists everywhere who wish quickly to redress the wrongs which theoretical oppositional elements are being systematically repressed in all three regions through the agency of the customary courts and denial of state patronage while the freedom of speech is nullified by the men of means who can fool and mislead the people through their control of the organs of public opinion moreover the big monopolies have made nonsense of personal freedom by their control of the organs of employment and entertainment fixing their own prices and influencing the law in their sole interest it is true that independence has brought increased prosperity to the governmentariansthe ministers contractors senior civil servants and their dependentsbut the vast majority of the people live in a background of dismal and abject poverty born to a regime of endless night this squandering of national values has had the worst effect among the youth who forever see promise mocked by performance and look in vain for any systematic revival of national culture or for the rationalisation of foreign techniques in order to usher increased wellbeing for the people yet nigerialarge rich radianthas a great destiny for in its illimitable space thought and things can develop and this slumbering giant is likely some day to startle the world in an age in which the problems of africa dominate international politics rupture in labors ranks much of the civil_rights progress that has been achieved in recent years can be attributed to the effective cooperation of jewish and negro antidiscrimination agencies these groups together with the support of key trade union officials are largely responsible for the passage of fair employment legislation in eighteen states they are the effective force behind the drive for open occupancy in housing they have backed attempts to implement the u s supreme courts school desegregation decision and they have given their time money and moral support to the students involved in the movement yet the fact is that the negro jewish civil_rights coalition now faces disruption a dissolution that seems symptomatic of the worsening relations between white and negro liberals in general the winds of change sweeping africa are also stirring the surfaces of negro life in america they are setting events in motion which seem to be taking the american negro into increasingly militant and uncharted courses of action what white liberals often regard as progress negroes increasingly have come to reject as mere tokenism and correspondingly many white liberals have begun to regard negro militancy as racist selfseekingthe first cracks in the negrojewish civil_rights coalition appeared after the formation of the negro american labor council an organization of negro trade unionists founded two years ago by a philip randolph president of the brotherhood of sleeping car porters and sole negro member of the aflcio executive council the nalc has emerged as a most outspoken critic of token progress in race relations within the labor movement while several jewish trade union leaders and two important jewish labor agenciesthe jewish labor committee and the american jewish committees national labor servicemore and more have been placed in the position of defending the official line of organized labor that the unions have made substantial progress in civil_rights job equality and related issues thus to the comfort and cheer of many conservative elements within the unions the creation of the nalc has served to divide longtime allies in the struggle for civil_rights on july seventyfive negro trade unionists met in new york city at the request of a philip randolph to discuss the problems which confront negroes in the labor movement and those which face the negro union leaders within the negro community in the course of his long career randolph had made several previous attempts to build a mass organization rooted in the negro working class the most notable of which was the famed march on washington movement that resulted in an executive order from president franklin d roosevelt in to establish the wartime fepc he was unsuccessful however along with frank crosswaith and othersin developing a more permanent organization under the name of the negro labor committee the principal difficulty being the lack in that period of a sizable and firm base of negro union members but as herbert northrup among others has shown large numbers of negroes entered unions through the world war ii labor shortages and the postwar economic boom the result is that today any negro labor organization has as a potential base some million negroes who are now members of the aflcio moreover a growing number of negroes hold posts in labor organizations both large and small and participate regularly in union conventions ironicallyin the light of subsequent eventsthe committee of seventyfive summoned in by randolph decided that what the present situation required was a permanent organization patterned after the jewish labor committee the nalc would speak for organized labor in the negro community just as the jewish labor committee did in the jewish community and in carrying on its fight for equality within the labor movement the new organization would ally itself as its jewish counterpart had done with other civil_rights organizations the committee of seventyfive called for a founding convention in a declaration which foreshadowed the tone and style of the nalc established some ten months after this first meeting we resent jim crow locals we deplore the freezeout against negroes in labor apprenticeship and training programs we disclaim the lack of upgrading and promotional opportunities for negroes we repudiate the lockout against negroes by some unions we above all reject tokenism that thin veneer of acceptance masquerading as democracy since hundreds of thousands of negroes are the victims of this hypocrisy we ourselves must seek the cure in terms of hundreds of thousands in the dimensions of a mass organization randolphs reasons for helping to establish the negro american labor council are as he presents them clearcut and logical he argues that since the trade unions are essentially urban organizations and since negroes are moving to cities in large numbers it thus follows that labors future is tied up with the future of the negro randolph emphasizes that aflcio president george meany is not a racist yet meany hasnt a sense of the urgency of the question that is necessary in the th century randolph doubts in fact if anyone except a negro can have that sense the new organization over which randolph presides is then a response to the basic need of the negro masses to have a voice of their own and as randolph firmly adds the voice of black labor is not going to be consonant with those voices that come from nonnegro sources or from negroes themselves that are nonlabor there is another side to the activities of the nalc randolph believes that his group represents the last chance of preserving the influence of organized labor in negro affairs the negro community possesses two principal mass organizations other than the political machine james z wilson notes in his important new book negro politics the labor unions and the churches in recent years however the unions have come under attack because of their discriminatory practices and organized labor has come to be viewed less as an instrument of negro militancy than as a proper object of it under these circumstances the officers of the nalc as veteran trade unionists think that their organization can save labors standing within the negro community insofar as the nalc was created by negro union staffersand not by negro workers or by rank and file union membersit might be called a middleclass organization however the most serious economic consideration behind its existence is the plight of the negro worker economists are given to treating unemployment in the united states as troublesome pockets of an expanding economy but to negro workers these pockets are a sea of quicksand sucking them down to extinction according to official labor department figures nonwhites comprise a full per cent of all the currently unemployed this figure includes puerto ricans as well as negroes but the departments statistics for the past winter also show that the negro unemployment rate is almost twice as high as the rate of white unemployment per cent as against per cent for whites further an urban league survey of unemployment among negroes in cities reveals that the percentage of the negro work force unemployed is frequently twice to three times that of the total unemployment rate thus in chicago where the total unemployment rate is per cent the percentage of negro jobless is in louisville kentucky the total is per cent while the corresponding figure for negroes is per cent in pittsburgh the figures are as against per cent in new york city as against per cent these statistics also suggest why with much less urgency by the white american community than by the negro in st louis there are unemployed negroes out of a total of jobless in gary indianamore strikingly out of a total of in detroit out of a total of but even when he has a job the black workers position is far from enviable in the median wage of the negro male worker was only per cent as much as that of the white worker as against randolph comments wryly when a negro worker goes into the market as a consumer he cannot presume to pay only per cent for comparable goods and services purchased by white workers the fact is negroes pay relatively much higher prices similarly white women averaged a year while negro women who it should be added are more often the breadwinners of the familyonly earned various staff members of the urban league all believe discrimination to be the main cause of negro unemployment and they all feel that trade unions have a lot to answer for in this regard shelton granger executive director of the leagues cleveland branch puts it succinctly rate of unemployment high rate of discrimination higher major offenders are banks insurance companies retail outlets and building trades unions marvin e jones vocational services secretary of the baltimore urban league insists that until unions and employers cease to discriminate by race thus presenting the opportunity for negroes to participate in apprenticeable trades management training programs etc permanent relief is inevitable for the unskilled worker though this last point may be overstated the fact remains that the position of the negro worker is steadily deteriorating in manufacturing negroes have been confined by and large to the semiskilled and unskilled jobs often these were dirty jobs that white workers did not want yet now because of the drop in the number of manufacturing jobs due in turn to the recession and the encroachment of automation competition for all kinds of workincluding semi and unskilled jobsis considerably more intense than it has been for some time in this situation the negro competes at a great disadvantage take for example the building tradesone of the few areas where the work force is expanding secretary of labor arthur j goldberg recently advocated that the aflcios building and construction trades department develop a steppedup apprenticeship training program he pointed out that if we are to fulfill our needs in the construction field during the next ten years we will have to produce about million additional skilled craftsmen here assuredly is a potential field of employment for negro workers yet under present practices they are all but barred from it the naacp estimates that less than one per cent of the apprentices in the construction industry throughout the united states are negro even in the relatively liberal state of new york the proportion of negroes in the building trades apprenticeship programs during the last ten years has gone up exactlyfrom to per cent julius thomas urban league director of industrial relations reports that in out of major cities the league did not find a single negro apprentice there was one negro apprentice electrician in each of four cities and one plumbing apprentice in five throughout the cities surveyed the urban league found a total of roughly negro apprenticesamong all fields its difficult says thomas to encourage a negro youngster to take an interest in apprenticeship training when it takes us three years to get one negro electrician hired in the nations capital roy wilkins of the naacp has remarked that given a continuation of present rates of advance it will take negroes years or until the year to secure equal participation in skilledcraft training and employment but thomas adds unless we get that training were in for becoming permanent wards of the richest country in the world the merger of the afl and the cio in achieved very little to alleviate these conditionsor so many negroes believewe have not realized says dr james m nabrit jr president of howard university in this combination of the afl and the cio what we had hoped for in the labor movement randolph expresses the feelings of many negroes when he says that unless the aflcio can be shaken loose from the position it now holds negro youth has no future the question is can the nalc do the job perhaps this question is best answered by illustrating the power which the nalc seems able to wield secretary goldberg in february of this year accepted an invitation to speak at a washington d c conference sponsored by the nalc the day he was scheduled to speak turned out to be an extremely busy one for the secretary so he suggested that william wirtz his undersecretary and a former law partner of adlai stevenson would be happy to substitute nalc leaders however said that they would have the secretary of labor or no one goldberg showed up president kennedy was also careful enough of the sensibilities involved to send the conference his greetings although by normal political standards such as attendance the meeting was not a success in contrast the aflcio not only did not send greetings or a representative but pointedly refused to send even an observer from its civil_rights department it cannot be said however that the nalc has won widespread support among negro workers its growth so far has failed to match the expectations of randolph and his followers the organization claims a membership of and a rundown of the various unions to which nalc vice presidents ber longmost of them are paid functionariesindicates that these members are drawn from the auto workers the steelworkers international union of electrical workers hotel restaurant retail clerks district of the retail wholesale department store union the brotherhood of sleeping car porters the longshoremen and the teamsters nalc chapters have been established in most of the major industrial centers of the north chicago new york pittsburgh youngstown these chapters function in a variety of ways which again serves to illustrate certain of the nalcs strengths and weaknesses the detroit chapter called the trade union leadership council is with members the largest and most active group in the nalc it is almost exclusively political and as one might expect largely concerned with the affairs of the united auto workers one of the tulc critics declares when a slate for union offices is drawn up especially in the uaw its just about got to be cleared with the tulc but there hasnt been any action aimed at discrimination or any effort made to bust through barriers erected by the building trades to negro employment the chicago nalc a chapter of some which is less fully oriented toward the activity of a single union has tried mainly to get a few negro youngsters out of the vocational schools trained in buildingtrade skills training is obtained outside the building trades regularly endorsed washburn school for apprentices negro nonunion skilled tradesmen do the teaching then if youngsters are rejected because of color we build up the record mobilize public opinion and prepare the way for a breakinwe hope the new york city groupanother chapter that draws from a wide variety of unionsengages mainly in fundraising activities the nalc has bypassed the usual union structure to recruit members and to ask for support it cannot or feels that it cannot appeal to union executive organs for support financial or otherwise as both the jewish civil_rights agencies and the naacp do it has turned instead to the negro churcheswith what response it is difficult to determine one thing however is clear the nalc cannot as yet mount the kind of communitywide offensive against job discrimination that a group of ministers recently did in philadelphia by conducting selective boycotts to force companies to open up hiring and upgrade negro workers why has the nalc failed to achieve the status and power that its founders were so confident it could have according to one active member of the organization it has been bugged from the start by confusion as to its role the labor secretary of the naacp for example vigorously performs many of the functions that might be thought to be the special province of a group like the nalc randolph however argues that the trouble stems from a lack of funds to carry on a nationwide systematic organizing campaign and from the intimidation of negro unionists by white leaders still others believe that the fault has been the lack of guidance from the national office the absence of program and direction one white opponent of the nalc says that it doesnt fight cases doesnt try to break in and doesnt send in complaints to the aflcio civil_rights department many other criticisms have been made of the nalc on the one hand its leaders have been called uncle toms one labor leader asserts that the nalc is a creature of functionaries appointed by white elected leaders to placate or to serve as channels to negro members and on the other hand george meany has told randolph at the february aflcio executive council meeting youve been doing a job outside the labor movement not in cooperation with us it has also been charged that the nalc is a racist caucus and that one of its prime goals is the election and appointment of negroes to union posts if its leaders succeed in building a powerful and militant mass organization presumably they will be able to maintain their position of power within the rapidly changing negro community the nalcs answer to its critics is perhaps best summarized by herbert hill labor secretary of the naacp who has worked closely with the new organization since its inception hill argues that the nalc had a choice of degenerating into an apologist for the labor movement within the negro community or of pursuing a vigorous role it did not want to compete with other organizations to give more awards to george meany it is this vigor hill feels that is resented by aflcio leaders and by the spokesmen of the jewish labor committee and the national labor service of the american jewish committee the dispute between the nalc on the one side and these two jewish labor agencies on the other has many ramifications the jlc was originally founded in long after jews had won recognition for their important role in the building of the american la bor movementand first served as a rescuerelief operation to aid jewish trade unionists and socialists in escaping from nazism and stalinism from the beginning the jlc has eschewed internal union politics altogether except possibly in predominantly jewish unions and only after world war ii did it become really active in the field of civil_rights like other jewish defense agencies the jlc operates on the assumption that the problem of bigotry and inequality is indivisible its technique is to place its staff people in key cities where they organize local labor committees to combat discrimination today the jlc has ten field representatives heading various state and city labor council antidiscrimination efforts william becker for example the jlc official in san francisco is generally credited with being the prime mover in californias adoption of a state fep law two years ago the american jewish committees national labor service also voids internal union politics but operates in a slightly different fashion from the jlc it was for example instrumental in getting both the afl and cio to develop their own fulltime civil_rights departments the ajcs national labor service also performs an educational function providing unions with civil_rights literature and advice in time the jlc and the national labor servicedespite their protests to the contrarycame to be considered by many white unionists as the voice of pronegro labor within the aflcio one source of the current conflict between the nalc and these two jewish agencies can be found in this confusion but a more immediate cause was an accident of history the appointment of charles zimmerman the jlcs chief civil_rights spokesman as chairman of the aflcio civil_rights committee just at a time when negro militancy was on the rise one jewish civil_rights professional explains this particular development in the following way among professionals in intergroup relations the jews are the longest in the field the most skilled and most experienced negro professionals resent this negroes have developed their own leadership and they dont want whitesjews or anybody elseto be in the forefront of the civil_rights fight deep bitterness now exists on both sides negro unionists have criticized the aflcio civil_rights department for inviting leaders of the jlc and the director of the ajcs national labor service harry fleischman to participate in trade union civil_rights conferences while not inviting either the nalc or the naacp in the past fleischman zimmerman who recently resigned from his post with the aflcio after serving four years and emmanuel muravchik field director of the jlcs antidiscrimination department have worked closely with randolph on civil_rights matters and jlc staff members in some instances even helped to organize nalc chapters but this cooperation broke down within the nalcs first year the jlc says one nalc activist is too eager to see progress where it aint he cites a press release based on a jlc survey hailing as a year of race relations progress within the unions there was no survey and not much progress he believesand he is not alone in this beliefthat the two jewish agencies are more interested in protecting their relationship with aflcios top leaders than they are in furthering civil_rights within the labor movement many jewish trade unionists are antagonizedand somewhat puzzledby the point frequently made in nalc statements that only negroes are entitled and able to speak for the negroes this puts off many jewish unionists who otherwise might be sympathetic to the nalc theyll tell me about discrimination asks a jewish trade union leader yet the jewish labor committee is most frequently cited by nalc spokesmen as a comparable organization and as a justification for the negros right to organize a committee of his own though many outside observers believe that both the jlc and the i ajcs national labor service have defended labors record of progress in combating discrimination much more vigorously than is necessary muravchik and fleischman argue that more can be done to promote the cause of civil_rights in the un ions by combining praise with crit icism this attitude exposes them to attack herbert hill for example calls them apologists for racism fleischman replies that hills approach discourages good guys from pushing civil_rights why do it at all if all youre going to get is blame for tokenism anyway they ought to get credit for things done i dont see this as a whitewash of labor racists one wonders if this growing antagonism between the jewish and negro labor camps is a precursor of strained relations between the larger jewish and negro defense agencies and ultimately between the two minority communities in general the deterioration in negrojewish relations can be found in many areas beyond the narrow confines of labors civil_rights circle negro ghettoes are spilling over into older jewish neighborhoods negro small businessmen are competing with jewish businessmen for the same customers aspiring negro politicians are striving against jewish politicians for leadership in minority group areas though conflict seems inevitable and natural as the urban scene changes some jews have been guilty of racial bias that has been newly precipitated in the white community even among people who were previously convinced of their freedom from it by aggressive negro demands for full equality and there has also been a revival of antisemitism among negroes enough to cause some of the negro press to cater to it occasionally it may well be that what james baldwin has called the negros naked and unanswerable hatred of all whites will come in this difficult period to center on the jew whatever its ramifications the split between the jewish and negro elements in labor is likely to widen until the position of the negro worker dramatically improves such improvement depends of course upon a number of external factors one is the effectiveness of the kennedy administration in enforcing the nodiscrimination clause in government contracts in this connection the immediate response of the administration to naacp demands for investigation into discrimination at the marietta georgia plant of republic aviation is clearly a good sign but even administration support will not be adequate unless drastic action alleviates chronic unemployment and prevents discriminatory unemployment generally there is also a pressing need on the part of organized labor for strong and imaginative action against discriminationparticularly against barriers in the building trades george meanys offer personally to recruit qualified negro apprentices in order to break discrimination among the washington d c construction unions was a gesture in this direction but so far it has proved to be no more than that another social consequence of continued discrimination is certain the further spread of the black nationalism bewailed by white and negro civil_rights spokesmen alike randolph attacks the chauvinist aspects of black nationalism in nearly all of his speeches but his statements also emphasize the conditions which give rise to such chauvinism the basic remedy for black nationalismwhich can become a danger to social peace as white nationalism is a danger to social peaceis the abolition of white nationalism which expresses itself in lynchings mob law disenfranchisement segregation and discrimination randolph does not believe that negro trade unionists are under the influence of the black muslims the current extreme exponents of black nationalism within the negro community but it is clear that the movement already wields its strongest appeal among the unorganized and voiceless negro masses there are signs that the muslims have already begun to exert strong pressure on the nalc and its leadership this pressure in turn partly explains the intensity of the nalcs attack against the unions for in any confrontation with the muslims the nalc will be at a great disadvantage until such time as it can defend trade unionism without having to apologize for the adverse effect on some union practices on negro life in america the world and a threeyearold there is a little boy of my acquaintance who is very happy and very friendly hes the normal type threeyearold with all the afflictions common to that age group he is deaf when he doesnt want to hear an order he sometimes sasses his mother and occasionally throws temper tantrums that last until broken up by several smart slaps to the rear he delights in daredevil stunts that make his mother quake with terror but all these things are normal for little boys and not to be taken too seriously the important things are that he is very normal and very dear to his parents and like the little girl in the nursery rhyme when hes good hes very very good he will sometimes stop in the middle of a game to say i love you mommy he loves an audience and will entertain them with several catchy tunes from a tv nursery school by counting from to saying his a b cs up to f and pledging allegiance to the flag he drops everything to watch the tv commercials many of which he knows by heart he loves to brush his teeth but usually eats most of the toothpaste and he makes you think of cherubim when he sings jesus loves me even though a few moments before he pierced all ears in the vicinity with an unearthly shriek for no apparent reason all very normal and as i said very friendly when his mother or grandmother takes him to the supermarket he says hi to everyone and everything on the street people dogs and trees the reactions of the humans are varied and interesting most even those in a great hurry pause smile and say hi gently some speak vaguely as though its an interruption they dont exactly resent but dont exactly relish either others look down for he isnt very tall suck in their mouths and hurry past when this happens the little boy looks puzzled for a few seconds but being three years old quickly forgets in saying the next hi because hes curious about everything one day he will ask why those people dont speak and his mother will have to try as best she can to explain shell have to tell him that he represents in miniature a minority group hated by some for the color of their skins and the size makes no difference that the people who wont speak to him here are representative of those in other parts of the country who throw eggs at sixyearolds for the crime of wanting the education their parents pay taxes for but she wont tell him the way these things affect her she wont tell him that the sight of children and old people mistreated by mobs fills her with a helpless rage that breeds hate and the desire to hurt them as they hurt these innocents who are aspiring to be treated as free and equal humans but she knows that these people should be pitied more than those with the most dreadful ailments known to medical science for the disease of bigotry corrodes the soul and so she is ashamed to hate so much and profess to be a christian for she must be able to guide herself before trying to direct another life she wont tell him these things instead shell tell him they are fortunate to live in a section of the country where any person with intelligence has a good chance of being able to use it shell tell him of the fine school she attended that he will soon attend where all students are given the same opportunities to learn and the same punishments when they dont try hard enough where they all eat in the same cafeteria and use the same water fountains and rest rooms where the qualified members of his race turn up on lady of the lockup he steel looks softer v cty under a coat of fresh it jl paint but steel is still steel each cellblock is done in a pastel feminine color there is a pink room a couple of blue rooms green rooms a yellow room and a gray room but steel is still steel bars are still bars and you cant see anything through the side windows but a brick wall on some days puddles form on the roof between the windows and the brick wall and the girls know its raining outside and on some days the afternoon sun comes slanting in through the bars and the girls know the weather is fine all this steel around you kind of seeps in a thin woman with sunken cheeks and a boyish haircut said one day recently and when you cant see nothing but a brick wall that gets to you too committed on a vagrancy charge she stared thoughtfully at the ranks of gray bars that closed in around her im getting out this afternoon she said im getting out nearby jail matron geneva reardon stood with a big key ring in her hand and smiled a warm open smile geneva reardon understands how little things like sunshine and cigarets and candy and lipstick can become very big to a woman in the davidson county jail she knows that sometimes just having somebody around who will listen to your troubles gets to be big she knows because she spends eight or nine hours a day six days a week in the house of steel on the seventh floor of the davidson county courthouse she listens to a lot of troubles and often the troubles bring tears trouble gets them here she says in a voice thats soft and kind of throaty a lot of them are young and scared and pathetic a lot of them come from broken homes and never had a chance everybody calls her miss geneva her hair is gray her color tan but she has found that trouble seldom makes color distinctions hers is a manysided job a lot of it involves supplying prisoners both male and female white and negro with the things they need from the courthouse commissary like cigarets and stationery combs and razor blades candy bars soft drinks and ice cream she often calls their families she calls their lawyers she tries to find answers for questions like when is my trial coming up and my babys been sick miss geneva can you find out how he is and how can i make bond she handles their money for them each withdrawal from personal effects is replaced by a receipt bearing the prisoners signature sometimes she dips into her own pocket recently a woman in her fifties was jailed on a bad check charge she had come up from florida and didnt have a dime when the case came up for trial the judge dismissed it but freedom left her stranded miss geneva slipped her a dollar for a meal you can eat across the street she said then you come back while the woman was gone the matron made arrangements for her with travelers aid two days later she was on her way back home they send me letters and cards she says every once in awhile i hear from one of the boys whos gone to prison from here one time a woman invited me to come and visit her in california then one day she called me long distance she said when you come out miss geneva dont tell my family where you met me they dont know ive been in trouble but i dont plan to go ive been to california miss geneva figured the last thing she would ever do was work in a jail born and reared in nashville she attended a catholic school took a business course at tennessee ai state university and worked for years for two doctors who shared a downtown office eventually both of her employers died and she was out of a job when sheriff leslie jett was elected and started shuffling personnel some of genevas friends in the courthouse put in a word for her and she was hired she went to work last sept at first i was afraid to come up here she says id never been around a jail before i had no idea what it would be like but i found out it is altogether different from what i thought it would be already she has glimpsed the tragic and the sordid sides of life behind bars we had one boy who had a new baby he had never seen and he was going to prison his wife brought the baby to jail he sat on a bench and said i want to hold the baby she put it in his arms he held the baby and cried this same prisoner she adds had engaged in a socalled kangaroo court in jail which involved brutality and sexual perversion among a small group of prisoners sometimes there are a dozen women in jail charged with all sorts of crimes from drunkenness and vagrancy to forgery bouncing checks assault and murder the drunks are usually repeaters margaret is an example she turns up about once a month one day recently she sat at the long metal table in the cell for white women dragging on a cigaret and bemoaning the injustice of it all they said i was drunk she declared i was drinking buttermilk they put me in for being drunk on buttermilk she wore a blackandwhite checked dress her hair was stringy her face puffy her eyes bleary and sad now miss geneva there she said shes sweet shell treat you right nearby sat two girls awaiting trial for forgery there was ann thin and pale hair brittle from too much reddish dye and too little shampoo she said she was but looked much younger were something special said ann who boasts of a long juvenile record we got big headlines when they pulled us in her partner linda who also said she was seemed quieter more thoughtful her hair was dark brown and she wore a tight black dress that bared her shoulders forgerys no good she said not when you get a long time behind bars at the moment the girls shared the coveted pink room a cellblock containing four bunks with steel walls painted a bright flamingo their personal things were scattered around and they seemed right at home nobodys gonna get this cell said linda i figure well be in here a good long while yet our trial doesnt come up till september and i dont see how we can make bond they promised me theyre going straight when they serve their time said miss geneva softly thats right miss geneva said linda we aint gonna do nothin more leastways not here in nashville the matron produced a batch of mail and handed a letter to ann i got a boy friend in the cell right next door said ann he writes to me every day this jails all right if you like it interjected margaret but me i dont like it miss geneva has found a formula of her own for getting along with prisoners kindness she says always works as an example she cites the case of a yearold girl who was awaiting trial for murder she came in sullen hostile and demanding preferential treatment i went out of my way to be nice says the matron in about a week we were getting along just fine i think it shamed her last christmas the male prisoners chipped in and presented her with a fivepound box of candy and one of the women knitted her a white stole i like my job she says thoughtfully i feel like im helping people who need help henry armstrong ii t was friday night and a few pugilistic hopefuls were working out in the ringside athletic club at a easton avenue upstairs over a good will industries store a punching bag made a thunderous noise a muscular youth rhythmically skipped rope a traditional exercise for training fighters in a foot roped square an agile young fellow with wide shoulders shadow boxed cutting an imaginary foe to ribbons with his fancy footwork feinting and darting punches he stopped abruptly hi champ he said with awesome respect to the man in the white sport shirt who walked up and leaned against the ropes appraisingly the man in the white sport shirt was henry armstrong who was serving gratuitously as athletic director of the ringside club a little over years ago he was one of the great fighters of the modern era and the only man ever to hold three world championships at the same time he grew up in st louis henry armstrong was now though he didnt look nearly that old he weighed around which was a good pounds over his fighting weight it was years since he had crawled through the ropes to face an opponent his fair weather friends and the good time charleys and the crowds that cheered him were gone and so was the he had made in the ring when he was a conquering hero to the faithful oldtimers who knew him in his prime and to the youngsters who have heard or read about his legendary ring prowess he is still the champ but there is another designation which is much more important to him now he is the rev henry armstrong ten years ago long after his fighting days were over he turned to god and was ordained a baptist minister of the gospel since then he has preached from hundreds of pulpits has addressed numberless organizations in his evangelism he has been particularly interested in building youth physically and spiritually believing that god has his hand in many things henry armstrong feels that his great record in winning three boxing crowns may have been part of his longrange planning it made him an idol gave him great influence with youth ergo the triple championship set up a platform for his evangelism among the young henry armstrong was a youth himself just on the threshold of his amazing career when he left st louis more than years ago the decades that followed were turbulent and epic and he did not come home again to stay until about a year and a half ago his return then was almost unnoticed and just as quiet has been his sojourn with mrs velma armstrong a st louisan who is his second wife they live in a modest duplex at a penrose underway right now at the ringside athletic club on easton avenue is a unique experiment in the combined religious and athletic approach to youth the gymnasium was dedicated as a church it will be a gymnasium with the usual bag punching rope skipping sparring and such during the week but on sunday the spacious gymnasium is filled with folding chairs and services are held it is my own idea said henry armstrong and much good may come of it i am a sports figure and i am trying to exert a good influence on youth in the sports field there is nothing more appropriate than that there should be a church in a gymnasium for this purpose it could develop into a great work for christ though okley clark owner of the ringside club and the rev mr armstrong are both baptists the gymnasium services are open to all creeds and colors it was in the cotton country near columbus miss that henry armstrong got his first look at the world on dec he was the eleventh of children in a sharecropper family named jackson he was called henry jackson after his father he was little but powerful durable and determined the boll weevil and the flood waters of the tom bigbee river discouraged the jacksons and sent them migrating north to st louis when henry was they settled around the papin and chouteau sector west of jefferson and henry went to the toussaint louverture school the main recreation of the neighborhood kids was fighting and though henry was inclined toward peace and nonaggression he had to do more than his share of scrapping because he was little he compensated by going in for body building and in his basement on josephine street accumulated an assortment of exercising machines as he grew up he worked as a bowling alley pinboy haunted the gym of the old pine street ymca which turned out many a fine boxer he later attended vashon high school graduated in l i years was poet laureate of his class an excellent student with ambition he wanted to go to college and amount to something he had notions of being a doctor but his mother and grandmother always wanted him to be a preacher when he graduated from high school in he got a job with a railroad section gang laying tracks at carondelet and then one day a wayward wind blew a sports page his way with a headline that announced kid chocolate had received a purse for defeating a singer in rounds what fabulous pay for minutes work thats for me henry announced im going away and become a champion and when i come back here ill be riding in a big shiny limousine just like kid chocolate he went to pittsburgh a good boxing town with a couple of fighter friends but he soon came rolling back in a beatenup old nash amid the jeers of his acquaintances he had been knocked out in his first professional fight when he entered the ring underfed and exhausted it was the only time in his whole career that he was put down for the count he won a second fight but the pittsburgh campaign which he fought under the name of melody jackson was an economic and artistic flop humiliated he and an older fighter friend harry armstrong sneaked off hopped a freight hoboed their way eventually to los angeles then regarded as the land of milk and honey by okies and other hardup folks henry started all over again as an amateur which meant he had to change his name to keep his oro record in pittsburgh from being detected so henry melody jackson became henry armstrong he took the last name from his longtime pal and sometime trainer and fellow adventurer harry armstrong he learned fighting could be a hungry unremunerative vocation he also learned what it was like to be a human chattel his first manager tom cox paid for his contract sold him later to wirt ross for ross in a few years sold him to eddie mead for the money being put up by actors a jolson and george raft henry got none of the profits of his sale after amateur fights of which he won he turned pro in and rapidly became one of the great fighters of modern times he was a formidable fighting machine a paragon of endurance he delivered a ripping storm of blows an incessant barrage from the time a bout started until it ended sports writers soon gave him such nicknames as hammering henry hurricane hank the human buzz saw the human dynamo perpetual motion and homicide henry he scored knockouts in his professional career alone between and he won straight fights he fought over times altogether and were title bouts he earned more than in he was elected to boxings exclusive hall of fame he started out in the featherweight pounds class and then successfully invaded the lightweight and welterweight divisions he had to knock over petey sarron oct and a couple of others before he got clear claim to the featherweight title he won the welterweight title from barney ross on may and the lightweight title from lou ambers on august henry armstrong was at the peak he was the unprecedented triple crown holder the toast of fightdom he remembered his mothers prediction at the time ot his birth that he would some day be the big cheese of the family that the whole world would know her boy and she also had said some day hell be a preacher yes he would be a preacher some day but not yet first he had to go through an agonizing or deal that would make him humble and suppliant he had hardly reached the top of the mountain he had hardly glimpsed the world at his feet when he began going down the other side in a return match lou ambers turned the tables won a slashing victory over armstrong on august and regained his title young and strong fritzie zivic of pittsburgh on october defeated armstrong and snatched the welter title from his faltering hands zivic beat him even worse scoring a technical knockout in the th in a second bout january henry armstrong was washed up after one of the most dazzling of all ring careers because his eyes had been gashed badly he was warned not to fight any more but he had been prodigal he needed money he hit the comeback trail and made a good chunk of dough but there were still too many parties there were bad investments too and he didnt have it any more he could lick secondraters yes but the old speed was gone the boys at the top were too good for him now on february he got a pounding from a palooka named chester slider he knew that he was through it had happened to many another idolized champion the fame the fortune were too much henry armstrong reached bottom in and then in a mom ment of despair began reading the bible and turned to god here was another kind of comeback a better kind he was invited to preach in a pulpit and he did he preached again and again and then one day he was ordained a minister of the gospel in the morning star baptist church of los angeles from then on some called him the champ and some the rev henry armstrong the stormiest protestants the negro and his whole baptist fellowship had their beginnp nings in america in stormy weather the forceful wind of ii exploitation lifted him out of a benighted environment in africa and brought him against his will to this land of cultural disparity the colonists found the labor of the american indian unprofitable and that of the white indentured servants inadequate much cheap labor was needed here for the american virgin soil was looked upon as the land of promise for raw materials to produce new commodities of commerce negroes made their appearance in america in years before the first baptist church was organized by roger williams the controversy over slavery was already at fever heat and the colonies were debating as to whether it should be sanctioned rhode island began to regulate the importation of negroes and define their rights in in that same year the first baptist church had a division vedder states that complete records of the fellowship are lacking and all that is i certain is the controversy began and continued until it reached the acute stage in thus baptists from the very beginning seem to have multiplied by dividing the people called baptists also set sail in america on rough seas nowhere else in the world has negro slavery exercised such a large influence upon the christian church as in the united states all of the great american churches grew up in more or less intimate contact with the institution of slavery and all of them were of necessity greatly affected by it the most important of the many schisms which have occurred among the american churches were those growing out of negro slavery while some of the most difficult problems facing the churches today are due to the negro and the bitter conflicts which have arisen in the churches because of him coupled with these superimposed conflicts were cross currents within the free fellowship of the churches the early historical local independency of baptist churches in america tended to impede the formation of any general organization until in a general missionary convention was formed to permit baptists to express themselvs in terms of missionary activities in the state conventions in the south withdrew to organize the southern baptist convention in the northern baptist convention was organized a delegated body under whose direction the many agencies of the baptists in the north and west now operate tossed and driven it is understandable that a slave people should be caught in the middle of every vicious circle without much voice or power of decision during the early years of baptist history in america it was after the baptists had spread to virginia that negroes won consideration as part of this movement that had experienced slow growth up to the beginning of the eighteenth century in general the negroes were followers of the baptists in virginia and after a while as they permitted colored men to preach the great majority of them went to hear preachers of their own color george liele the earliest negro baptist preacher in georgia was brought from virginia by his master henry sharp around presumably he was associated with the church in which sharp was a deacon and matthew moore was pastor the church gave liele the liberty to preach and his master gave him the time he was later freed and gave full time to preaching up and down the savannah river and in south carolina liele was known to have preached in the first negro baptist church in america at silver bluff s c this church was given support by sharp and a planter by the name george galpin when the british came to savannah the silver bluff church seems to have been abandoned but it was revived after peace came in under the direction of reverend jesse peter who as a slave had remained in south carolina during the period of the revolution jesse peter and a white minister abraham marshall organized what was probably the first negro church in georgia in a barn near brampton where andrew bryan won through lieles influence had been preaching in this congregation began building a church in the suburbs of savannah in in the meantime baptist churches were being established in virginia north carolina and south carolina the owners of slaves were beginning to discover that their slaves were of increasing value to them after becoming religious it is difficult for many to accept the fact that josiah bishop and william lemon performed duties as pastors of white baptist churches in virginia and joseph willis a negro minister licensed in became the organizer of the white and colored baptist association in louisiana in it was in the baptist churches especially that the negroes shared with the white men the fellowship of the gospel the reasons for the close relationship in this church were the same as those which prevailed in the methodist denomination with the added attraction of free congregational polity the latter feature permitted the negroes to organize and govern their own churches and so provided them with a practical equality in religious affairs even in natchez miss a baptist church had members of whom only were white with many exceptions to the general rule prior to the great rift in over the slave issue the slaves as a part of the household of their masters worshiped in the same churches after the rift between the northern and southern elements of the baptist denomination nobody was sure what to do with the negroes and they were too handicapped to do much for themselves the negro churches were certainly shaped in iniquity if not conceived in sin confused and rejected by the proclaimers of their faith negro christians could not be too sure of the rock upon which their church was built to this day many leaders refer to the negro churches as a protest movement and others refer to it as a sore on the body of christ to relieve their plight the board of missions of the triennial convention continued to send missionaries and established for the training of leadership among negroes such schools as morehouse and spelman in atlanta ga shaw in raleigh n c leland in louisiana benedict in columbia s c virginia union in richmond va and jackson college in jackson miss the last is now a state school southern baptists continued to give aid to negroes and it was customary in all of their annual meetings to hear reports on the instruction of the colored population even during the civil war their efforts have not ceased until this day they support many training institutes contribute more than negroes themselves to the american baptist seminary in nashville and within the last decade have begun admitting negroes to southern baptist seminaries a new unit evolves there had been organized missions among negroes as early as when the african baptist missionary society was inaugurated at richmond virginia it sent lott carey to africa with a regularly organized baptist church of which he was pastor it contributed its means through the american baptist union a northern white organization until from to it contributed through the southern baptist convention white because white southern baptists divided from white northern baptists in on account of the slavery question solomon cosby and w w colly were sent out by the african baptist missionary society of richmond virginia through the southern baptist convention that was the taproot of the historic tendency of negro baptists which has persisted for more than a hundred years in national negro baptists consciousness expressed itself in organizing the american baptist missionary convention it was organized in the abyssinian baptist church of new york it was composed of the colored baptists from new england and the middle west it could not operate in slave states like the african baptist missionary society of richmond virginia which functioned through southern whites but the atmosphere was full of hope for emancipation or emigration in three years after the last meeting of the american baptist missionary convention of which we have any account he negro baptists of the south took the leading part in organizing the baptist foreign missionarv convention of the united states of america which was the first unit of the national baptist convention to avoid a volume of details regarding the mushrooming and splintering of negro baptists between and we move on to the historic background given in the preamble of the constitution of the national baptist convention usa incorporated three negro baptist organizations claiming national status exsited in the united states prior to these three organizations in their separate conventions voted to meet in atlanta georgia september and form one body for the purpose of more effectively carrying on the benevolent activities for which baptists stand the organizations so uniting were as follows the baptist foreign mission convention which up to that time had been doing missionary work on the west coast of africa the national baptist convention which had done its missionary work in the united states up to this time the national baptist educational convention which was directing its efforts in christian education among negroes in the united states from this point began the major negro bodies as we know them today rocked by internal struggles the organized activities of negro baptists were hardly launched before divisions and rebellion arose the foreign mission board had been located at richmond virginia doing business for the whole colored baptist group since its authorization by the foreign mission convention of usa in the changing of the domicile of the board from richmond va to louisville ky was the first battle on board the new baptist vessel insult was added to injury by changing also the personnel of the board the brethren in richmond refused to communicate and would not turn over deeds contracts or records in the disgruntled exmembers of the foreign mission board led in organizing the lott carey foreign missionarv convention one of their contentions was that the national baptist convention was drawing the color line although the lott carey convention was reunited to the national convention by compact in it continues to function as a separate entity most of its support is from the eastern seaboard and a few states in the midwest the majority of the pastors and most of the presidents of that body have been members of one or the other of the larger national conventions while negro baptists were seriously threatened because of the relocation of their most active board the question of convention control was pressing hard for attention if the national baptist convention of usa had been incorporated before it changed the foreign misson board fom richmond virginia to louisville kentucky the old richmond board never would have defied the parent body nor taken the lead in organizing the lott carey foreign mission convention in generally the new denomination was set up along the lines followed by the two white conventions structures were set uo and empty portfolios granted to the key personnel of the various boards in the home mission board began publishing sunday school literature later the publishing board of the national baptist convention usa was incorporated under the laws of the state of tennessee in a crisis the incorporated publishing board refused to obey the orders of the unincorporated convention which created it the courts sustained the rights of the selfperpetuating publishing board because the unincorporated convention died each time it adjourned the convention realized that all of the boards whose charters were like the publishing boards could defy the parent body and do as the board had done the convention prepared to incorporate itself in order to control its boards and retain its property the publishing board forthwith attempted to split the national baptist convention of usa to retain a group which would furnish patronage to support the selfperpetuating independent publishing board the cause of the confusion manifested at the national baptist convention is the attempt and purpose of the convention to control its publishing board located at nashville tennessee by reason of the peculiarity of the laws of tennessee this board elects its own members although for years the convention thought that by electing members in open session they really became members of the board to its great surprise in the course of time it became known that no one is a member of the publishing board unless elected by the board itself baptists left chicago in with two camps one led by r h boyd secretary of the publishing board and the other by the convention president e c morris the latter group gained charter in the district of columbia and became the incorporated baptist convention commonly today older ministers use the names boyd and morris to distinguish between the two major conventions the national baptist convention of the usa and the national baptist convention usa inc these are the grand divisions of negro baptists although the lott carey missionary society is also chartered all boards of the incorporated convention except the publishing board remained loyal however there have been minor controversies over the national training school for women and girls in lincoln heights washington d c the founder of the school the late miss nannie helen burroughs was also president of the womans auxiliary to the national baptist convention usa inc she was favorable toward permitting the convention majority control on the board managing the school which also has members from both the american and southern baptist conventions the issue has been relegated of late to low priority because of other matters involving the establishment of tenure and regulating board operations within the last twelve years the convention has added a bath house sanitarium hospital board to manage the bath house in hot springs ark now leased to a private group immediately after his election in miami fla in september j h jackson added thirteen new departments and commissions to the nine divisions already provided by the convention naturally there has been confusion as to areas of responsibility caused by the inevitable overlapping assignments recently a small committee was sent to africa to do an investigation with regard to the purchase of land this special committee is separate and distinct from the foreign mission board the oldest and most virile unit of the denomination which is directed by c c adams corresponding secretary of philadelphia pa where the home office is now located the current deadlock in the incorporated body is due to differences over administrative policy and the tenure of the convention president section iv article of the constitution as revised in reads a president of this convention shall not be eligible for reelection after he has served four consecutive terms until at least one year has elapsedthis constitution was declared null and void on the opening day of the seventyseventh annual session in louisville ky in september before the messengers were enrolled marchers invaded the auditorium from the streets to the tune of music men were jailed opposing officers kicked out and litigants who contested the action in court expelled the resulting unrest was the basis of the groundswell that produced the taylor team and the spectacle at the philadelphia convention in a letter was sent out on august over the signature of m l king sr pastor of the ebenezer baptist church atlanta ga father of martin_luther_king jr we are engaged in a mighty crusade in our national baptist convention this crusade through our candidate dr gardner taylor looks forward to restoring our denominations harmony unifying our parentbody and auxiliaries behind kingdom objectives committing the convention to real leadership in civil_rights struggle providing regular itemized financial accounting to all pastors reestablishing a system of tenure after open refusal to permit an election by roll call of states the delegates remained in convention hall in philadelphia on september and a fair election was conducted with for the incumbent j h jackson pastor of olivet baptist church chicago ill and votes for gardner c taylor pastor of concord baptist church brooklyn n y what is the present state of affairs philadelphia courts have disclaimed jurisdiction in the matter because the convention is chartered in the district of columbia on january in hot springs ark jacksons group issued a declaration of the independence of the national taylor team the national baptist convention usa incorporated and its board of directors will accept the fact of the independence of the national taylor team the real deadlock is over the source of authority whether the board of directors or the messengers enrolled in any annual session make the decisions for the convention this problem is aggravated by the fact that any member who says he is a baptist can register and vote in annual sessions for the fee of ten dollars big battles swell the messenger roll and help the exchequer unfortunately the struggle for office seeps down through state conventions district associations and local churches many states have two conventions enrolled annually because every state president enrolling with two hundred dollars is automatically a member of the board of directors mississippi enrolls four state conventions regularly the state conven tion presidents are also concerned about tenure and even local pastors fear that their churches may rejoice to find a method of rotation millions on board according to the listings in the yearbook of a merican churches the national baptist convention of america has members and the incorporated convention has five million these figures are based upon reports for and as of today these bodies easily boast of more than eight million souls it is widely accepted that seventy per cent of all churched negroes are baptists onethird of the baptists of the world are negroes the third largest protestant group in america is the baptist denomination among negroes being outnumbered only by the methodist church and the south baptist convention to be the largest bloc of colored protestants in america and in the world in these times when nationalism is emerging in africa kindles in negro baptist bosoms a new sense of destiny and worth being the largest group in the negro structure the titular head becomes a towering figure within and without the group hence there are no expresidents of the parent body nor of most of the auxiliaries added to the egocentricities that are common in human circles is the element of negrocentricity that is sweeping america through the kneelins sitins standins wadeins and the like many negro baptists are so busy with race that little place is left for redeeming grace stuck in midocean and casting eyes about other members of the baptist fleet are noticeable out there in the mist and foam national baptists have working relations with all of them educational projects the baptist jubilee advance the baptist world alliance and the national and world councils of churches with one exception the southern baptists who do not affiliate with national or world councils these relationships are more nominal than vital as to the national baptist convention of america preachers of the incorporated convention cross lines in accepting churches and vice versa without strife but neither is there any sign of union in the near future as to the american and southern baptist bodies we seem to pair off against each other american baptists and negro baptists agree that southern baptists are highly bigoted negro baptists and southern baptists tend to label american baptists as being spiritually barren and american baptists and southern baptists would agree that negro baptists are sadly belated many of our large national baptist churches do affiliate with the american baptist convention since local independence is the baptist pattern only pressure from local churches will make for true progress in the direction of improved organizational procedures and wider coopthe crying need of negro baptist churches is for recruits to the christian ministry with dedication and training to keep the constituency stabbed awake at the local level yet there is some anxiety that we may lose our most promising young people en masse by too long delay heaped upon our inner contentions and the need for leadership are the multitude of new problems incidental to integration and urbanization we may keep looking within rather than without for much longer than we would like to admit in the meantime negro baptists can look forward to more sailing on a stormy sea have a future in politics leitmotiv of southern politics for some decades has been the lament that dixie has lost its voice in national party councils the prayers for deliverance from this obscurity follow ancient rituals of imprecation and gesture like a rain dance now in one of those twists which make politics ever unpredictable the prayers are about to be answeredafter a fashion the south is likely soon to return to political prominence and a southerner may well become a decisive influence in national affairs but the manner in which all this is to come about may send the southern shamans scrambling to their altars to dispatch amended petitions to the almighty for the potential savior of southern political influencealbeit not southern politicsis not a lone knight but is colored and some five million strong the souths negroes are the largest single untapped reservoir of voting strength in the nation registered and voting cohesively they can alter the course of events not only below the masondixon line but throughout the nation they can force a realignment of politics along more clearly defined liberalconservative lines and they can shatter decisively the tottering dinosaurdemocrat pterodactylrepublican coalition in congress needless to say any man who could unite and guide these potential voters would become a powerful arbiter of party platforms patronage and legislation it is too early to say that the rev martin_luther_king jr has become such a leader or even wants to but it is already certain that he is the fulcrum of the coming upheaval in southern politics it may be that he will decide as he clearly has not decided yet to enter the party hustings openly rather than to prompt from the wings or it may be that the souths white politicians many of whom are far more flexible and far less committed to the eighteenth century than is generally realized in the north will seize the initiative and provide their own leadership whoever the leader or leaders though the change is coming and the new political body will not remain headless for long the potency of an organized negro voting bloc is no untested theory of course it has been preached for years by the naacp it has been demonstrated time and again in fiercely competitive twoparty races in industrial states and even in a few southern cities such as atlanta and memphis without the negro vote in key states last fall john kennedy would not now be wearing his paperthin mantle of victory the negro vote has made scores of senators congressmen and governors vociferously civilrights conscious and it has won an amount of attention far beyond its proportionate size but not since reconstruction days when it was cynically manipulated has the negro vote counted for much in statewide races in dixie for decades its impotence could be blamed on white primaries kukluxism and lack of education even today in some of the rural southparticularly in the black belt countiesthreats violence and official footdragging present serious physical obstacles to voting by negro citizensyet the plain truth is that negroes themselves are in no small part to blame for their failure to realize their voting potential whereas the number of negroes on the souths voting lists surged dramatically in the first years after the demise of the white primary in georgia alone some registered within a few months time it soon reached a virtual plateau the net increase since is little more than this is true even though more and more of the souths negroes live in cities where they encounter little or no official opposition to registering a recent premayoralty primary registration drive in atlanta sponsored jointly by longstanding negro voter organizations and dr_kings southern christian leadership conferance fell far short of its goal despite an enormous pool of qualified negroes and the complete cooperation of the fulton county registrar in spite of this pessimistic current history there are signs that the most spectacular and significant gains in negro voting in history are in the offing for one thing the negro leadership is learning the hard lesson of organization we were naive enough one negro leader summed it up to believe that with the increased interest in civil_rights negroes would just go out and register on their own without any prodding the atlanta registration drive for instance might well have succeeded had it started earlier only after the drive was publicly announced did its leadership settle to the grinding task of setting up a block organization where it was needed most in the lower and lowermiddle income neighborhoods despite its weight in atlanta elections the negro vote thus far has been concentrated in the uppermiddle income groupswhat one negro critic labeled leading negroes as distinguished from negro leaders the experience will not be wasted however the new organization plans to remain semimobilized throughout the year and hopes to build from its newly established base this awareness of the importance of organization probably will receive more concrete recognition in the near future through a concerted southwide voterregistration drive involving dr_kings sclc the naacp and other humanrights groups a second reason for believing in a coming new wave of negro voting is the attention now being paid to the question no responsible negro leader has ever denied the value of the ballot although some perhaps have been suspicious of their more conservative white friends urgings to concentrate on voting in any case it is true that other activities have at times obscured the issue since the brown decision the naacp has been involved in a deluge of antisegregation litigation the energies of the sclc and the student movements have been drained by the timeconsuming planning and execution of nonviolent protests from lunchcounter sitins to freedom rides i have always said dr_king explained in an interview that i think one of the most significant steps the negro can take is the short walk to the voting booth yet its not a substitute for other things its not an eitheror proposition but a bothand in fact dr_king maintained that the other things have made it easier to interest the negro in the ballot box they have helped to overcome the my vote doesnt count psychology which exists among negroes because of the legacy of discrimination and slavery and segregation according to dr_king another evidence of the coming voting breakthrough is perhaps barely discernible outside the south itself where one comes over the years to appreciate the various nuances of southern oratory to the outsider current southern political speeches may sound the same as those of ten or twenty years ago but to the native they sound more moderate more flexible for instance senator herman talmadge of georgia whose reputation on the race issue was once little different from his late fathers is now being accused in some extreme quarters of selling out to the niggers for his refusal to use the filibuster in obviously hopeless legislative fights and for failing to insist that georgia close down its publicschool system to prevent desegregation senator talmadge like many another southern congressman is clever enough to read the handwriting on the wall and politician enough not to talk himself into a corner if the handwriting were not already large enough the justice department has been engraving it in sixfoot letters several times as many votingrights suits against southern registrars have been filed during the first eight months of the kennedy administration as were instituted in the three previous years of the voting laws existence only the most intransigent southern politician can fail to be impressed by this a man who is any politician at all is already planning how to survive when the negro vote becomes important perhaps decisive in his constituency legal or moral arguments aside there is cold logic on the side of the administrations energy the pure mathematics of the squeaker requires the democratic party not only to hold on to as much of its previous vote as possible but also to expand its support to provide a cushion for the inevitable dropoff if the administration is after new voters it can find no greater unexplored territory than in the south in last falls election the voter turnout by state ranged from idahos per cent of the civilian population of voting age to mississippis per cent the eleven beyond his immediate sphere of action in june for instance he addressed a freedom rally at the sports arena in los angeles sponsors were hoping for an attendance of fifteen minutes before the rally was scheduled to begin the fire department ordered the doors closed after had jammed inside another showed up of whom at least half remained outside listening to the fourhour proceedings on the publicaddress system a close associate recently said when they the kennedy administration want to know how negroes feel about something they call martin this may be an oversimplification but it is true that dr_kings influence with his own race is highly respected by white politicians the dignitaries on the platform of the los angeles rally included californias governor edmund brown new yorks governor nelson rockefeller after declaring at the national governors conference in honolulu that civil_rights was the paramount moral issue in american politics met with dr_king to discuss the issue at length and of course the political benefits which flowed to john kennedy last november as a result of dr_kings temporary imprisonment in georgia are well known the nonviolent movement of which dr_king has become the symbol has achieved considerable progress and influence thus far without becoming directly aligned with either party dr_king himself endorsed no candidate in and he is clearly undecided whether to become identified with either party in the future for the time being his political activity will be limited largely to voter registration the major emphasis will be in cities where tangible gains are possible but the nonviolent techniquein the form of registrationoffice standinswill be utilized to dramatize the plight of negroes in rural areas dr_king is not worried that negroes will be at a loss to know without overt guidance which candidates to support theyre going to vote for the candidates who stand most forthrightly for human rights he said neither is he concerned as are some writers that even if negroes register in large numbers in the south they will have no one to vote for in state races registration will inevitably have an impact he contended and either incumbents will see the light or new candidates with better vision will come forward i have followed a nonpartisan course dr_king concluded this doesnt mean that i am not interested in politics i am intensely interested in politics and maybe i will have to change some day but i feel that someone must remain in the position of nonalignment so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of bothnot the servant or master of either if civil_rights is destined as governor rockefeller contends to become the nations paramount moral issue then dr_kings cause probably can best be served if he remains nonaligned as a speaker he is superb as an articulator of nonviolent direct action his effectiveness cannot be challenged but his philosophical bent and his gentleness of nature make him not the best of administrators and he has tended to leave the work of organization to others the best guess at this time is that he will remain the conscience of both not the servant or master of either a gutter full of dreams he didnt eat much breakfast he sat around and tried to read but finally he gave that up and went out into the back yard the alley smelled like rotten eggs and fat maggots swam in the garbage cans some had lids some didnt hosea douglas picked up some pebbles and began tossing them around every time he hit a can the flies buzzed off in a black spiraling cloud he watched the flies return and swarm over the dead rat smashed into a red tirerutted pulp by a passing truck milk colored water trickled between the brick paved alleyway and formed a puddle where the alley dipped flies found that too everybody accused him of being a dreamer nobody he knew could see any reason in the world for his going out that afternoon and trying to get a job playing ball for a professional football team like the cougars he watched the flies buzzing around in the alley that was reason enough for him hey boy you looking for something that was how they greeted him when he got out to the camp id like to try out for the team he said to one of the fat guys who seemed to be in charge you what aint this the tryout camp of the cougars the two fat guys looked at each other well boy now look yeh youre kind of light for a linesman the other fat guy told him i dont play on the line i play in the backfield you what give him a suit luke a short baldheaded guy with a cigar told them yeh but give him a suit okay the man called luke shrugged come on you after hosea got his equipment luke took him to the dugout there was a lot of nervous talk going on in there hey youse luke said in his high nasal twang and the talking stopped this boy heres gone try out for the team luke grinned and left all of the players began to test their equipment seeing what kind of shape it was in then one after the other they filed out and left him in there alone with his dreams on the way out he bumped into a huge blond guy scuse me the guy said thats all right the blond guys eyes followed hosea out the door hey youse luke said when he spotted hosea coming over to join the group gathered around him run back in there and get that other guy to hurry up and get his butt over here i aint got all day it turned out the blond guy wasnt in any hurry and took his time dressing so that by the time they got outside the gathering had broken up and the backfield was passing footballs while the linemen charged each other where the hell youse guys been luke wanted to know you messed around and missed defensive and offensive instructions well thats just too bad for you cause i aint bout to repeat them the blond guy shrugged hey youse whats your name luke asked him elmer jabloski yeh well youse and your buddy better watch out attitude counts on making this team too the blond guy looked at luke and laughed luke turned red youse guys might just as well turn in your suits now he said what you play jabloski asked hosea quarterback jabloski didnt bat an eye come on lets go over with the backfield coach blakey invited me to the tryouts not ole lard ass hosea started to say no one had invited him but he didnt know what would be the point in saying that they had trouble breaking in the circle at least hosea did so jablo ski took a ball and he and hosea started throwing it at each other then the baldheaded guy blew a whistle all you guys who came to try out come around front so i can get a look at you he said there were twelve of them ill consider myself a lucky sonofabuck if i find at least one good player among you he said and ill be even luckier if the one i find can last over two seasons in this league he looked them over like they had leprosy in case anybody dont know it im leon blakey and i run the show now this here is mike cassares and this is craig luke my assistants the way it wound up everyone was on a team except some veterans the coach was sure of and hosea jabloski cassares said the coach said to put you in as linebacker think you can play that i play football jabloski said he did too like he was bom into a pair of shoulder pads and football cleats he could sense what hole a play was being run through and bottle it up before it got started good he could get knocked flat on his back and he would get up and still make the tackle he practically crippled both the rookie quarterback and his hopeful tryout replacement blakey sent in his veteran but not before moving jabloski over on offense the first time jabloski got the ball he ripped through the secondary and ran over the safety man without even breaking stride that would have probably been good for a touchdown if blakey hadnt blown the whistle luke started bawling out the defense really giving them hell until blakey told him to shut up blakey called the defense into a huddle and told them what he wanted them to do whatever he told them didnt work too well because on the next play jabloski went ten yards with half the secondary riding him blakey rubbed his chin and frowned jesus christ cassares said aw that hams just lucky luke said with that smile i wonder how much its gonna cost us to sign him up blakey said he dismissed two tryout hopefuls playing guard they didnt argue with him they just limped off the field and went into the locker room hey kid blakey said no sense in you hanging round if all youre going to do is loaf get over there and take mursons place at safety hosea pointed a finger at his chest me yeh you murson looked up and saw him coming he left without saying a word taking it easy on his left knee they finally got some guards and a linebacker in the game who could bottle jabloski up at the line of scrimmage so the quarterback opened them up with a couple of end runs by his two halfs then with the defense honest he faked a handoff and faded back a long lanky end got behind hosea and hauled one in he was off to the races but hosea reversed and managed to get him fifteen yards out from the goal line the whole defensive unit turned and looked at hosea without saying a word jabloski caught a short hard one in the flats and headed down the sidelines he was by the secondary before they even realized what had happened and hosea had to come all the way from the far side to get him he had a good angle on him and went into him low driving with his shoulder as hard as he could jabloski seemed to take off and fly hosea stopped him though two yards out from the goal line jabloskis momentum carried him five yards after his feet had been knocked from beneath him hey luke how bout sending us a safety man somebody yelled you dont like him blakey said chewing on his cigar the linebacker kicked the dirt out of his cleats you dont like him naw i sure as hell dont blakey shrugged and sent in another guy to take hoseas place hey you he yelled as hosea headed for the sidelines get over there and take the right halfs slot on offense the offensive quarterback looked up and saw hosea heading his way hey coach what the hell you trying to do ruin me you can play right half cant you kid well to tell the truth i really play quarterback now that was too much for both teams but blakey just nodded his head okay kelly i dont want to make you look bad so you rest a while and let the kid take over for a spell kelly fired the ball at hosea blakey looked over the defense and smiled okay cry babies whats your excuse now st louis in august the hottest month in the year the center overshot hosea and he barely had time to catch up with the ball before the whole defensive line smothered him whats the matter boys blakey said you forgot how to block he was grinning when he said it but on the next play the line held the center overshot hosea again though and the ends caught him as soon as he picked up the ball blakey blew out a couple of oversized smoke rings and sent in a new center the new center found hosea with the ball all right but the left guard crashed the line and caught him before he could pivot around hosea got up slowly all he could think about were the curbs over the gutters where he used to sit with the other kids when he was a child and plan all the big things they were going to do when they were grown hey boy luke shouted from the sidelines a big lopsided grin ballooning out all over his face what kind of quarterbacking you call that losing thirty yards on three plays the offensive team began to grumble in agreement hosea wiped his sweaty hands off on his pants he didnt hurry getting back to the huddle on the next play the left guard crashed again only this time hosea was rolling out to pass so it didnt matter he couldnt find a receiver anywhere though and that really got his goat but he didnt give up hell no he reversed his field and left half the defensive line strung out behind him he headed for the sidelines and got back up to the line of scrimmage only to find two guys from the secondary set and waiting then he got his first break since he had been out there jabloski came up from nowhere and nailed one of them with a block from the blind side that must have knocked him five feet in the air hosea gritted his teeth and stiffarmed the other guy so hard it felt as though his elbow was pushing up through his armpit his only chance was walking that chalk line and he knew it and he took off into high but the linebacker managed to get over there and block his path hosea broke stride and the linebacker grinned hosea got his head down and his knees up high that was the way you ran over a man that made the linebacker grin all the more the linebacker weighed twohundredandthirty pounds only he didnt try running over him at the last split second he straightened up and gave the linebacker his left leg the linebacker shifted in to take it and thats when hosea pivoted on his right spinning in a circle like a basketball center playing the key and while the surprised linebacker went sprawling after a left leg that was no longer there hosea shifted back into high and went into the end zone standing up it got quiet as hell out there st louis in august hot enough to mangle boy i like you jaboski said putting his arm around him you play football youre in the wrong place boy they told him cant you tell when you aint wanted yeh go home black boy fore you get your neck broke they tried to break it too only he caught them at their own game faked a pass down field and handed off to jabloski who went sixty yards down the middle of the field without anybody touching him jabloski threw the football over the goal line in contempt and blakey had to call the scrimmage off to prevent a freeforall blakey thought all the tryouts except jabloski should go home jeez i dont see how he can let you go jabloski told him while they were mounting the steps after dressing yeh st louis in august hot enough to kill see you jabloski told him and headed for the parking lot hosea headed for the streetcar line hey you hey kid hosea turned around whats your name hosea told him guess you realize what youll be up against in this league that was just a small sample of it out there hosea didnt say anything blakey puffed on his cigar jesus you got a great pair of hands kid i sure would like to use you what you think of that hosea didnt say anything he felt too thunderstruck to ever say anything again a child have you ever seen any real indians asked my sevenyearold son richard when he came home from school for lunch one day of course i replied you probably have too there may be some at school with youi havent noticed his eyes widened but they dont wear feathers on their heads no most indians now dress just about the way you and i do they used to wear feathers and sometimes now some of them dress up in costume for special parades he thought for a moment i guess maybe johnny brown is an indian no johnny is a negro i said dont you know what a negro is no do we know any negroes if it had not been for his serious honest little face i could have thought he was joking then i remembered another time when he had made a similarly surprising remark he had been telling his grandmother about one of his little playmates and she had asked him is he white or colored he had replied i dont know i had thought then that he had just failed to notice and i was glad that it was unimportant to him but with this question today i knew he did not know what a negro was why of course dear i replied we know johnny brown and his family and many others i mentioned the names of several of his friends who are negroes his eager little face registered surprise are they he pondered but bob the man who used to work for us said negroes have black faces now i was beginning to understand richards bewilderment yes i said people often say they have black faces but they are not really black some are very light tan and others dark brown we are said to have white skins but we are not white like this tablecloth are we negroes he then asked no i answered we are white if we are in the sun a lot and get our skins tanned then will we be negroes he wondered no we stay what we are bom i tried to explain then he began to think of the children in his schoolroom the idea of classifying children by race was a new one to him he had thought of them as boys and girls those he liked or those he didnt like but he had never thought of them as belonging to different races he mentioned several names remarking that he thought they might be negroes not knowing these children i could not tell him i said i had seen some chinese or japanese children at school too and tried to describe them i think maybe mary is chinese he said i like maryshe isnt a tattletale like sally i do not know to what race mary or sally belongs and richard is only guessing aside from this momentary curiosity about races probably started by some history story at school he doesnt care to him the important thing about people is not their skin color or eye structure but their behavior the subject was dropped a little later but when his nineyearold brother came home richard asked danny did you know johnny brown is a negro danny assumed the knowing attitude that a nineyearold is apt to take toward a sevenyearold sure and his family are all negroes too he told his younger brother after talking a little more about the subject danny said well what i dont understand is what race is this was said in a tone of dismissing the subject rather than of further inquiry he would leave this illogical complexity to the adults his statement rang in my mind for some time and i felt how good it would be if adults too could admit that they do not know what race is by william p grayson twentysix years ago when i started in the advertising business neg r annual income was rougmy iobillion today it is billion and growing rapidly taking stock of our economic importance is timely and pertinent to the whole of the american negros struggle for firstclass citizenship in the fight to eliminate discrimination and segregation we might give thought to the effectiveness of our individual application of the economic technique along with our freedomrides sitins prayins wadeins we suggest the investin counterattack the power of the almighty dollar to change minds and to create acceptance can be illustrated by the story of the minister of a church located in a neighborhood where the winos found it a convenient and comfortable place for sleeping one sunday morning the church had its usual number of smelly alcoholics as one was leaving he grabbed the ministers hand and loudly said rev that was the damndest sermon i ever heard you really had a hell of a message today now brother you mustnt use that kind of language here all of you are welcome to come here but i cant have you insulting my members and contributors with your foul language and profanity excuse me rev i didnt mean any harm but that was such a hell of a good sermon i put in the collection today the ministers eyes lit up as he forgot himself fifty dollars well ill be damn twentysix years ago advertisers and sellers generally considered negro families only as submarginal consumers bargain basement buyers and a convenient target for the disposal of irregulars markeddown nondurable goods and the happyhunting ground for the sale of questionable mailorder products those were the years when the mass communication mediums were effectively projecting an image of the negro stereotype today the economic strength of i the negro consumer is realized it is a market that is recognized as important to many industries vital to the success of many advertising campaigns and essential to the very existence of some major corporations don connell of the giant market research company of america an outfit that provides statistical data for the formulation of product manufacturing and selling strategy for many of the top us corporations recently pointed out industrys new approach to the negro market ten years ago marketing men had a great deal of curiosity interest and desire for information about the negro market but no compelling need to act on it today marketing men approach information on the negro market as a prelude to action it is a marketing fact of life that can only be ignored at the expense of profits donald i rogers writing in the n y herald tribune says the american businessmans needs for profits will bring equality to the negro where common sense and common decency have failed the negro market amounts to billion annually smart businessmen are cultivating it with utmost care the gross national product of the negroes in the us will total more than billion this year nobody is going to segregate that much money the wall street journal in a june article the negro consumer says never before have they been courted so assiduously by people with something to sell what is this negro market and what is our economic strength the negro market as i view it is not a market to be measured by color alone we are consumers with ambitions and aspirations that are limited and restricted by ethnic mores as a result we develop a different set of motivations and a purchasing pattern that varies considerably from those of nonnegro consumers with otherwise comparable characteristics advertising men have come to realize that there is no longer any single mass market sociological psychological and economic factors influence buying decisions there are many markets made up of individuals with similar buying patterns to reach them admen have gerrymandered us consumers into dozens of markets and submarkets each with its own preferences status symbols and standards of conformity we have the youth market career womens market house garden interest market group and leisure market consumers the largest most clearcut and distinct market of all says newsweek is the negro market our economic strength today is important to industry onethird of all of us live in the cityzone of the major markets of the us white families are shifting to the suburbs of major markets and only of the total now live in the largest cities our economic strength is vital to the success of many advertising campaigns because negro urban families tend to spend more for certain products than white families in the same income group in a city survey of families with comparable incomes we found that negro families spent an average per year for soft drinks while white families spend negro market families annually spend for cosmetics and toiletries compared with spent by equalincome white families the average expenditure of negro households is almost times larger than white households for hair preparations and vi times larger for phonograph records and times larger for candy we spend more for movie attendanceand some giant corporations must continue to marshal our economic strength in order to maintain the relative position of their brand among competition a major cigarette brand a premiumpriced mens shoe a popular brand of blended whiskey are a few examples of the many product types that are vitally dependent upon our continued purchases and preference for that matter total scotch whisky sales in the us would drop if overnite we decided to go on the wagon the travel industry is just beginning to recognize that we spend more than the average spent by comparable income white persons for travel our economic strength to this industry is some million this year the negro market will buy of detroits new auto production and will spend million for automobiles the average negro family will spend for clothing this year for a total of nearly billion we spend proportionately more for food clothing and housefurnishings per household than comparable income whites in practically all sections of the country these figures impressive as they are are only a small index of our economic strength the potential of the future is even greater what about the future will the negro market continue to grow will negro families earn a larger percentage than the of the nations billion consumer income markets of the sixties a book by the publishers of fortune magazine predicts that the consumer markets of the s will be shaped by teenagers who will demand vast amounts of foods and will enter massively in the market for secondsa second car a second tv two telephones etc this emphasis on the purchasing importance of young families are additional reasons why the future looks bright for us new employment opportunities are more likely than ever a study of population trends seems to bear this out in the us census showed a decline of twomillion in the white population in the age group white males of this age group in the population declined this is the group that is now years of age and the age group most preferred by employers already these statistics are being translated into future planning by industry and government in baltimore for example the twintrends of the white migration to the suburbs and the concentration of negro families in centralcity has resulted in a loss in total city population between in the same period the percentage of negro population to the total increased from less than to more than a breakdown of the population also revealed that of the citys white population is years old or over compared with for the nonwhites in the city dr matthew l tayback assistant commissioner of health for the city of baltimore has said it is safe to characterize the baltimore negro population as a young one and the white population as an elderly one this is essentially the whitenegro characteristic of many american cities since the negro population is young and at the age of new family formations and product acquisitions the negro is the manufacturers best consumer potential for food clothing home furnishings drug and personal cares products and automobiles industry should know that the negro consumer wants recognition our studies indicate that negro readers of a dozen or more different magazines find high class negro models in a negro magazine more appealing and interesting than white models these industrialists are responsive to your opinions your preference for negro or white models to demonstrate illustrate or recommend brands that are soliciting your business is important to marketing and sales experts industry is also interested in knowing your preferences in magazine reading large sums are spent in media research to study reading audience characteristics the daniel starch research organization provides a measurement of the percentage of negroes and whites in the audience of magazines generally magazines that are oriented primarily to reflect the interests and participation of a particular reader group have heavy concentrations of readers of that group for example all of the home service mens and weekly magazines have to white readeraudiences ebony magazine with beautiful negro models in ads and feature pictures has negro families in its reading audience life magazine has negro families in its circulation look magazine covers negro households and saturday evening post reassessing our economic strength we find that the negro market is million population with billion to spend onehalf of the negro population is strategically located in major markets and comprises over of the total population for those cities national advertisers striving mightily to get a toehold are vitally interested in favorably influencing negro consumer acceptance manufacturers are concerned about the local policies of downtown department stores where their brands must be sold these retail outlets now have up to negro customers the negro market is big and will probably increase to of the gross national product a possible increase of about billion more as negro family income goes up purchases of homefurnishings are planned first following this the negro family plans a trip abroad ranking third on his priority list is home improvement the growth and importance of our economic strength can best be summed up by a quote of excerpts of a letter from the secretary of labor to the president of the united states dear mr president he wrote for your interest and consideration i am forwarding a special study the economic progress of negroes in the us a notable development in recent years has been the steady improvement on the social and economic status of negroes in education type of work income housing and other areas for which measures are available the historic differentials between whites and negroes have narrowed this report while measuring progress permits satisfaction with past achievement only as a prelude to a determination to forge ahead with vigor in opening doors of opportunity even wider the secretary concludes as i would restate our own evaluation of the negro market potential it is not a basis for complacency but a spur to continued action my countryman my enemy ten per cent or so of the american servicemen on okinawa were negroes very occasionally they ran amok especially in an area known as koza four corners the four corners consisted of some five hundred gaudy bars with names like cotton club and new york jump the bars were monopolized by the negroes and whites who entered the area ran the risk of being beat en up sometimes young negroes marched up the hill from the four comers towards the business section of koza fighting and wrecking bars as they went the negroes in turn complained that some of the nco clubs and other places on the island were virtually off limits to them a negro air force staff sergeant said in his big deep voice it just about takes an act of congress for a negro serviceman to get in those clubs or some of them if an okinawan waitress in a club that has white southerners on its committee dates a negro or is even seen talking with a negro she gets fired i asked a white staff sergeant what he thought of that the white serviceman has just as much right to want his recreation spots for himself and his friends without having negroes around as the negroes have to want them integrated he said judiciously about negroes and okinawan girls he said its considered fashionable here for white and yellow to mix but its kind of taboo for white and black to mix he concluded anyway you dont gain acceptance for yourself and your friends by mob violence not long ago about a hundred of those young negro hoodlums marched up from four corners and tried to take the town a negro from texas a marine sergeant said gloomily that the four corners was just like being across the tracks in any mississippi town he added you know it was set up to be like that about six years back or more they just kind of gave the four corners to the negroes to keep us quiet and to try to cut down whiteblack fights on his first pass being unaware of all this he strolled into the white area of koza a white mp walked up to me and tapped me on the shoulder keep moving boy he said i beg your pardon i said dont get wise with me nigger he said you heard me tar baby the sergeants jaw muscles tightened at the memory now look here i said to him he continued im a sergeant in the marines heres my pass damn your pass he said up here youre nothin but another loudmouthed nigger the thing is said the sergeant earnestly that the peking radio reports all this you know some americans think we ought to keep quiet about it and never tell anyone like you cornin in from outside but the peking radio talks about it the okinawans know all about it just our own folk back home in the states they don know about it the okinawans to whom i talked seemed surprisingly placid about any whiteblack tension in their midst before the war the japanese soldiers on okinawa also committed criminal acts a policeman said but when it was suggested that indigenous law enforcers should carry firearms for the protection of themselves and other okinawans only okinawans guarding american bungalows and american military installations had gunshe smiled and shook his head that might only provoke the foreigners against us now they fight each other he said but this was an official view another okinawan said more bitingly white americans who treat black americans as inferiors are hardly likely to think of asians as equals how negroes escaped slavery in the revolutionary war in the revolutionary war the american negro was a pari ticipant and a symbol he was active on the battlefronts and behind the lines in his expectations and in the gains he registered during the war he personified the goal of that freedom in whose name the struggle was waged the negros role in the revolution can best be understood by realizing that his major loyalty was not to a place nor to a people but to a principle insofar as he had freedom of choice he was likely to join the side that made him the quickest and best offer in terms of those unalienable rights of which mr jefferson had spoken whoever invoked the image of liberty be he american or british could count on a ready response from the blacks on the american side the negro saw only limited military service until the war dragged on into its third year this negative attitude toward enlisting the colored man sprang from a reluctance to deprive a master of his apprenticed servant or chattel slave and from the fear of putting guns in the hands of a class of persons most of whom were not free in the main the negro was thought of as a servile laborer rather than as a potential warrior but when manpower needs became acute whether in the volunteer forces the militia or the continental troops hesitancies and fears were put into the background and the negro was mustered in this procedure typified an attitude toward negro enlistment that would prevail in americas future wars from colonial times until the twentieth century the negro would be bypassed in the early stages of conflict but as the struggle grew arduous civilian authorities and military commanders would turn to the one great remaining manpower pool and the negro would emerge from his status as a rejected inferior to become a comrade in arms some twenty months after the war broke out between england and her former coloniesby the close of grim necessity forced the states to reconsider the decision to exclude negroes from their armies bound by the necessity of conciliating southern views congress still refused to sanction negro enlistments but the states went ahead early in massachusetts included negroes in the list of draft eligibles and the legislature of rhode island at its february session voted to raise two battalions of slaves the substitute system encouraged the enlistment of negroes a man summoned to service was permitted to get someone to take his place and to procure a negro was easier and less expensive than to procure anyone else in virginia and in maryland the change in attitude toward negro soldiers was a consequence initially of the difficulty of mobilizing white manpower and later of the southward shift of the main theatre of war unlike their sister states south carolina and georgia steadfastly refused to legalize slave enlistments south carolinas heavy negro population made her fearful of such a step and georgia shared these misgivings when these states remained adamant even after the fall of savannah late in congress recommended that they raise negro troops but these two states declined to reverse their stand and maintained it to the end the negro welcomed the resort to arms although not very strong on theory he fulfilled the pragmatic requirements of a revolutionary he had little to lose in goods or lands and he lacked a sentimental or blood tie with england at any rate black americans quickly caught the spirit of in the words of frederick douglass the most prominent colored american of the nineteenth century the revolutionary war announced to negroes the advent of a nation based upon human brotherhood and the selfevident truths of liberty and equality there were portents of a new era individual slaves petitioned for their manumission groups of slaves memorialized state legislatures to abolish slavery for the first time a gallery of distinguished negroes made their appearance among them phillis wheatley precocious poet prince hall founder of negro masonry and benjamin banneker mathematician and astronomer negro soldiers served in the minutemen companies of massachusetts in the early weeks of the war in the state militia of the northern states and in the state and continental forces they saw action in the continental army at monmouth the last major battle in the north at yorktown where on july the continental army passed in review baron von closen an aidedecamp to general rochambeau made note that threequarters of the rhode island regiment consists of negroes and that regiment is the most neatly dressed the best under arms and the most precise in its maneuvers negroes served on sea as well as land in the chesapeake waters of virginia and maryland the use of negro pilots often impressed slaves was not uncommon and the massachusetts legislature ordered that captured slaves be made to serve on state vessels negroes were numbered among the more than twenty thousand seamen aboard the armada of american privateers it is not possible to give accurate figures as to the number of blacks in the american armies not more than a third of the negroes who bore arms were racially labelled moreover colored combatants were interspersed with whites in what today might be called unsegregated units it has been estimated however that negro soldiers served in the patriot forces a respectable figure particularly since so many were not free to act although man power shortage was the paramount factor the changed american sentiment toward drawing negroes into the war effort and thus conceding them a higher status was in part a reflection of the humanitarian impulse which inspired the revolution and was engendered by it antislavery sentiment mounted rapidly and action was taken on both continental and state levels above the potomac public opinion turned strongly against slavery by march pennsylvania was ready to lead the way by passing an act for its gradual abolitionwars end brought further gain to the negro to the slave soldier who had borne the responsibilities of citizenship before he could enjoy its rights it brought freedom and in some instances a land bounty in new jersey slaves belonging to tories were freed by act of the legislature waged in the name of liberty the war caused many americans to give a hard look at their own domestic practices abolitionist societies multiplied often under quaker sponsorship northern states following pennsylvanias lead took action to abolish or circumscribe the slave trade and slavery in the south the wartime decline of the staple crops tobacco indigo and ricedecreased both the value of the slave and the reluctance to give him his freedom thousands of negroes gained their freedom by joining his majestys forces faced like their opponents by a manpower shortage the british were receptive to the use of blacks and in commanderinchief sir henry clinton issued a proclamation offering freedom to negroes who would join the royal standard the british move was countered by the americans who exercised closer vigilance over their slaves removed the ablebodied to interior places far from the scene of war and threatened with dire punishment all who sought to join the enemy to negroes attempting to flee to the british the alternatives liberty or death took on an almost literal meaning nevertheless by land and by sea they made their way to the british forces in the south the british employed hundreds of runaways as shock troops others served as guides and spies it was as military laborers however that they found their widest use negro carpenters hostlers blacksmiths axmen and miners markedly increased the striking power of his majestys armed forces the british discovered as had the americans that a negro laborer could perform a service that otherwise would have to be done by a white soldier when the war ended hundreds of negroes were evacuated from savannah charleston and new york with the departing british forces the establishment of american independence did not bring all that many negroes had hoped for the idealism of the declaration of independence gave way to the conservatism of the constitutional era but if the negro felt that the cause of liberty had lost momentum his mood was somewhat brightened by the conviction that the revolutionary era in which he lived had marked out an irreversible path toward freedom that henceforth there could be no turning back even if there was a slowing down evacuation with the british if they have a sufficient number of transports they will carry with them about twelve thousand negroes which they have now in charles town and which they have stolen in their various expeditions into the country ralph izard to mrs izard october the chief concern of americans about negroes in the thirty months after yorktown was their disappearance whenever the defeated british made their final withdrawals whether by land or sea thousands of slaves went with them take what precautions they would the americans could not prevent mass exodus of their black bondmen which began immediately after cornwalliss defeat the articles of capitulation at yorktown stated that any american property held by the british garrison was subject to recovery the surrender terms were silent however about slaves who would try to escape by going aboard the departing warships of the royal navy americans did not need to be told that prompt action was necessary to forestall the flight of slaves on the very day of the yorktown surrender general george weedon placed sentinels all along the beach to prevent them from reaching the vessels of the royal navy prompt as was his action he feared that many runaways had already secreted themselves on board the ships on the next day weedon sent a letter to governor nelson apprising him of the situation virginias chief executive had not been idle within twentyfour hours after the surrender he had written to cornwallis asking him to prevent negroes from making their escape by boarding the sloop of war bonetta which was allowed to sail to new york with news of the capitulation these negroes cautioned the governor would endeavor to lie concealed from your lordships notice till the vessel sails general washington lent his support to the effort to keep negroes from leaving the state he was disturbed about the number of slaves who attached themselves to the british or posed as free men in order to deceive american commanders to put a stop to such irregularities washington on october ordered officers of the allied armies to deliver all negroes who came into their hands to a guard to be established at yorktown and gloucester under the superintendency of david ross virginias commercial agent negroes who could prove they were not escaped slaves would be released slaves whose masters lived in the vicinity would be issued a pass enabling them to make their way home unmolested slaves whose owners were not virginians would be advertised in newspapers of their home states while waiting for their masters to claim them they would be sent into the country to work for their victuals and cloathes washingtons order seems to have placed a check on slaveseizing by american and french officers as well as those of the enemy doubtless this was what he intended for he was fully aware that some american commanders had a weakness for acquiring property in blacks ten days before cornwalliss capitulation washington requested american army officers to report any negroes they had who have come out of york henceforth if any officer kept such a person in his service he would be called to the strictest account washingtons order also applied to officers of the state militia civilians did not come under military regulations and to prevent them from retaining other peoples slaves the virginia legislature in may ordered all holders of runaways to deliver them to their masters if known if the master was not known an advertisement seeking him was to be placed in the virginia gazette any person who could prove his right to a slave lost during the cornwallis invasion might apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant of recovery to compel americans to give slaves back to their owners was a trying task but it was nothing compared to getting the french to give up their negroes in dealing with an ally whose assistance at yorktown had been almost invaluable a delicate touch was essential washington used a personal approach in writing to the count de grasse on behalf of a maryland master who had lost upwards of forty slaves five of whom had been taken in the bay by a french ship and carried to the west indies i will take it as a very great favor if your excellency will direct them to be sent back by any vessel coming either to virginia or maryland the expenses of their return trip would be paid by colonel william fitzhugh their master the difficulties of negotiating with the french were tvpified by an incident which occurred when the french troops were stationed in charlotte county in southeastern virginia an american militia officer colonel thomas read sent a sergeant and a guard to the french camp to apprehend runaways and return them to their owners the french commander the marquis de choisy informed read that he considered his application unnecessary insisting that he had already come to an agreement with the governor respecting slaves the rebuked read dismissed the guard but he informed governor harrison that unless the negroes who had deserted to the french were quickly reclaimed those who have property of that kind in the vicinity of the camps will suffer by their going off with such complaints mounting governor harrison took the matter up with general count rochambeau expressing his reluctance to trouble the french commander harrison nevertheless found it necessary to mention that reports were coming in every day about negroes harbored by the french troops and that there was no way in which masters could recover their property except through your justice he asked rochambeau to issue orders to hold all negroes within his lines simultaneously the governor ordered the virginia commissioner of war to order a detail to receive the slaves supposed to be with the french army two days later rochambeau explained his position he and many other french officers owned negroes but these had come from rhode island having either been captured there by the french fleet or purchased from rhode islanders moreover some of the negroes with the french were hired others were free he was ready said rochambeau to help the virginians recover slaves but not at the sacrifice of the rights of his fellow frenchmen rochambeaus response was hardly satisfactory to the state authorities the governor notified virginias delegates to congress a week later that the french troops were moving northward with many negroes since some of these belonged to north and south carolina masters he thought that the congressional delegates from those states should be notified in order to recover the negroes when the french reached philadelphia the exasperated governor then unburdened himself to george washington declaring that he had written so many protests to the french authorities about loss of slaves that i am wearied out without being able to procure them some indeed had been returned but most of them had been kept by the french either for want of their owners having any proof at hand or the negroes declaring themselves free little could be done about runaways who passed themselves off to the french as free men except to put notices in the press a baltimore master advertised for ned who was skulking in the neighborhood of this town in order to join the french they would likely welcome him as a refugee according to the advertisement because he was very capable of being a waiter or hostler to any officer having been a waiter and coachman to colonel white of the state of georgia ever since the war commenced for some months after the surrender at yorktown the british appeared unable to carry on the war and too proud to make peace but by april his majestys ministers had decided to evacuate their troops using three of the major seaports the first of these departures took place at savannah in the summer of a week before the date set for the evacuation the georgia assembly urged governor john martin to request of the british commandant of savannah that no negroes or other property belonging to americans be carried off the legislators also asked governor martin to grant permission to citizens having property in british hands to lodge a formal claim realizing that georgia needed all its manpower resources to rebuild the states economy the lower house also tried to persuade departing tories to leave their slaves behind the commissioners for the sales of forfeited estates were empowered to purchase negroes from evacuees and sell them to residents on condition that the purchasers would not carry them out of the state for at least eighteen months british military forces formally withdrew from savannah in july evacuating loyalists with their slaves as well as troops on july general leslie ordered the royal navy to provide shipping accommodations for whites and negroes an embarkation return of august lists six ships as having carried negroes to jamaica by december an additional negroes had been taken to st augustine seven months later this figure had reached of whom were men women and children another problem which leslie laid before his superiors was the british obligation to the negro when leslie learned that charleston was to be evacuated he asked the commanderinchief for instructions as to the disposition of the negroes under commissioner cruden and those employed in the different departments there are many negroes who have been very useful both at the siege of savannah and here he wrote some of them have been guides and for their loyalty have been promised their freedom he pointed out that no matter how the sequestered negroes were disposed of there was an obligation to those who had voluntarily joined the british something was owed them because of the promises made to them and because of their past services they could not in justice be abandoned to the merciless resentment of their former masters carleton supported leslie in refusing to give up negroes who had borne arms for the king or had otherwise incurred the resentment of american patriots leslie therefore appointed a commission composed largely of military officers to hear the appeals of negroes who had served with the british army or who claimed to have fled to the british in response to proclamations offering them their freedom the responsibility which he felt to the negroes aggravated his major problem in the evacuationthat of trying to assure the south carolinians that their property would not be carried off masters were already sufficiently alarmed by the difficulty of recovering slaves by legal process they had to prove ownership and in establishing such proof they could not employ the testimony of the slaves themselves or of other negroesa law which the south carolinians themselves had enacted the british evacuated charleston without any supervision of their shipments when on december they finally left the city they took negroes of whom onehalf were destined for jamaica of the remainder all but went to east florida with a few finding their way to st lucia halifax england and new york the last american port to be evacuated was new york by november when the last of his majestys troops boarded their transports the final peace treaty had been signed since this treaty included a statement relating to negroes the new york evacuations had a broad interest one involving policy and its observance by the signatories the preliminary articles had contained an agreement that his majestys forces should withdraw without carrying away any negroes or other property of americans the terms of this agreement signed at paris on november soon became common and official knowledge in america on april commanderinchief sir guy carle ton issued an order from his new york headquarters warning all masters of british vessels not to commit any breach of the article relative to negro removals on the very same day the congress instructed general washington to make arrangements to obtain the delivery of the negroes and other american property then in the hands of the british or their adherents a week later washington wrote to carleton suggesting a meeting sir guy was willing if unenthusiastic i cannot decline the personal interview proposed by your excellency this important conference was held at orangetown on may washington was accompanied by his military secretary and flanked by three witnesses one of whom was george clinton new yorks able war governor washington led off by stating that he had asked for a personal conference as the speediest way of reaching agreement over the major problems connected with the british evacuation namely taking over the posts occupied by the british troops and recovering negroes and other property belonging to americans carleton replied that the british were leaving the county as fast as they could civilians had already been sent away including some negroes expressing surprise washington observed that transporting negroes was contrary to the provisional treaty carleton then advanced a point of view which dismayed the american negotiators despite its familiar ring it could not have been the intention of his government said carleton to ignore its obligations to negroes who had come into the british lines under proclamations of freedom issued by his predecessors to deliver up such persons some of whom would thereby be executed and others seriously punished would be a dishonorable violation of the public faith however if british evacuation of the negroes was subsequently declared to be a treaty infraction the crown would compensate their owners with this possibility in mind carleton had directed that a register be kept of all negroes involved thus the british evacuation of new york as of savannah and charleston proceeded with little american hindrance alexander hamilton found the british point of view on slaves defensible but his was an almost solitary voice in nonloyalist circles indignation over the carrying away of slaves was both widespread and enduring it was to affect american diplomatic relations with great britain for nearly half a century years after the war americans were still hammering the point that the payment of prewar debts in london and glasgow should be withheld until his majestys government made restitution for the lost blacks it appears that the position britain finally adopted on the return of slaves was formulated by guy carleton whose view became standard policy negroes who were with the british prior to the signing of the provisional treaty on november were free those acquired after that date were to be given up in arriving at this dictum carleton was doubtless moved as he claimed by a sense of responsibility to the negroes a farseeing man carleton may also have felt that if britain defaulted on promises of freedom made during the war any similar proclamations in future conflicts would not be trusted nevertheless he carefully fulfilled his assurances to washington that he would keep a register of negroes to facilitate the compensation of their american owners he assigned a board of three men to keep the register and every wednesday morning the board met for two hours at fraunces tavern with the three american commissioners by the time his majestys forces officially withdrew from new york on november the british commissioners had compiled a detailed list of negroes they had inspected comprising men women and children this massive inspection roll of negroes bore eight columns listing the names of the negroes their former masters and the names of the vessels on which they were embarking one heading was entitled description and bore such arresting comments as fine boy an idiot likely rascal snug little wench and nearly worn out to these negroes who left new york must be added the hundreds of unregistered ones carried away in private vessels the total number of colored persons who left that city as well as other ports can only be guessed perhaps it would be safe to say that during the evacuations the numbers of negroes leaving savannah was charleston and new york if anything these figures are a bit low and they do not of course include those who went off with the french nor the thousandsperhaps around five thousandwhom the british carried away prior to the surrender of yorktown many negroes were carried off without regard for their own wishes this would be particularly true of slaves belonging to departing loyalists likewise many negroes who had deserted to the british were not consulted about their being taken off in the evacuations perhaps most of these former runaways would have left america voluntarily since the british had assiduously spread the idea that those who went back to their american masters would be severely whipped and then assigned the hardest kind of labor the belief that their former masters would treat them harshly for having fled was no doubt a strong factor in shaping the conduct of negroes who had a free choice in peacetime a recovered runaway was not likely to get off lightly in wartime a slave who not only had taken to his heels but had joined the enemy had reason to feel nervous about the welcome he would receive upon his return to the home plantation to allay this fear some masters promised a pardon virginias theodorick bland jr sent word to his slaves isaac and kitt who were in new york that if they would come back to framingdell the family plantation in prince george county he would let bygones be bygones neither would listen isaac informed blands emissary that he had heard that once a slave had returned to his master he was treated with great severity exclusive of the thousand or more youngsters who were born within the british lines and who therefore might be considered bom free a small number of adult free negroes perhaps a few hundred went off in the evacuations there were eight free negroes among the colored refugees who came to east florida from south carolina as of july numbered in the black emigrants from georgia to east florida as of july were free negroes accompanying the british from charleston to new york late in was free negro bacchus a smith by trade thirteen free negroes men and women were included in the adults sailing out of new york in november on the peggy concord and diannah thousands of negroes were taken to other islands in the british west indies from to the colored population of jamaica showed an increase of practically all of the black immigrants were slaves many had been brought in as slaves but many others who came expecting to be free were seized by those holding no legal title and sold for rum coffee sugar and fruits perhaps the most noteworthy of the negroes taken to jamaica was george liele who as a slave and a free man in georgia had been a dedicated preacher brought to kingston in as an indentured servant liele worked out his time in two years once he obtained his certificate of freedom liele resumed his work in religion preaching in private homes and then organizing a churchthe only baptist church on the island by more than persons had received baptism at his handsmany of the negroes evacuated from the united states did not go southward thousands went to canada perhaps their lot may be suggested by focussing on the story of africanborn thomas peters darkskinned and of large frame peters had in fled from his master and joined the british during the war he served as a sergeant in a negro armsbearing pioneer company being twice wounded in battle with the coming of peace he and his wife settled at annapolis in nova scotia a province to which many of the canadabound negroes went the british had promised peters and his comrades not only freedom but a farm his majestys officers were slow in making good the promise of a farm and the civilian authorities were likewise dilatory the black settlers in nova scotia felt cheated either the surveyor was too busy to mark out their lands or the plots they received were largely thick pine forest and hard to clear finding themselves landless or holders of land that would produce little many negroes apprenticed themselves to farmers or congregated in burchtown a nearly allnegro community peters was a patient man but after six years of waiting he determined to go to england to seek redress from the kings ministers by virtue of a small sum raised by his fellows and by working as a hand to pay his passage aboard ship peters arrived in london early in here he received a welcome that must have made up for much of the disappointment of the preceding years granville sharp and his fellow reformers took peters in tow and soon the former slavesoldier became a london celebrity his eloquence his passion his spirit made him the rage of the newspaper world the latest fashionable craze and the newest object of philanthropy to assist peters his abolitionist friends drew up a memorial in his name and sent it to william w granville secretary of state for foreign affairs this document described the plight of colored families at annapolis royal and families at new brunswick these negroes would remain in those provinces it was said if they could obtain the full grant of land and provisions originally promised them otherwise many would be willing to migrate to any country which would make them a competent offer this petition which peters signed by making his mark brought quick action the secretary of state ordered the governor of nova scotia to investigate the matter if the charges were true the governor was informed that the province must fulfill its obligation or send these families to sierra leone a removal to sierra leone would entail some expense but his majestys government had an obligation to these negroes for their wartime services the idea of transporting the canadian negroes to africa originated with the directors of the recently incorporated sierra leone company founded to enable destitute negroes in london to make a new start by settling them on the west coast of africa the company had acquired a site and begun operations by the time peters visited london on its board of directors in the company counted such wellknown abolitionists as thomas clarkson william wilberforce and granville sharp it was sharp who introduced peters to the other board members and enlisted their interest in the black nova scotians in turn peters was favorably impressed by the kindness of the board membersby their assurance that he and his associates would be welcome to sierra leone and by their belief that his group would be better off there than in frigid canada with the tacit support of parliament and the approval of peters the sierra leone company got busy on august the company authorized two agents lawrence hartshorn of halifax and john clarkson to screen out the candidates for resettlement and get written testimonials as to their character sobriety and industry the agents were authorized to offer twenty acres of land to each prospective migrant with ten additional acres for his wife and five for each child many of the candidates were personally enlisted by peters who returned to the province prior to clarksons arrival including his family peters recruited a total of eightyfour persons from st john new brunswick and annapolis and brought them to halifax some applicants made their way alone many of these arrived at the headquarters city only after hard journeys of up to miles through wooded and little known country thanks to men like george and peters there was no problem in recruiting good prospects indeed the directors of the sierra leone company were surprised and gratified by the number of applicants by the end of the year a large enough group had been recruited and the ships chartered on january a bit over three months after his arrival at halifax agent john clarkson could joyfully write i am now under sail with a fair wind and fine weather having on board souls in fifteen ships properly equipped and i hope destined to be happy for the next few weeks the embarking nova scotians were not as happy as clarkson had hoped the expedition ran into heavy squalls temporarily separating one ship from another some sixtyfive of the voyagers died at sea and another hundred were too ill to be landed when the fleet pulled into kru bay in early march when the remaining thousand stepped ashore they found that little preparation had been made to receive them they knew they would have to work long hours if they were to succeed in throwing up enough shelters before the rainy season set in but if at the moment their new dwelling site lacked adequate housing it bore a sweet sounding namefreetown
who was marcus garvey in jamai ca a named amy garvey on the arm of her chair and invokes the name of her late husband he was no damn fool says he was no buffoon or clown american negroes will find out that he was right integration is not enough far away in the damp chill of london another woman named amy speaks the name of the man to whom she too was once married his spirit is still a dynamic force in the world the seeds he scattered in the s are beginning to bear fruit in america in washington park on chicagos south side an old black man holds a small audience with the same name that mahn he sings in a pronounced west indian accent that mahn was right no one is going to help the black mahn but the black mahn that mahn marcus moziah garvey has been dead now for years he died broke an exconvict and some said a failure but time has dealt kindly with the jamaican firebrand today years after his stunning harlem triumphs his name is on many lips a few months ago during the nationwide uproar over black nationalist groups commentators and columnists summoned the ghost of garvey recently a book black moses and several articles in scholarly journals have probed into his life when kwame nkrumah the first african prime minister launched his ship line he went back to garvey for a name black star not the least of many factors in what approaches a garvey revival is the increasing interest of american negroes in a resurgent africa among many people who feel recent events vindicate the little giant are the two women named amy garveys widow amy jacques and his first wife amy ashwood contend that he was a prophetic figure who lived years before his time garvey they say did two vitally important things he went to the heart of the race problem by ripping away the shame and inferiority that were stunting the growth of the black men he focused attention on africa when black nationalism was dormant to understand these contentions and the air of controversy that still surrounds the garvey name one must go back years to the heyday of garveyism the man behind the ism was a short black spellbinder with a dandyish mustache and piercing magnetic eyes during the fabulous s he hypnotized the harlems of america with a backtoafrica movement using as a text the slogan africa for the africans at home and abroad garvey preached the gospel of a united africa under the rule of black men in the process he developed what many sociologists consider the first and only mass movement among american negroes he gave his followers parades uniforms and pageantry he declared god and jesus black and urged negroes to glory in their blackness garvey talked big and dreamed big the late james weldon johnson said garvey collected more money an estimated million in one twoyear period than any other negro organization had ever dreamed of he organized cooperatives factories a small army and a commercial steamship venture the black star linearrested in on a charge of using the mail to defraud he was convicted and subsequently deported to his native jamaica in his dreams shattered he died in london that commented professor albert bushnell hart of harvard university is the difference between success and failure had garvey succeeded in his undertakings he would have been uncontestably the greatest figure of the th century having failed he is considered a fool to many of his contemporaries garvey was a fool or worse but says amy jacques garvey they were blind all around you she adds all around you you can see the things he saw then coming true going back into the turbulent racial history of the s she avers that it was important for a leader to come forward at that time and tell negroes that they were somebody it was important to assure them day after day by every technique available that black was not a color to be ashamed of he gave to millions of people who had no ambition who felt they were born with a handicap a new sense of dignity and personal worth she says he made the masses feel proud of their black skin their kinky hair and their thick lips he lifted black people up and made them feel that they were something of value garvey told them god made you black and he didnt make a mistake race pride meant something to every individual thats why he urged negro children to play with black dolls i remember the controversy over the painting of a black christ his critics laughed and said you see garvey wants to make everything black garvey knew and said that god is a spirit but he said since you are made in the image and likeness of god when you visualize him you must visualize him as looking like you instead of visualizing him as looking like another mana white man carried away by the polemical skill of her late husband she laughs and her eyes sparkle oh she says you cant beat his arguments you cant beat them theyre irrefutable few things are more alive to amy jacques garvey than her late husband when i talk she says i talk for garvey i feel i can interpret how he would feel if he were alive the dynamic woman who has edited a book of garvey speeches has at her fingertips almost everything garvey said and did she can quote for hours from his speeches all around her in the handsome house on kingstons mona road are garvey paraphernaliaold books busts and pictures mrs garvey who has lived in kingston since her husbands death raised their two boys marcus jacques and julius and put them through school by dabbling in real estate and disposing of inherited property amy jacques who is thin and intense differs considerably from her childhood friend amy ashwood who was garveys first wife amy ashwood is heavier and although she lives in london she wears african tribal robes both women however are natives of jamaica both have written books about garvey unpublished and both are persuasive conversationalists amy ashwood started with garvey in jamaica and was associate secretary of his first version of the universal negro improvement association she was also garveys private secretary he divorced her in and married amy jacques who was then his private secretary at the time of the divorce amy ashwood said some harsh things about the man who proclaimed himself provisional president of africa but time has mellowed her now living in london where she operates the afropeoples centre she spends most of her time preaching the gospel of the new africa which she says owes so much to garvey garvey stole the march on africa she says africa was slumbering when garvey struck at that time the american negro did not want to hear the word africa she smiles you would try to talk to them and they would say i aint lost nothing in africa more than any other man of his time garvey made a contribution towards awakening the masses of the world to racial insecurity although he was not the first to visualize a strong and independent west africa he gave the idea the new urgency and a tremendous impetus although both women agree on garveys main contributions to the modern world they expressed in separate interviews different opinions on other aspects of garveyism amy ashwood for example believes that garvey would have adjusted his program to changed conditions amy jacques denies that he would have changed every plank in his platform she says is valid amy ashwood says that garveys bitter enemy the naacp is the american organization doing the most to propagate his ideas the naacp she says has acquired the mantle of garvey they are the aggressive organization in america today they are making all the moves garvey would have made it must be remembered however that the naacp is a nationalist group and there are other problems outside the united states which it is not addressing itself to amy jacques expresses the traditional garvey opinion that the naacp is an organization of middleclass negroes dominated and financed by whites it cant be called a negro organization she says apart from a few lodges and churches there are few purely negro organizations in america such an organization is vitally necessary she says garveyism is still pushed by garveyites in america amy ashwood says flatly that backtoafricanism which most laymen consider a central tenet of garveyism is outmoded she says i dont believe the backtoafrica movement would be valid for american negroes today i rather think that the booker t washington philosophy of dropyourbucketwhereyouare should permeate american negroes after marcus garvey had returned millions to africa spiritually he had done his work it was finished in the real sense i believe if garvey had lived he would have studied the conditions in africa even more than in the new world and he would have realized that the return to africa had taken placethat the black man in the new world could make a greater contribution to africa by remaining in america rather than migrating it is a sensational misunderstanding of garvey amy jacques says to imply that he advocated backtoafricanism people misunderstood him as a matter of fact the term backtoafrica was used and promoted by newspapers negro newspapers mostly to ridicule garvey there was no backtoafrica movement except in a spiritual sense but migration was planned to liberia because concessions were given there the idea was to take only enough to establish a township as an example and patterns for africans he never advocated mass migration the idea is ridiculous garveys whole program she continues was based on reuniting the three units the people on the homefront in africa american negroes and negroes in the west indies he always saw the three units together he believed in and gave his life for a united race he knew that once a strong african nation was established negroes everywhere would automatically gain added prestige and strength the second mrs garvey is critical of american negroes who she says do not always understand that big cars and fine apartments are not basic to the good life for a man to be respected she says he must have a parent tree the jews have palestine the italians have italy the important thing is nationhood american negroes will eventually win their fight for integration but it will be a hollow victory even if the negro is allowed to participate in a small way he will be swamped as a personality in the body politic and in the years to come the practical realization will be absorption if the american negro is to gain national prestige and racial prestige and economic stability he must become part and parcel of a united race you can have all the highpowered cars you want and all the plush apartments that you want and i can have a horse cart and yet something deep down inside of me makes me feel damn proud to be in a nation of my own and to walk on ground that belongs to me on ground that is being developed and administered by black men of my own choosing what garvey understood was that minority citizenship cannot fulfill the demands of a full man what kind of man was garvey was he a con man or a genius demagogue or prophet he was an enigma amy ashwood says he was a prophet student of mass psychology and something of a healer he was also a racialist in the sense that he conceived it his duty to stimulate in the members of his race something which was a source of great anger to their oppressorsand that something was pride in their origin she falls silent and her hands clutch at the air as she tries to find words to enclose the man finally she says because he could speak to the masses in a language they could understand he was able to assume the mantle of black moses among the contemporaries were many better educated men but most of them lacked the common touch amy jacques says he was a showman an opportunist and a propagandist of the first order he used everything he could to draw attention to and dramatize his ideas he was calm almost phlegmatic in conversation but the minute he walked on a platform he was transformed he could put his finger on the pulse of the audience and address himself to that point in her book she writes a witness at his trial compared him to a master musician who had complete control of his instrument and plays on it at will and his faults amy ashwood says like the rest of us he was made of mortal clay and he carried his full burden of human weakness and limitation his chief failing was his inability to share responsibility he was autocratic vain and he loved to hog the spotlight he erred in trying to shine too brightly amy jacques says he was not practical he was always so eager to get things done and in cases where he had to rely on others he felt they would do in the same circumstances what he would have done despite these faults both women say garveys name will live in london in an apartment building that once belonged to a lord amy ashwood puts the case for garvey this way he must be resting peacefully and joyously in the certainty that history will give the verdict that he neither lived nor labored in vain and that his successes by far outweighed his faults and mistakes ghanas black star line is a living compliment to garvey nkrumah hasnt forgotten him amy jacques says garvey immortality is assured she says further that garvey knew it he will never be forgotten because he always saw the three units as one he knew that he had made a contribution and he knew that what he had done was worth it he did the dirty work negro leaders owe him a vote of thanks he worked with the masses if the foundation is poor ignorant and rotten how can you build a superstructure that will last he laid the foundation so that a superstructure could be built on it and he did it the only way it could be doneby meeting the masses where they were by dealing with their hopes their frustrations and their fears and so today nkrumah and kenyatta give him credit for the work he did ironically enough garvey never set foot on african soil today as the flames of black nationalism race through the west indies and africa he lies dead in a london grave but his bust rests on a slab of concrete in kingston jamaicas king george vi park a stones throw from the offices of a colored premier this is as close as he ever came to the black_power that obsessed him perhaps as the two amys contend this is close enough marcus moziah garvey they say was a black moses who saw the promised land he never entered from ebony march an american story jworked for a week yes i did that r i worked for a ge ss week not for eight hours but from sun up to sundown i think now what a big fool i was you know they still have people doing the same thing right now i am now years old born july i was in a little town called speed north carolina there were very few negroes who had their own land i heard my grandfather tell that his father had a farm and that it was paid for well this same white man that i worked for for a week his father fooled a acre farm out of my greatgrandfathers mother for my grandfathers father was dead at the time well at that time my grandfather was a boy he said that he cried all night thinking of what a fool his mother was thats why im glad those boys and girls the freedom riders and sitin demonstrators are fighting for their rights thats why i join the naacp every year i may not be able to get a lifetime membership but i can pay every year and be a member well you see my grandfather raised me he tried to send his son and i to school as long as he could so we made it to the eighth grade this white man that we lived with said that we were too large to be going to school that he should put us to work so he did in i got married so in my one child was bom i had always said to myself that i would never stay there and work for a week for the rest of my life so i began farming with my wife annie sun up and sundown and at the end of the year we still had not made a thing so in december of my set of twins was bom in we began to farm again i told my wife one night there is no way in the world we can live off of a week then i left and came to baltimore after a week i had a job i then sent back for my wife and kids i got a job as a steel worker i now earn a week so thank god i prayed and i prayed i thank god again thats why i know there is a god i have people there in north carolina today doing the same thing today all of the south is not bad but most of it if the south had been right and not judged me by the color of my skin i would be there today and be happy to be there so thats why i am praying for those boys and girls also the naacp we cant all live here in baltimore ill always be praying are todays athletes too dull it seems unquestionably to be true that detroits assemblyline system produces fine cars but some doubt clouds the profitable applicability of this system to sports or are todays athletes too dull in an era not so long gone sports were filled with colorful entertaining characters and these showmenathletes added a great plusquality to games that is sadly missed today in this age of conformity we have a plethora of skilled players who hold their bats the same way run track the same way kick field goals alike but you can count on the fingers of your right hand the stars who still dare to be individuals in their quest for uniformity sports stars today even dress alike and that often approaches the somber style normally to be expected of morticians and income tax consultants of the younger boxers only louisvilles cassius clay is refreshingly different archie moore and sugar ray robinson remain dominant individualistic personalities but such are their dwindling athletic fortunes that they very well may have been removed from the ranks of headliners between the time this story was written and run off the press at negro digest in baseball vic power clevelands first baseman labors to display his amazing artistry afield but instead of appreciation he inspires the defamatory charge of being a showboat to be called a showboat if you happen to be an athlete is a clean sort of way of getting cussed out perhaps the most colorful major league baseball player is the caucasian star washingtons jimmy piersall the payoff for his individuality is a resounding cry from opposing dugouts youre crazy in professional basketball there is wilt the stilt chamberlain who as a superblytalented athlete standing feet inch is forced to be an individual bill russell of the boston celtics is the rare player who sports a beard reportedly because hes tired of people mistaking him for chamberlain and bill occasionally looses his emotions through the medium of a roundhouse right to an opponents jaw but essentially russell is a super defensive player and though he ranges upwards of feet inches he no longer stands out physically at a convention of cagers the fbi if given ample time might assemble an allamerica squad composed of colorful stars for the most part however the big heroes of today are about as colorful as the fading strains of a funeral march heavyweight champion floyd patterson hibernates between bouts roger maris the yankee home run slugger often attempted to impersonate greta garbo i want to be alone during his stretch run on babe ruths record jimmy brown the cleveland browns fullback and soft drink salesman is sheer power and speed and all business about the job of scoring touchdowns it is now as if sports heroes are doing probation on their candidacy for election to the staid and stoic ranks of back bay society only a few of them have the courage to twist in public and virtually every word they utter bears the stamp of a publicists approval i became startling aware of this a few years ago after a certain bigoted caucasian player had spit in a negro stars face when i asked the negro star about this great expectorator he said oh hes a nice fella great ball player of course current sports stars boast many technical qualities the oldtimers never matched this is therefore not a saga dedicated to the theme that the old days were necessarily better this writer belongs to no oldtimers club himself and to confess a truth it is possible that some of the legends ive heard from the oldsters themselves are nothing more than pure fiction on the other hand i do know that in my own time ive watched with growing alarm frequently with yawning boredom the development of factoryline athletes the decline of individuality in sports and this decline appears to run handinhand with the total conformism sweeping this country it is my contention that when sport submerges athletic personalities in its conformist system then games lose much of their appeal their zest their artistry it always has seemed incongruous that a ball player who must hit the dirt on a slide into second base which is about as undignified an act as you can commit in public particularly the bellyslidewill turn around and chastise a contemporary for being a showboat simply because the latter prefers to catch throws at first base with a flairful sweep of one hand instead of playing it by the book in the old days sports stars werent nearly so businessminded as they are today they werent pampered nearly so much the modern athlete wants three days off if he contracts a hangnail and they appear to have loved their games more up to a point a businessminded attitude can be good for the athlete and his sport certainly it is not necessary to drink to excess spend money wantonly on wild wild women and spout profanity in public to earn the reputation of being a character this is not the type of color which is lamented here any athlete who has moxie enough to save his money build an enterprise to insure his future is applauded here on the other hand where would archie moore be today if he were not a colorful figure would dizzy dean remain one of the highestpaid baseball broadcasters if he were not a masterful mangier of the queens english isnt it true that even joe louis remains a popular figure because he possesses a dynamic personality what is this color that i lamentand who were the most colorful athletes of the lost era color is as difficult to explain as why one hollywood actress is sexy and another isnt it is a quality that distinguishes one performer from a crowd in a totally individualistic way it is most often an inborn not a manufactured quality although enterprising publicists often seek to create it color may be found in the way a star speaks runs makes a catch color is a plusquality in a skilled performers stockintrade color in an unskilled performer isnt worth a nickel at the gate but color properly placed is surefire box office even in depression times it is a quality that endears one performer to the crowd while another just as good technically may elicit respect but no fanlove color is a quality with which a player on a losing team may yet salvage some enjoyment for the partisan fan it is often expressed through an athletes display of unshakeable confidence in himself in the fearless way frank robinson digs in at the plate babe ruth used to call homerun shots ted williams used to thumb his nose at sports writers there is no questioning the fine athletic skills of emlen tunnell of the green bay packers hank aaron of the milwaukee braves or elgin baylor of the los angeles lakers but these are not particularly colorful stars they are superstars make no mistake about it and in baylors case perhaps the negative is being stretched yet these are athletes who always make the most difficult play look routine the colorful athlete gets a tremendous kick out of playing money is not a first consideration and he is not ashamed to let people know he enjoys what hes doing he always seems to be having fun the same difference is noted between a louis armstrong and a typical cool cat jazz artist louis plays and sings with a flair all his own with voice and trumpet sounds unmistakably his with an overflowing good feeling and enthusiasm that the stuffy bearded ivyclad cool cat never matches such is the way with a colorful athlete as compared to the assemblyline star sheer size alone does not necessarily make a player colorful nor for that matter especially good ernie ladd of the san diego chargers stands feet inches weighs pounds and eats like food is going out of style but nobody has nicknamed him big daddy big daddy lipscomb of the pittsburgh steelers on the other hand is not only huge enough to inspire awe he is also good enough to engender respect and flairful enough to be truly colorful most frequently as in big daddys case you are told that a player is colorful by his very nickname somewhere along the line while exuding color he has inspired a coach writer or teammate to give him this catchy monicker such was true of satchel paige goose tatum sweetwater clifton rarely does a colorful player bring such a name as elijah percival or jeremiah into sports in all the annals of sport there never have been more colorful athletes than satchel paige jack johnson or goose tatum among negro performers and mickey walker babe ruth or babe herman among the caucasians walker is remembered as the great fighter who was known to show up for a bout intoxicated get clobbered into sobriety then go on to win his battle ruth was of course the bandylegged potbellied cocky heavyeating funloving homerun hitter who revolutionized offensive baseball herman will always be remembered as a hardhitting erraticfielding star who allegedly caught baseballs with his noggin and of an occasion stole bases that were already occupied all six of these performers had this in common they were uncommonly colorful and they were uncommonly skillful i shall dwell on the former trio at more length satchel paiges main forte was his ability to throw a baseball faster with more accuracy with more complete confidence in his ability than anyone of his time he attracted possibly more fans in more big cities different countries and hick towns than any other pitcher who ever lived because while winning games and striking out batters he was also a master showman a titanic entertainer satch wasand is at age a dramatic actor of no mean skill which he has demonstrated in one hollywood motion picture he knew instinctively how to manipulate a crowd as well as how to fool batters lean and lanky he affected a slowdrag type of walk that sent crowds into gales of laughter the moment he stepped out of the dugout or bullpen he invented a series of original pitchesand gave original names to pitches that everyone else threw when satch joined the cleveland indians in youthful gene beardon was surprised to learn that satch threw the spitter supposedly a new pitch oh that satch rejoined is that what you call it ive been throwing that pitch for years few pitchers would have had the audacity to call in their infielders and outfielders confident that they could strike out the side but satchel paige did it few pitchers would have dared throw the hesitation pitch at major league hitters but satch did few pitchers possessed his keen understanding of human nature his witticisms his flair for conversation when satch realized that there was some question as to his age he did not end all suspense by merely telling people the truth instead again displaying his flair for showmanship he let everybody guess built the guessing game up into a national contest which still goes on as early as a fan walked up to satch and claimed you must be because i saw you pitch a game in good public relations was a part of satchel paiges color he loved nothing better than an engaging conversation i once saw him patiently and smilingly sign more than autograph slips in a boston night club during world series time although he had come out of his hotel room only to dance the rhumba he made every person he signed for feel as though he got the biggest bang of his fife out of the project he actually enjoyed it and on that night satch could have run for mayor of boston and won there never was any walking through crowds of kids for satch as some of todays lessable prima donnas do i once heard him scold roy campanella for refusing to sign an autograph for a ladys kid roy was too busy eating but satch wasnt another part of satchel paiges color was his intellect although most of his color stemmed from his skill and his humor on the mound satch like louis armstrong actually was and is a geniusuntutored by oxford standards perhaps but no less a genius he speaks with authority on subjects ranging from muleskinning to engineering i once saw satch talk a famous magazine photographer up a tree on photography photography is one of his many hobbies when he was with the old st louis browns satch did the same to a collegegraduateengineer on the subject of engineering it is satchs claim that he once sang in a tuskegee institute quartet that he foiled a murder attempt on himself by sitting down crosslegged to eat bugs with south american savages when you can come up with stories like that you just have to be colorful for imagination is too a part of color jack johnson was not only in all probability the greatest heavyweight fighter who ever lived he was by far the most colorful cocky and contemptuous of his foes fearless in the ring as well in private life possessed of natural leanings toward the dramatic jack enlivened his sport as it had not been enlivened before and has not been enlivened since he suffered a loss of popularity because he dared marry a white woman but none of this can detract from the fact that jack johnson was a colorful practitioner of legalized mayhem nothing proves it more than the fact that during his lifetime he was star athlete actor preacher singer nightclub operator writer and whatall jack was known to toy with his intended victims just for the fun of it and the fact that his supreme confidence antagonized fight crowds delighted him he knew this invaluable secret to be successful you either have to make them glad or make them mad the villains role was not distasteful to him jack was so skillful a fighter that he could call his shots as babe ruth is supposed to have called his homerun shot in the world series of and in the long ago when jim jeffries came out of retirement to assume the role of white hope in a bout with champion jack johnson gave a classic performance while rumors of a fix floated around the ring jack toyed with the massive jeffries methodically chopping him into human hamburger then when jack decided that it was time to end the thing he said well jim you better go for yourself this is itor words to that effect some historians say that until that moment jeffries expected jack to take a dive final proof of jack johnsons colorfulness as a boxer can be found even today in nationwide arguments about his titlelosing bout with jess willard willard will never achieve in history complete acceptance as the better man that day because johnson was shown while taking the count holding an arm and gloved fist over his head as if to shade the sun from his eyes willard claimed a clean knockout johnson insisted that he was forced to throw the fight and his proof of course was the controversial photograph somewhere in the byways of america reese goose tatum still plies his trade as a professional basketball star like satch and jack goose has been a tremendouslytalented athlete both in baseball and basketball but he is most widely known for his rare ability as an athletic comic and pantomimist in the latter category he is without peer internationally known goose brought up from arkansas to the harlem globetrotters a flair for making people laugh he inculcated this into his playing possessed of unusuallylong arms an individualistic gait and a loosejointed body goose seemed to make each shot of the basketball a thing of productional comedy he was the sort like satch who could rouse an audience to laughter just standing stilldoing absolutely nothing but just standing there looking around yet his knack for scoring baskets was uncanny in baseball he sometimes affected an oversized first basemans mitt a comic split as he fielded a low throw a little bit of a jig as he made a fancy play perhaps this was showboating but it was also an art a clean art and millions of people enjoyed it unfortunately there has developed among negroes a school of thinkers who decry the talents of such people as satch and goose and louis armstrong this is partially attributed to the fact that negroes have been brainwashed into thinking that the talents of these men constitute uncle tomism or deplorable buffoonery or lack of dignity which negroes can no longer display to the world but there is a difference between being an uncle tom and being a true clean wholesome showman red skelton a superb clown takes pratfalls and he makes millions of dollars doing it seldom if ever has satchel paige done anything degrading on the field of play many ingroup critics forget that colorful oldtimers of paiges clan are untutored geniuses that in spite of the handicap of poverty and lacking formal education each one through his special genius his wealth of color perfectly matched with his athletic skill has become an international celebrity great as they are none of our young stars of today are as widely known nor as widely loved as satchel paige some of the younger players look down their noses at him but they crave the lavish approbation the public pays him in a sense the decline of colorful athletes can be charged to or attributed to progress each of the three athletes dwelled on here came to the bigtime already possessing certain original traits each had learned his sport in his own way he was a product of a more individualistic society none had been subjected to a coaching system nor had he been taught that conformism was the rule of life today in baseball most players are products of a farm system where everyone is taught to hit alike run alike field alike unless the athlete follows closely the pattern laid out for him he is liable to be turned away by a manager most professional football players are collegetrained and they therefore bring with them a certain amount of social finesse to coin a phrase which might be most pleasing to the late emily post but which does not easily make for individualisms in their sports no one is encouraged anymore to be different the grayflannel suit is madison avenues trademark and most young advertising men in that sector feel out of place if they dont dress in grayflannel ivy league or whatever is the current style of dress on madison avenue similarly athletes now are encouraged to dress alike wear ties whether they feel comfortable or not clear statements through publicists never speak out on a matter thus when a jackie robinson or sugar ray robinson speaks independently he is frowned on when a ted williams refuses as he used to to tip his hat to the fans after hitting a home run he is called a rebel no one can change willie mays breadbasket catch and despite his rating as the greatest allaround player in the game willie is called by a few critics a showboat actually the modem athlete is afraid to be colorful unless one comes along who just happens to be so good and so distinctive a personality that no one can change him the colorful athlete finds it most difficult to make it the decline of the colorful athlete is to be lamented it must be admitted that athletes and teams are better than ever because new records are being set all the time but there is something about the factorymade athlete that just doesnt measure up to the oldtime colorful player be he baseball football basketball horse racing hockey or track star these factorymade athletes make it look too easy they have lost the skills so recently displayed by such as kid gavilan in boxing with his bolo punch and his fine sense of timing which allowed him to goof two minutes of each round and fight furiously for one colorless athletes are fine when theyre winning but in this one mans opinion theres nothing duller than a colorless athlete losing on moving fences as bom and grew i to manhood south of the masondixon line and although some twenty years after the civil war and the freedom of the colored man there still existed a feeling of race prejudice as a youth i was indoctrinated with the idea that the colored family was of the servant class uneducated and destined to live in the poorer sections of our city that as a race they could never be educated to the degree attained by the members of the white race yet working for my family was old isaac johnson and his wife cecelia they were descendants of a slave family and neither were free until after the civil war fortunately they had been the chattels of a family by the name of clark good people and with this family they spent their early lives matured fell in love and married isaac as i remember him with his white hair and beard was a saintly man a lovable character and loyal servant cecelia his wife just as saintly and lovable was beloved by and depended upon by our entire family and as a cook she had no equal as a youngster i loved to sit upon their laps and listen to their tales of days spent in slavery and of their experiences during the civil war on isaacs knee with my head upon his shoulder i would listen in awe and enchantment as he would unfold to me how he had stepped upon a copperhead snake the snake biting him on the foot how he immediately took his jackknife made a cut where the fangs had entered the flesh letting the blood carry away the pisen as he termed it the story of how the union soldiers the northerners in dem bloo uniforms in de middle of de night stoled all de food de cattle de horses scotched de land and took ebrey ting de old massa possessed and then he would add ah hopes you son will nebber grows to see de likes ob dat kinda war well old isaac and cecelia passed on to their reward and we their chillen as they called us grief stricken placed them in the hands of thar lawd years passed and i grew up in i with old isaacs thoughts in mind went off to war during my service overseas as an ambulance driver i saw wars destruction and devastation i carried back from the front the maimed bodies of all nationalities regardless of race creed or color i learned that war was no respecter of mans station in life the great and the small the white the brown and the black were mowed down as a reaper would do its job in a field of grain as old isaac would say de war god is no specter of persons dey all looks alike to him then i learned of an incident which cut deeper into my feelings that man regardless of race creed or color is as old isaac used to say one of de lawds chillen a group of boys after a costly advance returned to a small french village taken with the loss of several of their buddies they gathered their bodies together catholic protestant and jew and went to the village padre requesting permission to bury their dead in the village churchyard cemetery the old padre granted permission to bury all the baptised buddies within the cemetery but he said the laws of my church will not permit me to allow you to bury the unbaptised jewish boy in consecrated ground they then laid to rest the bodies of all their buddies except the one jewish boy in consecrated ground and with sorrowful hearts they placed the body of the boy of jewish faith in a grave just outside of the burial grounds returning sometime later to visit the village cemetery much to their surprise they found the grave of their jewish comrade in the cemetery grounds surprised they called upon the old padre and asked him why the grave was now within the cemetery enclosure his reply to them was as i informed you boys my church would not allow the unbaptised to be buried in consecrated ground but there is no law on earth that prohibits me from moving the fence your buddies all rest in the arms of our saviour so i have a confession to make that i shall always hold within my heart old isaacs philosophy we is all of us de lawds chillen regardless of the color of our skin or our station in life old isaac was a true disciple of his lawd his hopes dat i would nebber see a war did not come true but in the old padre i found another isaac who taught me all men are created equal regardless of race creed or color may this confession convince others whose prejudices are wavering it took old isaac the old padre and two wars to convince me that all we have to do is move our fences the tuskegee story the spectre of white political nation nondo mihaunts fearful whites from downing street tq elizabeth ville and from manhattan to the golden gate but nowhere is legal takeover by negroes more postuskegee pres luther h foster sible than in tuskegee alabama and nowhere else have affronted whites contorted the law to such ludicrous lengths to preserve a political supremacy the unique demography of tuskegee and macon county makes this a major battlefield for the balot testing ground for the fearsome question of whether negroes would participate or dominate if given the chance for only here in this black belt oasis do negroes rest on all three legs of the tripod to power only here does the negro population enjoy superiority in distribution of wealth and educational reserve the countys population disparity negro white is a carryover from slavery when the many black hands were needed for the comfort of the white few and has increased by virtue of two major negro institutions located here the countys only two financially important establishments thus far have been tuskegee institute and the veterans administration hospital their combined gross annual payrolls alone total million million and million respectivelymore than half the countys total income million each institution is predominantly negro with token integration in the last several years amounting to about a dozen whites altogether unless the county attracts more white industry soon it is ironic but conceivable that whites will press for more integration into the two negro institutionsparticularly the veterans hospital tuskegee institute with a teaching and research staff of including phds eight edds two mds nine dvms and holders of masters degrees and a nonteaching staff of answers the question of educational preparedness even without adding the welltrained nucleus of the member staff of the veterans hospital eleventh largest in the nation the stakes and the strategy even so the denial of political power even political expression to that otherwise prodigious group hasin the pastbeen almost absolute but this has been possible only by denying those citizens the most basic tool of democracy the ballot thus the battle lines are drawn negroes many whites say would take over local government and send representatives to the state house and possibly to congress in short order but squarely between tomorrows negro political representation and todays nonpolitical negro is the high barrier of discriminatory voter registration supporters of the barrier are referred to looselybut with some exactnessas state officials and the whites downtown doing most to beat down the barrier is the tuskegee civic association many of whose members were among the all but five negro voters gerrymandered out of the city in by an act of the alabama legislature before the foursided city map was carved into a sided spectacle negroes were registered city voters no one has doubted and few have denied that the intent of the gerrymander was to prevent negroes from voting in city elections true to its character tca reacted to the gerrymander by educating macon county negroes on the merits of not shopping with white merchants and of setting up more businesses of their own which they did unlike most protest groups which have sprung up across the south since the tca is more than years old it has consistently employed discussions and time consuming attempts at conciliation and meticulouslydocumented complaints all without violence or unsavory advantage neither has it sought or received official interference in either direction from the va hospital or tuskegee institute the tcas plodding pace often seems incongruous with the efforts of younger groups whose accent is on direct and immediate action its policies and strategy are very much debated whenever the impatienteven those within the organizationplace a measuring stick alongside tcas accomplishments what does tca do and how fast they ask last winter tca president dr charles g gomillion himself sadly remarked that no progress has been made in race relations in tuskegee since he came to the community years ago gomillion head of tuskegee institutes social science department noted that there had been some material progress among negroes but progress otherwise was impossible since no white person in macon county will meet with negroes to discuss any type of problem another avenue the may civil_rights decision was legal payday for those who had waited painfully since plessy v ferguson legalized segregation in similarly tcas biggest payday came last march when a supreme court verdict followed by the federal district court in montgomery struck one of the most direct blows ever dealt to disfranchisement since enactment of the th amendment for the first time in the nations constitutional history the supreme court ruled in a case on gerrymandering which the court had previously regarded as a political thicket out of judicial bounds but the court held that the tuskegee gerrymander was indeed an exceptional case and ordered the citys boundaries restored on grounds that the intent was to deny a basic federal right to otherwise qualified voters the techniques used to prevent negroes from registering and voting are too incredible to be recounted in any but a compilation of southern tragicomedy but as a partial result of its patented chicanery alabama placed ahead of only her sister antagonistmississippiin the small percentage of voters in alabama ranking th had only per cent of her votingage people at the polls while mississippi showed per cent the national average was per cent the elections found throughout the south only per cent of votingage negroes registered as compared with per cent for southern whites in macon county less than per cent of the votingage negroes were registered while the books showed whites registered although the census showed only white persons of voting age that bleak pattern anchored the tcas case gomillion v lightfoot before the supreme court which remanded it to federal district judge frank m johnson jr sitting in montgomery judge johnson ordered among other things that sixtyfour named negroes must be registered within days within days after examining an applicant the registrars must tell the applicant whether he is registered and if not why the board must register any negro whose performance in attempting to qualify is equal to the performance of the least qualified white applicant ever registered and until notified otherwise the board must report to him each month on progress made this was by far tcas biggest triumph in its years of peaceful efforts but with voting an elemental matter in a democracy the victory was a major achievement in the total southwide struggle for civil_rights since no other case so dramatically and clearly defined the voting issue and unmasked the awesome determination of those who fear the wrath of negro votes important though it was tca members saw clearly the incompleteness of their victory while headlines across the country underscored the verdict tca celebrated cautiously what macon county negroes have had to learn is that while laws are tools they are merely tools and must depend upon the skill and intent of the mechanics who use them who owns government what have the whites to fear or hope for in being outvoted by nonwhites would there still be a place for them in a government which rightly or wrongly they feel is really theirs to run or ruin what does the tca really want to accomplish for the macon county negro participation in accordance with his interests and ability is gomillions answer if in time he is interested in and capable of filling the majority of positions then he should go into them gomillion adds but to take over just because we are in the majority in populationwe are not interested we want to start at a level at which we can begin to learn the various intricacies and move on in accordance with our interests and merit we dont take the position that we ought to have the majority of the positions simply because we are more numerous now there are people who do feel that waybut that is not the policy or thinking of the people i work with in the tca we would advocate or support no one for office merely because he was a negro dr gomillion who thinks tuskegee mayor howard rutherford appeared more openminded on local race problems at the time of his election says now that less conciliatory interests appear to have gotten to the yearold mayor even so the tca president says he plans to negotiate soon with the mayor on such goals as jobs for negroes in local governmental agencies the mayor refused to answer questions on race at the time of this writing because i honestly dont think they will help solve the problems in tuskegee he did say however that he thinks tuskegees race problems are lessening and that we could work the problem out all right if people would be levelheaded and calm votes make a bargain the mayors plea for a period of calm is sincere such a period would allow him to make quiet overtures to negro voters who now equal white voters and who will surely gain ballot superiority be fore another election date arrives following judge johnsons orders last september negro municipal voters were added to the permitted to vote before the citycarving at that time whites were registered but they have not added substantially to that number since the restoration of city boundaries with the court holding the door open negro voting applicants are pouring in at the unprecedented rate of per registration day two per month with per cent of them passing the tests white county voters recently outnumbered registered negroes by about but at the present registration rate the string of votingage negroes yet to register leaves little room for doubting the outcome the trend against the ballot bigots is gradual but unmistakable in macon county and the city of tuskegee mayor rutherford knows that from here on in heor whoever wins the electionmust get the negro vote this makes for a bargain heretofore nonexistent much credit for the bargain is due to va employee william p mitchell meticulous energetic and methodical chairman of the tca voter franchise committee the most consistently informative and effective of the more than consecutive tuesday night lectures since were mitchells clear analyses of the legal loopholes ferreted out or contrived to disqualify negro voters it was mitchells kind of educating and encouraging which fostered the economic withdrawal that closed the towns only movie and at least of the towns white merchandising concerns tca is kaliedoscopic there are many stories in the tca story there are the crusade the internal problems and successes of a negro middle class a towns moral struggle and the oddity of a white minority whose tradition time is ploughing under and of course it is a story of votingwhich seems a threat to one group a right to another and a question to all on the matter of motive much of this composite story was told recently at tcas fourth anniversary celebration of its crusade for citizenship a campaign given impetus by the gerrymander of the rev k l buford tca vice president and methodist minister summarized the voting and gerrymander victories and observed another significant achievement has been the spirit of togetherness by which we are now benefited our forces are not divided now our strength is not dissipated as it once was you will remember that it was at this very point that our white neighbors were misled they predicted that we would not stick together they said that we would sulk for a week or two but that we would come back and the whole thing would blow over in a few days but we did not sulk we did not pout like children but we determined that we would join hands the high and the low the lettered and the illiterate the fortunate and the unfortunate the man who lived in a palatial home and the residents of tenement farm houses the man of means and those who were not so fortunate and we decided that this was every mans battle but the race has not been won as yet and we cannot afford to grow content at this stage in the game for the race will not be won until the last vestige of discrimination and secondclass citizenship has been swept from our view certain differences between the tca and other protest groups are clear generally they add up to the tcas more leisurely pace which due to local circumstances macon county negroes can perhaps better afford tca strategywithdrawal instead of sitins conciliations instead of demands court cases instead of placards downtown and educating to vote instead of to ride may be only surface differences yet such strategy could mean that tca hears the sound of another drummer as thoreau put it if so it could mean that tuskegee negroes will get there by walking instead of marching to participate instead of dominate the new challenge to negro colleges can be proud of the y m jit t private negro colleges ww and universities for the ln efh role which they play as a powerful force in the social and cultural changes taking place in the areas where they are located the private negro colleges developed the first generation of negro leadership they later provided the first teachers for the publicly supported colleges and public schools the educated negro ministry and the first opportunities in such professions as medicine and law these colleges and universities subsequently produced leaders who enriched the main stream of american culture booker t washing ton walter white j e k aggrey and charles s johnson to name a few from the past they have continued to develop men whose achievements rank high by any scale of values mordecai w johnson john hope franklin thurgood marshall and martin_luther_king jr are part of a long list of alumni whose accomplishments form the most concrete justification for the support of the private negro colleges one important mission of the private negro colleges is that of identifying recruiting and financially assisting the talented negro student to obtain an education but the task is even greater than this for we must not only identify recruit and finance todays student we must provide him with guidance and widen his horizon by pointing the way to the many fields of study and job opportunities outside of the traditional professions of teaching preaching law and medicine it is for this reason that i have chosen as the subject to discussemployment prospects in the international field with particular emphasis on africa why africa it is in this area where the interest of many of us gravitates that the united states faces a number of key challenges foremost among these is the continuing clarion call across the continent for selfdetermination the magnitude of this demand may be seen in the fact that during the past two years new nations have emerged in africa african countries account for some member states in the united nationsmore than from any other continent it can be expected that several new nations will join the group in a few they look to the united states for years these new nations are completely committed to the principle of total independence and freedom a similar clear and unequivocal commitment our series of votes in the united nations on the angola situation demonstrate that the u s government is aware of the need for action on this issue the second challenge is the need for accelerated even rapid social and economic development in all of the new african states the great need is not only one of raising the standard of living of the majority of the people but also one of planning and economic development in all of their human resources of massive health programs and of transportation communication and electric power networks africas great mineral and agricultural potential has only partially been exploited the continent produces most of the worlds cobalt diamonds and gold it is the source of substantial supplies of copper iron maganese and uranium among the principle agricultural resources are cocoa coffee palm oil rubber and vanilla the need for technical knowhow as well as technically trained personnel is great the united states together with other highly developed countries of the free world has obligated itself to assist the new african nations in longrange programs of economic and social development the third great challenge is that of educationthe basic tool from which all other instruments of progress are fashioned over per cent of the population of africa is illiterate the scale of this problem can be seen from the following today for the african countries as a whole only per cent of the children of primary and secondary school age combined are enrolled in school the situation varies ranging from two per cent of the school age group in several countries to nearly per cent in others in the majority of cases the proportion of children out of school exceeds per cent of the school age population it is axiomatic that a high illiteracy rate is incompatible with rapid economic growth and social advancement the african governments agree that the key to the future is education by education i am speaking of a wellbalanced system of primary secondary and technical schools as well as colleges and universities all of these institutions can grow and expand to meet the challenge of the vast shortage of skilled manpower technicians teachers administrators doctors nurses and specialists of all kinds this lack of trained personnel rather than finances is often the bottleneck to development the united states in cooperation with the various agencies and member states of the united nations is attempting to meet this need squarely with a broad program of assistance now where do we fit in the colleges and universities of the united states are deeply involved in our efforts to meet these challenges first of all they are engaged in the massive program of educating and training the thousands of foreign students who annually come to the united states during the school year we had a total foreign student population of of whom approximately were from africa in addition our american institutions are involved in training thousands of students in americanaided colleges and universities in africa secondly our american colleges and universities are providing many of the specialists for the technical assistance educational and economic development programs that are in operation abroad this is especially true of the staff of experts sent out by the agency for international development commonly called aid and of course i must mention the peace corps which is relying heavily on recent college graduates for its inspiring programs abroad the private negro colleges are not newcomers to the task of edueating africans in fact they have pioneered in this field among the best known of the distinguished graduates of the american negro colleges are president kwame nkrumah and the late dr j e k aggrey of ghana governorgeneral nnamdi azikiwe of nigeria and dr hastings banda of nyasaland the united negro college fund institutions are continuing their links with africa as participants in the african scholarship program of american universities which is directed by dean henry of harvard university not only are we bringing students here but some of our schools such as hampton and tuskegee are operating programs and sending specialists to africa under contract with the u s government but this is not enough notwithstanding the needs of our own country for highly trained personnel the negro colleges and universities should share in the national efforts to meet the tremendous demands placed upon our country by the underdeveloped nations of africa and of the world we must make every effort to encourage and to prepare forward looking internationally minded young men and young women who are eager and capable of serving our government and international organizations both here and abroad in the past because of the spectre of discrimination we have had reason to hesitate in preparing our selves for positions in the international field there is no longer cause for reluctance there is now a challenge the fresh invigorating wind of opportunity that prevails in the field of international employment today the most important limitation of opportunities for the negro in international work is the limitation that the negro sets for himself today the opportunity to equal or surpass the widely acclaimed accomplishments of a dr bunche is much greater opportunities for welltrained negroes at home and abroad are open with such private organizations as the rockefeller brothers fund the ford foundation and the africanamerican institute in addition the opportunities for qualified negroes in the department of state in the international offices and bureaus of other departments and in the united nations and its specialized agencies such as the international labor organization the food and agriculture organization and unesco to mention a few are unprecedented secretary of state dean rusk at the state department conference on equality of employment opportunity last august stated we are determined to do everything we can to insure that discrimination is not practiced in the department of state and that we open up the channels of opportunity to all of our american citizens he further said that american personnel overseas must be representative of all the american people and that is not yet the case that we would like it to be he heavily underlined the fact that the department of state is seeking bright young negroes to take the foreign service examination and competent experienced negroes for appointment to middle and highlevel jobs but let us note with all honesty that negroes took the recent foreign service examination and none passed in the future let us not be weighed and found wanting in my capacity as assistant secretary of labor for international affairs one of my principal tasks is to serve as chairman of the united states delegation to the annual conference of the international labor organization widely known as the ilo the international labor organization which has its headquarters in geneva switzerland has sent out over experts of nationalities to undertake over assignments in different countries these experts are trained in many different fields one country may want an agricultural advisor another an educational expert and a third an instructor in the automotive or electrical trades to qualify technical competence and experience often carry as much weight as a phd i should mention that among my other duties i am a member of the board of the foreign service of the united states my office has responsibilities for recruitment training and orientation of foreign service officers particularly those who specialize in labor matters thus you can see that i have a personal interest in preparing more of our young people to take a place in the international field are we ready to meet the challenge can we provide qualified individuals in sufficient numbers who can take advantage of these opportunities in spite of our limitations of funds facilities and faculties we have an obligation as educational institutions to exert every effort to prepare our students for international service or at least to give them a sufficiently strong background so that they can go on to graduate schools elsewhere and qualify themselves what is needed is a good general education including facility in written and spoken english and a good background in sociology anthropology history government geography economics and administration those students interested in becoming foreign service officers need fluency in at least one modern language in addition to the general liberal arts background already indicated in this regard i call to your attention the administration bill now before the congress which calls for grants and loans for the construction of academic facilities and college scholarships for needy and talented students the approaching death m of james crow news bulletin james crow alias jim crow or segregation age active during his youth in the ku klux klan in mob violence in racial discrimination and segregation in public schools and public transportation has been a patient at the confederate hospital since may his condition following his last heart attack remains unimproved and his physician states his name is still on the critical list medical bulletin shortly after the civil war james crow wasted his energies in many nefarious activities sowing wild oats during the reconstruction period he deprived the negro of political equality and to him it became a holy crusade in which a noble end justified any means this patient was in the heat of the battle to reduce the negros citizenship to a matter of inconse quence to be sure he helped to draft southern legislation separating negroes and whites on trains in depots and on wharves by negroes were banned from white hotels barber shops restaurants schools and theatres eight years ago james crow collapsed from overwork and a rundown condition for three months he was critically ill while recovering from a segregationectomyremoval of a cancerous segroid gland by surgery his present condition is further complicated by the effect of several heanf attacks that resulted from blowing his top when he learned how the supreme court had been chipping away at the practice of segregation the last great weapon of the confederacy his previous medical history shows that by the time the justices had finished with the cases of elmer henderson h marion sweatt and g w mclaurin james crow had become a miserable wreck of skin and bones too fragile for the south to lean on his physician gave him up for dead but he rallied through the crisis on may the u s supreme court ruled that segregation in public schools was illegal james crow suffered a relapse and his physician had to give him a shot of white supremacyllin the court on may handed to the lower courts and local school boards the task of ending all segregation in x public schools against the doctors orders james crow got out of bed and aligned himself with southern reactionary forces that pledged themselves to retain segregation at all cost by the threat of imposition abolishment of public schools pupil assignment and other means this led to his present illness james crow recently suffered another relapse because of the nationwide conference of sitdown demonstrators held in raleigh n c although too weak for any active participation in heckling of boycotters and spraying of students with water hoses he is confident he will rally to recovery as he has done in the past however his physician is very doubtful prognosis dr mordecai johnson eminent specialist has warned james crow to slow down the spread of his cancerous activities while yet there is time to save himself from the hopeful words of dr thurgood marshall world renowned legal cardiac specialist and consulting specialist james crow learned that he had better conserve his energies because complete destruction of all enforced segregation is now in sight his pastor seeing how feeble james crow is his church minister has urged the aging man to renew his faith in god and man because the time is past when christians in america can take a long spoon and hand the gospel to the black man out of the back door the shadow of john brown on the ninth day of may in the year of our lord a group gtocss of peoplel moj tly e groes gathered as they have done for a number of years upon a small plateau lying high in the adirondack mountains in northern new york state there they commemorated the onehundredth and sixtysecond anniversary of the birth of john brown abolitionist they recalled that this man left his family his farm and his home on this very spot now only three miles from the famous resort town of lake placid to try an experiment in martyrdom this year they also remembered that it is the close of the first century since the beginning of the civil war it was this very john brown who triggered that conflict when in the summer of i had a visitor at my home on main street in lake placid in the person of a frail old colored man lyman epps i therefore had the feeling when we shook hands that i was fingertipping a full century of american history it was on the eighth of december a bitter cold winter day that this man lyman epps had lifted up his voice to sing blow ye trumpets blow as the remains of john brown abolitionist were lowered into the frozen adirondack earth at that time there were many controversial opinions about john brown in his own community some said he had been a martyr others thought him a daring and idealistic patriarch still others those practical ones we always have with usdeclared him an outright fool be that as it may john brown with his five sons and a handful of dedicated followers both white and colored had previously left the log cabin home in what is now known as the north elba township and stealthily headed toward the arsenal at harpers ferry virginia so great was this mans hatred of slavery and its injustices and cruelties that under his inspired leadership the little band dared surround and capture the united states arsenal at harpers ferry john brown had the forlorn hope that the negro slaves would rise up against their masters and join his crusade but the slaves knew little of the movement for their liberation the whole project had been poorly organized if at all for a pitiful few days the band held the fort they were then captured some killed john brown was hanged and his body brought back by his wife to the cold north where today john browns body lies amouldering in the grave while his soul goes marching on here then before me in this yearold negro whose wrinkled face reminded me of a brown withered apple was a living attestation to those days perhaps it was the quiet reserve in which he held himself that gave lyman epps an aura of great dignity out of proportion to his fivefootfive stature when i asked him to what he attributed his many years of earth he gave me a wry smile and answered maam i alius behaves muhself if there is a better rule for longevity i do not know it he sang a ballad for me in a tuneful voice a bit on the quavering side and then confessed his most earnest wish he wanted to be permitted to live in the old brown homestead to wear a cap with an emblem on it in the shape of a golden eagle and to be allowed to tell the summer tourists who flock into the place what he knew about john brown and his family i promised him i would write to the governor this later i did i received an answer from a secretary who referred me to a department who referred me to a bureau who referred me to a society who said no it didnt matter anyhow for on november lyman epps passed to his heavenly reward at the age of our village clerk matthew clark told me that he and the undertaker and two colored women wrapped in large woolen shawls against the bitter cold were all that followed the body to its grave there had been no singing perhaps the winter wind moaned through the lonely pine trees as the last of the living symbols of the civil war passed from our region what i gathered from my talks with lyman epps and from what i later learned interviewing some of the descendants of the john brown neighborsnow my neighborsis here related and history corroborates the story abp the year was on a beautiful morning in june of that year john brown abolitionist walked out of his house to where a hundred feet beyond lay forever imbedded in the mountain soil a great granite boulder some ten feet high and about thirty feet long from the back of this stone where it sloped upward to a rounded top john brown climbed its weather worn surface and mounting its crest began to chip away at the flintlike face of the rock as he continued hammering the thought came to him that this smallish plateau had been a wise choice for the building of his home the sight was high enough above the road to alert him to any ones approach from the south there the trail stretched back through some five miles of cascade notch with its elongated lakes and primitive forests to the south rose the peaks of the great range of mountains the highest of these marcy lifting its head over five thousand feet above sea level this mountain range seemed to encircle john browns tract of land as if to protect it from the waves of hatred flung at him from that direction his onestory clapboard house did seem dwarfed by the vastness of the great wilderness about it but through those very windows bleak and small as they sometimes seemed he could always get a clear view of the top of whiteface mountain miles to the north today that peak seemed to stand isolated against the summer sky and coldly aloof from the affairs of men as coldly aloof as john brown felt himself to be from the bickerings and indecisions of friend and foe the sky began to cloud over a cooling breeze was blowing up it drove the milky whiteness of the swishing mares tails overhead northward until finally the rolling vapors were swathing the peak of whiteface mountain in undulating gray clouds as if to hide its countenance from the tragedy to be enacted at its base with his chisel he had recessed the first initial j into the stone surface and the second initial b had been begun when john brown felt himself tiring he wiped the sweat from his eyes absentmindedly with his shirt sleeve how much harder than chipping this flinty rock was it to pierce the complacency of his country men he pondered to violate their pharasaical serenity or force them to take some steps to liberate the unhappy slaves from their misery it must be done it must be done and god john brown feels has appointed him for the task a sadeyed elderly woman mary brown now leaves the house and walks slowly toward the great rock she comes to call her husband for his noonday meal he is not quite through he tells her the homely little woman stands mutely beneath him and waits she has guessed at her husbands purpose atop the rock in her heart she has prayed for wisdom with which to turn him back from his resolve put me here mary when i come back he instructs her here in the shadow of this great rock mary brown is too inured to anguish to afford the luxury of even womanish tears she feels certain it will be her mournful duty to put john brown here for his last sleep she knows that now her husband has determined to leave his mountain home his family his neighbors and his friends for the fatal and sublimely irrational attack on the government arsenal at harpers ferry the negro slaves must be freed if only to prove to an apathetic world that there are no inferior nor superior races since in spirit all humanity is one mary brown had not yet resigned herself utterly to her fate she had one last hope she would try to pierce her husbands selfesteem when the hammering had stopped she looked up at john brown and told him of an incident which had occurred that very morning in their house some childish difference had arisen between their daughter and a neighbors girl while at their play in the heat of their quarrel the neighbor child had spat out that her grandfather didnt think much of john brown she had heard him tell her father that so far as he was concerned john brown was gods damnest fool if this was what their neighbor and supposedly good friend thought of her husband what mary brown cried out would the world say of his proposed venture in the south john brown looked down on the stricken face of his wife he noticed her careworn face and her work hardened hands he tried to comfort her to assure her that the raid on the harpers ferry arsenal might just prove a success if he outlived the attack there would be honor and plenty for all if it was gods will that he pay for the enterprise with his life god had prepared him for that too perhaps the world must exact a sacrifice for awakening it to the sufferings and indignities of slavery when he returned to her then she must put him here beside this great boulder for his eternal rest and as for the neighbor she need not be distressed over that why a hundred years from then nobody would either remember the neighbor nor his sayings c the year was it was a beautiful summer day in july the state of new york that now owns the john brown place has recently had it restored to its original status as when the brown family lived there a stir of excitement is evident in our selfcentered little village of lake placid a commemoration service is to be held out at the old john brown farm three miles beyond us it is to celebrate the passing of a full century since john browns sacrifice shocked the people of this country into its bloodiest civil war also this day will mark the completion of the restored homestead in what john brown would have called his dooryard there stands today a bronze figure of more than life size of the patriarch he seems to be walking toward whiteface mountain in the north with his right hand extended in a gesture of explanation to a kinkyheaded little frightened negro boy about whose shoulders john browns left hand rests benevolently the great stone boulder lies a very short distance to the left it is now fenced in with a spiked iron enclosure the tract of land about it is filled today with the parked cars of many people white and black who have come to hear the speeches and browse through the restored home of the patriarch chairs for some two hundred visitors are arranged in the open before the speakers stand so that all may sit and listen to the tragedy of john brown in solid comfort i flowed along with the crowd to the glassedin grave marker in the shadow of the great boulder john brown is recessed in letters a yard high newly cut into the stone a slim and wellgroomed lady is down on her knees in the grass before the small and glassencased old tombstone which john brown had himself brought here from off his fathers grave in new england standing beside the notetaking lady kneeling there i recognize one of my not too distant neighbors an elderly proudlooking woman by reputation a great church worker the kneeling lady rises and is introduced to me she speaks with a marked southern accent when she laughingly explains that her husband had refused to accompany her to the affair he had stated that john brown gave the south enough trouble while he was living and he her husband being a southerner had no desire to see any more of him nor to meet with any of the rabblerousers who again so recently have come to upset the peace of south with their protests their law suits and their agitators i felt it unwise to pursue a topic of conversation so very controversial i simply shrugged my shoulders and looking up alarmed at the swiftly overcast sky i said could john brown be here today i wonder what he would think my neighbor friend gave me an oblique smile as if to say between you and me i might add something to that and she did at this very place and almost a hundred years to the day it was that john brown told mary brown his wife not to distress herself over what a neighbor had said so disparagingly about him i suddenly recalled that i stood in the presence of a descendant of that very neighbor why you know she gloatingly whispered my great grandfather did not think so much of john brown my people turning to me as you must know were his very close neighbors in fact it was my greatgrandfather who helped care for the brown family when the abolitionist left them on his wild adventure south my father once told me that his grandfather always maintained that john brown was gods damnest fool we stood a bit shocked we were hushed by the fact that this nice churchgoing lady would use the name of god in vain and on the sabbath too suddenly from the mountain range a terrific wind blew up a very black cloud gathered directly over us it did seem as if john brown had overheard and resented my neighbors remarks everyone ran for his car i arrived home just as the storm broke it was like a cloudburst it darkened the whole countryside bodies of water like overflowing turbulent rivers poured down on everything i looked up and out of my window over the turmoil of the downpour i could just barely detect the tip of the gold cross standing atop the stone church steeple the other side of main street i clenched my fists i cried out in my heart give em hell john brown give em hell the crispus attacks story it was a moonlit night made brighter by the new snow that blanketed the cobblestone streets groups of young men paraded up and down king street around the commons speaking in hushed tones casting hostile glances in the direction of the british soldiers standing guard and moving about the commons it seemed that resentments of the past five years mounting in intensity had reached the point of explosion the very atmosphere of boston was electric with tension what had been for many years only routine disgruntlement became with implementation of the hated stamp act a cause that was november the citizens of boston had resisted protested refused to cooperate and the act was repealed the following march but then the stamp act was followed by measures only slightly more bearabletaxes on glass paper lead tea plus a law establishing a civil list making local officials responsible only to the king of england the people demonstrated cried taxation without representation to humble them the kings agents brought in two regiments of british troops and when the citizens refused to house them the troops were billeted on the commons and in faneuil hall this stratagem had not worked of course the people became more bitter their resentment flared into taunts incidents between the redcoats and people of the town occurred more frequently and now this day march a british soldier had struck a small boy with the butt of a musket some man among the townsmen called out to the soldiers and hard words were exchanged the soldiers stepped forward to face one of the roving gangs the two groups squared off against each other the townsmen with cudgels and clubs the redcoats holding their muskets at the ready then from among the citizens a man named crispus attucks stepped forward he was tall somewhat burly with dark brown skin and hard curly hair beneath his cap he was a stevedore and sailor a husky man now in middle years known as the mulatto he faced the british soldiers and spoke out fearlessly the way to get rid of these soldiers is to attack the main guard he shouted strike at the root the roving crowds of townsmen drew up behind him voicing their agreement shouting their anger at the band of armed soldiers let us drive out these rascals they screamed they have no business heredrive them out an officer appeared and ordered the soldiers to run your bayonets through them the townspeople if the soldiers were attacked the soldiers began loading their muskets when they raised the rifles the townspeople surged forward accepting the challenge led by crispus attucks you cowardly rascals for bringing arms against naked men a citizen screamed lay aside your arms and we are ready for you attucks backed up by his sailor friends shouted let us fall upon the nest come on dont be afraid of themthey dare not fire knock them over with his club he aimed a blow at captain preston who had rushed out to command the soldiers the captain deflected the blow from attucks club the club knocked the musket from a soldiers hands attucks quickly seized the bayonet from the fallen musket but as he rose with it he was tackled by a british soldier why dont you fire cried someone from the ranks of the militia and the soldier stepped back and fired his musket crispus attucks fell dead on the commons in rapid succession five other muskets blared forth and four other citizens fell beside attucks two of them samuel gray and jonas caldwell died instantly the other two samuel maverick and patrick carr died later maverick the following morning carr on march the first blood of the american revolution had been shed the excitement which followed that massacre never abated the bells which were rung in the town calling the people of boston into the streets was the summons to arms and rebellion three days later a public funeral was held for the first martyrs of the rebellion four hearses met at a junction in king street and from there a procession moved six deep to the middle burying ground the four victims carr was still alive were buried in a common grave under a gravestone with the following legend long as in freedoms cause the wise contend dear to your country shall your fame extend while to the world the lettered stone shall tell where caldwell a ttucks gray and maverick fell for the next several years and until america had won independence from england march was celebrated as the principal american holiday to this day march is known as crispus attucks day and is marked by those who remember that crispus attucks was the first hero of the american revolution until that march evening when the finger of immortality pointed to him crispus attucks was little known even in boston he had been a slave and it is known that some years earlier he had fled from his master william browne of framingham mass for browne had advertised in the papers for attucks return the following commercial appeared in the boston gazette or weekly journal of tuesday october ranaway from his master william browne of framingham on the th of september last a mulatto fellow about years of age named crispus six feet two inches high short curld hair his knees nearer together than common had on a light colourd bearskin coat plain brown fustian jacket or brown allwool one new buckskin breeches blue yarn stockings and a checked woolen shirt whoever shall take up said runaway and convey him to abovesaid master shall have ten pounds old tenor reward and all necessary charges paid and all masters of vessels and others are hereby cautioned against concealing or carrying off said servant on penalty of the law boston october subsequent advertisements for attucks return appeared in the boston gazette on november and november and then attucks name and activities went unrecorded until after the events of march where did crispus attucks spend the intervening years no one knows for certain but scholars and researchers have offered many opinions the late john wesley dobbs of atlanta wrote crispus attucks might have gone to sea he might have visited foreign lands this we do not know but we do know that he was very much alive on march when he showed up on king street with a big stick in his hand ready to die and to become one of americas greatest heroes he died defending the honor integrity and selfrespect of all american citizens living then and the ones to be born later on according to dobbs attucks did two important things on the day he died he firmly established himself as a man of valor fortitude and bold enterprise he believed in that most precious american heritage of freedom and he made the down payment on liberty and freedom for all members of his racial group who were to live after him the martyrs grave that crispus attucks shares with his fellow patriots now lies in the northeast corner of the old cemetery between the park street church and the tremont building in boston it is near the grave of samuel adams one of the signers of the declaration of independence six years after attucks death but an even more imposing memorial to attucks heroism stands in boston commons the scene of the boston massacre and of attucks death it is a monument erected by the state of massachusetts in on the monument freedom holds in her left hand a broken chain and in her right the flag the american eagle sits at her feet on a bronze tablet the boston massacre is depicted crispus attucks lies dead and his fellowpatriots mortally wounded are falling back into the arms of the citizens the words of two great americans are carved into the monument those of daniel webster say from that moment we may date the severance of the british empire and those of john adams say on that night the foundation of american independence was laid and an american negro born a slave set the moment in motion allan morrison it is our feeling that the position of the negro in the theater is neither safe nor secure it is obvious that the negros share in the benefits of the american theater has never been commensurate with what he has given to it the theater has depended heavily on the negros vitality and creativity but has not accorded the negro artist equal status or opportunity artists have borrowed liberally from the negro but they have not seen fit to recognize the contribution with the honesty which should be consistent with american tradition they do not accept the negro as their equal in the performing arts since the time of the shakespearean actor ira aldridge who achieved great fame in europe negroes have had to fight to gain a place in the theater and express themselves there the fight goes on people in the theater and show business as a whole are fond of pointing to the socalled liberal tradition in their profession and declaring that artists do not discriminate those of us who have been around a while know that this is not true artists are capable of bias but to face the problem squarely and to put the responsibility where it belongs we must admit that the artists are not always responsible for the exclusion of negroes or other minorities or the refusal to make proper use of their skills and talent this is usually the prerogative of the producers and of those vitally importantand sinister influencesknown as sponsors recently we have heard about the energetic campaign of p jay sidney aimed at ending the unfair and distorted image of the negro projected by the theater the movie industry radio and tv he has not hesitated to tell people who are nationally known that they are phony liberals he has picketed the theatre guild the paramount talent association and others and he has achieved some result he has received assurances from some of these people that there will be an improvement in the american scene this is an important question now the united states is concerned about its image abroad but many of us are more concerned about the image at home the fight that the negro is waging is not only for an increase in the share of employment but for a difference in the portrayal of the negro there is the increasing importance of the presence of negroes in our society it is a national problem which is causing us embarrassment abroad the facts are rather depressing the truth is that the entertainment media of this country are not depicting the negro correctly and his contemporary role in society times have changed today the negro as citizen worker professional scientist has spread completely across the whole spectrum of this country negroes are entering new fields the change in conditions requires a parallel representation on the stage in the movies and on tv because of the aura of liberalism that has grown up around the theater it has been rather difficult to level strong charges against the theater or the other arts but i do not believe the arts can be exonerated from charges of race barriers within it barriers do exist against negroes and this is a denial of democracy but also it does a great disservice to the arts since it denies the logical use of the skills and talents of nonwhites ossie davis as to what the theater offers the negro performer writer director or producer now i would say it offers him an eitherora chance to fight like hell or starve to death i remember an occasion when we discussed the theater in american culture etc and this afternoon the theme might be better understood if we try to indicate where this particular part of the american scene fits into the total picture and i would like to give you some background thoughts and ideas to see what the fight is in the late s the supreme court of the united states gave the dred scott decision which was that the negro had no rights which the white man was bound to respect the civil war revoked that decision and put in its place the th th and th amendments and two civil_rights acts meant to show that the negroes had all the other fundamental and basic rights that anybody else had but at a later date in the supreme court threw out the substance of the amendments and substituted another rule which was that of separate but equal but what this meant was that you did not have to include the negro you did not have to respect all of his rights provided you gave him a token indication of membership in the human race and provided you gave him a separateand certainty not equalshare of the substance of this country then in this was reversed by the supreme court this latter philosophy embodies the minimum changes going on in this country today and that is simply fight the struggle to push to extend to all our citizens those rights previously reserved to the whites only all of us have suffered from this exclusion this perversion of our democratic heritage and it is as true in the theater as in other places so we come today to see what we can do to explain this fight to ourselves and to indicate how we might help to bring to fruition that democracy and the rights to which we are all entitled this particular aspect of the theater today is a depressing one and i would like to indicate briefly some of the nature of what we face as a negro and nonwhite performer in the theater i testified as a witness before actors equity as to the nature of the discrimination and the substance of my testimony was a sample drawn from one weeks fiscal statement in conjunction with the play with which i am associated and i showed by the report that in a negro show written by a negro featuring negroes and about negro life negro people were employed this is against all of the other employment figures for our show where we have stagehands none of whom are negro none of the ushers are negro none of the scrub ladies are negro and none of the other attendant functionaries are negro this in spite of the fact that my producer is not a man who attempts to discriminate what i am implying is that the exclusion of the negro from the theater is part of a system which was set in motion a long time ago and if we are to do what is necessary about eradicating this condition we must address ourselves to the system which automatically goes into operation the minute a negro becomes involved in a production much of this is automatic one thing having nothing to do with the particular choices of the people in positions of authority and power we must certainly address ourselves to getting that aspect of this question taken care of we must address ourselves to those who do have policymaking positions and who can hire more negroes practicing a fairer presentation of the american scene in their choice of players the american scene is far more integrated than we get when we go to broadway and when we look at tv and the movies i feel good about the future because it is my nature and i feel that men and women can do what they will and must do if they know what needs to be done if they agree why it needs to be done and if they are willing to bestir themselves to see that it gets done my feeling at the moment is that our position is going to get worse instead of better because the theater is going to get worse before it gets better and because we are not yet as a people as ready to face facts and implications as we ought to be we will discuss them think about them but to take a vital step and become active is something else normally what we do is acquire information express our willingness but draw back at the final commitment philip rose i am interested first in the remark about the final step raisin in the sun and purlie victorious represent very small steps because i am interested in integration in the theater and i dont think raisin in the sun or purlie victorious represent integration in the theaterrather they represent a reflection of our society and that integration does not exist in our society these plays are important but i am more interested in how do we fight forhow do we getintegration in the theater when we have an author like ossie davis who writes a play and we succeed in getting it on that is fine but i am interested in other playrights writing today and largely they just dont write parts for negro actors or directors when casting dont think in terms of negro actors i would like to throw out for discussion the questionhow do we break the door down how can we get through to the playwrights many of the plays that are presented could have more validity by showing negroes on the stage and this can do more to bring in money than a lot of other things now being done i feel that it has to begin with the playwright because finally what it must lead to if our society gets to that point is that eventually we can cast negroes simply as actors and they will not have to be cast in terms of their skin color and then we will have the theater showing the way instead of following behind what society is doing another thing is that we still have to go through many arguments with people because when you do a play with negro actors then you better be successful you can do plays which run for a week or two and nobody says anything but if you do a play with negro actors and it has a short run they say thats why it failed because there were negroes in it negro plays should have the right to fail too how do we proceed negroes could be used much more than they are why arent there negroes in subways are for sleeping there is nothing in new york probably which is as integrated as the subway i am doing a play now laid in rome but there are negroes in the chorus we have to show that it can be done by doing it stuart vaughan let me start by saying that i have just come back from europe where we spent eight months seeing foreign productions we came back to see what our feeling about the new york theater was going to be we went to various productions the two plays which we liked bestthe two productions we liked bestwere purlie victorious and moon on a rainbow shawl and the companies in those plays are in a great proportion negro performers i would like to say that after having seen the work of the berliner ensemble and others in europe mr daviss work stands up with the finest acting in the world and his play had an impact and drive which i responded to with great sympathy we have no need to apologize for the talents and abilities of our negro actors maybe because negroes have to fight to get where they are perhaps that is why they are so vital now i want to raise a problem i have directed a number of classical plays in new york and i want to raise this problem because i need to be informed i have tried to use negro performers in classical plays wherever i could and i have found myself limited by my own esthetic concepts which may be too narrow and i have found myself limited by the historical validity which is in the head of my audience negroes could be used in many of shakespeares plays but people are not used to the idea in some cases makeup solves the problem but of course in some cases it does not what are we going to do about this problem i do a play like the octoroon which has to do with the negroes past why did we do it perhaps to get a reaction of disagreement it was an artistic success in terms of what we were trying to do what should we do about plays which have a place in their historical past what do we do about the historical problem howard da silva all of this so far has been interesting because so many questions have been raised here does our problem begin with play writing what about casting i think the battle has to be waged on all fronts in all ways you need only read a few novels about negroes to realize how shabbily they have been treated in all the arts i would like to pose thiswe all work in the theater and the method has become second nature dont we know that there is a difference between the surface representational way of presenting an art and the evocative wayevoking the reality if you have a talented actor there before three minutes have gone by if an actor is creating you dont care if he is polkadotted it has been my experience that where you have a gifted performer the question of pigment is discarded very quickly by the audience which easily bridges the gap i would like to see us continue the battle on all frontsdo more to encourage the writing of works about negro life both contemporary and historical and cast negroes irrespective of pigmentation without waiting for a future time lets do it now ruby dee ive just read for a job doing a tv commercial and i want it desperately i would make a lot of money and it would be secure but the money would go back into the theater because the theater needs help one positive thing i feel todaythis is shown first with purlie victoriousfirst i want to commend the new producers like mr rose and the people of dedication like mr da silvaand to say that pur lie victorious is attracting a whole new kind of audience and that is wonderful people who never came to the theater before are coming to see purlie victorious and one feels as if one is reaching to appeal to ones source i feel happy that we can walk into a gathering of negroes and be applauded for our performance that is importantthat more of us are encouraged to come to the theater if we encourage more negroes to come to the theater purlie victorious will have repaid its backers i feel if there is some forward thrust to life there is life and hope and something that people of good intention can do in the world is to encourage the negro audience of course i believe in integration but before one can integrate we must think in terms of equals i would love to see negro producers i would like to see negro money take over some of the houses then we could say that we will develop this kind of talent we will put in the american scene a new look a new life we will encourage our writers and assure them of a market this is all very indefinite but before there can be real respectartist for artistwe must seize the reins we must equate when we operate in terms of the pattern of society we get a certain kind of respect and help and it may be that in the theater by seizing the reins we will accomplish something by getting a new audience purlies pearls we want our cut of the constitutionnot with a spoon but with a shovel im a great one for racial pride its just that i dont need it in my line of work man if slavery comes back i want to be your agent you are a disgrace to the negro profession why some of the best acting in the world is done in front of white folks purlie victorious judson the irreverent reverend in ossie davis play purlie victorious a little ary his one was going to t be a jewel really a perfect jewel isobel snead could hardly wait to tell the girls at bridge this afternoon after the succession of clumsy incompetent maids she had had to let go one right after the other it would be a relief to put the children

every time she heard a name like cartwright or rhinelander she wanted to kill alfred now she started to scribble roxanne illena helena there it was under her very nose helene of course with a carrot after the last e or whatever it was they called that little jigger they used in spanish or was it french she lay back on her pillow thinking how beautifully impressive it would look when writing to her sister back on the farm helene is quite adequate in a foreign sort of way the children adore her and have been behaving beautifully after the last one then at bridge this afternoon she curled her toes thinking about it when you said helene people just naturally thought of someone aristocratic well no not that at least not in a maid but she did have a grecian air about her tall aloof and just awfully efficient she was probably a bit stupid back of that madonnalike expression but you didnt really have to know anything to be a domestic really those girls were always feeling sorry for themselves but if they only knew it they were the lucky ones at least they didnt have to get in the rat race called culture where you had to be on your toes every minute for fear you would get caught off guard and say something wrong she closed her eyes and sighed luxuriously she would have the girls greeneyed at bridge and how too perfectly lucky that helene fitted the size twelve uniforms they had on hand now alfred wouldnt have a chance to blow his stack about buying a new batch he loathed having the girls wear uniforms she rolled over spreading her arms high on the pillow it was simply delicious she decided being able to lie in bed without hearing the morning ruckus of the children she thought now of the girl calling the children to dinner alto fred still called it supper helene would say firmly going right up to them dinner is being served children you will come now some of the other girls in the block in just any kind of a dripdry would yell out loudly you kids coming suppers on she yawned hating the thought of getting up but it was nearing ninethirty and she wanted to watch the girl a few hours before leaving to play bridge after all she had only come three days ago but what a blessed three days the change in the children was simply unbelievable she never had seen two such rude illtempered disagreeable children as chrissy and roger had been this past year which just proved you couldnt be too careful about selecting a maid chrissy had the makings of a lady underneath it all like her mother but roger was quite like his father quite boorish at times she watched the morning breeze play with the curtains alfred had not yet come up to tell her goodbye before leaving for the office she wondered if helene had offended him not that he was easily upset no he was too thickskinned for that more than likely he had angered her it was just like him with his coarse brand of humor she cringed thinking of his morning greeting to that other one what was her name well girlie this egg aint even been laid yet and worse yet his oolala when a vulgar fat gyrating alfred was just leaving she heard him say ouilafo as he opened the front door she walked upstairs slowly and sat down on the vanity to think it was very quiet downstairs too quiet she thought as far back as she could remember the children had made so much noise in the morning she hadnt been able to sleep they were such lively healthy uninhibited youngsters so very normal i since this helen had come they had been acting subdued queer sort of it just wasnt natural for children to be so quiet and well behaved why they were frightened that was it that girl had them scared they were cowed into being good her headache had cleared now she started to dress thinking it over she realized that all along she had thought the girl had a mean eye it was the madonnalike expression that fooled one for the sake of the children she would just have to let her go it was too bad really how would she ever be able to teach the children not to be prejudiced when one right after the other failed to prove himself her self she corrected mentally no color line in hell say once there tt was a negro in at ii lanta who had made up his mind to commit s j mcs suicide so one day he went down to the main street and took the freight elevator up to the top of the highest building in town in fact the highest skyscraper in georgia negroes could not ride the passenger elevators but he was so anxious to commit suicide that he did not let jim crow stand in his way he rode as freight once at the top of the building he took off his coat drew a deep breath approached the ledge and jumped off he went hurtling through the air and was just about to hit the sidewalk when he saw a white woman come around the corner he knew he had better not fall on that white woman so he curved and went right on back up there was another negro who one day came to a strange town in mississippi where he had never been before when he got off the bus he did not see any of the race around so he asked a white man where do the colored folks hang out here the white man pointed at a great big tree in the public square and said do you see that limb negroes in arkansas when you ask them what life is like in tennessee will tell you the white folks are so bad in memphis that black folks cant even drink white milk but if you ask negroes in tennessee what it is like in arkansas they will say man in that state you better not even put your black feet in no white shoes there are innumerable variations on the use of the word white in the south they say for example presumably in fun that the reason negroes eat so many blackeyed peas in dixie and in louisiana so many red beans is because for years after the emancipation colored people did not dare ask a storekeeper for white beans red beans or blackeyed peas okay but it was not until folks began using the term navy beans that ne groes had the nerve to purchase white beans too in a wylie avenue hashhouse one day i heard a negro say to another one at the counter here you are up north ordering white bean soup man i know you are really free now everybody laughed some of these types of jokes are even laid on animals they say there was once a black cat in mobile who decided to head for chicago because he had always heard that up north there was no color line hardly had that cat gotten to chicago than he met a white cat desirous of being shown about the black cat said to the white cat lets go round the town but the white cat said to the black cat you better set your black self down in some places so another pleasantry goes white folks are so mean they will not give a negro the time of day a colored man said to a white man what time is it sir the white man asked the negro do you play chess the negro said yes sir the white man said then its your time to move these and hundreds of other jokes of a similar nature which negroes tell on themselves belong in the category of white is right yellow mellow but black get back their humor is the humor of frustration and the laughter with which these sallies are greeted for all its loudness is a desperate laughter white people often do not understand such humor at all negroes do and such jokes told at appropriate moments amuse them no end shortly after the big detroit race riots a cartoon appeared in a negro newspaper that harlemites thought highly if wryly hilarious but no white person to whom i have ever shown it even cracks a smile let alone laughs aloud the cartoon pictures a wall in a sportsmans den on which the heads of the game he has bagged are hung a deers head an elks head a tigers head among them mounted like the others is a negro head two little white boys are looking at the head one little boy pointing at the negros head tells the other youngster my daddy got that one in detroit last week most such jokes however are at the expense of the south in harlem they say a young mothertobe about to bear her first child decided to go back down south to be with her mother when the great event came her young husband tried to keep her from going pointing out to her that aside from having better hospital facilities new york had no jim crow wards and colored physicians could attend patients in the hospitals in the south one often has to have a white doctor since many hospitals there will not permit negro doctors to practice inside their walls still the expectant mother insisted on going home to mama the father in harlem waited and waited for news of the birth of his child no news came the ninth month passed the tenth month passed finally he phoned his wife and told her something must be wrong to go to the hospital anyhow and be examined she went the white physician marvelled that her child had not yet come putting his earphones to his ears and baring her abdomen he pressed his instrument against her flesh to listen for the prenatal heartbeats of the unborn child instead what he heard quite clearly and distinctly inside the body of the mother was a sugar chile robinson type of voice singing the blues wont be born down here wont be born down here if you want to know what its all about as long as south is south wont come out no i wont be born down here he wasnt she had to come on back to new york to have her baby harlemites swear that that colored child had plenty of sense a great many jokes with which negroes regale each other but seldom tell white folks are hardly complimentary to racial intelligence jokes relating to tardiness are among them some such jokes even go so far as to blame the darkness of the race upon a lack of punctuality on that morning long ago in the dawning of creation when the lord called upon mankind to wash in the river of life they say that everybody promptly went down to the water to wash except the negroes the negroes lingered and loitered along the way dallied and played and took their own good time getting down to the river when they got there the other folks had used up all the water and had emerged whiter than snow in the river bed after so much washing the negroes found only a little mud into the mud they waded with their bare feet late in their desperation they bent down and put the palms of their hands in the mud too by that time even the mud was used up therefore to this day nothing is light about negroes except the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet late always late other jokes relate to behavior and how a negro in so far as these jokes go will always snarl things up even in heaven they say the first time a negro went to heaven all the other angels became excited when they heard he was coming and had prepared a great welcome for him even saint peter and the lord were moved at the prospect of greeting the first member of the darkest race into celestial glory in honor of the occasion the gates of pearl were shining and the streets of gold had been polished until each cobblestone gleamed but what did that negro do that negro was so excited when he first got his wings that he took off then and there at top speed and would not stop flying he flew and he flew and he flew and he flew in his crown of gold and his snow white robes he lifted up his wings and flew like mad from the east to the west from the north to the south up and down and all throughout the universe he whizzed by the golden throne at miles per hour wings spread like a constellation he flew around gods footstool so fast the cherubinis thought he was greased lightning he went past st peter at such speed that he started a tailwind on the golden streets finally saint peter said whoa but that negro did not stop peter sent a band of angels out to catch him but they could not get anywhere near that negro gabriel blew his horn but he paid him no mind he was a flying soul he made wings do what wings had never been known to do before he looped a loop in the sky then he looped another loop and tied a knot that negro was gone solid gone he scattered feathers all over heaven and stirred up such a gale that the lord god himself stood up and cried stop when he stopped that negro skidded bang into the pearly gates broke one wing smack off knocked his crown into eternity snagged his robes wide open and fell panting at the foot of the throne saint peter just looked at him and said just like a negro in the category of the bawdy joke there are hundreds illustrating the prevalent folk belief in the amorous prowess of the negro male many such jokes cut across the color line in boastful fashion they say a white man came home one cold winter night to find his golden blond wife on the living room divan deep in the loving arms of a great big dark negro petrified in his astonishment the white man forgot to close the front door the icy winds rushed in thinking his wife was being raped in a frenzy he cried darling what shall i do to this negro she sighed from the couch just shut the door so he wont catch cold even in hell according to the joke makers a negro is hell since for so long negroes had had such a hard time on earth as compensation up until the end of the civil war all of them automatically went to heaven when they died but after lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation and things got a little easier for negroes on this globe the lord decided to send a few colored folks to hell the first negro consigned to the devil was a tall strapping man of color who in his day had been a great lover from st louis to the gulf because his boudoir skills left him so little time for grace the lord said send that negro to hell so peter threw him out of heaven no sooner did the negro set foot in hell than he grabbed the devils daughter and ruined her ten minutes later he enticed the devils wife behind a hot rock and ruined her about this time the devils mother came along the negro grabbed her and ruined her the devil suddenly became aware of this mighty despoilation trembling for the first time since he had been ruler of hell he fell to his knees and called on god for help lord please take this negro out of here before he ruins me whether or not hell then began to draw the color line the story does not say but negro jokes often draw a color line through their humor in such a fashion that only a negro can appreciate them certain aspects of the humor of minority groups are often so inbred that they are not palatable for outside consumption there are thousands of jewish jokes that rarely reach the ears of gentiles and if they did they might be embarrassing to the ears of both groups so it is with negro humora part of it is intended only for negroes to others such jokes are seldom funny anyhow the point is lost for often the nuances are too subtle for alien comprehension a joke is not a joke when nobody laughs by sandra e haggerty no one would know if you didnt tell them the old lady seated next to me smiled reassurringly rich thats it they must be rich she turned to the girl sitting next to her and went on only the rich ones go to college my brother and i tried to suppress our obvious amazement we were in utah heading via bus to utah state university in logan this was our first encounter with a native loganite many similar experiences were to follow in what is called by some the last stronghold of the mormons as the bus wheeled its way northward through sardine canyon and down into cache valley i was in awe of the picturesque beauty so unlike my stereotyped idea of what utah should look like i expected barren desert land as far as the eye could see i later learned the topography of the areaits marvelous mountain ranges and desert lands we got off the bus at logans small combination restaurantbus station and surveyed main street simultaneously we were being surveyed always before when people stared i was egotistical enough to think it was due to an attractive personal appearance but having spent most of my time in denver new york city and california all fairly cosmopolitan areas this had never been a problem but in logan well logan turned out to be a utopia of provinciality foreignersthose not only from foreign countries but those foreign to cache valley were out of place we took the towns only taxi and went up on the aggie hill we soon discovered that there was no university housing available then came the search for a place to live we went to several private homes advertising student housing only to be rebuffed with sorry no smokers no drinkers and no foreigners it was then we realized that we were not being recognized as negroes but as iraqis persians etc my brother and i are fairskinned negroes we learned that many of the people in the area had never come in contact with negroes and were not aware of the great variation of skin color hair texture etc that exists among american negroes finally allowing the landlord to believe that we were iranian students we acquired a small three room house situated down on the island which was really too far from the campus for walking but we did not realize this at the time still excited about attending a new college that year it was my senior year and my brother was beginning as a freshman we cleaned up the little house and the next day headed for the campus after registration we found there were eleven other negro students on campus all but one were on athletic scholarships i was the only negro girl on campus we immediately learned the magnitude of influence the mormon church had in the city on the people and on the university the first statements i heard concerning the mormon religion were biased coming from the other negro students the foreign students and the jack mormons mormons who had broken away from the church the mormons believe the negro is cursed they believe the negro is inherently inferior the negro cannot belong to their church negroes are not allowed to step inside their temples tabernacles or wards their religion is the only true religion the first quarter passed with no major incidents most of our contacts were with other negro students and the foreign students of which there were about on campus most coming from iran iraq africa the west indies and south america most of these students were in the agricultural fields sadly to say many of them had been only to logan and had not visited other places in the states consequently they were forming opinions about the united states using logan as an example and sadly to say hate the lds latter day saints talk was prominent among them i felt kind of greedy in my contacts with the foreign students there was so much to be learned from them so many new ideas to be gleaned from and exchanged with them i felt sad that so many people in logan could not see the wealth of faraway places that had been brought to their doorsteps winter quarter my brother and i moved into the dorms on campus when i went to report for my room the house mother asked my name i told her she looked all through her room chart and couldnt seem to find my name i told her i thought the room number was still not looking at me her eyes scanned to room and she murmured no thats not it two ne she looked up at me embarrassed now excuse me dear what did you say your name was i repeated my name and added and i am a negro my roommate was the only other negro girl on campus that quarter shortly thereafter came the big blowup several of the white girls were known to be dating negro fellows this had been going on for some time but never so out in the open the school administration was bombarded with complaints from various sources one sunday afternoon all the negro fellows were called together the content of the meeting was ambiguous reports varied depending on which of the fellows was telling about it but in essence the problems of interracial dating were discussed and the negroes were asked not to date the white girls the next day the whole campus was buzzing about the meeting accounts varied and stories were grossly distorted rumors ran rampant the colored guys will be expelled if they are seen with white girls they will lose their scholarships the guys wont be allowed to play ball the following day a discussion group hashed over the subject a committee was selected to see the president to clear up rumors and to ascertain university policy concerning the subject of interracial dating during the meeting the president stated that the rumors were untrue that the negroes social activities would have no bearing on their athletic and academic activities the furor eventually died down then there was the night utah state played brigham young university a long time bosom enemy of states i was particularly anxious to see the game because the star player on byus team was an old school buddy of mine during the game a fight ensued between one of our negro players and my friend on the other team reportedly name callingthe seemingly favorite insult between white and blackwas the cause of the ruckus at any rate feelings were keyedup and after the aggie victory i went to the opponents dressing room to say hello to my friend the hallway outside the dressing room was filled with angry byuers this was another time when seemingly i was not recognized readily as being a negro i listened to the talk those dirty niggers play like animals usu should be barred from the conference everytime we come down here those black niggers start a fight theyre not athletes theyre animals id never been so disappointed in humanity at that moment my date for the evening who happened to be a dark skinned negro pushed his way through the crowd to find me i took his arm and stood very close to him everyone became quiet all eyes were upon us some faces seemed to mirror disbelief others distaste and dislike and still others a somewhat apologetic look about this time the players came filing out of the dressing room my date asked a tall fellow standing near us if he would call my friend he looked at us strangely and called again silence evidently people thought there was going to be another fight my friend walked over seriously then his eyes dropped down to me and a big grin broke across his face we chatted excitedly i learned he had married one of my girl friends tensions relaxed slightly but we were still the center of attraction after goodbys and an invitation to visit in brigham city my date and i left followed by stares i later found out that byus favorite nickname for usu was usuall designating the growing negro attendance in an effort to understand logan the people and their religion i often talked to a returned missionary whom i had classes with i also took the utah history course the memorable thing my missionary friend told me when i asked about the mormon attitude toward the negro why negroes could not hold the priesthood i wanted to know i had learned that negroes could be members of the church and that there were negro mormons was this analogy suppose a father has two sons certainly he loves both of them very much however one of the sons as in many families is a little more capable a little more conscientious than the other son this does not mean that the father loves him any more on the contrary a parent seems to love the seemingly less competent child more due to his need anyway this father has a huge fortune that he must leave to his sons it is natural that he should give this responsibility of wealth to the son who is most capable of taking care of it so it is with the priesthood i did not agree with my friend in this line of thinking but it was a concept that i had not heard previously on several occasions the negro students were invited to be panel members in some of the sociology and psychology classes some of the questions asked of us were unbelievable are negro babies born black are negroes sexually more potent is it true that negroes have speech defects there were many and varied explanations for why the negro exists and why he is black and needless to say a great deal of time was spent discussing the issue depending on who the explanation was coming from and the seriousness of the speaker these statements were sometimes fascinating sometimes humorous and at times disgusting but always highly interesting cain killed abel and all cains descendants were cursed with black skins ham son of noah had a black wife whose descendants were cursed with black skins there are three lives the before life the here and now life and the after life the people who lived wicked lives in the before life are cursed with black skins in the here and now life the negro today however all is not lost for the black man by leading a good life now may redeem himself and his white skin for the following life and then the negro students joined the act and added such explanations as in the beginning everyone was black god sent a big rain for everyone to wash themselves the rains came and everyone except one lazy fellow washed away the blackness when he awoke only a puddle of water remained and he was able to wash only the bottoms of his feet and the palms of his hands the lord baked his people when he made them and he simply cooked some longer than others some he burned up completely there were many jokes circulated among the nonmormon students about the mormon religion and its founders joseph smith and brigham young calling joseph smith ol joe or mighty joe young and brigham young brig and pres was common about this time a book entitled mormonism and the negro was being sold in the book store briefly it dealt with the curse of black skins that the negro is under and why the book in my opinion was ridiculous it caused quite a bit of commotion and i was pleased to learn that it was not endorsed by the mormon church through my study of utah history and my association with the professor who taught the course i gained an appreciation and understanding of the mormon people which i had not had previously i found their history to be exciting and unique in many instances their pioneering spirit the incorporation of religion and everyday living and the fight against persecution for the practice of polygamy in the early days are admirable even though i could never believe in the mormon religion i respect it i would like to see a greater reciprocation of respect for differences in this area in the past few years this university has grown appreciably athletic wise due in great part to the negro athletes recruited from other states if this is to continue the university is going to have to offer these athletes and other outsiders as well much more than a continuing battle against provinciality is the negro really ready preach brothertjpjtt hood help the han vv dicapped do unto others as you would have others do unto youbut where are these people when a helping hand is needed where are the people who expound all their theories on how we should help one another when the boys at the bar will listen where are the people who make such public displays of contributing to the most fashionable charity in other words where are all the phonies hearts to the sincere plea of a person in need there are those who have practiced what they preach those who have quietly aided others in a less favorable position but they are few and far between lets stop crying in publicand start helping in private for only in this way will we ever reach our goal the old line of no one wants to help us is oldhat for no one will help you if you dont first attempt to help yourself lets stop putting the burden completely on the white man and shoulder some of it ourselves when the day comes that we have helped one another to the best of our abilityand have exhausted all outletsthen turn to others for additional help for thenand only thencan we say that this old world still has a fighting chance that our children have a past to be proud of and a future to look forward to with anticipation does the bible support segregation several years ago a new bishop was appointed to a certain diocese in the southern united states the bishop was a yankee and his flock both priests and laity were somewhat apprehensive as to how tu he would conduct himself in the delicate area of race relations shortly after his arrival he called together the clergy of his diocese when he appeared before them he was holding a copy of the bible in his hand fathers he said i will accept any policy on race relations that squares with this his priests and people understood him this statement marked the beginning of steady progress in realizing a truly christian policy of racial integration in the churches and institutions of that diocesebut in recent weeks we have been subjected to the dismaying sight of a catholic laywoman defying the bishop of her diocese on the basis that his directive on the desegregation of the new orleans catholic schools contradicts the plain teaching of the bible now while it is true that down through the ages the bible has been used by men to justify the most heinous of crimes we need only think of cromwells psalmsinging soldiers in our day it is hard to take the allegation that the bible teaches segregation seriously we might not be too surprised to find a backwoods snakehandler espousing this doctrine or some south afrikaner supporter of apartheid but to find such an attitude among catholics is a shock and a scandal i have not made any survey as to how prevalent such ideas are among catholics in this country but i seriously doubt that the lady in question is in any sense representative of the laity in the south or anywhere else but perhaps just for the record we might inquire into the merits of the case can we find anything in the bible which justifies racial segregation the racist has certain pet passages which he loves to quote out of context both literary and historical genesis the first book of the bible is a favorite quarry of texts for the rabid segregationist ironically enough one of the principal aims of this book is to show the unity of the whole human race both in regard to its origin and its destiny let us examine a few of these passages in the fourth chapter of genesis we read gods words to cain cursed shalt thou be a wanderer and a fugitive on the face of the earth and the lord put a mark on cain gen this text from the story of cain is actually pointless when taken as a justification for segregation cain was a criminal who had just killed his brother abel the lords curse was his punishment for that crime and no one can seriously speak of membership in any particular race as being a crime original sin too has sometimes been interpreted by racists as an early attempt at integration satans words to eveyou yourselves will be like gods gen are thus supposed to reflect her desire to rise above her station it is hard to suppress a smile at such mangling of the text adam and eve did indeed sin by trying to arrogate divinity to themselves but to equate this with the demand of any human being for equal rights based on common humanity and citizenship is nothing short of nonsense but the biblethumping segregationist goes on to find other texts and one of his favorites comes from the sixth chapter of genesis the sons of god seeing the daughters of men that they were fair took to themselves wives of all which they chose and god seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth repented that he had made man miscegenation cries the segregationist biblical scholars for centuries have puzzled over the meaning of this obscure passage one thing however is clear this passage has nothing whatever to do with racial mixing here the book of genesis is talking about groups which it represents as being just a few generations removed from their common ancestors no racial differences could have developed in such a short span what about the oftrepeated allegation that the sons of noah ham shem and japheth are the ancestors of the modern races this is based on genesis and the sons of noah who came out of the ark were shem ham and japheth these three are the sons of noah and from these was all mankind spread over the whole earth bible scholarscatholic and noncatholic alikeare agreed that this verse was never intended as an historical explanation of the racial origins of mankind in races of the old testament a h sayce remarks attempts have been made to explain the names of the three sons of noah as referring to the color of skin japheth has been compared with the assyrian ippatu white shem with the assyrian samu olivecolored while in ham etymologists have seen the hebrew kham to be hot but all such attempts are of very doubtful value it is for instance a long stride from the meaning of heat to that of blacknessa meaning indeed which the hebrew word never bears but even if we were to grant that this passage is concerned with racial differences at most it would indicate that the biblical author was aware of various racial differences and could by no stretch of the imagination be regarded as a justification of the practice of racial segregation everyone im sure remembers the story of the tower of babel from chapter of genesis the tower which was going to reach to the heavens which god prevented when he made the various groups working on it speak in different languages and so be unable to understand each other and which ultimately led to their separation from each other the segregationist grabs this text too as proof that races must be kept separated but this interpretation completely misses the point of the story we are dealing here with a parable on the pride of man the diversity of languages and consequent dispersion is seen as a decline from the primitive unity of the human family and not as a step along the road of progress to the racist abrahamwho in some ways was a champion of exclusivenessmay seem the patron saint of segregation but his exclusiveness was tribal not racial in fact the difference between abraham and the neighboring peoples was no greater than that between the english and the scotch abrahams first son ishmael had an egyptian mother agar and cetura who bore abraham six children genesis and was a northern arabian actually abrahams apparent zeal for racial purity in making isaac his heir and in sending his other children away was occasioned by sarahs sharp tongue and confirmed by gods selection of isaac as the one through whom he would fulfill his promises to abraham abraham himself had been quite willing to make either ishmael or his slave eliezer his heir and his concern to obtain a wife for isaac from his own people was merely an example of the bedouins concern for tribal solidarity and lets look for a second at some of the other great names of the old testament moses wife sephora came from the land of madian which was a part of arabia exodus even a casual reading of the book of kings shows that the harems of david and solomon were certainly a mixed bag but perhaps the outstanding example of extratribal marriage in the old testament is found in ruth the moabitess ancestress of both david and christ himself in short the ancient israelites were a blend of mediterranean peoples and any attempt to claim that they were concerned about racial purity is a myth the one real example of an attempt to prohibit intermarriage with nonjews by the priest ezra and the governor nehemiah was based on spiritual motives nonjews were pagans and there was real concern that intermarriage would cause defections from the faith of israel another popular prooftext is verse of the th chapter of leviticus do not breed any of vour domestic animals with others of a different species do not sow a field of yours with two different kinds of seed and do not put on a garment woven with two different kinds of thread the purpose of this piece of legislation was a religious one it was to inculcate practices which would serve as reminders of a religious truth the need to preserve the faith of israel undefiled by any admixture with pagan cults like much of old testament law it has been superseded by the new testament and no longer is binding on us yet the tortuous reasoning of the segregationist would seem to be that although we no longer have to avoid the mixtures expressly condemned in this passage we plant hybrid corn wear suits made of dacron and wool and crossbreed cattle we must treat it as the biblical warrant for avoiding a kind of mixture never even hinted at in the text we might summarize the old testament attitude on racial segregation by saying very simply that the ancient israelites had no such concern those passages which might at first glance seem to lend support however fanciful to segre gationist views are either concerned with other matters entirely are examples of tribal suspicion of the stranger or based upon religious and not racial grounds in turning to the new testament we find that jesus himself was by no means of pure stock both st matthew chapter one and st luke chapter three give christs family tree and in both accounts of it we find several nonjews but still more important the new testament teaching of christ and the apostles offers no foothold for the segregationist actually it provides much more support to those who would abolish every sort of invidious discrimination st paul summarizes the whole new testament teaching on the unity of mankind in christ to the galatians he writes no longer is there jew or greek no longer is there slave or freeman no longer is there male or female you are all one in christ jesus galatians he reminds the ephesians christ it is who has made both jew and gentile one and has broken down the partition wall of hostility which separated them ephesians against this background of new testament thought we might pose a different question from the one with which we began this inquiry if the bible neither supports nor tolerates segregation does it demand integration the scene of judgment described by matthew chap indicates that there is one and only one decisive question christ will ask us have you loved your neighbor as yourself he has never assured us that such love is free of risk it may well mean risk of health or wealth or even life itself but neither has he offered to excuse us because of such risks of course the problem of integration or segregation is a modern problem it did not exist in the world of the bible but this modern problem nevertheless demands the light which biblical teaching on human relations can and does shed upon it how can any christian seriously maintain that segregation is compatible with christianity or refuse to work actively in so far as he is able for the elimination of this scandal from the modem world the unity of mans origin and destiny the community of mans fall and redemption the demand of christ for a love that surmounts all barriers of social or class distinction leaves no other alternative do not be surprised brothers if the world hates you you know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers he who does not love abides in death everyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him little children let us not love merely in word or with tongue but in action in reality i john a kind of homecoming oday february i set foot on african soil for the first time i had expected and anticipated a spiritual excitement a kind of dramatic consciousness of identity with the spirits of ancestors long dead and unknown and i wished very hard to feel something anything truly different after the long hours in the airplane but all that happened was the heat which soon had my shirt sticking to my back in the short walk from the plane to the airport lounge airport guards with rifles or with pistols holstered at their sides yet wearing friendly smiles and saluting the travelers with friendly gestures of welcome the sky blue and clear and limitlessly empty except for the large wrynecked carrion crows which circled lazily patiently confident that sooner or later they would find a meal the long ride to the hotel in conakry capital of the former french colony of guinea along a narrow asphalt road fringed with trees suddenly and sweetly familiar the trees of boyhood and hometown cocoanut palms curving sinuously upward their tufted tops swaying in disdainful majesty above the green banana and papaya trees mango trees so deeply green each leaf seemed to be in shadow breadfruit and laden orange trees here and there a clump of the sweet cassava plant or the blooming hibiscus and bougainvillea and now it came to me in a tearstarting rush i had seen it all before in the british guiana of my boyhood all of it the crows and the trees and the low huts strawthatched with walls and floors of packed clay as the car sped along the road i caught glimpses of familiar faces long remembered and i had the feeling that if i leaned out and called out a name someone would answer with pleased recognition as i approached the center of conakry the feeling of being in familiar surroundings decreased probably because the buildings seemed so strange square and shuttered tenthirty in the morning and everywhere groups of people sitting at doorways or outside the shops or in the shade beside the road men always the men sitting dozing or in friendly argument among themselves men talking and laughing while women moved among them with bundles or large household vessels balanced casually on their heads and tiny children strapped straddlelegged on their backs in front of the shops the innumerable tailors each one pedaling industriously on his treadletype sewing machine undisturbed by the talk and laughter of the groups of men around them who had plenty of time to stand stare and comment and the others those easily identifiable as strangers always in groups of four or more strongfeatured men who reminded me of the drillers and surveyors and oilmen of maracaibo but without their easy banter and ribaldry russians czechs and chinese all looking serious and dedicated as if determined to prove that they were not tourists i called at the bank to change some travelers checks into the local currency but finding it closed during the midday lunch period not much lunch for the staff i thought for now is the time of ramadan the moslem month of fasting i wandered around and sat in the bar st germain for a beer and sandwich nine chinese eight men and one woman sat at a nearby table waiting to be served the lunch they ordered meanwhile reading technical pamphlets and books with hardly a single word exchanged between them the waiter a friendly little man originally from somewhere in the west indies noticed my interest in the chinese group we call them the miracle workers he said they build well and very quickly have you seen the exposition building i replied that i didnt know there was one nice he said very nice and they build it like that and he snapped finger and thumb to indicate high speed the men were lean hardlooking and young the woman slim and petite her hair severely short her face impassive and without makeup when the food arrived they kept their books open and read while they ate as if the food held little interest for them and was merely a necessary interruption in the flow of more positive endeavors other people dropped into the bar and my friend the waiter would say russian or american one partly graying man approached my table greeted me in french and sat down he said he was a correspondent from yugoslavia in guinea to cover the impending visit of marshal tito now i know why there are all the flags and street decorations i said well partly he replied most of them are left over from the visit of the russian premier who was here a short while ago i returned to the bank in the afternoon the staff was just arriving and was busy shaking hands with each other in the french manner the bank is a large building the offices at street level with several other customers white and black i waited at the counter while the staff showered each other with courtesies they were all very young and when they were finally seated at their desks and had begun their various activities they seemed very slow and inexperienced typewriters and adding machines were operated slowly and ponderously and i had the feeling that they were all in training if not completely new to the job when finally a clerk approached me he took what seemed to be an awfully long time to complete several forms then i was told to sit and wait so i stood at a barred window and watched the movement in the street outside people spitting all over the place so with some disgust i turned away awful isnt it a man was standing beside me he too must have been watching the people i mean the spitting he went on but theres a reason for it theyre fasting most of them and what with the heat and the dust it is very difficult to swallow the saliva so they spit same thing in all moslem countries try fasting and you might feel yourself wanting to spit too he was tall and thin and very red as if new to the heat and strong sunshine he spoke in english each word clearly and carefully enunciated as is the case when one is using a foreign language his thin bony face had a sharp intelligent look but pleasant with curiosity and understanding it must be difficult for them in this heat i replied not knowing what else to say theyre accustomed to it he said its one of the things that binds these people together their religion and helps to rally them for political action when necessary which part of africa you from im from the west indies i answered and i am visiting africa for the first time to take a look at things i come from prague he told me im a teacher i am here helping to train teachers so we talked about teaching i mentioned that i had taught in schools in britain and referred to the kind of problems i had encountered there in guinea he said there was never any problem of discipline because religious and other influences conditioned the child to respect his elders and the educated person commanded a position of prestige the main problem was how best to meet the acute shortage of schools teaching staff and equipment and at the same time keep pace with the hunger for education which was everywhere in evidence as i spoke with him i realized that he had a real and simple belief in human dignity and his work was important in that it was geared to a readiness to be sympathetic and helpful i noticed that while talking the time had slipped away and we were still waiting for our money so i approached the clerk who had attended me and asked if there was any reason for the delay everything is ready he replied but the cashier has not yet returned from lunch he was very matteroffact about it and i felt myself becoming impatient and irritable especially as the clerk casually ignored me and went on laboriously adding figures on a machine the czech teacher said this is not paris or london you know after all theres nowhere to go in a hurry so dont be too impatient these young people are trying to do a very complicated job without much experience when the french left they took every piece of equipment they could with them together with the experienced staff so these young men and women have to learn as they go and banking is not the easiest of business transactions nevertheless they are making it work no matter how slow it seems as they become more and more accustomed to the routine of the work and the techniques of international finance the whole thing will speed up and heres something else when it is finally running smoothly all of these young people will have the satisfaction of knowing that they did it themselves thats important you know soon afterward the cashier arrived a goodlooking obviously pregnant young woman she quickly checked through the forms made some rapid calculations on a small adding machine and paid me the amount i required in guinea currency from the speed with which she worked in such contrast to her colleagues it was clear that she was very experienced and pregnant though she was very much needed once out in the street the czech teacher remarked thats a sign of the times all the white faces were on the wrong side of the counter i understood his little joke when i left him i wandered away from the center of town through the narrow streets lined with the allpurpose shops of the lebanese traders past a high wall behind which could be heard the alltoofamiliar sounds of childrens voices i followed the wall around to a wooden gateway and entered a small courtyard where about a hundred children sat in tight rows behind long narrow trestletype desks and repeated the instructions of a teacher as he explained simple arithmetical tables with the assistance of a blackboard i paused but he noticed me and came over i apologized for interrupting his lesson but he seemed quite pleased to have a visitor especially when i mentioned that i too had been a teacher as soon as the children saw me they stood up very quietly a gesture of respect i had received previously only in the public schools of britain and it occurred to me that whatever the shortages in other fields this new state was not ignoring the importance of social niceties the class was mixed boys and girls of about eleven years all simply sometimes poorly dressed without any attention to uniformity but their black faces and lively eyes shone with their hunger for knowledge and information the teacher wore khaki slacks and shirt and simple sandals of broad strips of leather fastened to thick rubber soles which i suspected had been cut from old motorcar tires on his brown intelligent face he sported a sparse scraggly beard which did nothing for him nor took anything from himit was simply there thats all his french was beautifully articulated and i later discovered that he had studied for eleven years in dakar are you over here to help us as a teacher he asked oh no i replied im merely wandering around africa looking for things to write about my first visit you know welcome again he said and we shook hands again but its a pity youre not a teacher we desperately need all we can get see for yourself i need at least another teacher to help me here any likelihood of the situation improving oh were getting help he replied but not enough quickly enough people are going to help us from china and czechoslovakia and yugoslavia and the west indies you know martinique and guadaloupe where they speak french sometimes it even becomes a bit complicated when some of the new teachers have to teach through interpreters until they can manage in french damned funny at times his laugh was easy and pleasant i suppose that limits the scope of the teaching you are able to do i suggested not too much he replied because we are adapting our educational plans to our needs and right now we need artisans and agricultural workers more than we need clerks and potential bureaucrats so we are concentrating on primary education to supply a broad general base then in the secondary schools we are providing technical education planned to create an interest in the country and a willingness to contribute to its development the child who gets an education must appreciate that the state needs his trained usefulness you mentioned teachers from china czechoslovakia etc i said do not they present the possible danger of introducing communistic ideas into the minds of the youngsters immediately his face lost its pleasant friendly mien his eyes shone with controlled anger and he replied you americans are all alike black or white youre all the same in a hasty attempt at apology i said im sorry i did not mean to offend you by asking that question incidentally im not an american im a west indian please forgive me if my question annoyed you im not annoyed he said carefully im merely sorry for you because you americans have developed such a phobia about the word communist that you see nothing but communists wherever you go here in guinea we are desperately trying to transform independence from a political attainment into an economic reality to do that we need help and we are not too proud to accept help but we will not accept any help if it means jeopardizing any part or aspect of that independence we sacrificed so much to achieve i looked at the children and noticed that they were watching somewhat anxiously something of the teachers changed mood must have transmitted itself very quickly to them and they were in silent response to it the teacher himself seemed suddenly aware of the childrens interest because he turned and rapidly wrote a few simple problems on the blackboard which he instructed them to copy and solve in their notebooks when they were busy at this he turned once more to me maybe you americans would like to help us if he emphasized that little word with hands and shoulders and eyesit even had a strangely sibilant sound as he hissed it at me maybe you would help us but only on your terms because you neither understand nor believe in african neutrality and that is simply explained by the fact that as yet you do not believe or respect africans he paused and shrugged a tired patient gesture i am not a communist im merely a teacher trying to do my job as well as i am able this is not a communist country and i think i can safely say it will never be the day you black americans understand what personal independence really means you will begin to understand how we feel about our country he was not angry but i was becoming bored with being called an american and being blamed for their supposed sins of omission i made one more try im not an american im from the west indies oh yes so you said he answered smiling suddenly but you sound like an american you ought to stay here awhile and becomewhat is the termbrainwashed he laughed at this and i joined him and on that easier note i left him the afternoon sun was very warm and i made my way in the general direction back to my hotel anticipating a refreshing shower and a change from my sweatdamp clothes here and there i saw groups of workmen swarming over the skeleton of a new building and it was with something of a shock that i realized that nowhere in sight was there a single piece of mechanical equipmenteverything was being done by hand ladders were makeshift arrangements from roughly cut saplings as were all other wooden supports in use concrete was mixed by hand and passed by a chain of hands to the place desired here and there i saw a european directing operations and i guessed from their slavic features that they were eastern european but in spite of what the young guinea teacher had just said there was not much evidence of concentrated popular effort in fact conakry was to me singularly depressing i passed a group of women dressed in their national costume with wide flaring skirts and an overmantle of embroidered gauze on their heads they wore headkerchiefs of brightly patterned cotton tied to show wide points rising elegantly from each side like the wings of some exotic bird immediately the rusty wheels of my memory quickened into gear and i recalled seeing women similarly dressed long ago in my native british guiana on market day in the countryside yes memory was clearer now i could even remember seeing a photograph of my grandmother wearing that distinguishable headkerchief i looked closely at the women observing their finely shaped features black and silky smooth did my origins lie somewhere here with these people i could not understand a word they said for they spoke an african dialect but they smiled at me and i bowed as i passed i was feeling something now and it was a good feeling for the very first time in many years i was walking among people without being conscious that i was different from them although a stranger to africa i felt sufficiently identified to be at ease comfortable to belong passersby might readily recognize that i was a stranger to guinea but unless my speech gave me away it would be assumed that i was african from some other territory or state a stranger but not strange because i was by origin a fragment of the whole back in england persons often asked me from which part of africa are you because on first contact they immediately associated my black skin with africa now in an african town among africans i felt at east and realized with something of a shock that the white faces looked strange to me a group of men standing outside the office of air france chatted softly but earnestly about the congo and patrice lumumbas death for which they blamed the united nations in general and the negligence of ghana in particular i sat nearby to listen surprised at the amount of information they seemed to have with them the congo was a cause celebre and indicated the need to so order their own internal affairs that it would never be necessary for the united nations or any other organization to intervene from a passing taxi a radio blared forth the sound of childrens voices in song something in praise of president sekou toure their voices too loud and evidently untrained but undeniably enthusiastic as the men spoke of the congo it was clear that lumumbas death and in such strange circumstances crystallized in their minds the evils of all colonialists and their policies one man made a reference to tshombe and spat on the ground to show his disgust from what they said i learned that the guinean forces in the congo had been recalled some had already returned home now and then someone spoke of we in africa or we africans but i had the feeling that for them africa meant guinea because there was little or no reference to any of the other african states it was very exciting to watch them and notice that the language they used their mannerisms and fondness for the philosophical turn of phrase were all very french indeed but none of it detracted from their dignity or belief in the rightness of their opinions back at the hotel i had an excellent dinner and from my corner table observed the other diners some of whom were guests at the hotel others officials resident in the town and able to afford the exorbitant prices charged for the meals bits of conversation could be heard in russian yugoslav czech chinese german french arabic english and american eating was a long drawnout affair because after dinner there was nowhere to go and nothing to do for entertainment having eaten i sat at the bar next to a tall very black man who between sips from his glass held it up to the light as if determined to discover how such a harmlesslooking liquid could produce the kind of effect it was having on him his hands holding the glass fondly like a communicant were large and powerfullooking as were the shoulders and chest which bulged the thin gaily colored shirt and i was sure that when he stood up hed be six feet tall or more his thin face was dominated by a large aquiline nose and marked high on each cheek with three vertical incisions which made him look rather like a pirate in festive mood i ordered beer and surreptitiously studied the antics of my companion as they were reflected in the mirror over the bar he must have caught me at it because he suddenly turned to me and asked stranger he spoke in english yes i replied ghana no im west indian he looked more closely at me as if to locate something in my face you look like a ghanian he said tonelessly and went back to his careful examination of his drink turning the frosty glass slowly in his fingers then how do you like my country he shot the question at me without turning his head i only arrived today i replied ive been wandering around town taking a look are you a salesman or with a mission or something no im a writer looking for copy this is my first visit to africa and im trying to record my impressions he pivoted around on his stool and very seriously extended a large hand welcome to africa he said his grip was strong the fingers cool from contact with the glass this is my first food today he continued shaking the glass been fasting sunup to sunset ramadan you know ive read of it i replied know anyone in town not really just nosing around i could show you around tonight if you like he offered his drink completed we set out he was even taller than i had guessed about two inches over six feet and walked with a slightly stooped posture as if accustomed to accommodating persons much shorter than himself the night was cool from the soft sea breezes and from the forecourt of the hotel could be heard the soft murmur of the tide on the beach close by overhead the towering mango trees lost their tops against the darker sky now crowded with stars which seemed brighter because of the dimly lit streets we followed the road around from the hotel and he pointed out the stately gardensurrounded houses once the residences of highranking french officials and now converted to service as ministries of one sort or another when the previous occupants the french left he remarked they literally gutted the houses what they could not cart away they smashed baths toilet bowls everything on into the town by now the shops were closed and the streets were for the most part deserted except for an occasional group of two or three men chatting beside an open doorway a general air of depression seemed to hover over the whole place and nowhere could i detect any sound of music or laughter god what a place to be stuck in i thought what does one do for entertainment in this place i asked he stopped with that curious habit of listening with his head cocked to one side entertainment he echoed oh i see what you mean there are no night clubs or brothels here these days the french took them with them when they departed so hastily but we manage very well without them he laughed luckily we are a polygamous people so have ways of entertaining ourselves then in a serious vein we do know how to enjoy ourselves believe me but right now most people are observing ramadan and that is a very quiet period for us we walked in silence for a while past the deserted market with its tiers of open stalls through narrow streets lined with closely packed twostory buildings dark behind their tight shutters and empty except for mongrel dogs foraging in the shadows on past the high wall of the soldiers cantonments until we reached some open ground beyond which the chinese exhibition building rose in massive silhouette here we stopped very impressive i offered in an attempt to probe his thoughts what he asked the exhibition building like a transplanted piece of new china oh sure he replied his thoughts elsewhere before long all the open land like this will either become development areas or be turned into parks and playgrounds for our children but before that happens we have lots of lessons to learn and the chief one is to live without the things we cannot affordthings like night clubs and brothels he turned and grinned at me his teeth a flash of white in the dark gloom of his face we africans often talk glibly about independence he continued after a while before it is achieved the very word has a certain magic quality and very often we expect that many of the problems which attend the winning of independence will solve themselves in some magical way here in guinea we are learning that independence must be more than a political milestone it must become a spiritual quality so that we can better apply ourselves to the grave tasks ahead of us this quality of the spirit is not breathed in with the night air at this he waved his arm in the gesture of an oratorit has to be learned and developed we the old ones learned it through fighting and sacrifice and we have to teach it to our children with everything else they learn in that way all of us will understand and accept that each one of us has the responsibility for making this country great excuse me please i interrupted but are you a lawyer or teacher perhaps no he replied im a soldier he began walking and i fell into stride with him have you been to the congo his answer was long in coming yes he finally replied and for me the most important lesson is this that under no circumstances must we in guinea allow our internal affairs ever to deteriorate to the point where any outside country or organization needs to intervene or is asked to intervene but fortunately that is very unlikely we walked in silence for a while all kinds of questions clamored within me but i felt that he was in the mood to talk and needed no prompting from me it was a saddening experience for me he continued to see an organization like the united nations forces of which we were a part become so completely ineffectual as an organ for peace and stability through the vagueness of its mandate the irresolution of its authority and the proved inexperience of some of its top personnel who though tagged and uniformed as military personnel had neither the tradition of military action nor the personal experience of situations of armed conflict to guide their decisions much of what happened in the congo since july of must be laid at the doorstep of the united nations and it will long remain a matter of national and personal regret that we contributed by association to the whole unhappy situation the congo dilemma is a monument to human error everyone involved in it made mistakes varying only in degree unfortunately in nearly every instance mistaken action was persisted in primarily to save somebodys face or defended because no other course of action seemed effective stupidity is no respecter of persons and many innocent people have died because of it we in guinea can avoid such fatal stupidity by teaching ourselves and our children to appreciate the disciplines and responsibilities of independence and so to believe in this little country of ours that no hardship is too great and no contribution too small in helping its progress does the man in the street feel the same way as you do about the countrys development and his involvement in it i asked yes of course he replied even though he might not be as articulate in exposing his feelings while youre here talk to them yourself and if you have the time get up into the country among the smaller towns and villages talk with the people you might run into a few surprises we continued our walk swinging right along the tarmac road which followed the twisting coastline overhead the palm fronds whispered softly as they touched each other sly sounds vaguely heard against the wash of the tide and the heavier chorus of crickets frogs and the sleepless nightjars people passed us talking softly together the slap slap of their sandaled feet audible long after they had faded into the distance we need help to do the things we need to do here he continued and we are getting help from certain quarters but we need more the time must come when we shall resolve our differences with france without sacrifice to our national pride or integrity and one fine day the americans will think seriously enough of us and other african states to treat us with the dignity due to independent states and their inhabitants we are sick of being badgered or maneuvered into situations of choice between east or west merely because the united states will not conceive that we are free people and intend to remain free from any kind of influence or control jesus christ the damn folly of it he exclaimed do you know something none of the russians or czechs or yugoslavs or chinese who come here ever ask about the united states and what we think of them we have a few american teachers in our schools but no one asks us if that means that were becoming capitalists why the hell cant americans recognize that to people like us freedom and independence are the most precious things we have anyway he said more calmly it may all work toward our good the hardships we experience now might prove to be the best possible thing that could have happened to us dont you think i ventured that your political conduct i mean your countrys political conduct must reflect a truly neutralist attitude if you expect to be believed that is not what is expected of us he replied no one believes in african neutrality we are exnected to be either prowest or procommunist and if we refuse to enter bodily into one camp we are promptly branded with the label of the other if i or one of my countrymen should visit russia tomorrow the word would go around that i am prorussian or procommunist and id have a hell of a time if after that i wanted to visit the united states but take the other side of the coin no eastern european country would refuse me entry merely because i had previously visited the united states what does that make you think who is it that has the growing up to do we were now once more outside the hotel de france well here we are he said tell you what if you like i could take you around tomorrow we could take a run up into the country and let you see whats happening there conakrybrothels apart or the lack of themis like any town anywhere which has felt the influence of a cosmopolitan population upcountry you might better see and understand the things ive been talking about id like that fine i replied delighted to have so interesting and responsible a companion showing me around this was indeed a lucky break one thing you can do he said seeming in no hurry to leave when you write about us let them know that what we need even more than their money or their machines is their respect theyve got to learn to respect us as equals much of the time they humor us ive seen it with my own eyes so i know what im talking about nowadays wherever an african goes and speaks he is listened to and nobody ever attempts to be critical of him unless they feel that his political complexion differs from theirs theyre never very much concerned with the man or the content of his talking but merely with the kind of political alignment he represents or seems to represent we command attention in the councils of the world primarily because we are africans and so we are wooed and solicited and pampered like clever performing monkeys because nobody is really taking the trouble to look behind the facade and understand the african the first thing about our new independence is our desire to be seen and heard often we are unprepared to be seen and heard and our posture is merely an imitation of those who so recently controlled us yet it is readily applauded and encouraged uncritically just because we are africans however when we are reported i notice that our remarks are invariably qualified by reference to our use of english or french as if that were the seal of cultural arrival it is hardly ever noticed that every african who stands up in the worlds councils speaks a language different from the one he learned at his mothers breast and is consciously or unconsciously making a concession to those who would otherwise find it nearly impossible to communicate with him on the other hand we africans do not seem to have finally made up our minds about the grave responsibilities which lie ahead we resent the old image which nonafricans entertain about us but we have done little to present a new and clearer image of ourselves very often we behave as if we are shipwrecks struggling helplessly in the floodtide of independence instead of capable marines managing our political affairs with judgment and discretion we have a hell of a lot to learn from each other and from nonafrican people with wider experience of government industry and representation than ourselves but we need the kind of constructive criticism and appraisal free of political bias which would stimulate us to increased responsibility of expression and action he laid a fatherly hand on my shoulder and said you must forgive me my young friend for preaching to you but it is not every day that one has the opportunity to talk like this with an outsider too often you people are in a hurry to judge us out of hand and naturally our first impulse is to resent your criticism because you have shown very little inclination to understand and be at least patient with us try to balance everything you see and hear against the fact that we were suddenly thrown upon our own limited resources with the added handicap of the antipathy and distrust generated by the conduct of the french in the last days of their control remember that in spite of our difficulties we are a small country but a united one have a good night and well start upcountry early in the morning ill call for you around eight oclock i watched his tall figure swing easily down the path onto the road to move into the treecrowded shadow of the still african night i breakfasted at am and comfortable in cool khaki shirt and slacks i waited for my friend who arrived promptly on time in a large chauffeurdriven american car he may have noticed my surprise because he said laughing i wangled it on the argument that you were an important visitor its one of our official cars outside the hotel the air was damp and fresh with dew which still hung in misty patches over every ditch or narrow gully the driver leaned heavily on his horn as we moved through the town streets already crowded with people on their way to their various jobs or to the large market in the center of town we slowed down as we passed the market the air now heavy with the ripe odors of dried fish fruit and a wide variety of unfamiliar herbs and roots people shouted at each other across the inches which separated them in the ageold exercise of haggling over the price of an article their arms flailing the air in wild gestures or their fingers fluttering in insistent illustration every kind of merchandise seemed to be on sale but most of it utilitarian and of cheap manufacture brightly patterned cloth from japan cheekbyjowl with gay enamel cooking utensils stamped with the legend sierra leone independence large bunches of bananas and plantains piles of local oranges chickens lying on their sides with legs securely tied their eyes halfglazed with fear the public letterwriter sitting at his little table ready to serve the illiterate for a price and the ubiquitous tailor the whir of his restless treadle lost in the general cacophony this country is rich very rich my friend said look at the color of the i earth weve not even begun to tap our resources of bauxite or lets say were i only scratching the surface so far under that useless grass theres wealth i waiting to be dug up but it requires money lots of it wish i knew a short i cut to fort knox he laughed then as if struck by a sudden idea he said i tell me something about president kennedys peace corps what will it do i and how does he plan to set about assembling it i why does everyone ask me questions about america as if i am an i american or somehow responsible for what happens there i seem to spend i an awful lot of time explaining that british guiana is not the usa all i i know about it is what i have read or heard in france i replied strange the way americans see africa he murmured more to himself than to me i wonder who it is that advises him about us in africa peace corps where would he send them and what will they do and what is most important how will he choose them i read that they will be mostly young men will their expressed liberality be a qualification would they have to like black people before they become eligible or will they be shown how to be a liberal after they are chosen would a man be barred because he is a southerner even if they satisfy all of mr kennedys requirements does that imply that we in africa will believe in them what guarantees have we that the men of the peace corps who come to be nice to us in africa would be just as nice to black americans in the usa and when they come over here what will they do just tell us what nice people americans are were not interested in peace corps were not interested in hearing how peace can best be preserved from young liberal americans wed rather have some of the practical symbols of peace out there he pointed at the blur of landscape flitting by you know bulldozers and tractors and wed welcome young peaceful americans who could teach us how to turn this brown grassy promise into a productive certainty so that our country might taste the fruits of peace before they grow too old to care peace corps he whispered that is the kind of charity which should begin at home and be firmly restrained from leaving it his lips tightened into a thin bitter line or perhaps he intends sending black americans to teach us about peace they are not much better than the white ones i hear that they want to identify with us africans and that theyve started all kinds of organizations which claim to reflect african heritage very good provided they maintain the distance between america and africa and are sensible enough to understand that a black skin does not make everyone an african ive seen them here and in other places in africa and been rather sorry for some of them when i observed their disillusionment with us from thousands of miles away tomtoms and grass huts and polygamy seems very attractive and picturesque and freedom for africa is an exciting battlecry but close at hand the heat and the dirt and disease and shortages play havoc with lofty resolutions i suddenly felt somewhat out of accord with him maybe this was aimed obliquely at me because i too felt a sense of identity with africas political destiny surely i interrupted the expressions of solidarity from black americans is all of a piece with african progress even though they come from people several generations removed from the african scene im concerned with positive values he replied sagely not with questionable postures the best contribution any outsider can make is to be as active and positive as possible in the fight against indignity and inhumanity americans are americans and the black ones should concentrate all their efforts in fighting the many forces of indignity which beset them in america that is the kind of contribution we need herethe encouragement of knowing that on all fronts the fight for social equality and political freedom is firmly joined do you know and once again his face relaxed in a smile quite often i meet black americans in africa and by god theyre so american in everything they do and say that they dont seem to realize it and we africans find it most irritating because of the common factorour black skins seems pretty hopeless does it i asked not altogether he assured me laughing maybe one day we africans will become as familiar with airconditioning and laborsaving devices and department stores so that well develop a few more factors in common with our american cousins there was a question which had been on my mind all day now that he seemed relaxed and affable i decided to plunge in about your president i began well what about him so far you have said nothing about him in european newspapers i have seen him referred to as dictator procommunist strong man and demagogue so far you have been very frank and outspoken in your observations about the outsiders would you be just as frank in telling me about guineas leadership after two years as an independent state again the familiar headononeside pause but this time the beginnings of a smile tickled the side of his mouth and ran along the big arched nose the things you read were mainly true but the people who wrote them did not understand the truth they were writing they did not even know they were writing the truth because they do not know the man easy relaxed patient even fatherly now hed be generous and explain it carefully to me two things they do not understand the africans background and the meaning of african nationalism in africa we have always been accustomed to authoritarian rule it has been the basis of our social structure long before any european ever set foot on african soil and it still survives in the heart of every african no matter how europeanized he might seem to be in africa we respect strength and we honor it when it is allied to personal courage and skillful leadership our president has these qualities and he is an african in the fullest sense he is well informed although he never attended university either here or abroad and when he speaks he speaks the language of our people in the way our people understand we trust him and we follow him dictator demagogue those are european terms they have no meaning in the context of africa nor has the term democracy in guinea we are for the most part of our three million people illiterate democracy presupposes a literate majority of the population what we need what we must have is strong forceful leadership toward achievable targets designed to involve everyone irrespective of educational or other considerations he sipped his drink before continuing as for the other thing it seems impossible for the outsider to get into the skin of the african to understand the terrible but wonderful spirit which has recently been released within and among us you blind yourselves with label and name tags and refuse to look behind them to apprehend the facts if an african reads marx or engels you brand him communist if he visits prague or moscow you brand him communist would you consider him a capitalist if you caught him reading the financial times the lesson you need to learn all of you both east and west as you are fond of describing yourselves is that we are first and last africans we are willing and ready to learn from you all of you but we have no wish or intention to be anything but africansfree independent africans your newspapers expend a lot of time and energy criticizing our form of government let them note that we are all firstclass hundred per cent africans there are no secondclass citizens among us let them also note that the oneparty rule which they find so difficult to swallow is not restricted to guinea liberia ghana tunisia these are but a few where the same things exist and sierra leone go there and take a look milton margai has no opposition party to contend with then theres nigeria right now we have the job of feeding housing and educating our people and of building our economy so that we can continue to improve their food housing and education and we have a leader who is young strong and vigorous enough to do just that i suppose you have noticed that our shops have no luxury goods and our women do not wear the latest paris fashions but what is important is the fact that although the french revoked their support of our budget we are not economically crippled as a matter of fact we are stable and moving ahead later on we may give some attention to putting a little icing on the cake he laughed and i felt an admiration for this man if he truly expressed the general attitude of the people then guinea was well on the way to setting its mark on the whole continent of africa this was undoubtedly a big night people were arriving for the show mostly europeans men and women dressed fashionably in light linens and silks all looking enthusiastic greeting each other somewhat loudly now and then my friend would indicate an ambassador or special envoy from europe or another african state a tall distinguishedlooking fairskinned negro immaculate in a white sharkskin suit was identified as the united states ambassador the tone of my friends voice did not convey much enthusiasm he may be leaving us soon he remarked as the gentleman passed us on his way to the main hall i thought that the ambassador may have completed his tour of duty and was moving to some other theater of operations one must never underestimate the deep effects of conditioning he said seemingly talking more to himself than to me that is why we must use every means possible to keep reminding our people that every aspect of their daily lives must reflect their consciousness of freedom and independence treat a man unequally and after a time he will think or behave unequally even if you subsequently place him in high office he will occasionally betray some residual traits of inequality we are a free and sovereign state and would prefer that representatives from other states at ambassadorial and other levels are chosen from among the best in their field and at the moment we are inclined to doubt that black americans have had sufficient opportunities at higher diplomatic level to provide them with the background and experience necessary to the efficient execution of the job of an ambassador we cannot be expected to entertain the highest regard for a black ambassador when we know that in many parts of his own country he would be refused hotel accommodation and other facilities merely because of the color of his skin and when he speaks to us on matters of importance we cannot be sure that he speaks on behalf of all america it therefore follows that america must quickly introduce changes to equate the status of her black citizens with that of her white citizens or keep the black ones out of internationalrepresentative office may i ask you a rather frank question i interrupted why not its a free country he grinned you are bitter about america arent you one might even say you are positively antiamerican arent you guilty of the same kind of phobia which you so determinedly condemn in them its strange he replied but i feel no hatred no none whatsoever is that difficult for you to believe lets put it this way im impatient to see some improvement in the relationships between other countries and ourselves but i think it is necessary to speak ones mind ive been speaking frankly with you because i hope that in reporting me you will present the truth and perhaps it might lead to some revision of attitudes no im not antiamerican i am merely proafrican even if at the moment all africa for me is concentrated in the word guinea i suggested that we get seats for the fashion show and we inquired at the desk but discovered that we were days too late all available seats had been sold and there was not even standing room it was no great disappointment because the long car trip the heavy meal and the beer all conspired to produce a comfortable lassitude and we agreed that perhaps bed would be best i said goodbye to my friend as he would be busy from then on and would be unable to spend more time with me and retired to my room to scribble down everything i could remember of our conversation later i could hear the sounds of music and cheering from downstairs but soon these subsided into the dark peace of the african night
man barry sat at the breakfast table obscured from his wife hy a c pyof the new york tribune occasionally a hand reached out for coffee and returned then replaced the cup see where theyre considering a tax hike he complained seems theres no end to taxes after eating barry kissed his wife grabbed his brief case and started for the door oh he said hows herbies cold its better his wife replied but im

come you ride car hey no i think maybe i get refrigerator to sleep in this african heat very bad you know tunde laughed and flung a joshing hand at his departing neighbor who saw his bus rumbling down the dusty road after getting on he took a seat next to anna polynova a middle aged woman he had been riding with for years ahh a good morning to you she said cheerily she had been saying it the same way for eternity and nikoli returned her greeting as he always had how is your little ivan today she inquired oh hes better today replied nikoli still has the sniffles though my land she remarked were

well find something worse when the bus reached his stop in downtown moscow nikoli bade his commuter companion farewell and stepped to the street he strode briskly along the ginza slightly swinging his brief case back and forth it was a beautiful day and people crowded the street en route to their jobs shimura usually grimaced upon smelling the dirty canal water but on brilliant days as this one he would forget all unpleasantness he briskly entered a building and crowded himself into an elevator good morning shimurasan greeted one of his coworkers ah good morning mochidasan he said your son tanizawa is he all right today yes said shimura he just has a mild case of the sniffles today returning home from work in the afternoon robert was quite weary from a hard days work he held his brief case as though it weighed fifty pounds and didnt swing it at all he found his neighbor as he had left him tampering with his automobile only there were many more parts lying about now hey george robert called directing his voice to a pair of feet george emerged from under the car showing a greasy face with a clean smile you know man he said i think i better get me a mechanic man what you need

for our people and him not caring about school like that yeah man said george these kids today dont know whats happening robert shrugged and headed for home see you later man ok man said george take it easy yeah its never too late to learn dver wish you had do more education you look around and see the everlessening number of unskilled job openings and wish that you your husband or the boy you hope to marry could get out of the rut and uncertainty of earning a living with so little skill and knowledge to offer do you look at others and envy their progress and bemoan the luck that keeps you down but i had to go to work early my folks couldnt afford to keep me in school too many mouths to feed around our house all i wanted to do was fool around nobody made me study i got expelled i wanted to marry and have a home of my own many excuses many reasons but the statistical truth revealed by the u s census bureau is that only about seven percent of the adult population of the united states has a high school education yet in spite of this low educational level jobs are getting scarcer for unskilled and uneducated workers machines in factories and offices are demanding knowledge not manpower alone men and women who know who are willing to keep learning even if they had to quit formal schooling early are the ones industry wants fortunately however it has never been so easy to continue education as now even if you are employed fulltime have children or are handicapped in some manner somewhere somehow there is a chance for you your husband or boy friend to learn thereby improving chances for earning more money and getting more satisfaction from living first of all do not admit defeat you are not alone your need has not been forgotten more and more employers union leaders recreational workers librarians ministers and various welfare and civic organizations are recognizing the hunger of people for more learning they see that the increasing automation of our space age is going to require a trained people actually a college degree is not a requirement in most fields neither is a high school diploma however the one requirement is usually a willingness to seek more learning lets consider some of the avenues to more knowledge offered for the taking some free some for nominal fees there are the ymca ymha ywca here are offered courses that vary in different communities but included are everything from swimming to stenography and selling write to your local y organization for a complete listing of courses offered for increasing skill and enjoyment of living industry has encouragement programs for employees who want to better themselves eastman kodak gives tuitionaid for employees studying jobrelated courses u s steel bell telephone standard oil western electric and ford motor training company are only a few of the big companies that have varied programs for onthejob training direct financing for further education or reimbursement plans for ambitious employees write to these and other corporations and learn what each company has to offer in educational plans for vocational advancement universities have extension courses that offer credit and noncredit programs in such subjects as nursing teaching animal husbandry soil conservation dairying marketing recreation family health engineering public relations labormanagement relations etc one big college city college of new york offers some courses for younger children at the same time parents are attending classes trade unions often have libraries and workers educational programs to help in general and special knowledge for the laborers advancement and happiness study by yourself this is perhaps the biggest selfimprovement field for those whose education was interrupted home study methods are important big correspondence schools such as the international correspondence schools scranton pennsylvania not only give courses for those who answer their advertisements but cooperate with thousands of industries and businesses in providing easy methods of furthering education for groups and the individual some of our nations leading men in business and politics had little formal education but a high percentage of them got more education by means of home study courses and local adult education programs you may also study alone in other ways consult an expert in some field and ask his help or advice on securing additional education and information in his particular specialty get acquainted with your public library ask the librarian for help in learning how to use the card indexes and in finding materials that you may study at home make a plan of action in learning then follow it work full or parttime as an apprentice this can be one of the most thorough ways of learning and one of the shortest and most practical paths to mastery education need never be completely finished for the person who wants to keep ahead in this fastpaced world and its all up to you why boxers go broke boxers the process of going broke is much like an inevitable incurable feels early stages but is terribly painful ever after is a disease that afflicts most of the bigname highestpaid boxers regardless of race creed or disease good it color regardless of their own innate intelligence regardless of good management regardless of all the bad examples lateera fighters could learn from sugar ray robinson is a mental giant in his craft he is a man who understands sharpies and sharp practices yet a few years ago sugar ray sat in the guest dining room at the ebony magazine offices and literally cried over his financial woes he blamed friends whom he had trusted implicitly exheavyweight champion ezzard charles admits that his managers were gentlemen and most of his federal income taxes unlike joe louis were paid off the top of his purses yet charles couldnt escape an attack of secondstage poverty jimmy carter several times lightweight champion was once so frugal that he wouldnt even purchase an automobilebut somehow his money trickled through his fingers as if they were paralyzed and his bank account leaked like an open wound the total number of oncerich fighters of the past halfcentury who have escaped the financial blight can be ticked off on the fingers of one arthritic hand the fact is charles an expert on the subject has neatly packaged the complete story by saying of himself i seem to have gone the way of all champions at the time he spoke charles was bereft of plush cincinnati home several businesses dozens of old friends and the gleaming cadillacs he used to drive but still possessed of a fine mind and a keen will to win he was fighting backholding down a promotional job with a wine company learning the wrestling profession manfully holding his family together always a man capable of turning the fetching word charles concluded i lay me down to bleed a whileand then rise to fight again the inability of boxers to hold onto their money earned through a rigorous expenditure of blood sweat and tears only slightly less horrifying than war between worlds composes the saddest sorriest most sickening story in sports the number of exfighters who once earned more money in a night than many workers earn in a lifetime only to end up as charity cases is legion conversely the number of negro boxing greats who retained their wealth from careers end all the way to the pearly gates hardly totals more than one celebrated casethat of the late harry wills jack dempseys chaser who amassed a considerable fortune and then carefully maintained it throughout his declining years to drop a few more names beau jack the lightweight who supposedly was protected by some of the finest minds in boxing traversed an unusual circular route from shoe shine stand to riches back to shoe shine stand when it was all over jack admittedly was no more knowledgeable of what had happened to his money than a preschool age kid who attempts a scholarly reply to that famous toothpaste query where did the yellow go joe louis financial difficulties are known throughout the world although joe who probably when i was dieting for fights virtually living on cups of tea charles continues my buddies were drinking scotch and eating steaks on me i used to visit a place in cincinnati called the cotton club there were guys there who used to hit me for eight and nine dollars a day every day i think now that those guys must have been junkies some guys would borrow as much as a day from me in a sense im glad that its all over now and i dont have to be bothered with that group anymore because they were not for real joe louis sugar ray robinson ezzard charles jimmy carter beau jack and henry armstrong another member of the clan probably grossed as much as million in boxing an incredible amount of money properly invested this money might well have been the foundation of enterprises now worth a billion dollars henry ford for one never possessed any such beginning bankroll but it is not entirely the fault of boxers that they are unable to manage money most of them gush up through solid bedrock of poverty into sudden fame and undreamedof riches the wise management of money as millionaire j paul getty has said is a talent that does not come easily fighters who have in most instances barely finished high school simply are not prepared to contemplate what all the money they earn so quickly means sudden wealth causes them to lose equilibrium gives them a sense of power they cant handle makes them do foolhardy things busy fighting making personal appearances training and having fun they reserve little time to study such as banking or the stock market although many boxers do selfeducate themselves admirably in the basic economics of life the sad truth is that few fighters actually control their own money most of them notably excepting sugar ray robinson docilely take orders from others some are owned by individuals or syndicates managers may take as much as per cent of the purses boxers earn v is the usual percentage a champion fighter must employ trainers rent training quarters and pay various other normal and abnormal expenses such as paddings called publicity by the time all the deducts are in the fighter finds that his oncehefty purse has been greatly decimated and then there are income taxes which constitute a vicious circle once a fighter has become delinquent for while he is fighting to pay off the pastdue bills he is piling new tax debts on the old unless he has hired reputable managers or accountants a fighter who earns a halfmillion or a million dollars in one year can easily fall into serious difficulty with the government once the treasury department held up a sugar ray robinson purse of several hundred thousand dollars louis tax bill the result jewelry and other socalled accoutrements of luxurious living of course if one is to be fair he must note that spendthrift boxers are no more egocentric nor hardly more careless with their funds than many of the nouveau riche of business or industry the basic difference however is that the boxer gets only one shot at riches he doesnt keep big money long enough to become truly accustomed to it what is the remedy for this disease of going broke which is so peculiar to boxers before an attempt is made to answer that question perhaps this point should be made most often it is the general public the fans who lament feeling the plight of oncerich boxers gone broke invariably the boxers themselves will tell you on reviewing their careers that if they had their lives to live over they wouldnt change a thing it sometimes seems that boxers dont expect to hang onto their money it comes easily and it goes easier many boxers live with the wild abandon of people who know the hellbomb is on the way and the bomb shelter is made of cardboard boxes nevertheless many concerned people suggest programs rules and regulations to protect the boxer and his money these suggestions usually begin from two points the appointment of a federal boxing czar and special income tax consideration for fighters this consideration to emphasize a payasyougo plan and special rates to equate taxes and the boxers short period of high earnings some of the suggestions advanced in recent years though wellintentioned probably would violate the civil_rights laws if put into practice in many cases the boxers themselves would have to be protected over their dead bodiesfor one seldom finds a rich champion who is humble enough to admit that he needs help in anything unless it is in an introduction to that pretty babe over there the rich boxing champion unfortunately is more apt to react in the manner of a wellknown fighter of a few years ago on being given unsolicited but undoubtedly sound advice by a sports writer who loved him like a son the rich champion turned a deaf ear a frigid shoulder and a pipinghot retort i dont tell you how to write do i he sang for the angels rtlesville is a small almost asleep southern town on the mississippi river in the old days excursion boats used to sail up and down the mississippi carrying cotton on the way up and happy people on the way back i remember especially how the shouts and the music coming from the boats sounded like the distant revelry of remembered carnivals and i would run to the apple tree in our yarda splendidly arching tree on which i had nailed thin planks of wood for a ladderand i would climb up as high as i could to see the big white boats sailing brilliantly in the sunlight from one of those boats many years ago so people told me stepped charlie logan the boat was going north so charlie must have come from someplace further south although nobody ever knew where i first met charlie when i was nine years old while exploring the outskirts of the thenbustling little town where my father a methodist minister had just been assigned to a new church i was pedaling on my bicycle up a steel hill where the tall red and yellow hollyhocks allowed only brief glimpses of the mississippi below when i decided to stop for a better view completely enraptured by the wide panorama below i began walking toward the edge of the hill suddenly the ground gave way and i found myself clinging fearfully to a clump of thick grass on the edge of the hill i was too terrified to yell for help and as i began edging my way toward the top i imagined i could see my body slipping from the ledge and plummeting to the jagged rocks below suddenly in the midst of my struggling two dark arms darted down and strong hands lifted me upright i stared up into the dark smooth face of a man whose strangely laughing eyes and strong hands gave my shaking body mental and physical support it was charlie logan thank you i managed to say weakly my heart seemed as if it was pounding through my chest i glanced backward over the hill and quickly retreated from the treacherous edge towards my bicycle charlie gave a chuckle that sounded like a low rumble of thunder thats all right son he said youre a brave boy didnt even hear you cry for help shakily i mounted my bicycle and began coasting downhill almost at the bottonttt glaneed back briefly to see charlie standing like a muscular brown statue in his somewhat tattered shirt with a grin on his broad dark face somehow i still remember the way charlie looked then but years later i was to remember him looking altogether differently my mother and father met charlie about two days after my fearful experiencean experience about which i knowing the restrictive measures of my father and the fears of my mother refused to tell them we heard a knock on the door my mother in her friendliest and most melodious voice had called out just a minute as she quickly glanced in the hall mirror and patted her hair in place on her way to the door move your guns out of the way billy she said in a hushed voice to me on the floor then she opened the door and there flashing a broad whiteteethed grin was charlie are you the preachers wife maam charlie said yes wont you come in my mother said hesitatingly charlie looked down at me on the floor and grinned have a seat wont you my mother said pointing to a wooden chair near the door charlie immediately contented himself with talking to me howre you doing son he said lets see your guns over there iscooted around on my knees and dragged the gun from under the big padded sofa charlie had a strange pleased smile on his face when i handed him the gun and he stroked and patted it as if he was caressing a favorite pet he barely looked at my father who had just walked out of the room where he had been reading hello preacher charlie said still stroking the gun this heres a brave boy you got preacher charlie said poking the gun toward me fearfully i awaited what was to come but charlie didnt mention the neardisastrous incident he just continued to rub my air gun and talking more to himself it seemed than to my father and mother im gonna get a houseful of guns im gonna get me a trunkful of shells too charlie said one of these days theys going tbe a war between us colored people and them white people on white horses and im goin tbe ready the eyes of my mother and father met they looked back at charlie who began talking faster and louder i had a family once but they left me to go up north i had a son once too until those white people on white horses got him he never done nothin wrong preach er he never done nothin wrong but they beat him and they beat me lawd he didnt even cry preacher and those white people with those white sheets on jus laffed they wouldnt even let me help im charlie was almost crying now but he rambled on he said his family left him but he was glad that they were gone because those white people on white horses might try to kill them too he said he had a wife but she went to heaven shes gone where im goin tgo when i leave this world charlie said then he started to cry i had never seen such big tears before they dropped on the wooden polished floor and on charlies dusty shoes making mudspattered spots on the worn leather my mother said something soothing and patted charlie on his shoulders which seemed to be bent low with a heavy weight my father said well charlie gods going to make everything right after a few minutes charlie wiped his eyes and walked out without a word to my mother or father mom hes got my bb gun i whispered shhh my mother said but mom hes got my bb gun i screamed i started to run out to tell charlie to bring back my bb gun but my mother caught me at the door i clung to the screen door long enough to see charlie walking slowly down the street wiping his eyes with his forearm and carrying my air gun like a stick in one of his big hands charlie could sing real loud he would stand outside the small methodist church my father pastored until it was almost time to sing then he would march up to the front row of seats and sit down when the time came to sing charlie would sit up straight as a cigar store indian rear back his head and really sing after church he would walk to his home smiling to himself he wouldnt look back or talk to anyone he would keep on walking and smiling to himself until he got to his oneroom boxlike shack that was covered with red rubber shingles charlie told my father one day when dad was trying to tell him in a tactful way to sing more quietly that he was singing for the angels those angels in those shiny white robes gonna like the way i sing charlie said theys going to put in a good word for me to god gods probably too busy to hear me but he wants us people to raise up a joyful noise anyway my father gave up after that conversation nobody could learn much about charlie he never invited anyone to his home and if a stranger or visitor came to his place he always met them at the door charlie ran errands and worked around the yards and houses for the wealthy people in town they all liked him and at christmas time they would give him bushel basketsful of food and clothes but charlie never worked at one place for any length of time sometimes he would quit a job for no reason at all several times he was told not to come back to work but his white employers always talked fondly of him he was a good worker and many times charlies neighbors would see him returning from work late at night carrying some kind of a crooked stick in his hands the children of those wealthy people liked him too sometimes in the late afternoon or whenever charlie was coaxed long enough he would tell them stories everybody in the big houses knew where charlie and the kids were at those times because they could hear that deep throaty laughter of charlies accompanied by a chorus of childish laughter charlie would make the children tremble with fear when he told them ghost stories but he often made them laugh when he teased them about their pet cats and dogs he would feel the little cats body or the little puppys underside and say hes got some good ribs on him whens he goin tbe ready to eat the kids would laugh and tell him that nobody was going to eat their pet charlie would reply when he gets a little more meat on those ribs hes going to be just right for eatin but despite charlies fondness for the wealthy people and their children he would insist on saying that there was going to be a war between us and those white people on white horses some day my father once told him no charlie one of these days each person is going to accept the other as a brother and well never want to hurt the other again no they wont preacher you watch and see what i tell you charlie said one of these nights youre going to hear those white horses cornin and youre goin to see white people come out of the woods with sheets on and theyre goin to pull you outta your bed and beat you charlie began to talk louder and louder and his eyes seemed to grow bigger and he shook like he was cold you aint goin tbe able to do nuthin preacher but you got a brave boy here he said pointing to me when they start to grab holt of you hell start booming and hell keep going boom and boom and boom and calm down charlie calm down my father said nobodys going to hurt us thats just your you jus watch what i tell you preacher you jus watch what i tell you im telling you the truth you jus and charlie talking as he walkedto the earth under his feet would mouth his warnings all the way home nine years passed during which time my father was transferred to other churches his new assignments were to take him far away from the mississippi and far away from charlie however we continued to hear from old friends who would write and tell us about how the church was going along with reasons they didnt like the new pastor one of them wrote that charlies still singing for the angels and added hes becoming harder to get along with here lately maybe its because hes getting up there in age three years later on my way back from the navy base where i was stationed my train stopped for a halfhour lay over at hartlesville i took the opportunity of renewing old friendships and surprising some of my fathers old members with my growth in the past years wheres charlie the man who used to sing so loud i asked their expressions became almost solemn he lives the same place one of them said sister johnsons been with him since i dont have much time i said ill drop by to see him on my way to the station goodbye ill tell dad i saw you charlies house looked surprisingly smaller and more ragged than i had remembered it the loosened and fallen shingles left the little shack with a ragged checkerboard appearance i knocked on the door then pushed it inward at the response of a small voice inside as i blinked to get accustomed to the darkness i made out the form of an old lady sitting by a bed and in the small bed lay an old man with a large bony frame his face resembled a dried prune how are you charlie i said the question seemed somewhat strange for the old man laying there with the empty gaze aimed toward me was not the charlie i had so fondly remembered through the years do you remember me charlie i bent down closer to his face his watery eyes seemed sunken amidst his wrinkled skin whats wrong with charlie i asked the old woman the old woman just shook her head suddenly charlie looked toward the dark ceiling his eyes rolled and for the first time he seemed to be seeing he started to rise y heah them angels is cornin he whispered hoarsely jus lak i toldja they would an singin even louder than i used to sing i grabbed charlies shoulders as he seemed to totter precariously on the bed and eased him back down the old lady just sat calmly and patted charlies arm and looked with meek concern into his face charlie seemed to breathe a deep sigh of relief as he lay motionless my eyes wandered from charlie and the rickety wooden bed to a dark corner near the window which afforded the only light in the dirty cluttered shack what i thought at first glance was thin cordwood stacked against the wall were guns and almost to one side stood my bb rifle from ever so long ago blue bright and shiny my gun and all those others near the guns was a huge wooden trunk curious i walked over to it the lid was unlocked i lifted it and to my amazement saw boxes and boxes of shells and bullets of all kinds stacked to the very top and then i recalled charlies warnings of years ago i knew the purpose for which those guns and ammunition somehow had been collected by charlie through the years i knew they had meant death for those longremembered riders on white horses who dared not come while charlie was still alive on this earth and singing for the angels the new negro saint hen the cardinals in rome approved the canonization of blessed martin de porres during the recent consistory presided over by pope juan xxiii a memorable event became part of church history this is the first time in the history of the roman catholic church that a latin american negro was elevated to sainthood and friar de porres also is the fourth latin american saint the others saint rose of lima peru st felipe de jesus of mexico and saint maria ana paredes de jesus of ecuador canonization of the new saint took place may in the basilica of st peters in rome culminating the sanctification process which had been developing in tribunals of the holy see for the past years friar martin was the son of juan de porres a young spanish knight and ana velazquez a mulatto of spanish father there is not much information about the mother but supposition is that she was a mexican slave of african origin juan de porres met ana velazquez in lima fell in love and made a home in a street named the holy spirit for a time ana was able to hide her mulatto background for she could pass as white and this deception was even practiced on her lover but when she was with child a halting confession was made as ana had feared her noble gentleman was highly disgusted or perhaps disillusioned fearing birth of a colored son this was exactly what happened and the newborn infant was taken from the house by a back door to the church of san sebastian where parish priest antonio polanco baptized the baby in the presence of two neighbors as son of an unknown father and ana velazquez with margin of document stating martin a natural son don juan de porres continued his relationships with ana who gave birth again this time to a daughter also black when the viceroy of peru commissioned de porres to a new post in guayaquil the father abandoned mother and children without any provisions for their maintenance however neighbors with more conscience aided the mother in rearing the children instructing them in religion from the start young martin isolated himself from the other children preferring to stay for long periods within the grounds of the parish church from the age of two onward the darkness of martins skin grew more pronounced but the lad did not seem to mind this at all though it drew attention to him at seven he was charged with the care of his sister for whom he invented all sorts of ingenious games one day however de porres returned for his children alleging a great love for them taking them to guayaquil ecuador a key point in the spanish dominion of peru the youngsters were presented to captain diego de miranda chief of the spanish garrison and de porres confessed his alliance with ana and his decision to give a good education to the children as is the duty of a christian gentleman three years later de porres was named governor of panama then a province of peru leaving the young girl with his uncle de porres returned with the young martin to lima sought out his former mistress and delivered his son to her with the recommendation that she arrange for his confirmation and also his continued schooling the father selected the vocation of barber for his illegitimate son ana velazquez took her duties seriously placed her boy in a barber shop run by one known as mateo in the san lazaro district where there was a profusion of homes of negroes huge haciendas and fragrant fruit orchards martins duties were to keep floors seats and mirrors clean and he was soon apprenticed to learn the intricacies of barbering he also acquired some knowledge of surgery and pharmaceuticals professions then allied with the barbers trade his teacher in the arts of medicine and surgery was the selfsame maestro mateo still a youngster in his teens martin began devoting much of his nights to prayer on his knees his arms stretched out face bathed with tears he got a reputation as a queer one in the district and decided to leave one day after mass he crossed the rimac river over a rickety wooden bridge made his way to the santo domingo convent and was granted an audience by the father superior to whom he confessed his desire to be a lay brother the dominican friar heading the convent looked with benevolent eyes on his humble supplicant and despite rulings at that time not permitting acceptance within a monastery even for the choir of indians or mixed breeds to the fourth generation martin was permitted to stay the accepted convert brothers had all the rights of the dominican order whereas the lay brothers were without any rights considered terciaries and were tolerated as servants of honor who also had the advantages of a religious life lay brother martin passed many years doing menial tasks on his own request he sought out the most modest tasks served as a sort of slave of the brothers his devotion to the order was a silent unspoken one but one day when funds for maintenance of the convent were not increased with the prior hardpressed to make ends meet martin who considered himself a slave of religion offered himself to the prior saying sell this poor mulatto who is worth nothing here for he serves so badly those who treat him so well maybe if you sell me to a master who treats me badly i may learn to serve well to which the friar touched by martins offer replied go along friar for we have need of you here and god will provide the remedy for our situation martin served as a barber within the convent waited on table took care of the sick as well as sundry other duties and he always said his best reward was being in the company of the brothers and superiors so that he could sweep the floors over which their feet had tread one day martins father recently deposed from the governorship of panama by a change in viceroys came to the convent felt his pride wounded when he saw the humility in which his son lived the inferiority of his position and the menial tasks he had to perform the friar to calmthe aging father agreed to give martin at least the habits of a fully accredited monk in midmonth of october friar martin was stricken by an intense fever which grew worse daily he asked for the last sacraments which were given to him with all the brothers of the convent surrounding his cot wax tapers in their hands the news of the friars illness spread and throngs from all walks of life came to the convent in a period of improvement friar martin even received the viceroy who prostrating himself before the sick man asked that when he passed on to the next life he should not forget to petition god for aid and to give a sign to the official so he could rule better on november of friar martin who had dedicated his life unselfishly to religion and to the welfare of his fellow man went to his eternal rest and now years after his passing and after long years of sifting of the evidence as well as the ticklish issue of

state university detroit and the lagos museum in nigeria west africa the help of the selfappointed experts jazz has been manufacturing its own mausoleum for twenty years these experts gnashed and grieved at the lack of acceptance for the one true american art form since the acceptance finally came they have denounced it at every step flailing away at the network television shows musical prostitution deriding the major jazz festivals circuses opposing every new attempt to bring the music into a mass medium for twenty years they bemoaned the relegation of jazz to cheap saloons and dance halls today instead of rejoicing at the profusion of national concerts and global tours they whine that too many acts are crowded into the shows and bemoan the low intellectual level of the audiences and the profit motives of the promoters for twenty years they complained that the giants in the field had earned pygmy recognition today the top jazzmen have been so glamourized and oversentimentalized by these same experts that a chorus blown by a nowdead artist while under the influence of sesame seeds taped on a home recorder in the basement of a bordello at am evokes more learned analyses than the most brilliant work of a nationally popular bandleader taped in seventrack stereophonic high fidelity popularity of course is the sure road to excommunication among these solemn seekers after a world they wish they had never found to qualify among the cognoscenti as a jazzman of consequence you need a an active rejection of the publics interest or preferably no public interest at all b a police record preferably for violation of the narcotics laws c an utter lack of concern for beauty of sound d a death certificate andor e a capacity for solemnity and the conviction that jazz is a deadly serious business this narrows the field neatly in a you have miles davis who turns his back on audiences and thelonious monk who seems unaware that they exist we wont go into the unhealthy details of b the constant newspaper headlines though slanted are basically factual chief contenders for c are ornette coleman john coltrane and sonny rollins in d charlie parker and lester young in e john lewis gunther schuller and a handful of other third stream jazzniks adding gerry mulligan and a couple more you find that this minute minority representing five per cent of the top jazz talent gathers more than fifty per cent of the nationalmagazine feature articles on jazz the rest are too popular too witty or too alive when bix beiderbecke flourished jelly roll morton had his red hot peppers venuti and lang their blue four and ellington his original cotton club band there too much for the slick boys from the slick sheets who have been trying for a dozen years to chase him back to canada leonard feather devoting an entire down beat column to fergusons alleged malfeasances summed up his work as a ghastly and unswinging display of bad taste a summation that would serve better as a description of feathers own column ah for the handy duality of a jazz critic not too many years later a ferguson lp appeared with notes written byyou guessed itthe same mr feather it was mr feather too who found sidney bechets vibrato harsh and shrill yet was able to write fifteen hundred warm words on him for blue note records nat hentoff who once wrote in down beat after thirteen years in jazz i know by now that if you say maynard ferguson is the most tasteless overrated trumpet player this side of clyde mccoy somebody is going to get mad is a past master at the art of endorsement endorse of course means to write on the back as well as to give ones name or support to to sanction after notably failing to endorse the clarinetist buddy de franco often dismissing himnot without reasonas cold and unemotional of one de franco album the technique is swift and assured but not only is the playing decidedly chilly even de francos conception is disappointing there are clean almost diagrammatic patterns but what are they say ing hentoff nevertheless succeeded in endorsing him when he hentoff wrote the jacket notes for three of de francos verve lps noted for his gravely earnest dedication as a critic mr hentoff has written wordy endorsements of such major jazz figures as russ morgan for recent albums such as russ morgan at catalina mellow unhurried melodically clear music and morgan time spirited and yet graceful sweeping and tender glowing sensitive rollicking provocative on the other hand he has come out fearlessly against the enemies of the true jazz for instance his constructive blanket statement that he is antiella fitzgerald was quoted in a recent issue of show business illustrated this is in line with his previously stated position reviewing a fitzgerald album for down beat he observed ella is excellent the album is thoroughly recommended because of ellashe floats with superb phrasing through the ballads and rocks the uptempos ella of course deserves five stars if ella today were to team up with russ morgan perhaps hentoff would reverse his antiella fitzgerald position kiss and make up hentoffs soulbrother and coconsultant for the cbstv show the sound of jazz in is whitney balliett currently a purveyor of jazz esoterica to the forty ish commuters who dig the new yorker who suffers from what appears to be a case of advanced onomatopoeia is it because you are a drummer manque whit old boy that you analyze your percussive betters in such terms as knicketyknack ticketythumpticktackthumpthump ping and swoosh or are you simply trying to make the magazines infatuation with sound of own coined words department in either case an english translation would be helpful balliett often is capable of realistic perception he once wrote bohemians law that true art originates only in the garret still operates to an astonishing degree in jazz when an occasional jazz musician breaks into the big time he immediately becomes suspect and often as not is dropped from all rolls of honor yet the same balliett has made this profound observation barring the blues and duke ellington jazz has never bothered its head much about content whether content here means size capacity matter dealt with or material contained to imply that fletcher henderson jelly roll morton eddie sauter sy oliver ralph burns or even pete rugolo ever lacked content is delicious sure and maugham wolfe wells shaw shakespeare and oflaherty never bothered their heads much about plot right another man the critics have done their best to bury since he began to please the public is dave brubeck who represents a deadend pseudomodernism for hentoff while feather confessed to an ambivalent reaction to the flood of publicity that has engulfed brubeck how much closer is the tie between genuine jazz feeling and the modern jazz quartet ira gitler reviewing brubecks ingenious time out album suggested if brubeck wants to experiment with time let him not insult his audiences with such crashingbore devices better still if he wants to experiment let him begin with trying some real jazz listen to any brubeck lp then to one of those third stream music concoctions in which john lewis submerges his modern jazzless quartet in a farrago of pseudocryptoneoquasiclassicalism all right gentlemen which one has the beat ironically this same thirdstream fusion was effected eleven years ago by stan kentons orchestra with writers like bob graettinger bill russo franklyn marks alongside whom the posturings of the john lewisgunther schuller clique are pretentiously pathetic yet hentoff said kentons alleged innovations in jazz are a badly assimilated pastiche of the classical impressionists of a generation and more ago this criticism is more aptly applicable to schuller co in the view of andre previn who observed if somebody were to say that im imitating gunther schuller id quit the business martin williams perhaps the champion nit picker of the whole critical brotherhood he writes articles with titles like the funkyhard bop regression is capable of such a bon mot as thelonious monk is what no jazzman has ever been before him my italics still a legitimate innovator and experimenter after over fifteen years working directly with the materials of jazz take a funkyhardbopregressive bow marty you just wrote ellington gillespie gil evans and lester young out of the party the case history of the aforementioned andre previn is a perfect example of critical hostility toward popularity versatility clean living a sense of humor and a lack of pomp all of which previn is unfortunate enough to claim he has been espoused by only three major critics ralph gleason who like previn is cursed with a sense of humor wilder hobson the level of whose critical values may be gauged by his explanation of the superiority of such bands as basies the answer may lie to some extent in the negro ganglia and leonard feather who can be discounted since he has supervised recording sessions for and has had a couple of his songs recorded by previn previn has all the wrong credentials he is a european white the critics though not antiwhite have a tendency to be suspicious of nonnegro performers a former child prodigy a bestselling record artist a classical pianist who avoids mixing that part of his work with the rest a jazz pianist who enjoys playing a versatile writer who at nineteen was a composerconductor in the despised hollywood studios a producer of popular ugh songs one of which won an academy award nomination and winner of two oscars for the movie scores of gigi and porgy and bess he might have lived down two or three such handicaps but the tout ensemble makes him the persona least likely to be grata in all of jazz critical history why is popularity anathema to the pundits why are les mccann the most successful new pianist since peterson and a hirt the biggest new trumpeter since ferguson not even listed in the latest edition of feathers encyclopedia of jazz why is the immortal concert music of gershwin written off by hentoff as selfconsciously flatulent sentimental instantly dated why does balliett find it trying work to listen to the delightfully unpretentious piano of ahmad jamal whose work is so much more broadly accepted than monks one key answer lies in the trend toward ugliness a factor now a part not merely of jazz but of the whole body of american popular art in which it has become a can cer velma west sykes who conducts the national screen council for box office a trade magazine for theatre exhibitors observed once beauty to the point of perfection was what the sculptor and the painter tried to portray now the grotesque the weird and the repulsively ugly are the rage among art critics once stories were written about successful people now the sharecropper the skidrow alcoholic the call girl the wealthy playboys and playgirls of loose morals are the folks you most often meet in current bestselling novels and plays miss sykess comments have a perfect parallel in jazz where once we heard the exquisite purity of johnny hodges alto we face the cacophony of an ornette coleman who rejects tone chords harmony and melody whose champions equate anarchy with progress coleman hawkins and ben websters tenor sax warmth gets nothing but occasional lip service from the yolktops whose tedious homilies are generally devoted to the rankling racket of john coltrane harry carneys rich full baritone sax has given way to the grainy schoolboy bleatings of gerry mulligan and todays new trumpeters lacking both the pure gold of armstrong and the brash brass of ferguson strive after the thin strained tones of the lesser beboppers as ralph j gleason once odserved john q square is a lot hipper than hes been given credit for good music invariably rises to the surface stravinsky outlived his most virulent antagonists jelly roll mortons memory is unsullied despite the immature tirades of feather gershwins family can laugh off hentoff whose sarcasm can hardly erase the esteem in which the composer has been held for close to forty years lets remember too that cassals heifetz and horowitz were never criticized for paying too much attention to technique similarly the wellorganized creativity of ellington and kenton the genius of peterson the unique facility and versatility of previn and the rest of the reviled major talents of jazz will prevail simply because talent is a form of truth the real truths of jazz have a way of making themselves seen and heard and will continue to do so long after the cackle of the critics has sputtered its way to an inky inglorious coda what you should know about equal job rights what exactly is the purpose of the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity the preamble of executive order issued by president kennedy states the purpose clearly when it declares minus the whereas discrimination because of race creed color or national origin is contrary to the constitutional principles and policies of the united states it is the plain and positive obligation of the united states government to promote and ensure equal opportunity for all qualified persons without regard to race creed color or national origin employed or seeking employment with the federal government and on government contracts it is the policy of the executive branch of the government to encourage by positive measures equal opportunity for all qualified persons within the government it is in the general interest and welfare of the united states to promote its economy security and national defense through the most efficient and effective utilization of all available manpower the presidents committee was established by the president to carry out the above policy who are the members of the committee and how were they chosen the officers and members of the committee were appointed by president kennedy when he signed executive order on march the president appointed vice president lyndon b johnson chairman secretary of labor arthur j goldberg vice chairman and assistant secretary of labor jerry r holleman executive vice chairman there are fourteen public members of the committee howard e butt jr corpus christi tex donald c cook new york the rt reverend monsignor george g higgins washington d c edgar kaiser oakland calif mrs

administrator national aeronautics and space administration eugene m zuckert secretary of the air force how does the individual citizen know which firms are oblu gated to abide by the presidents executive order forbidding racial discrimination in hiring there is no sure way for the individual citizen to determine whether a firm is a government contractor such information is a matter of general knowledge in a community insofar as many business firms are concerned but there is understandable lack of certainty as regards other firms particularly subcontractors there is no such thing as a master list of government contractors the number runs into the hundreds of thousands the presidents committee maintains a list of contractors subject to filing compliance reports from this list it can reply to inquiries asking whether specific companies are government contractors but it must be remembered that the list which is not complete at this time consists only of firms holding contracts of or more and employing or more persons since committee jurisdiction applies to contracts of or more the compliance report list is far from a complete listing when a complaint of discrimination is filed with the committee the compliance report listing first is checked if the companys name does not appear on that list other procedures including telegraphic inquiry to the company are followed to determine whether the named company is a contractor locally the following means of identifying government contractors are probably the most certain find out if he displays the we pledge equal employment opportunity poster on his bulletin board look at recruitment advertising to see if he identifies himself as an equal opportunity employer determine if the plant or company is a subsidiary of a company which is a known government contractor put the direct question to the company as to whether it is a government contractor how does the individual citizen go about filing a complaint when he feels he has been refused a job because of race he may file his complaint either with the government agency with which the company is doing business or he may file it directly with the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity washington d c while the complaint may be filed in a letter in most instances a complainant fails to provide all necessary information when he writes a letter in such cases the committee replies to the letter by sending a complaint form with spaces and instructions for the necessary information complaint forms are available from the committee or from the contracting agencies a complaint may be filed by an individuals representative but must be signed by the complainant who determines whether a firm is in fact discriminating against job applicants because of race first it should be pointed out that the committee is interested not only in job applicants but also in employees the equal employment opportunity clause in government contracts declares the contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race creed color or national origin the contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race creed color or national origin such action shall include but not be limited to the following employment upgrading demotion or transfer recruitment or recruitment advertising layoff or termination rates of pay or other forms of compensation and selection for training including apprenticeship the procedure followed by the committee provides for transmittal of the complaint to the contracting agency the agency investigates and reports its findings andor actions to the committee the committee may either accept or reject the agencys report the report may be sent back for further investigation or the committee may conduct a joint investigation with the agency or it may make its own investigation or require a full compliance review on the conclusion of the investigation the agency makes its decision as to whether there was discrimination subject to review of the committee staff and executive vice chairman the agency andor the committee sees to it that necessary corrective action is taken in many parts of the country negroes have never been hired in other than menial jobs in factories and governmentconnected installations are these employers required to end their racial hiring practices each contract signed by the government and a contractor includes the sixpoint equal employment opportunity clause under this clause which is a provision of the contract the contractor is required to provide equal opportunity without regard to race creed color or national origin the mere signing of a contract clause of course does not insure performance each contracting agency in government is charged with responsibility for administration of its own contracts not only insofar as this clause is concerned but in all other areas of performance it goes without saying that there are varying degrees of performance under a contract as rapidly and as widely as possible the contracting agencies and the committee hope to achieve the fullest possible compliance with the equal opportunity contract clause in all sections of the country compliance includes the elimination of hiring policies based on race and treatment of all job applicants on an equal basis does the committee ever step in of its own accord to persuade employers to hire negroes this question must be answered in two parts first the committee has authority to step in of its own accord to insist on equal employment opportunity when the executive order and contract clause are being violated but in general the regular procedure of referring such matters to the contracting agency is followed second it would be in error to say that the committee persuades employers to hire negroes the committee insists on merit employment without regard to race creed color or national origin this means that all qualified applicants must be given equal consideration for employment it also means employees must be given equal consideration for promotion upgrading transfer etc furthermore as required in the executive order and the contract clause the government contractor is required to take affirmative action to insure equal opportunity as a matter of fact of course insistence on equal opportunity results in opening job doors to negroes along with other minority groups who have been the victims of discrimination and experience has shown that affirmative action generally includes active recruitment of negroes and other minority group people by the companies must there always he a case of reported discrimination before the committee steps in no the committee may act on its own motion or on the basis of information received as distinguished from formal complaints but the preferred methodand the most effectiveis on the basis of complaints moreover the caseload of complaints is so heavy that the limited staff and facilities available for investigation negotiation conciliation and review is fully utilized in handling them does filing a complaint entail any fees or expenses for the complaining citizen no a complaint may be filed by letter or preferably on the complaint form provided by the committee while the complaint does not have to be notarized attention is called to the fact that the submission of false or fraudulent information is a federal offense subject to fine andor imprisonment are firms covered hy the presidents executive order required to admit all applicants to their intraining programs they are required to treat all employees equally in all phases of employment including training all qualified applicants for intraining programs must be considered on an equal basis what happens when an employer tells a job applicant that he cannot be hired because the union does not admit negroes by and large the employer who tells a job applicant this is not telling the truth although there are exceptions any applicant so informed is entitled to file a complaint with the committee it will be fully investigated and appropriate action taken it should be pointed out that in most instances management has an absolute hiring prerogative a right it has fought for and retained through the years in many cases the excuse given in the question is merely a means of putting the blame for not hiring on the union when in actual fact the union concerned has no control over hiring does the presidents executive order apply to unions at all yes unions are specifically included in the executive order but it is recognized that the government does not have the same authority over unions that it has over contractors where a contractual obligation is written into the contract the committee is instructed in the executive order to use its best efforts to obtain cooperation of unions and is given authority to hold hearings concerning union policies and practices actually the committee has found national union leadership extremely cooperative as this is written the aflcio executive council is considering a program of union plans for fair practices in which unions will join with the committee in pledging and implementing equal opportunity without regard to race creed color or national origin some unions have insisted on inclusion of nondiscrimination clauses in their collective bargaining contracts and some have included such a provision in their apprenticetraining programs how will the complaining citizen know that the president s committee on equal employment opportunity has taken action on his case the committee advises the complainant that his complaint has been received and that investigation is being undertaken the investigator is required to contact the complainant to verify his complaint and to obtain any additional information he might be able to provide when the case is concluded the complainant is advised of the action taken to date what percentage of complaints have resulted in breaking discriminatory practices by employers as of april the committee had completed action on cases not including complaints in which the committee had no jurisdiction because the companies complained of did not have government contracts of those cases or per cent resulted in corrective action to date has any government contractor been denied further government business because of failure to comply with the presidents order as of april no contractor had been barred from government contracts and no contracts had been cancelled the executive vice chairman of the committee did issue orders requiring the filing of special compliance reports by two companies before they could be awarded additional government contracts upon receipt of the special compliance reports the committee will decide whether additional steps should be taken to insure compliance similar action is pending in connection with other firms has compliance with the presidents executive order opened up a significant number of jobs for negroes across the country there is no way to measure the number of jobs for negroes opened up as a result of the program the compliance report system which is just getting underway will provide some measure but not a compre hensive measure likewise the plans for progress reports from firms cooperating in that program will provide some measure but even taken together the two programs will be far from an accurate measure of what is happening in the employment of negroes what percentage of major businesses in the u s have government contracts there is no accurate figure as to what percentage of businesses have government contracts it is safe to assume however that a big majority probably as many as of the major business firms in the country do business with the government either as contractors or suppliers does the committee have any figures on the number of government contracting firms which hire no negroes in nonmenial jobs the compliance report system which has just been instituted by the committee will provide this information as well as other vital information about employment of negroes and other minority group people insofar as firms with and over contracts and or more employees are concerned has the existence of the presidents executive order substantially increased job opportunities for negroes in the south is there a reason to expect that job opportunities for negroes will increase in the future as a direct consequence of the presidents executive order the word substantially is elastic and might be considered too broad for what has been accomplished to date although job opportunities have been opened to negroes in some plants and some areas of the south where they did not exist before as for the future the answer is a definite yes more and more doors to job opportunities will be opened as the program gathers momentum as more and more companies in more and more areas realize that this committee the agencies and this administration insist upon compliance with the executive order and the contract clause how does the committee go about enforcing the presidents executive order barring discriminatory hiring a full answer to this question would be too lengthy for this occasion listed below are seven steps which were reported by the committee to the president in its report the first nine months which covered the committees work through midjanuary copies of this report as well as committee literature are available without charge from the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity washington d c the seven significant developments reported to the president were every executive agency and some nonexecutive agencies of the federal government have taken affirmative steps to insure equal opportunity for all employees and applicants for employment affirmative steps for insuring equal opportunity have been taken by a sizable number of business firms either through the plans for progress program or as the result of complaints filed with the committee agencies are developing manpower capability for effective operation of affirmative action programs with government contractors the compliance report system of the committee will provide for the first time information on minority group employment necessary for the development of affirmative programs on a broad scale the committee has launched an educational and informational program aimed at developing greater incentive on the part of minority group persons to train for the fields of employment in which the doors are being openedor opened widerand to see to it that the training is available programs of affirmative action in labor unions similar to and patterned after the plans for progress in industry are being developed concrete steps are being taken to insure equal opportunity in apprenticeship and training programs and in government employment services a gift of song first met paul laurence dunbar in a slim volume titled lil gal and read the poems of lowly life with much pleasure memorizing several of them there were tenderness and empathy in them humor and pathos i years later a friend quoted a stanza from a poem of his called when malindy sings fiddlin man jes stop his fiddlin lay his fiddle on de shef mockinbird quit tryin to whistle cause he jes so shamed hissef folks aplayin on de banjo draps dey fingahs on de strings bless yo soulfugits to move em when malindy sings i liked that so much i wanted to find out more about the author who had passed on in and was surprised to find out that he was not from a southern state but had been bom in dayton ohio where then i wondered had he learned to express himself in the correct idiom and situations of his poems it was from his mother matilda dunbar who had been born in slavery and who told him stories in the limpid negro dialect of old kentucky i read his father joshua had also been a slave and the war between the north and the south had been ended only seven years when the baby boy was born lets call him paul said his father the bible says paul was a great man some day this boy will be great and do you honor and so he was named paul laurence dunbar laurence being the name of a family friend one wonders now if pauls father had the gift of prophecy because judging from where he started and what he succeeded in becoming he could be called great and he surely did do his mother honor his father did not live to share it pauls mother had learned to read and write and she taught both father and son when paul was only four years old his lessons began poetry was an especial love of matilda and she soon recognized the poetic gift that paul evidenced in his early boyhood and encouraged it in every way she could in both grammar and high school paul was liked for himself and recognized for his talent by his teachers and classmates in his senior year he was president of the literary society and editor of the school paper at graduation the only negro in his class he wrote the lyrics for the class song paul had high hopes then with his good scholastic record he would get a clerical position and be able to help his widowed mother so that she wouldnt need to work so hard his buoyancy was cruelly deflated because he was a negro nobody would hire him for office work he had to take a job as an elevator boy for four dollars a week he made the best of it continuing to scribble down verses at every opportunity his former classmates and teachers encouraged him in every way they could and his poems began to be printed in various newspapers when he was twenty he was asked to give the address of welcome to a meeting of the western association of writers this was really quite an honor and he made a very favorable impression on the assembled writers one of the members later quoted some of pauls verses in a newspaper article james whitcomb riley whom paul admired read it and wrote him praising the verses paul and his mother began to hope that his published verses might be issued in book form but they knew he would have to pay for the publishing himself how could he do that help came in the form of a loan and the enthusiastic help of his classmates the book oak and ivy appeared just before christmas and within a couple of weeks paul was able to repay the loan now he began giving readings of his poems in different cities as will carleton james whitcomb riley and others were doing he was becoming well known as a poet but he and his mother were nearly penniless friends old and new came to his help again impressed by his courage and perseverance in paul had another book of poems published majors and minors william dean howells the distinguished critic wrote a review of it in harpers weekly the copy containing the review came out on the poets birthday june and as a result of the article orders for the book poured in and paul received over letters of cordial appreciation his next book lyrics of lowly life was issued by a standard publisher and contained an introduction by william dean howells besides when malindy sings this book contained other favorites as ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes and ode to ethiopia a poem exalting his mother race reciting its wrongs praising its virtues and urging continued striving toward better things howells said that so far as he could remember paul dunbar was the only man of pure african blood and of american civilization to feel the negro life aesthetically and express it lyrically a race which had come to this effect in any member of it had attained civilization in him and i permitted myself the imaginative prophecy that the hostilities and the prejudices which had so long constrained his race were destined to vanish in the arts that these were to be the final proof that god had made of one blood all nations of men dinners and receptions were given for him and after a visit to england where he met many distinguished persons paul was offered a position in the library of congress thus relieving him of the financial strain he was always feeling poetry as everyone knows brings in little money he had four novels published but they were inferior to his poetry i read a description of paul as he appeared at this timeof medium height with a lithe wellproportioned figure a resonant mellow voice and an appealing personality gentle and sincere if he had lived longer he might have gone to greater heights be cause he never ceased dreaming and learning some spoke of his writing as the beginning of a tradition others as the end of a regime with more years of personal experience in the slowly changing world as regards the negro race he might well have contributed more forthright expression of his own time but as dr w s scarborough said of him in his song he has helped pave the way for a future for his race he has hewn out a path and what was possible in his case is possible for others his dayton home has been a shrine for over fifty years and in a boy scout troop placed a bronze tablet at the entrance under the name of the poet laureate of his race is inscribed this verse from one of his poems because i had loved so dearly because i had loved so long god in his great compassion gave me a gift of song si short story in the summer of charlie was my best friend we were in the same class in elementary school and we lived right next door to each other he in the first high stoop house from the comer and i in the second by standing on our backyard fire escapes and reaching out we could pass things to one another my mother came home late in the evening and my father never until much later so when i came in from school and my sister wasnt there to tell on me i would climb out on the fire escape and call to charlie to do this we each had a long string with a stone wrapped in cloth tied to it hanging from our fire escapes once when charlie had been mean to the lady under him she cut his string anyway to call to each other we would swing the stones so that they tapped the window the day of graduation from elementary school charlie was so excited when he came home that he almost broke my window when i climbed out on the fire escape he was there all dressed up in his blue suit with a tragic look on his face i thought you were dead he said why didnt you come to school i was sick i answered you dont look sick now how was it i interrupted you didnt get left back did you of course i didnt you know what somebody said he continued they said your mama couldnt afford to buy you a new suit they were right you mean you missed graduation because you didnt have a new suit would you have gone if you didnt have one yeah he answered i guess youre right i probably wouldnt have its all that stupid principals fault if he hadnt announced that everybody had to wear blue suits and all that this wouldnt have happened then as an afterthought he added couldnt your mama afford to buy you a new suit i dont know i replied i guess not but i really didnt know we werent any poorer than charlies family and from the way mama had explained it when i had asked her i had been unable to figure out whether we could afford it or not she had said that the sunday suit i had was good enough for anybodys graduation and that if any of the other kids were getting new ones she hoped it was because they needed them when i tried to explain that it wasnt the other kids that i was thinking of but my teachers she looked at me real hard and said i know you dont want a new suit because the white man says so my principal says we should all your principal huh a hundred boys sitting up there in blue suits may be the most important thing in the world to him but its not to me if how you look is all that counts then maybe youd better stay home but mama i cant stay home i cried then go in what you got i stared at her unable to believe this lack of understanding then turned and walked away i was sitting at the fire escape window indulging in a fantasy of how i would kill myself and she would have to buy the new suit to bury me in when i felt her come up behind me look here she said i want to talk to you i dragged myself around and saw her standing there wiping her hands in her apron honey she began softly a new suit isnt going to change you as far as the white man is concerned to him youll still be a little colored boy that man she continued looking off out of the window is up there on a mountain and hell probably be up there all your life but remember youre as good as he is new suit or no new suit tears began to run down my cheeks but i gave no sign of even noticing them she didnt understand me my own mother here she was talking about mountains and all i wanted was a new suit did you hear what i said the tears came faster and finally unable to ignore them i wiped my shirtsleeve across my face and blurted out all i want is a new suit just then the door opened and daddy came in when mama turned around i ran off i didnt tell charlie any of this that day on the fire escape and it wasnt until august that i realized what she meant in august charlie and i decided to visit columbia university we planned the trip one day in advance and the following morning arose very early and set out through momingside park which separated the valley where we lived from the area where the university lay the park a two block wide strip of trees grass rocks and sand rose steeply from momingside avenue to morningside heights its many planned paths and beaten trails having long since given up their secrets to us we crossed it rapidly pausing only twice once to cautiously inspect a man who was lying in the bushes we thought we had accidentally stumbled onto a murder but it turned out he was a drunk and the other time to throw stones at two dogs to prevent them from doing what we had been told would be injurious to their health at the top we rested in an oval from where we could look out over the whole of harlem it was bunched up it seemed between central park and the yankee stadium its old buildings spilling almost into the east river with cars and people filling the remaining spaces like black lava we tried to count all the parked cars we could see but after reaching two hundred we tired turned and headed toward the university we found ourselves in another world the buildings were tall and immaculate their polished brass fronts opening onto glistening tile floors which beckoned towards cool dark opulent depths awnings everywhere and the streets were large and clean the white granite faces of the buildings meeting the sidewalks in a line unbroken from comer to comer after two blocks we came to a sprawling group of buildings and charlie said this must be it know what i bet if we had been dressed up i bet that woman wouldnt have thought we robbed her yes she would have too i replied it wouldnt have made any difference how do you know it wouldnt have made any difference i almost told him what mama had said but changed my mind i just do thats all i just do we stood looking at each other im sure he knew what i meant then two cats began fighting in the

great good friend silas hamilton died the year was silas was a physician and he had shown an affection for george that was to be reflected throughout the state of illinois for years to come at the bequest of silas a double crypt had been prepared and the vacant space was to be occupied by george who would one day be laid at the side of silas george looked longingly at the double grave when silas passed away he had no real family except silas he would just as soon go too now when silas will was read was to be used for the construction of a primary school in otterville it was to be the first free school in the state of illinoisthree thousand dollars in cash was left to george having been taught the rudiments of book learning by silas george who was forty years younger than silas wanted from the beginning to pass along knowledge to others he realized a limited education could help a person only so far the thought of a school close enough to walk to fired his interest and although he was nearly twenty years old he decided to enroll the first day school opened the day came when he taught on many occasions in the hamilton primary school when the regular teacher was indisposed frugal by nature as well as by the example silas had set george put his into savings with his small earnings as a farm hand he accumulated enough to purchase his own land he began to farm it and realized profits from it every year george became well versed in the bible he kept to himself a great deal studying and pondering when the otterville baptist church which was erected partly with georges funds was not visited by the circuit preacher it was george who stood in the pulpit and delivered the sunday sermon for a long time he had known the value of wholesomeness and as he looked back to the memories of his association with silas hamilton the person he knew best it occurred to him that he would like to imitate silas most outstanding quality that characteristic of being rid of more pesky traits than the average human being the attribute most of all was the ignorance silas was so completely rid of status or social class did not mean anything to silas where his patients friends and neighbors were concerned he was without reluctance to actually love his brother the rid of george never forgot about silas was his definition of learningnot a means to an end unless the student knew the meaning of purpose to this day ottervilles population has not increased beyond the number of several hundred people but from early days of its settlement it was developed into a rich agricultural region george lived as a bachelor in the community honest and shrewd he was known as a good man but there was nothing about his everyday life that attracted attention no it was not when george lived that people gave much consideration to him except as a genial neighbor but when he died in april the townspeople accorded a high tribute to him as they laid him to rest beside silas hamilton then came the reading of georges will and otterville friends realized most certainly now the love he held in his heart for others the community learned that had been set aside for the erection of a monument in the memory of silas its people were privileged to see what is probably the only monument of its kind in the worlderected by a single man in memory of another individual he admired part of the inscription on the stone reads the monument stands today but another stipulation in georges will is the one that after years is a living testimony of his profound feeling for humanity he left the residue or whatever may be left of the estate not otherwise appropriated to the education of qualified persons of jersey county of which otterville was a part the residue amounted to a board of trustees was appointed to administer it it became the george washington educational fund was put in trust under the jurisdiction of the circuit court of jersey county and through its interest earning power increased to within sixty years during the first fifty years so few applicants had come from students in jersey county the board of trustees decided to extend the limits of residence to the whole state of illinois sixtyeight years from the date of probation of george washingtons will students had been helped to a higher education a resident of illinois applying for financial assistance to further his education will be advised by the board of trustees that he must provide references of good character have a good scholastic standing and he or she must indicate what specific course of study he wishes to pursue what the letterhead george washington educational fund or its contents does not say is that the applicant must be a colored person or an american of african descent for george washington of otterville illinois was a negro and a christian freeman it has been mainly by word of mouth that scholars have the unique qualification of his will his legacy to aid others to follow him to be rid of the handicaps of ignorance has been realized in a way he could have hardly visualized r m warner jerseyville illinois present secretary of the fund reports that students have been assisted up to this year reflecting the higher general economic status of illinois negro residents in recent times mr warner points out for the last eight or ten years we have had very few requests for assistance he would not have presumed to substitute riddance as one of the three rs but george would be pleased to know how far his bounty has gone toward providing the substitution le over i am a southerner i was bred in the south where my forefathers were slaveholders and confederate soldiers i was born and raised in southern towns with their rigid racial patterns and their typical southern prejudice i was away from the south for a few years but i returned to live in the south by choice and intend to remain here for the rest of my life i love the south and its people i like having two black arms in my kitchen and two black legs pushing my lawn mower to help take the drudgery out of living for myself and my family and i like having them at a very minimum of cost to me i like choosing my own friends and associates and i like eating in pleasant places with well bred people of my own race class and status i like to worship in a church which is composed of my friends and equals where i will be among my own group racially socially and intellectually i like for my children to go to school with their own kind and with other children of their own racial social and intellectual level i like for them to be shielded against poverty ignorance dirt and disease i like to practice medicine among intelligent cooperative people who understand what i am trying to do for them who are friends as well as patients and who pay their bills i like to live in a neighborhood composed of people of my own group who have pleasant well kept homes and where there is no conflict or strife i do not want my daughter to marry a negro i like the racial status quo i am a southerner but i am also a christian as a christian i must believe that god created all men and that all men are equal in the sight of god i must believe that all men are my brothers and are children of god and that i am my brothers keeper i must believe that jesus meant what he said when he commanded me to love my neighbor as myself and when he commanded me to do unto others as i would have them do unto me i must believe that the church is gods house and that it does not belong to me to the congregation of trinity presbyterian church or to the southern presbyterian church i must be lieve in the fellowship of all believers i am also a scientist and have devoted my life to the pursuit of objective truth therefore i must know that while there are individual differences among people there is no such thing as racial inferiority i must know that within every group there are individuals with different potentialities and that i cannot arbitrarily classify anyone on the basis of his race or color i must know that poverty and ignorance and isolationcall it segregation if you willbreed feelings of inferiority frustration resentment and despair and that these feelings in turn lead to misery to immorality and to crime which in turn not only depress the people and the groups involved but the community as a whole and the whole country therefore as a christian and as a scientist i am obligated to act on the basis of what i know and what i believe and not on the basis of what i like i must live by conviction and by conscience rather than by preference and by prejudice i must therefore regard every man rich or poor black or white as a child of god and as a person not as some kind of subhuman being or animal or even as an inferior i must try to see to it that every individual gets equal rights under the law and in politics this applies particularly to the right of equal justice in the courts and to the right of the exercise of political privilege that is the right to vote i am obligated to pay a living wage to every man who works for me and to do my best to see that others do the same i must accord to every man the right to rise to the limit of his abilities in any job or profession and i must make every attempt to see that no man is blocked because of his race or social status if any individual of any race rises to a position equal to mine then i must accord to him the same privileges that i have and welcome him as an equal i must see to it that everyone has an opportunity for an education as good as my own children have if this means as the social scientists the courts and the negroes themselves believe that that education must be the same education as my children have then i must accept it and encourage it i must try to see to it that no man be humiliated and rejected because of his color if this means that the negro eats where i eat sits next to me in the theater or rides next to me in public transportation then i am obliged to accept it i must see to it that every man has an opportunity for a decent home and decent surroundings and if this means that he will live in my neighborhood or in the house next to mine then that is the way it must be if a negro wants to worship in my church or join my church then i am obligated to see to it that he is not only accepted but welcomed into that church even if it be trinity presbyterian church i must not be led by false pride to try to judge his motives for coming into that church i i must try to overlook the selfish politicians who use the negro for their own ends the communist agitators who delight in stirring up i i racial strife the noisy aggressive negro who abuses his privileges i and who makes life unpleasant for me and even the negroes who exploit their own race i must even overlook such irrelevant questions as which race is the further developed which race pays the most taxes etc and remember the basic principles on which i am trying to act and in which i believe i must not only accept the efforts of the negro to achieve his legitimate aspirations but i must try to help him achieve them and i i believe that the church must do the same if it is a truly christian church i must do this even though it goes against my deepest prejudices and even though it threatens my superior and isolated position in the community and even though it entails the risk of intermarriage basically the problem is not one of what i like but what i know to be right i must not let my wishes determine my attitude toward my associates my school my church or even my own family but if i am true to the principles which i profess then i must act according to those principles this i believe by warren t greenleaf remarkable social experiment is being carried on in chicago these days one of the citys largest merchandising firms is hiring people with black skin for the same reason it hires people with white skin the reason is merit that is the person hired negro or white shows promise of being able to perform the work for which he has applied such a policy is known as fair employment practice and it is not news today any company that does business with the government is required to consider job applicants without respect to race religion or national origin but in the retailing business it is unusual in the first place retailers seldom come under the provisions of the fair employment practices commission legislation in the second place retailing by its nature requires the greatest possible exposure to an unpredictable buying public and relatively few retailers have been willing to risk sales by asking white customers to buy their shoes or gloves from negro sales people even companies that do adhere to the fepc code have been slow to bring negroes and other minority group members into middle and upper management negro girls usually it seems lightskinned have been appearing more and more often as secretaries in the large corporations and negro men sometimes serve as foremen in manufacturing plants but the day when a negro will sit on the board of directors of a white firm still seems remote it is impossible to predict when a negro will be a director of carson pirie scott company in chicago or indeed if a negro ever will however as a result of the companys adoption of a hiring on merit program the opportunity is there carsons is a company that employs people in its retail stores in metropolitan chicago and downstate illinois heading the companys operations as president and director is c virgil martin a fiftyish sixfooter with a firm but friendly manner and a conviction that ideals arent worth much until somebody puts them into action martins ideas on segregation of any kind are strong even though quietly expressed he grew up in bloomington illinois a community in which there were few negroes and few unreasoned fears perhaps this contributed to his easy acceptance of the idea that negroes and whites are basically equal his mother and father impressed that principle upon him and emphasized it by selecting a negro doctor to take care of him in his earliest years martin first encountered segregation when he took a job in another town to help pay his tuition through illinois wesleyan university he was working as assistant boys secretary at a ymca and found that the swimming pool was closed to negroes the boys secretarymy boss didnt even know when the rule had been made we talked about it and decided to break the barrier just by letting the negro boys in it caused a bit of a fuss on the part of a vocal minority but there was no real trouble martins concern with social values continued after his graduation from school he took his ab at illinois wesleyan and a masters degree in business administration from the university of chicago he went into social work as an administrator became executive director of the indianapolis community fund and in the midforties served as executive director of the new york city war fund organization by when he joined carsons as general superintendent martins varied experience had added to his sense of social justice a knowledge of how things were accomplished in the business world the combination has served him well undoubtedly it helped lead to his selection in as chairman of the illinois public aid commission which oversees the administration of million in welfare funds each year in contrast to many business executives who regard public aid programs as throwaways martin views them as investments in people which if properly administered will pay dividends in the economic order as well as the social the story of how martin and carsons have been able to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices suggests that ideals can be a good deal more practical than many selfstyled realists would allow the story begins in it was about that time that the first fepctype legislation was passed in new york state i was opposed to that legislation at first martin recalls it seemed to do nothing but solidify resistance to equal employment opportunities and lead to ingenious ways of avoiding compliance but as time went on without bringing any suggestions from the leaders in the retailing business as to ways of improving hiring policies with respect to negroes and other minority groups carsons decided to design a program of its own before a government model could be forced on the company the first step was to obtain agreement from all members of top management that the act of discrimination was wrong in itself and that carsons should eliminate bias in hiring we debated this in our top management for a year and a half says martin all but one of the top men agreed that we should do something about the problem and we decided that we wouldnt move until he was sold nobody put any pressure on the man but as the months passed he began to feel like a heel now hes one of the most enthusiastic backers of our equal employment policy after the policy had been debated and approved the next question was that of approach sessions with negro and white backers of fair employment practices helped carsons management lay down some guide lines first we decided that there would be no publicity on the program martin says too many people try to make integration a drama next we agreed that we would not hire negroes for the traditional jobs elevator operator porter that sort of thing the purpose of the program wasnt just to put negroes on the payroll but to give them a real chance at positions that were formerly closed to them martha douglas director of personnel activities for the company and one of the planners of the hiring on merit program remembers that management also had to define the nature and goals of the program very clearly some people think integration is running out and hiring lots of negroes that wasnt the point of the program at all hiring on merit meant that there would be no discrimination against minority groups it also meant that there would be no discrimination in their favor the first negro to join carsons under the new program came in as a member of the companys junior executive training team he began work as a tracer in the adjustment bureau within months the bureau manager asked if there were any more negroes available for assignment to his section carsons felt hiring on merit had passed its first test today years after the program began there are very few levels of upper and middle management in which there are no negroes according to martin hiring is just the first step promotion is on merit also negroes serve as assistant department managers stock department supervisors credit and personnel interviewers interviewing both whites and negroes for jobs and charge accounts and as sales people on the floorsthe most sensitive areas of a department store the manager responsible for carsons downtown properties after hoursand that represents many millions of dollars says martinis a negro many negro supervisors have white subordinates i sat in on a discussion yesterday at which a negro was being considered for a department managership hell be responsible for purchases promotions sales and profit on several lines of merchandise hell have a terrific psychological problem because he will be the first negro department manager says martin translating retailing titles into familiar terms id say hell face the same degree of difficulty that jackie robinson faced when he went into the majors there is as yet no negro in top titles into familiar terms id say ceived some nasty letters says management at carsons whether there will be is not a question of tolerance or of brotherhood but simply of business the first negro who serves as an officer will do so because he has more ability than his contemporaries this is one aspect of the thinking behind carsons employment policy the hiring on merit program is regarded by management not as a form of missionary activity but as a business policy from the beginning the successor failure of the program was not to be judged by the percentage of negroes employed by the firm nor by the volume of praise it brought the program would have to meet the same test as that applied to any program undertaken by the company did it help the business attain the end for which it was founded making money in a legitimate way one of the encouraging results of carsons hiring on merit policy is that it has proven to be good business after the first negro sales people appeared on the floor we received some nasty letters says martin all unsigned we also received hundreds of favorable letters signed from white people the favorable results of the program were not limited to expressions of approval from customers another was carsons discovery that it had tapped a pool of excellent workers who had been passed over because of prejudice or fear negro employees have proven themselves equal to whites and predictably more than equal in many cases the program has not been without snags of course carsons had to learn as it went along since the program was in the main a pioneer effort faulty interpretations of the program by supervisors as well as employees called for corrections negro workers were very well accepted by other employees from the beginning martha douglas remembers soon requisitions came to the employment department asking for negroes the requisitions had become discriminatory then we had to explain to department managers that to favor any group defeated the purpose of employment on merit sometime it was negro employees who needed talking to occasionally we had sessions with negro workers to point out the difference between poor business deportment and discrimination a white lady who was rude to a negro sales girl wasnt necessarily a bigot perhaps she was just illmannered we also had to remind some negro associates that they would have to accept correction just as white employees did discipline was not the same as discrimination but despite the problems the company encountered as it enlarged the program carsons considers the hard business advantages alone have justified the work and the planning that went into the hiring on merit policy mrs douglas spoke for carsons management when she summarized the program for a group of midwestern retailers in this way we believe it is economically foolish even unwise business to exclude a large segment of the population from job opportunities the business today that does not employ minority groups cuts itself off from a valuable source of labor supply carsons is benefiting from this valuable source of labor supply but martin draws no comfort from the fact for the existence of such a large number of minds that are going to waste is due in his opinion to discrimination the negro college graduate is the most unemployed man in the country he says he spends time energy and money to develop his mind and talents and then finds that the only jobs open to him are as a truck driver or mechanic but the lack of opportunity resulting from discrimination has a more insidious effect than that of depriving negro college graduates of positions commensurate with their training for martin believes it discourages many young negroes from entering college at all or from improving their abilities in any way its a vicious circle he explains take away from any man worthwhile opportunities and you take away his incentive to develop the talents that would enable him qi to take advantage of opportunity when and if it comes the result martin has found is that the great bulk of negroes lack the basic skills necessary for any employment above the menial level this is not because negroes have less native ability than whites but because their color has forced upon them a future which holds little promise and it is only future hopes that motivate present preparation the effects such a joyless horizon has upon young men and women of a minority group are well known police reports show that the incidence of assaults petty larcenies and the others in the melancholy catalog of melancholy crimes few really big crimes in order to embezzle a million dollars in this country youve got to be white is higher among negroes and puerto ricans than among other racial or national groups yet a recent comparison of the number of juvenile crimes committed in puerto rico and those committed in new york city by puerto ricans showed that delinquency soared among the young migrants to the land of opportunity the effects of discrimination and economic injustice toward the negro show too in current unemployment statistics financial columnist sylvia porter recently cited labor department statistics to back her statement that though our nonwhites make up per cent of our work force they account for per cent in the longterm unemployed group another labor department report showed that in the average negro earned only per cent as much as the average white some commentators felt that this figure was cause for congratulations inasmuch as the figure for was per cent but as michael harrington wrote in commonweal july at this rate the negro will not reach parity with the white man until some time well past the year other indications of the negros attitude toward his white world are not expressed in numbers for example elementary school teachers say that when negro children are asked to draw a man and his family they usually produce a white family this is to be expected advertisers illustrators for the mass media and even doll manufacturers daily teach the children that most attractive people are white what can be done to change an economic system that again in harringtons words keeps the negro down and then uses the fact that the negro is on the bottom of the pile as an argument for keeping him there as a definition for what the negro naturally is there are two parts to this question the first is what can the negro do martin would advise a young negro to acquire professional skills law medicine accounting architectureand then go into industry he believes young negroes would do more to advance the position of their raceand ultimately their ownby entering white corporations rather than negro professional firms this might mean in the case of a young negro lawyer that he would be hidden in a back office preparing briefs for white lawyers to try it is hard advice but solving the problem of economic discrimination will call for real sacrifices the second part of the question is what can the wellmotivated white do to help the negro attain equality in the business world martin has no ready answer for this half of the question which is fitting in a way for he and his company are one audi clam gup aunt clara git g up big toms comp in a terrified voice ggaosji whispered into aunt claras ear as she lay sobbing face down in the dirt you goddamn goodfornothin nigger bellowed big tom the overseer of the plantation giving aunt clara a vicious kick git that swill to the hogs but aunt clara only buried her face deeper into the dirt she was trying desperately to shut out the memories of that terrifying afternoon a slave dealer had arrived at the plantation he had examined her four children richard mar garet elizabeth and palina pinching their firm young flesh and looking at their teeth after assuring himself he was getting his moneys worth he bought them for each and dragged them away aunt clara was bom in january in when she was three years old she was sold with her mother to ambrose smith she was married at eighteen and had four children when ambrose smith died all her children were sold aunt clara was then bought by george brown in kentucky when he died in his children freed aunt clara the law in kentucky required slaves who were freed to leave the state within a year aunt clara was fiftyseven years old when she left the brown plantation for st louis she was a tall woman with a fine carriage sometimes her black eyes were gay sometimes tragic sometimes brooding in st louis she got a job as a cook and washwoman ever since her four children had been sold one dream had filled her life someday somehow she would find them and free them an exorbitant dream for an exslave who could neither read nor write she didnt have the slightest idea how she could accomplish this but with her hand in gods she knew she could do it aunt clara could not read the st louis newspapers but the crowds that jostled her in the streets could hadnt the rocky mountain news in denver got out an extra on brown wrapping paper they had run out of regular print paper headlining the discovery of gold in gregory gulch in colorado thousands were leaving st louis each day for colorado in covered wagons drawn by oxen many of them didnt have the slightest idea of how gold was mined some thought a flat bottom boat with knives on the bottom of the boat was carried to the top of a mountain and then propelled down grade while the knives shaved off the gold as aunt clara listened to the stories of the gold rush she knew there would be plenty of work for her men would pay good wages for cooking and washing and she would save her money always her dream was before her to find her children who had been sold as slaves and to free them she heard of a big caravan leaving for colorado if the boss would take her her stove wash tubs and boards along she would cook for the men on the trip he snapped at her offer the wagons were heavily loaded thirty of them each drawn by six oxen the caravan crawled between the barren windswept peaks of the cruel rocky mountains through terrible gorges and across roaring mountain streams they could only do about two miles an hour naked bones marked a trail of death there were eight terrible weeks of sickness hardships and death they had no meat until they came across a herd of buffalo aunt clara was strong and lithe and as lean as a panther she worked from dawn into the night she comforted the sick and nursed the dying the smell of sweat from the oxen was incense to her suppose she was walking like mike ryan instead of riding in a caravan mike with a companion started out from st louis for colorado with a cart loaded with supplies while one pushed the other one pulled ryans companion gave out but he kept on alone a group of men also bound for the gold camps in colorado overtook ryan who was almost dead from exhaustion some of their oxen had died they offered ryan the job of looking after them he knew nothing whatsoever about oxen but he took the job after weeks of hardship and hunger they reached denver the oxen were almost dead and there was no feed for the starving animals with no time to lose quickwitted mike ryan baked great pones of bread from the flour in the covered wagons when they cooled he fed them to the oxen they devoured the bread and lived the caravan in which aunt clara traveled finally reached auraria colorado now denver after eight terrible weeks auraria was on cherry creek wooden sidewalks were raised a foot above the muddy streets spitsplashed prospectors pushed and jostled from one saloon to another it was a lusty flagrant mining camp with riches pouring into it from central city aunt claras destination was central city she left auraria the same day she arrived the tobacco juice of the driver of the stage coach landed square in the middle of the rump of a pawing grey horse and was the signal for the rearing six horses with a careening stage coach at their heels to start their wild breakneck trip from denver to central city aunt clara wildeyed and fearful clung for hours to the side of the stagecoach as it careened around dangerous hairpin curves and up narrow precipitous virginia canyon whose walls dropped a terrifying thousand feet as the driver of the stagecoach with a mighty flourish of his powerful hairy arms brought it to a sudden stop in central city aunt clara fell sprawled into the mud of eureka street men pushed and jostled each other to get a glimpse of the woman with the black skin where had she come from had she come all the way from africa what was central city coming to when the stage unloaded the likes of her with her old castiron stove and tubs which had been strapped to the top of the stagecoach aunt clara was the first of the colored race to reach the pikes peak region in the gold rush of with her battered old cast iron stove and wash tubs she began to wash for the men hers was the first laundry in the new country now the miners could have their heavy sweaty shirts washed for fifty cents apiece instead of throwing them into the muddy streets to be fought over by mangy hungry dogs aunt clara worked far into the night her little cabin became a hospital and a refuge for the sick and poor she was a good nurse and was always the first on the scene when disaster struck in the mines one night a beautiful young girl in red tights was dancing in the gold dust saloon leathernecked tobaccosplashed prospectors threw gold dust in little bags on to the stage as she stooped to pick them up her red tights split the men howled and stomped and threw more gold dust the girl hadnt always been a dance hall girl in red tights confused and sobbing she ran out of the saloon and down the road to aunt claras cabin there there soothed aunt clara ill sew you up quick as a jiffy so aunt clara sewed up the split in the red tights drying her eyes the girl then went back to the gold dust saloon she was always on the lookout for people who needed help she lived a life of poverty often her meals were only sour dough and cured hog meat she was welcome in every shack whether catholic protestant jew or indian wigwam but she was never too much at home anywhere aunt clara was a friend of columbine lily another dance hall girl one day blacksnake lachut walked into the saloon to order his favorite drink blackberry brandy with his long snake whip he cut off the button that held columbine lilys dress it dropped to the floor and columbine lilv was stark naked there was one place where she could run to in order to get away from blacksnake lachut that was aunt claras cabin down the road he wouldnt dare come there aunt clara wasnt shocked when columbine lily ran into her cabin without a stitch of clothes on she just pulled out her battered old trunk found some red calico and made columbine lily a dress within a year after gold was discovered in gregory gulch men were camped on the sides of the rocky mountains and in the gulches men fought for the privilege of sleeping on the floors of the saloons packed with smelly humanity saloons and gambling houses ran full blast at night men in wide sombreros their woolen shirts open showing hairy chests with little visitors tangled in the hair roared down the dusty mountain trails to central city food was cooked over open fires flour was a sack potatoes a dollar a pound and bad whiskey cents a gulp there were no banks but many of the miners hid their gold dust and nuggets in aunt claras cabin one day a man couldnt get his oxen to cross a bridge over a swollen creek as aunt clara came close she heard him shouting oh lord if yell git me over the goddamn bridge ill never ask ye for another damn favor she helped him get across aunt claras business was prospering and her dream of searching for her children was nearing fulfillment it was aunt claras birthday and mike flaherty her old friend who had struck it rich gave aunt clara a gold watch mike couldnt tell time but neither could aunt clara the old prospectors in central city had a lot of fun asking her what time it was her black eyes would twinkle as she answered see fer yerselfthen yell know i aint lying to ye a young married couple arrived in central city from the eastv the people in the camp wanted to welcome them so they surrounded their cabin and began to serenade them but the bride and groom bolted the door of their cabin for three days and nights the merrymakers besieged the honeymooners the scared bride and bridegroom refused to unbolt their door then someone thought of aunt clara git aunt clara git aunt clara he shouted theyll open their door for her so aunt clara was sent for they unbolted the door for her and she explained to them all the folks wanted to do was to serenade them so then the groom invited the crowd into the cabin to meet his scared bride the serenaders prepared a feast and the merrymaking lasted all night aunt clara who had been quite a dancer in her day danced a jig while the fiddler played good ole turnip greens every sunday morning aunt clara went to church there were a few indians in the congregation the sun was beating down upon the tin roof and it was very hot the young minister talked on and on a young buck dozed off and dropped his gun it went off with visions of an indian uprising every man present jumped to his feet his hand reaching for his gun aunt clara was sitting up in front she stood up drawing her tall body up to its full height holding out her full skirt like it was a big apron she walked down the aisle as cool as a buckberry and demanded that every gun be dropped into it nobody argued with her they were all too glad she had thought so fast and perhaps averted a bloody massacre it hadnt been too long since the last indian uprising the civil war had ended and the slaves had been freed aunt claras face shone with happiness now her dream of finding her children was taking shape she would not have to buy their freedom now she had saved a little more than ten thousand dollars aunt clara left central city colorado and traveled back to her old home in kentucky she located her four children and her childrens children and thirty other relatives she took them to leavenworth by steamboat and then purchased a covered wagon again she crossed the plains and mountains but this time it was a triumphant caravan her children and relatives settled in central city georgetown and denver and not one ever brought sorrow or shame to aunt clara old age was keeping step with her she moved to denver from central city and bought a little home dishonest men cheated her out of the remainder of her savings but aunt clara did not want friends and relatives saw to that her dear old face was lined her black eyes were faded but she had been a gallant figure upright in body and soul inspiring others to hope that they too might achieve a great example was more powerful than much conversation her life visibly lived for humanity was worth more than many sermons she bolstered a tottering faith and renewed the hope of those who were sinking beneath adversity she gave new courage to the tempted not for one instant did aunt clara think she was heroic yet her whole life was one of heroic sacrifice she was the blue columbine that grew wild in the rocky mountains she was the dream of gold come true in the sands of a prospectors battered old pan she was an inspiration to black and white she died at the age of eightytwo central city has honored the memory of this remarkable woman by dedicating one of its chairs in its famous opera house to her where famous people from colorado have been similarly honored do negroes lack courage to move to the suburbs for four months i tried to sell our home in bostons outer suburbs to a negro family i have failed my white neighbors did not stop me i could not find a negro buyer this experience has shattered many of my illusions about negro housing when i began seeking a negro buyer in the spring of i shared with many other whites a vague feeling of common guilt i had never personally discriminated against a negro but somehow i felt partially to blame for their situation deep down in my heart i believed i was at least partially to blame for the very bad housing which they had to live in now i have lost that feeling of guilt i no longer feel responsible for the negroes having to live in what amounts to a slum district in boston it is not the fault of my fellow whites that many negroes are in that district it is the fault of the negroes themselves most of them are afraid to leave the ghetto they know so well and move out into the strange territory that is now the white suburbs even today i find this hard to understand i can appreciate their psychological reasons for not moving out into the suburbs the ghetto is familiar to them in some ways it probably resembles a mothers wombit is warm and comfortableand gives one a feeling of security but in other ways it is very very hard to understand why mothers and fathers do not try harder to move out into the suburbs and give their children a better start in life it is not the lack of guidance or leadership that keeps todays negroes locked into bostons slums such guidance and leadership are present in fact i was amazed when i found out just how talented some of the negro leaders are in boston today take attorney walter c carrington for example this year old boston lawyer graduated from harvard college and harvard law school since he has been a member of the massachusetts commission against discrimination recently he submitted his resignation from this salaried post to accept an appointment as a mission chief in charge of secondary school teachers in the infant african nation of sierra leone attorney carrington has sacrificed what could have been a potentially profitable private law practice to devote his life towards the betterment of his fellow colored people he is not alone in this task ill never forget how many devoted and enthusiastic whites and negroes whom i met during the four months i was trying to sell our home to a negro these devoted and energetic people are courageously trying to find more homes for negroes in bostons suburbs today you would be amazed to learn how many homes they have lined up and i think you would be as bitterly disappointed as i was when you come to realize how few negro families are willing to take advantage of these new opportunities opening up to them today our own home is just one example in the first part of we were able to build a new home just a few miles away from our home of that time that meant we would have to sell our threebedroom ranch house in the suburban community of holliston i think it was the cuban invasion that made me decide to sell our home to a negro family the events during that invasionand the soul searching analysis of events and background motivations that followedcaused me to think deeply about our country i was conscious of the fact that the cuban invasion had failed partially because the world was not yet clear on just what america stands for we have always claimed to be the land of opportunity but deep in my heart i painfully suffered a guilty feeling a feeling that we were denying equal opportunity to negroes in this country together with our three young children my wife and i drove into bostons negro community what we found seemed almost like a new world but it was not the clean bright world of fresh air and sunshine that the puritans found when they first landed in boston in we found instead a dirty noisy crowded worlda world almost exactly the opposite of the clean spacious suburb in which we were raising our children the streets were crowded with trucks automobiles and people we drove down the main street of the negro community block after block of dirty rundown threestory brick tenement buildings loomed up all around us torn weatherbeaten political posters stared down at us from lamp posts dirty brick walls empty store frontsa mocking reminder of bostons oftenmade but never kept political promises we drove past the secondhand furniture stores past the many poorlylit variety stores past the small loan company on the comer with its three discolored brass balls over the door and its big front window crammed with cheap jewelry old clothes and musical instruments and we turned into a side street a woman was leaning out a thirdfloor window shouting at her children playing on the street a push cart was at the curb and a tired little old man was making a sour face at a fat colored lady who insisted on squeezing the tomatoes before buying any a little boya darkskinned curlyhaired youngster about fourstarted to chase his ball onto the street a middleaged woman struggled to raise her bulky frame off the front stairs ran after him as fast as her tired legs would carry her and grabbed him by the ear she pulled him back to the steps clucking excitedly like a mother hen all the while this did not seem like a good place to raise children at the next intersection we turned and headed for home again as we drove back out of the negro section we couldnt help but notice that many of the people were fairly well dressed and quite a few of them seemed to own late model automobiles it seemed to us that there was money in the negro district what seemed to be lacking was opportunity to spend this money on suburban housing somehow this apparent lack of opportunity made our own good fortune seem almost unfair nine years ago we had very little ourselves i had married my childhood sweetheart in june just three weeks after my high school graduation i was making a week we moved into a threeroom second floor apartment this seemed like enough at first but in december of our son was born and it no longer seemed like enough we wanted something better for our children for several months i worked at three jobs we accumulated a small nest egg in september of i used it for my first semesters tuition at boston universitys college of business administrationevening division for seven years i had worked and studied studied and worked we had two daughters we needed more space in we found a fiveroom firstfloor apartment and in we were able to buy our first house a threebedroom ranch home in holliston i found a new job and in a year in which i graduated among the top seven in my classi was promoted to an assistant vice presidency now we were able to build our dream homea nineroom home on a large lot yards wide by yards deep and covered with blueberry bushes and pine trees compared to the negro families we saw crowded into bostons ne gro ghetto we were doing nicely too nicely it seemed i couldnt help wondering could i have enjoyed such success if i had been colored and the answer seemed clearvery unlikely indeed this bitter realization soured the pride that had been growing within me it turned instead to shame and humility all my life i had believed deeply in the american dream i had developed a passionate devotion to the ideals expressed by thomas jefferson and until the cuban invasionand our drive through the negro ghettoi sincerely believed that my own success was a living proof that america was living up to jeffersons ideals what i had just seen seemed to me to be a shocking charge that americas equality of opportunity did not extend to people with colored skin i had read the words of jefferson many times they were burned deeply into my mind and heart and as i drove home that day his words came back to me clearly and sharply we hold these truths to be selfevidentthat all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness i could remember other things jefferson had said too such as no man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights of another in europe the dignity of man is lost in arbitrary distinctions where the human species is classed into several stages of degradation the american example has kindled feelings of right in the people and insurrection has begun of science talents and courage against rank and birth which have fallen into contempt i agree that there is a natural aristocracy among men the grounds of this are virtue and talents work and genius would thus be sought out from every condition of life the natural aristocracy of talents i consider as the most precious gift of nature nobody wishes more than i do to see proofs that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to those of the other colors of men and that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence but we must await with patience the workings of an overruling providence and hope that it is preparing the deliverance of these our suffering brethren when the measure of their tears shall be full coming when their groans shall have involved heaven itself in darkness doubtless a god of justice will awaken to their distress a just god i remembered only too well that abraham lincoln had said that those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under a just god cannot long retain it it seemed clear to me that boston was denying freedom to its negroesfreedom to live in good housingand i felt a shared sense of guilt in this deprivation i was about to taste the fruits of success myself and why had i had the opportunity to attain this success only because of those who in the past had created and preserved this opportunity i myself am only a third generation american but i am proud of my countrys tradition i have adopted its heritage as my heritage and i knew well what a major role boston had played in winning this heritage of freedom for america the mayflower compact was signed by the pilgrims at nearby plymouth this compacta sacred covenant of democracy sworn before godset the tone for the puritan founding at boston in through the years this heritage has burned brightly in boston it was in boston that the first major resistance to the king of england began in the midseventeen hundreds it was the closing of the port of boston by an angry king that rallied the colonists together it was in boston that the colonial army under general george washington had first driven the british back out to sea and it was from boston that swift yankee clippers carried the american ideal to places as far away as the spanish isles of hawaii now americas fiftieth state i myself had benefited from this tradition of equal opportunity as i looked back i could remember clearly the many men who had generously helped me advance in my career with no thought of reward for themselves other than a good feeling that comes from such a brotherly act suddenly it seemed that all the favors that had been done to me had merely been loaned to me now it seemed to be my turn to return these favors to lend a helping hand to some other person driving home from the negro ghetto that day i talked it over with my wife and she agreed that we would make our home in the suburbs available to a family from bostons ghetto the problem of negro segregation was a very large problem it was a social problem a matter of social justice as an individual and a part of societyi felt individually and partially to blame for this problem i could not cure the problem by myself for i am only one man but i can do my part and i sincerely believed that if i did my part as an individual other individuals might be inspired or encouraged to do their part we reached holliston and drove through the center of town but then as we turned onto our own street i began to have doubts about my decision ours was a relatively quiet deadend road of about a dozen almost new low cost ranch homes built on property next to a rolling green dairy farm the houses were inexpensive but well maintained our neighbors were young hardworking families many of them with young children we pulled into our own driveway our three youngsters spotted their playmates and piled out of the car running across our wide front lawn to the house next door as we watched them go it was only natural to wonder what it would be like when young negro children ran across that same front lawn to play with the children next door would they be acceptedor rebuffed they would have fresh air and sunshine and behind them a large rolling space of the dairy farm but would they have friends would the blessings of suburban living be more than offset by the absence of their old friends of the city how does one go about selling ones home to a negro should we go up and down the street ringing doorbells and ask their permission did we owe it to our neighbors to give them a veto over our decision we had decided to sell our home to a negro because of our concern for people we had never metthe negroes crowded into bostons ghetto did we not owe at least equal consideration to our friends and neighbors living on our own street believe me these are disturbing thoughts for a few days we kept our decision to ourselves i felt the need of discussing this matter with someone else before we actually placed our house for sale to a negro hesitantly i turned to our minister for guidance he seemed like the natural person to ask but there was one drawback our minister reverend james e turner of the community christian church was a southerner he was formerly from austin texas i wasnt at all sure of his feelings about negro segregation and thus i was pleasantly surprised by his reaction when i told him about our intention did he approve he most certainly did not only was this young exsoutherner strongly in favor of our intentions he has since become a member of the local fair housing committee himself but he enthusiastically volunteered to help us find a negro family i heard from reverend turner just a few days later he was so excited he couldnt wait until i got home that night he telephoned me at my office he told me he had just been advised by the massachusetts council of churches that the american society of friends would be the best place to find a negro family quickly i looked up the american society of friends in the greater boston telephone book i found their headquarters listed in cambridge appropriately enough the same community in which general george washington had assumed command of americas revolutionary army my hopes were soaring as i dialed the number as i heard the ringing on the line i had visions of learning that hundreds of negro families were waiting in line to find suburban homes in boston i remembered how desperately we had wanted a home in the outer suburbs for our own children and it seemed only natural that most negro parents in bostons colored ghetto would have the same desires for their children a woman answered the telephone i gave her my name and told her why i was calling can you help us find a negro family i asked yes she answered pleasantly she was sure that she could she gave me the name of a fair housing committee leader in framingham a large suburban city near our town she advised me to contact him directly she said that he was sure to have several families lined upjust waiting for homes to become available in our area and so it was with great hope and enthusiasm that i wrote a letter to this man i described our house and explained our motives for wanting to sell our home to a negro to make it absolutely plain that we were not trying to sell to a negro to get an abovethemarket price i suggested that any potential buyer call in an independent professional appraiser to determine the value of our home i said i would sell our house for whatever price this impartial expert decided was fair i also asked specifically if they had a negro family listed with them who had small children who might most benefit from our dairy farm environment and had worked hard to improve themselves like myself several of our neighbors had been combining both work and study what i wanted to offer to an individual boston negro was equality of opportunity in the truest sense i deeply believed that if one individual negro who had worked hard to better himself was rewarded in the same manner that a white man may expect other negroes from the ghetto would see this and be encouraged to try and improve themselves too i wrote that i had no idea how our neighbors would react to a negro family moving into our area but i thought it safest to expect the worst and hope for the best i suggested thatout of respect and deference to our neighborswe would like to sell to a negro family whose moral character had been proven i did not approve of discrimination in regard to negroes either for or against i still do believe that to give a man a special privilege because his skin is colored is just as much an insult as to deny him the same privilege because his skin is colored in short i was applying the same standards to choosing a negro buyer as we would have applied to choosing a white buyer seeking a family that could benefit from our house and fit into the neighborhood with a minimum of disharmony i hoped that an educated hardworking negro family of good character would make such a good impression on our community and on the area that other opportunities would open up for additional individual negroes to buy homes in this area several days went by and i received no answer i began to get impatient work was proceeding rapidly on our new home we planned to move as soon as school closed for the summer and we wanted to line up a negro family immediately to be sure that their own children were able to enjoy a full summer of outer suburban living finally the answer arrived anxiously i ripped open the envelope i expected to find a list of negro buyers instead i found a letter praising our intention and stating that eminent sociologists agreed with our conclusions about the benefits of motivating negroes my blood began to boil i wasnt interested in eminent sociologists i was interested in helping some young negro children gain an opportunity to play in sunshine and fresh air this was the first hint i was to uncover that finding a negro buyer for our home was not to be an easy matter but i did not yet realize that the fault lay not in the white committees in the suburbs but in the city negroes themselves i incorrectly assumed that day that the local committee was inefficient and that dozens if not hundreds of negroes must be waiting anxiously for word of available suburban housing so i began again i drove in town to boston to personally seek a negro family i went to boston universitys housing department i asked them if they had any negro faculty members who were seeking suburban housing they said they did not i asked if they had any graduate students who were seeking suburban housing they said they did not do you have any graduates seeking suburban housing i asked they said they did not they were very friendly and encouraging but they did not have any negro buyers we tried the housing departments at massachusetts institute of technology and harvard universityacross the charles river in cambridgebut we had the same results there i was deeply disappointed i had heard so much about hardships encountered by negro students and instructors trying to find adequate suburban housing all of this wide publicity to the need for a fair housing and yet i could not find a single individual negro actually looking for a suburban home he month of may was drawing to a close soon schools would be closing negro children would be playing again in the crowded slum streets of bostons colored ghetto but what could i do i felt a strong social obligation but it did not extend to ringing every doorbell in the boston negro ghetto and asking the occupants if they would like to buy a house in the suburbs i i had worked hard to make my own way i expected negroesif they wanted equal opportunity to show equal initiative a few days later just as i was about to abandon my effort to find a negro buyer an article in the boston morning paper caught my eye the headline said housing aid vowed to negroes and the article said the eyes of the world are not alone on montgomery alabama or jackson mississippi an assembly of four hundred colored south end and roxbury residents were told last night they are on the cities of new england and boston in particular the article went on to tell of the proposed programs to rehabilitate the negro sections of boston and give that group its greatest opportunity and challenge and it added but this will require community cooperation and some sacrifice to succeed what was this i asked myself were the negroes trying to find suburban housing or werent they were they more interested in fixing up their homes in the ghetto my initial feelings of guilt and shame were now giving way to sorrow and even anger a picture with the article showed three of the leaders of bostons negro community i decided to call one of them up on the telephone i picked walter c carrington identified as a member of the massachusetts commission against discrimination i called him on the telephone i told him of my efforts to locate a negro buyer for my house i also mentioned that i had been specifically trying to find a particular negro family one which had made sincere efforts to improve itself there was a silence on the phone an awkward pause i could almost sense resentment building up in mr carrington he was very polite but he asked if perhaps i was not a bit unfair in trying to restrict the potential buyer to a certain type of negro was i he asked implying that all negroes were not entitled to fair housing i asked him if he had not sacrificed time and effort in his own personal selfdevelopment program if he had not worked hard and studied hard to get through harvard college and harvard law school yes he agreed he had i asked him arent you better able to lead your peoples battle for justice because of the long selfdevelopment program you have gone through his voice noticeably softened yes he answered now growing much more friendly and even enthusiastic i can see what you mean you are not trying to discriminate against some negroes but rather to reward effort on the part of negroes who show greater initiative i agreed and with that the ice was melted between us we had a long conversation he was very encouraging he suggested that since some time had elapsed since i had contacted the society of friends that i try them again he pointed out that with school closing several negro families might have just contacted the society and inquired about suburban housing i thanked him and did contact the society of friends again mr carrington proved to be right there were several families now listed the society gave me the names of several families and also referred me to a local area chairman i contacted that chairman i explained the situation to him he volunteered to contact the negroes on the list to get more personal information on them for me and find out which family might best fill the specifications i had in mind several days later he got in touch with me again he was discouraged families had not wished to commute to my community in the outer suburbs he said it was too far i grew very angry how could it be too far when i was commuting to boston daily myself and when a neighbor on my street commuted daily to revere on bostons north shore even further away i told him that it seemed to me that if any parent wanted his children to have good housing they should be willing to spend a little more time driving each day as i did and as most of my neighbors did he agreed but said it just did not seem to be so in the case of bostons negro families i wanted to make at least one more last try and was given the name of the fulltime coordinator of all twentyfour fair housing committees massachusetts is probably one of the leading states when it comes to legislation forbidding restrictive covenants on real estate i called this coordinator he too enthusiastically and sincerely tried to find a negro buyer for us but he could not there were none i could hardly believe my ears by now it was the middle of june schools were letting out our own new home was ready and we were about to move so far i had not told my neighbors about our twomonthlong effort to find a negro buyer now we decided to come out into the open with the matter i believed too deeply in what i was trying to do not to make at least one open and bald effort to find a negro buyer on the st of june ran a large ad in the newspaper looking for a negro family we described our three bedroom ranch home with its large yard and its neighboring dairy farm and in large type we announced that this offer is open to everyone regardless of race color or creed we got only one telephone call from a person who identified himself as being black we gave this person directions on how to find our house he sounded tremendously interested and said they would be there that night with the down payment deposit we waited he did not come but a delegation of our neighbors did i had expected such action they told me that one of our neighbors who was also moving had turned down a negro buyer at their urging i now understood why the black buyer had not shown up probably he had recognized the street decided he would not be welcome and had kept right ongoing what surprised me most of all though was the very reasonable attitude of my neighbors there was absolutely no emotional reaction on their part they were coldly logical about the situation they explained that they were concerned that if a negro family moved in the value of their own property might drop i told them that studies had shown that negro residents over the longer term had practically no effect on real estate values whatsoever one of my next door neighbors said that he had heard the same thing but that one could never be sure of what might happen in an actual situation we shook hands all around and they left in a generally satisfied manner they told me they understood it was our house to do with as we wished but they had merely wished to make their own thoughts known to us i was really surprised i had expected threats of bricks tossed through the windows of our new home or the windows of our negro buyers this was typical of the surprises i encountered all during my efforts to find a negro buyer the whites were in many cases either enthusiastically for the project or at least reasonable and calm in their acceptance of it there was very little of the excited white agitation that i had been led to expect on the other hand there was apparently almost no initiative being shown by negro families trying to move out into the suburbs their condition seemed to be one of apathy if they wished to live in the ghetto i felt that was their business but i began to grow angry as i reflected on how i had been given such deep feelings of personally shared guilt over keeping them in the ghetto it appeared to me they were there of their own choicenot because whites had sealed them in we spent the summer in our new home i did not list our former home with a real estate broker we kept waiting waitingand hopingthat one of the fair housing groups would find a negro buyer for us the summer ticked away our large yard stood empty on the th of august with department stores beginning to run backtoschool notices our hopes were finally smashed the fair housing committee contacted us and said that they still had no negro buyer lined up summer was gone and so were all our initial hopes and desires reluctantly we listed our house with local real estate brokers and decided to place it on the market we sold it to a white family our experiment in a personal effort to help establish social justice and brotherhood had failed not because of resistance by the whites but because of apathy by negroes it is hard to express the disappointment i feel over this situation i still sincerely believe that negroes should be entitled to equal opportunity and i still sincerely believe they must show equal courage i can understand their reluctance to move out herefor they will not be welcomed with open arms by all of the whites in this area but then the whites who first moved out into this area were not welcomed with open arms by the colored residents who then dominated the area our local history is rich with stories of white families who battled both indians and hunger in putting their roots down here these early new england colonists sought only new opportunity and they were willing to fight for it if the negroes want this opportunity they should be willing to fight for it too
the tragedy of teenage marriage a few weeks ago i was a v stopped by a negro man who had just witnessed divorce proceedings involving his yearold son the mans eyes watered as he said to me what a tragedy for that boy god if only i could have convinced him a year and a half ago that marriage is more than one long grand passion this mans son a brilliant student had given up a promising career to marry a dimplecheeked brownette who was the doll of the high school junior class the couple learned after the wedding that her tastes for clothing and entertainment were richer than his income that his idea of the role of sex in marriage was a lot more liberal than hers that religion was a source of constant irritation between them and that his circle of friends and hers were not in the least compatible now the father complained with alimony and child support payments to make my kid hasnt a ghost of a chance of continuing his education it hurts me so because ive spent all my adult years trying to open doors of opportunity for that boy i wanted him to amount to more than i did but this is what its come to its a real tragedy i told my friend that that courtroom drama probably was a tragedy for the girl tooin that she was a mother and a divorcee at i knew that it would be no solace for this father but i added that his unhappiness was being shared by millions of parents educators clergymen judges and others who see the parade of bitterness and misery that is being generated by a recent upsurge in teenage marriages i mentioned also that no one should worry more than negro parents and civic leaders about this rash of youngsters barely across the physical threshold of adulthood who are joining the rush to the altar they should worry because it can be shown in a dozen ways that these marriages constitute one of the major barriers to the negros march to firstclass citizenship i consider it a truism that a people who would be free must destroy the fundamental enemy of freedom ignorance there are far too many negro youngsters of vast leadership potential who today are deserting the war against ignorance for what they assume foolishly are a only the endless ecstasies of marriage we cannot afford to let the gallant efforts of a few students involved in sitin demonstrations and other protests against racism blind us to what is happening to thousands of other negro youngsters former federal education commissioner lawrence derthick said recently that youngsters of high school age will not get their diplomas next june and for many of these the reason is that they have decided to accept a marriage certificate instead derthick adds that of the nations avi million andyearolds a million are not in schooland for at least of these early marriage is the reason school authorities point out as informed negroes already know that a shockingly high percentage of those missing from the nations classrooms are negroes not that this problem of teenage marriages is primarily a negro problem the question why do they marry so young is an agonizing one in every economic racial and cultural segment of the american community it is a fact however that a slightly larger portion of negro marriages are in the teenage category than is the case for white marriages it also can be demonstrated that a disproportionate number of these negro teenagers are exchanging wedding vows without the slightest preparation for with barely a remote under standing of the responsibilities of family life perhaps the primary reason for negro concern is that colored youngsters and the colored community in general are less able to afford the repercussions of these premature marriages than any other group in our society this is illustrated i think by the story about three young aristocrats who were trying to outboast each other with regard to their fathers wealth my father is so rich that im going to groton and yale said the first my father is so rich im going to do my prep work at harvard and then go to the sorbonne cracked the second my father is so rich that i can afford to stay ignorant boasted the third many white youngsters may be able to afford the loss of education the stunted earning power that almost inevitably goes with a teenage marriage but the negro struggling in a hundred ways for equal status in a predominantly white society simply cannot afford the luxury of ignorance and of unexploited potential president howard bowen of grinnell college has said education determines the degree of our capacity for foresight and our ability to plan for the future a mark of primitive people is that they lack this capacity to look ahead they live from hand to mouth the future is for them dim and vague education on the other hand helps people to become aware of the future and prepares them to plan ahead it enables them to carry out longterm projects and to make sacrifices for distant ends the magnitude of the educational deficit among negroes is well known by most negroes and need be stated only briefly here we are turning out fewer than half the high school graduates much less than half the college graduates that we would produce each year if negroes were being educated to the same extent americas white population is there also is no need to detail here the ways in which educational economic and other discriminations have made it extremely difficult for negroes to alter this situation but as dr eli ginzberg professor of economics and director of the conservation of human resources project at columbia university points out in his book the negro potential the negro cannot expect the schools alone desegregated or otherwise to erase the handicaps under which our youngsters labor parents the churches communications media within the negro community all have a role to play in imbuing these youngsters with a deeper understanding of the opportunities and responsibilities that lie before them ginzberg explains better preparation for work involves much more than a formal equalization of education opportunities for negroes as for whites basic preparation for school and for work occurs within the family the neighborhood and the community the habits the values and the goals that the child acquires i provide the basis for his later accomplishments in school and at work because of his history the american negro is not prepared in the same way as the white population to take full advantage of the economic opportunities that exist the negro must alter many of his values before he will be able to cope effectively with his new situation i can think of no better place to begin this alteration of values than with todays teenagers and preteeners what negro homes of tomorrow are will be determined by the success that can be achieved today in convincing able youngsters to delay the rush to what they think are the infinite romantic pleasures of married life in order that they can get the educations essential to the economic moral and general family stability that is so lacking among so many negroes several weeks ago i talked to ellen an yearold negro in chicago who already was the mother of two children separated from her yearold husband and being supported by the aid to dependent children adc program this young woman who had wed during her sophomore year in high school explained how she got into this predicament i was miserable my parents were so old and countrified and our furniture was so horrible that i was ashamed to take my friends home even if i had i was sure my mother would bore them to death talking about the bible all she did was talk about heaven and hell and about how i had to stay home because i might get consumption from the night air or get into some other kind of trouble well davehe was a grade ahead of mewas miserable too his father was drunk all the time i couldnt believe a boy as smooth as dave could have such hicks for parents dave and i felt nobody really cared for us but us and we decided to sort of strike out on our own after months of marriage dave decided to strike out on his own so here i sit with the kids ellensthese are not their real namesstory pinpoints one of the major reasons for the upsurge in teenage marriages many youngsters are running away from unhappy homes fleeing in search of love and affection family experts say that a disproportionate number of negro youngsters are involved in this rather desperate groping for love and happiness one reason the experts say is that unhappiness finds it a bit easier to get inside the door of homes beset by poverty and a lack of education another reason they say is that many negro parents find it virtually impossible to strike that happy medium of firm but loving discipline that leaves enough latitude for teen agers to make the transition from adolescence to adulthood sociologists say that a disturbingly large number of negro parents dont know where their teenagers are from one night to the next and apparently do not care at the other extreme is a group of parents who are so fearful of embarrassment to the family name that they make virtual prisoners of their girls a detroit mother told me recently i was so determined that my children would not contribute to those horrible statistics that the white magazines keep throwing at us negroes that i practically forbade my daughter to take a deep breath in the presence of a boy this created horrible conflict between us but i was certain i was doing the right thing a few months ago my daughter eloped with a boy id never met she lied about her age in order to get married i went to the family service people and they told me i could get the marriage annulled and have her committed to a detention home as an incorrigible but they said they doubted that anybody in the detention home could undo the damage that i had done over the last few years i guess we negroes can try too hard to be perfect parents this detroit mother still had the hope that her yearold soninlaw will turn out to be a good husband more ready to settle down than most teenage boys are but the odds run heavily against this for the bureau of census reports a very high rate of failure for all teenage marriages and an appalling failure rate for nonwhites paul c glick reports in his volume american families based on the census that for every negro teenage girls who marry about will be separated from their husbandsa rate four times as high as for white teenage girls another of the negro girls will get divorces and will have their marriages terminated by the death of their husbands this means that a pitiful of these negro teenage girls will make marriages that are stable and permanent the other face one form of heartbreak or another glick points to one ironic racial difference the divorce rate among white teenagers is actually higher than among negroes the reason for this is that white girls who rush into a mismatch take advantage of legal aid services offered by the community or the courts and get the protection afforded by a legal divorce on the other hand most negro girls wind up like ellen separated or deserted left without even the alimony the child support payments the opportunity to move with honor towards a second marriage that a courtsanctioned divorce would provide negro youngsters who today may be flirting with thoughts of marriage ought to take serious note of one thing that these marriage statistics show quite clearly the girl with the least education usually my lap as i talked to this colored youngster i had to say to myself my little boy has got this kid beat already hes got him beat by a mile i knew from the fathers record in high school that the little lad couldnt be inherently dumb i couldnt assume that my boy had an iota more of native intelligence than he did but i could see that because of the negro lads environment because of his less intellectual surroundings my boy already had him beat when it comes to being able to make your way in our society i believe that one thing most american negroes want passionately is to make sure tomorrows colored children dont get beat by a mile because of poor schooling poor environment poor home life one of the ways that this can be avoided is to convince the teenagers who will produce tomorrows generation of children that they owe it to this coming generation to postpone marriage long enough to get the education the understanding of and respect for family life that will enable them to be adequate parents every negro who really has turned his face against the indignity of racial caste has to realize that eradication of this system involves fighting a thousand kinds of battles on a thousand kinds of fronts the lawyer in the courtroom the man in the voting booth the platform lecturer the novelist at his typewriterall these and many more are soldiers in these battles but none can win any final victory except through the vastly expanded intellectual and moral strength of the negro people as a whole it is imperative therefore that we get more soldiers in the battle to convince our youngsters of their special obligations as husbands and wives mothers and fathers it is essential that our youngsters be convinced that marriage for the new negro cannot be merely a yielding to raw emotions it also must be an intellectual decision made with the realization that the negro family too is a major link in our new chain of freedom by father rollins e lambert tere is an old nurst f ery rhyme about six men of indostan all of them blind who wanted tq jnvestigate he de phant each of them encountered a different part of the animals anatomy and as a result each came to a different conclusion about the creature as a whole in the race question one of the biggest difficultes with most people both white and negro is the number of blind spots in their outlook because of segregation few white people know the american negro but this has not prevented a lot of generalizations about the whole racegeneralizations based on very limited experience or even on what one has read in newspapers and magazines among educated people such things are passing away but one can still hear in some circles sweeping statements such as negroes are dirtythey are criminally inclined they are ignorantthey are oversexed they are musically giftedand so on i have even heard a white person say that all negroes look alike as a matter of fact most of the conclusions are justified if they are restricted to a segment of the negro racejust as the same conclusion can be justified if they are applied to segments of any other race or nationality the first point i want to make then is that the word negro embraces a group of people with differences from each other just as great as in any other similar large group of people the second point is that the negro in america is american and wants to be regarded as such he is not african and until recently regarded himself as having practically no connection with africa there is no reverence for the mothercountry such as one might find in an american of irish or polish or italian ancestry just recently the american negro has begun to express interest in and sympathy for the africans as they struggle for freedom and negroes here are beginning to feel some racial solidarity with negroes there being an american the negro wants to be judged not as a group but like other americans for what he is personally how he lives works raises his family keeps his home participates in civic affairs pays his bills conducts himself in public and in private as a neighbor friend human beingthese are the important things and on these the negro wishes to be judged individually he does not want to have to bear the burden of the crimes and excesses of other negroes nor does he want to ride on the achievements of jesse owens or ralph bunche he is unable to see how the color of his skin demands that he be treated as if he came from another planet most americans are aware i am sure of the rising tide of the negro demand for recognition both in the us and in africa no amount of wishful thinking on the part of white people is going to stop this tide from achieving its goal and the sheer magnitude of the negro population makes it an issue which cannot be ignored experts on population trends for example predict that chicago will probably contain a nonwhite majority within the lifetime of most of us the implications of the negro problem are so wide that no catholic be he priest or layman can excuse himself from being interested on grounds that he or his neighborhood is not affected first of all a person in any urban area can scarcely avoid coming into contact with some negroes at least casually as a priest who is a negro i know that if more priests and white laity were aware of the presence of potential converts on these occasions more converts would be made chances are only one in twenty that the negro in question is already a catholic and secondly areas that have not been touched by the negro migration may be hit suddenly at any time a couple of years ago i gave a talk to a group of catholic women in a chicago suburban area most of them said that they had little contact with negroes and were wondering what they could do to promote interracial justice and charity last year one of the women telephoned me father she said when i heard your talk i thought that the whole thing was pretty remote from me but i live in deerfield what exactly does the american negro want the answer is simple he wants what most other americans want he wants a good job a job which is equal to his ability a job where he can advance if he has the ability a job which will give him and his family some security he wants a chance at decent housing and i do not refer only to public housing projects although these are indispensable for the lowincome groups he wants a house or apartment of a quality and in a location such as white americans of similar income can have he wants to give his children an education comparable to what white children receive so that they can compete on terms of comparative equality a casual observer might say the negro has all these thingsat least in the north what is he complaining about lets admit right away that tremendous progress along these lines has been made in recent years and it is going on constantly but there are still gaps to be filled and the average negro thinks much more about these gaps than about the progress already made it has been nearly a hundred years since lincoln freed the slaves but complete freedom is not yet a reality for the descendants of the slaves up to now the negro has been kept almost completely out of the professional fields and private industry except within the negro community itself he has to depend upon government jobs to give him any real opportunity to display his learning or natural ability even after a considerable amount of education he often has to drive a municipal bus or work in the post office in order to have steady employment in business few executive positions are open to him in a bank he is lucky to be hired as a broompusher even big companies which do tremendous business with negroes will hire negroes only in their lowest ranks of employees this is true even in northern cities among which chicago incidentally is regarded by some as the most segregated city in the nation speaking of job opportunities we would expect that at least in the catholic church a negro man or woman would be given ample opportunity to try a religious vocation or aspire to the priesthood but even here there is sometimes a color bar especially where girls are concerned one superior told a girl i know that the community would pray the holy ghost to guide her somewhere elsealthough the community was desper ately praying for vocations itself and in a certain parish grammar school the sisters still dare not talk about religious vocations for girls for fear that a colored girl might want to join the order that is teaching there the conditions in which many negroes live come in for a lot of criticism from white people it would be a shock to some of the critics to find out that the people most dissatisfied with slum conditions are the people who live in them who are forced by racial segregation to live in them the average negro wants a nice home in a decent neighborhood and is willing to work hard and to pay a lot for it when he has it furthermore he will generally be just as interested as anyone else in maintaining the standards of the neighborhood where he lives as job opportunities have improved the negro has more money to spend on better housing this is why such a tremendous pressure has built up in cities where negroes are confined to a ghetto this is why negroes are trying so hard to escape the segregated housing which can only result in the spread of slum conditions segregation causes slums in several ways in the first place it limits the amount of housing open to the negro and therefore causes overcrowding of houses and apartments overcrowding obviously is directly connected with slum conditions moreover as long as housing is segregated and limited in quantity the seller can demand a higher price for it the buyer or speculator in order to pay off his mortgage or to make a quick profit is inclined to subdivide his property to produce more rents and to neglect upkeep again slums will develop cardinal meyer archbishop of chicago stated last year that it is high time the pattern of segregated housing in chicago be broken down the negro in chicago and elsewhere wants this not so that he can run down a neighborhood but so that he can find decent conditions in which to live and raise his children it is a great scandal when he finds priests or catholic organizations blocking his way all indications are that the negro in america is going to reach his objectiveshousing education work opportunities and that he will achieve a large part of them within the next decade or two he will reach them with or without the help of the catholic church if he reaches them without the church it is easy to imagine what his attitude toward the church will be at present however the church finds itself in what can generally be called a favorable position as far as negroes are concerned most american negroes who belong to a church are protestants either baptists who have the largest share or methodists about six per cent of negroes are catholics the ninetyfour percent remainder is largely in ignorance about the church for most of them it is just a namethe name of one of the white mans churches but the catholic church has two attractions to draw the negros attention its schools and its claim to be the one universal church many negroes are aware of the forthright statements and actions of some of our bishops in racial matters and the elevation of an african to the college of cardinals drew wide favorable notice the reason for the attractiveness of our schools even for the noncatholic negro is mainly that if he is ambitious for his childrenas most parents arehe wants to preserve them from the moral corruption which so often accompanies life in the ghetto if he cannot escape the ghetto he does the next best thing he tries to immunize his children by giving them a religious education even if the negro escapes to a good neighborhood he is still attracted by the superior moral training and discipline which catholic schools offer the reason why the catholicity of the church attracts negroes is obvious it is in harmony with the urgent need of the negro for acceptance by the society in which he lives the church and its members however must practice what they preach otherwise this becomes just another disappointing mirage in the negros struggle arbitrarily dividing negroes into three classes we can detect certain differences in their attitudes toward the catholic church the poorest class often thinks of the church as the church of charity they know that christ was kind they see kindness in catholic priests and sisters who are known to be effectively helpful when someone is in trouble this makes it easy for such negroes to identify the one true church the middleclass negro is satisfied when the local parish fulfills his spiritual needs and educates his children but he is often hurt when he emerges from his own parish into the larger catholic world as an example two colored couples attended a precana conference in a parish in a part of chicago rather far from the negro community the other couples attending treated them with obvious coldness and hostility as a result one of the negro couples dropped out after two sessions the other couple more sophisticated and experienced felt the same hostility but had the courage to complete the conference along the same line many an enthusiastic convert has been stunned and baffled when he discovered that some fraternal organizations have no negro members that he will find difficulty in being accepted as a patient in some catholic hospitals that it is practically impossible for a negro doctor to get on the staff of a catholic hospital that there are catholic high schools which do not have and do not want colored students such a convert was told when he took instructions that he was becoming a member of a universal church a church which regards all men as equally precious before god he sees that the teaching of the church and the performance of its members do not matchand naturally he feels that the white man has betrayed him again the upperclass negroto get back to our threefold divisionis critical of the church and skeptical of its claims he knows that his race is making great progress in many fields he sees that the color line is breaking down rapidly everywhere and he sees that the church which ought to be leading this progress is lagging behind or even fighting it he experiences the racial prejudice of white catholics including sometimes priests he observes that we preach against many kinds of sin but seldom about the sin of hating our neighbors if they happen to be negroes he notices the silence of the catholic church in his struggle in many places and remembers it his conclusion is that the catholic church is lying when it claims to be universal and that it is hypocritical when it tolerates racial prejudice and segregation he will not accept such an unchristian i version of christianity consequently we find among the number of converts fewvery few who are doctors or lawyers or university professors being a priest and a convert to the church myself i am naturally interested in bringing other negroes into the church this does not mean that we catholics should be alert and active in the field of social justice and charity only as means to conversions charity and justice are virtues which make us godlike virtues demanded of us by god if we are to save our own souls but when the negro sees that bishops priests sisters catholic laity understand his problems when they prove by their actions that they are sincerely on his side and are not just reluctantly assuming that position when it is too late to do anything else when he sees that the white catholic laity are given a firm and decisive leadership in the direction of interracial justice and charitythen the negro will begin to see the church in all its beauty as the worldwide society which reaches down into his own city his own neighborhood to raise him up to god by doris e saunders the warm june air was electric with excitement the unbelievable was about to occur for the first time in history an allnegro theatrical troupe had been commanded to appear before the reigning monarch of the british empire bert williams the inimitable and his partner george walker were about to add another first to their lengthening list of achievements they had the previous season opened on broadway for the first time in a hit show in dahomey and now the show which had been appearing in london since midmay at the shaftsbury theatre near piccadilly circus had been selected by king edward vii to highlight the celebration of his favorite grandsons ninth birthday the child who was called david was the eldest son of the prince and princess of wales later king george v and queen mary behind buckingham palace surrounded by high walls and railings the magnificent palace grounds stretched over forty acres and included a private lake for this event a special theatre had been erected on the velvet lawn parquet flooring had been laid for the stage which was perfect in every detail the scenery had been brought out from the shaftsbury and even special lighting had been installed at the foot of the terrace the royal band under the direction of herr gottlieb was in place waiting for the signal to begin the national anthem behind the drawn curtain that covered the stage the members of the cast fidgeted nervously the women patted their hair in place again and again smoothed already smooth skirts and shifted from one foot to another the stage director and the author of the play jesse shipp bustled like a mother hen he had been there since early morning giving last minute instructions to the carpenters and electricians fixing props and adjusting the footlights naturally a meticulous and nervous person jesse was not about to have anything go awry from lack of attention to detail the principalsbert williams george walker and georges wife ada overton walkerhad remained in their dressing rooms until almost the last minute and then like the rest of the company found themselves unable to resist a peek through the curtains to see the royal family bert williams tall handsome even in the burnt cork which darkened his naturally olive colored skin felt that this must in some way be a dream it seemed just a while ago that he and george had been hungry urchins scratching for a roll and a tossed coin from the drunks who made the san francisco barbary coast their hangout those were the days when one unhappy experience followed on the heels of another the list of the failures seemed endless they had worked their way east from san francisco in piecemeal fashion staying in a town only long enough to make enough money or a connection that would enable them to move on to another at this time many of the white stars of the minstrel stage worked in cork or blackface it was when bert finally realized that in cork makeup with a comic costume he could be funnier than any of the blackfaced whites then at the zenith of their popularity that they began to hit their stride as a team george walker was unsurpassed as the dandy dressed to the height of fashion with manners and speech that would do credit to one to the manorbom playing straight man to the somewhat naive and always gullible character that became bert williams trademark unhappy unlucky mournful and melancholy with shambling gait and quizzical expression bert was the epitome of the sucker his song im a jonah man introduced a new word in the american language as a jonah became synonymous with a hardluck character the senegambian carnival and the policy players followed by sons of ham paved the way for their reception on broadway in in dahomey in dahomey written by jesse shipp with music by will marion cook and libretto by paul laurence dunbar was the first broadway show to be written staged and acted by an allnegro group after opening night at the new york theatre when the tumultuous applause of the crowd greeted them bert and george knew that the two minstrel boys who had sung and danced for the amusement of the barbary coast riffraff had made the grade they were in and now suddenly the strains of god save the king filled the air and the royal procession with the king and queen and the young prince of wales in front started moving down the stairs and terrace of the palace to the lawn where chairs had been placed for the king and queen the other members of the royal party found places on the grass still peering through the peep holes in the curtain the female members of the cast let out excited whispers regarding the handsome king edward vii was an impressive figure tall and portly he carried his weight with grace and authority it was no accident that the edwardian era became noted for the glamor of male dress on this occasion the king was attired in grey frock coat and topper as were the other males in attendance the ladies following the lead of queen alexandra were gowned in pastel silks and gauzes with large picture hats and umbrellas alexandra was an extraordinary beauty and though long past middle age she looked many years younger buckingham palace which had not been used for the last forty years of queen victorias reign had come to life with the ascension of the pleasureloving edward to the throne an army of carpenters and painters had moved into buckingham palace and the gloomy rooms which had been jokingly referred to by members of the royal staff as the sepulchre became the scene of splendid court balls and the lovely gardens were often in use for parties during the king and queens residence the world of edward vii was the world of the theatre music horse racing and cards the pleasures of the sensesenormous cigars fine liquors beautiful womenwere the pleasures he demanded widely traveled and extremely sophisticated though not an intellectual edward lacked the prejudices that had characterized the reign of his mother his queen alexandra who idolized him found her pleasure in his pleasure therefore it was not surprising that he had selected the most recent importation from america to entertain the royal family and their guests at davids birthday party that the entertainers happened to be negroes was not as important as the fact that they were new and exciting that he was establishing a precedent concerned him not one whit he had heard about the cakewalk that was done in this show and he wanted to see it he ended up learning how to do it himself with none other than george and bert as his teachers the cakewalk which had swept the united states at the turn of the century was a rollicking and rhythmic strut that had all of the more adventurous londoners talking and trying now the anthem ended the williams and walker orchestra under the direction of will marion cook took over the musical chores and sounded the overture for the act of in dahomey the curtain rose on a scene in dahomey where brightly garbed native dancers twirled to stirring tribal music the main action of the play was laid in a small florida town but the opening scene established the mood for the rest of the action the story dealt with a colonization scheme in which some fast talking operators from boston trade upon the credulity of an unsuspecting old man with lots of money but very little experience in dealing with this kind of chicanery bert a happygolucky fellow was the heir to the old mans fortune and it was he on whom the wily george concentrated his attention the machinations of the unscrupulous george and the resulting dilemma in which bert friendly trusting and unsuspecting finds himself was summed up in one of the final moments of the comedy george as rareback punkerton asked bert as shylock homestead for an additional sum of money to finance the outrageous scheme to colonize dahomey shylock had finally realized that when its all goin out and nothin cornin in he must put an end to the drain and so he refuses rareback the following dialogue then took place shylock i really must have the ten thousand dollars and i say no do you mean to say that you refuse no i dont refuse no and refuse is two diffunt words they dont sound alike you dont even spell em alike i say no noe no with that williams gave walker his inimitably droll look and walked off the stage the songs the dances and the byplay between the two comedians carried the afternoon off with great success champagne and strawberries little sandwiches and tea were served to the cast following the curtain and afterwards the young prince of wales persuaded the kindly bert williams to sing with him im a jonah man it was only after the group had gathered back at their strand hotel rooms that jesse shipp revealed the secret that could have canceled the performance before it was given as he recounted the events of the morning shipp said that during all the hustle and bustle when everyone was tripping over everyone else in an effort to get the show properly launched a stout gentleman in a red vest had strolled down from the palace and inquired from shipp if he had found anything wrong with the english way of doing things shipp exasperated with problems in having things done his way had unleashed all his pent up frustration on the questioner whom shipp took to be a glorified flunky it wasnt until the royal family had put in their appearance that shipp recognized the flunky as his majesty king edward vii the ab ack cab net in acton when the black cabinet swung into action behind the scenes their own bosses and even president franklin d roosevelt seldom knew what hit them like the time that steve early kicked a negro cop in the groin in pennsylvania station just a week before the elections and a few minutes after roosevelt had made one of his most rousing campaign speeches in madison square garden a dismayed white house adviser called weaver frantically at his home in washington and pointed out that the new york herald tribune was already on the street identifying early as white house press secretary and grandson of the confederate general jubal anderson early this could cost us the negro vote the caller bemoaned so get the boys together and turn out a really pronegro speech which the president can give in baltimore next friday weaver demurred and said it might be difficult to get the boys together in the middle of the night although most of them including faire which brought the unprecedented results weaver is now administrator of the federal home finance agency and the first negro in a cabinetrank job william h hastie dean of the howard university law school at that moment were already assembled around the card table in his basement and anyway he said i dont think a mere speech will do it what we need right now is something so dramatic that it will make the negro voters forget all about steve early and the negro cop too and given the green light to find something dramatic weaver and the black cabinet went into action next day the white house adviser almost fainted when he found out what the boys wanted but fdr a consummate tactician approved the plan on the spot so hours later the u s army had the first negro general in its historythe former col benjamin o davis sr whom governor lehman enthusiastically released from the th regiment here in new york the war department had its first negro civilian aide to the secretarythe same bill hastie who once was a federal judge and governor of the virgin islands and is now a federal appeals judge in philadelphia the selective service had its first negro aidecol campbell johnson an army reserve officer who is still a ranking selective service official and if secretary knox and the navy brass hadnt fought so bitterly in the short time remaining before election day the navy department would have had its first negro civilian aide also but the black cabinet was willing to settle for per cent of its original demands and roosevelt never had any reason to regret the ballot box returns on the investment dick gregory the racenik comedian since these are times s g when people tend to r weigh up comedians in carats of social significance it may be said of a young man named dick gregory that he constitutes a highassay vein of meaningful risibility or risible meaningfulness a lode moreover he is peculiarly qualified by birth let alone disposition to mine further you really want to have some fun he sometimes tells a night club audience with the deceptively degage air of a gourmet about to pick apart a squab make out youre colored some day i suggest you do it on a weekend you do it during the week you might get fired it is when life looks whitest however that he rallies hopefully way things are he will add ten years from now youll have to be my color to get a job well beyond the facts that gregory is a negro and very funny or even that the burden of his material which he carries with extraordinary lightness is concerned with the doubtful brotherhood of whites and negroes are a number of circumstances making him unique historically at any rate as unique and historic as a comedian can be for one thing he is the first negro standup comedian in half a century or sosince the late bert williams was in his primeto be so widely accepted by white audiences more important unlike williams or any of his successorsstandup sitdown or walkaroundhe has been so entirely on his own terms he has made his mark without resorting to tomming or being what negroes call a handkerchief head two of the milder terms of opprobrium for those perpetuating the stereotype of the race as laughingly servile sly stupid ignorant improvident untrustworthy in an amusing way and so on williams not only conformed but being light in color obliged by putting on blackface a negro comedian looking for white wages in those days had no alternative there are good negro comics around today with gregorys singlemindedness some bitter or broad others simply so oriented toward negroes that their work takes on the nature of an ironic exclusivity among them redd foxx nipsey russell slappy whitedewey pigmeat markham and timmie rogers from time to time they play for white audiences but they earn their living mostly in negro night clubs and theatres rogers as an instance performed in a white night club in hollywood as long ago as and his experience was pretty much typical of what a nontomming negro funnyman might expect prior to becoming a comedian rogers did a songanddance act with another man the props for which included a greenandred zoot suit costume he got a twoweek engagement at a sunset strip place whose owner had not seen him in anything else on opening night rogers turned up in a dinner jacket wheres that suit the owner asked gone down the drain rogers answered you put that suit back on he was told or you havent got a job rogers refused he was allowed to work a week in the dinner jacket and then fired nor have negroes unanimously endorsed such independence gregory claims that early in his career an influential negro performer with whom he had second billing in a negro night clubits clientele consisted largely of slumming whites warned him his act would not sit well with whites and swung enough weight to have gregory canceled out some less fearful negro comedians feel that talent aside gregorys success is partly the result of a fortunate conjunction of events relatively liberalized racial attitudes rogers could thus be described as prematurely unstereotypedly funny and accident he happened to be the only comic of any complexion available one night in chicago when another irwin corey was taken ill gregory went on for a single performance at the playboy club and was found to be so hilarious that he was reengaged later for a longer period john levy a negro and an important independent talent manager likens gregorys emergence to the advent of jackie robinson a conspicuously unservile man himself in baseball and as redd foxx put it the other day greg opened the door somebody had to be first theres room for all of us he cant work pittsburgh and glocca morra the same night negro comedys untapped if it doesnt happen for me now ill take to driving a truck gregory who is is a dark slender but powerfully put together man of middle height but looks just as phthisical as any of his likeminded white contemporaries in the same shoulderless threebutton suits they wear he was an outstanding track man in college and ran through most of four years on athletic scholarships before running out on a diploma he has round innocent eyes a round ingenuous face mouth and voice and a small crescentshaped mustache nothing in his appearance or delivery is at all in consonance with what he says the result is that at first hearing the effect he creates is as unexpected in its way not to say disarming as might be the spectacle of albert schweitzer rigging the stock market a further result is that he attracts several kinds of audience the comparatively few negroes who can afford him lately are one of course then there are shadings of solvent caucasians a group whose beliefs genuinely square with gregorys a second reasonably wellmeaning whose guilt at harboring prejudices can be temporarily assuaged by laughing with himin the safety of chic night clubs a third that lives by restrictive realestate covenants but is sophisticated enough nevertheless to enjoy what it knows to be gallows humor for it and an odd fourth numbering a high percentage of southerners that nurses the unshakable notion that gregory must be kidding bellicosity is to totally lacking in gregorythe trait seems to be personal as well as professional that to repeat a joke older than he is his victims are unaware their heads have been cut off until they try turning them shouldnt be any race problems he may say guilelessly everybody i meet some of their best friends is colored gregory fires up one cigarette after another at work and his pauses are usually punctuated by great wreathing clouds of violently exhaled smoke behind which he stands like gautama buddha smiling in a joss house now lets face it he continues theres just not that many of us to go around we take over the world though the snows gonna be black try driving home on that at night he also has a sly bottomless capacity for understatement that now and then leaves his audiences behind i dont know he remarked plaintively one night at the blue angel why everybody wants to ask me questions about the congo there was an instant of silence as though he had left something out it was followed by a tremendous prolonged wellingup of laughter gregory waited anxiously for it to subside a man trying only to explain himself i have never been out of the country he pointed out this brought on a thick spatter of appreciative applause people ask me he went on how come they dont send white troops only way i can fig ure it out is they dont want em coming home with those war brides the grin on his face had nothing of the sardonic in it it simply expressed the complicity of goodfellowship his faith in the nation was boundless i can tell we making good in the congo seventythree witch doctors joined blue cross there is something a trifle eerie in watching gregory run on considering that what he is actually doing is a kind of immemorial unchurched racial lament a cataloguing of wrongs a reading of indictments the sterner the indictments the more convulsed are his listeners i was tricked into the army he insists the recruiting sergeant says join the army the armys integrated that meant i had to sleep with puerto ricans a guy comes up to me says im from mobile i sure enjoyed your act you ought to bring it to mobile i need to take my act to mobile like custer needed more indians like the rev martin_luther_king needs a convention of dimestore managers i wont even work the southern part of this room the blue angels tiny stage as it happens is south of the customers he wouldnt mind paying his taxes if i thought they were going to a friendly country and he is wont to tell people on occasion trying to make you laugh is like trying to explain integration to a lynch mob he has an intricate story about a transatlantic plane flight during which it becomes necessary for three passengers to jump to save the rest an englishman goes out the door invoking the name of the queen a frenchman with vive la france on his lips ahm from texas says a third he walks back to that door gregory relates picks up a mexican andwhoosh and the guy really was hawaiian he remembers the day swimming pools were integrated in his home town st louis ah but they were nice to us that day in he says they hired a new lifeguard for us he was blind we got up on the new diving board and jumped they drained the pool riding in the back of buses doesnt bother him next time you get on a bus he points out you notice where that emergency door is located and he has a fine explanation of why so many negroes own cadillacs he himself saves on the country club he cant join and by not taking his family to florida for a winter vacation if he gets hit by a bus he wont be taken to the best hospital where they going to charge me so i go to the city hospital for free pick it up save plus general motors sell me anything some aspects of television annoy him just as they do everybody else i wrote hollywood he says damned if i can see one colored cop on the untouchables they wrote me back theyre mak j ing a picture called stagecoach south they offered me the leading part and i turned it down cause i know the first time they make a negro western the indians gonna win i he is naturally preoccupied with current events having had eight years of piano playing with harry truman and eight of golf with dwight eisenhower he settled for four years of bingo with john f kennedy we put him in he observes voted six or seven times apiece didnt mean we were cheating either just making up for the times we couldnt vote gregory also makes a conscientious effort to remain no more than a few hours behind the news one n piece of his material notes that he volunteered for the outerspace program and that when asked why he responded well i cant go to school down here on the evening of the day the russians announced they had put a man in space gregory was ready with some new lines thing that amused me most he said was when that man reached a state of weightlessness he floated out of his chair and he was able to write but he had to hold on to the pad i get like that every saturday night and it dont cost this country no two billion any night club performer will be afflicted with hecklers gregory has had a surprisingly small number none in new york and has handled them gently but firmly to a woman who stood up and stated flatly i dont like you he replied christ had twelve disciples and two of them welshed on him so what do you expect out of a room of people a drunk who wanted to know what he did for a living was informed that gregorys father was a millionaire if you ever get to little rock he added tell faubus his son says hello very likely the most dangerous situation he has ever been in was set up in an indiana club by a woman who was drunk rather than hostile my god she bawled at gregory youre good looking i sure would like to love you a thunderous quiet filled the place gregory took a deep breath what nationality are you madam he asked im hungarian said the woman take two more drinks gregory raced on and youll say youre colored run up here and kiss me and well both leave town in a hurry the relief felt was nearly as loud as the laughter by richard cox must live for human man beins s anc not jjyl this damned color vl a mans color is no africans equally as much as europeans must realize the falsity of any color bar you cannot base a constitution on wrong w these are the words of an african nationalistperhaps the only politician in east africa to have surmounted the mental obstacle of thinking of independence in terms of blackvswhite he is julius nyerere prime minister of tanganyika since may the selfgoverning trust territory he leads completes the final phase of its transition to full independence this friday nyereres dream of a democratic state in which there is a place for whites as well as blacks goes beyond tanganyika to embrace the east african federation he hopes to see created with neighboring kenya uganda and zanzibar and if these ideas prevail they can hardly fail to influence other parts of emerging africa as well in during a visit to the united states nyerere was given an honorary doctor of laws degree at duquesne university as a statesman and scholar whose vision and determination have given new hope to men long weary of racial strife and unresolved national differences in achieving that status nyerere has been helped enormously by certain factors in tanganyika ever since the british captured it from the germans and it came under league of nations trusteeship after the first world war it has been thought of as a country that would eventually govern itself five years ago this idea was not exactly at the forefront of administrative thinking and nationalist agitators were not welcomed but by the time britain had freed ghana in officials were positively looking out for nationalists they could encourage since there are very few european settlers in tanganyika there were no strong settler voices to obstruct such encouragement it became relatively easy for african leaders to gain recognition of their aspirations and nyerere himself the outstanding leader suffered little that might have embittered him as nationalists go he had it very soft nyerere is a slightiy built man with wideopen friendly eyes and a neatly clipped toothbrush mustache receiving a recent visitor he wore slacks and a gaily patterned beach shirt the clothes he prefers though lately he has felt obliged to wear a suit increasingly often he wears native dress only for public celebrations the air about him was relaxed and amiable he has a way of listening attentively watching closely with his head on one side giving a halfserious laugh as a point is made and then coming back with a deliberate but nonetheless whiplash answer he had been explaining the pitfalls of european patronage in african politics and referring to the idea of federation had said seriously my fear is not of european support in tanganyika europeans are more doubtful of federation than africans asked how europeans who did want to help could best do so he smiled slowly leaned forward resting his head on his hands and looked up eyes twinkling by saying nothing he said this wry and penetrating humor rare in africans is one of his greatest traits it comes out often whether he has just settled down rather shyly to discussion with a small group of strangers or whether he is at his most formal in the legislative assembly he uses humor to cool people down to make a point forcefully without emotion and it is a potent weapon speaking after a heated debate on independence in october of last year he said now i recall more than one member saying of our independence that it is something we must demand i am not sure that the word demand is not too colonial a word for october our independence is no longer a question of demanding but of planning and the planning is really a question of decolonization but i venture to suggest that one of the most difficult things to decolonize is going to be the minds of some honorable members here his audience who had been half expecting a sting of some kind roared with laughter nyereres point was made the ability to turn ideas inside out putting them subtly but clearly into a new perspective is one of his best qualities as an orator it is with his choice of words that he controls a crowd rather than with gestures when he walks into a big rally he will raise one hand lightly in greeting and acknowledgment then sit down on the platform looking rather small and insignificant light a cigarette and wait his moment to speak as kenyas tom mboya justly remarked he is more patient than most of us this applies to nyereres policies as well as his behavior though in his demands for independence he has been patient only by comparison with other african nationalists by normal european or american standards he has moved at revolutionary speed he has wanted freedom for his country just as soon as it could possibly be considered ready he has lobbied and argued for it nonetheless he is different from other east african leaders he may have concluded a speech to the pan african freedom movement for east and central africa with the cry peoples of east africa unite you have nothing to lose but your chains but he lacks the panache of his contemporaries he doesnt even carry a symbol like mboyas flywhisk and he also quoted to the conference behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity from the psalms his trademark is quietness and informality but once nyerere starts to speak he dominates his voice drops to a lower key than normal a burning gleam comes to his eye and he talks slowly and deliberately elaborating and explaining until satisfied that he is understood he is still the same person thoughstill humorous and as one man put it he calls forth a lot of happiness in spite of this geniality he can be tough and unflinching there was a notable occasion last year when he advocated federation before a highly emotional rally of africans he attacked opposition to it telling the crowd bluntly that they were becoming bigheaded and no longer cared about their neighbors then he told them to go home quietly they went and they accepted his ideas another time he heard that provincial leaders of his party the tanganyika african national union t a n u were using their position to extort money from asian traders he called a meeting of the national executive and accused them i see faces here of people who have been known to be corrupt finally he declared that rather than see t a n u corrupt he would end the party when nyerere says the function of leadership is to lead and if necessary to tell the bitter truth he means it it is hardly surprising that this plain speaking has made him enemies opposition in the tradeunion movement is growing the tanganyika federation of labor wants more positive action on hehalf of the workers to them his hardwork and nononsense policy is far too reminiscent of the capitalist colonialists he is supposed to be fighting in recent months the organization has become seriously split on this issue meanwhile groups of young tanganyikans in london and moscow are preparing for political action in the future when the newness of independence has worn off and opposition is really growing their accusations that nyerere is bourgeois and westernoriented are nonetheless threatening for their familiar ring and their elements of truth could convince ordinary tan ganyikans that they were being sold back to the colonialists far though it is from the real truth at the moment there is only a tiny opposition party within the country with only one seat in the assembly but t a n u cannot be expected to keep its allbutabsolute majority forever even thoughor perhaps becauseit is so much nyereres own there might one day be a split in it it was as the leader of t a n u that nyerere came to power born one of the many sons of the chief of the small zanaki tribe he was educated at makerere college and at edinburgh university while studying he became a devout catholic and after graduating in scotland came home to teach at a mission school from this he entered politics creating t a n u out of a modest social organization for africans founded by english civil servants back in as president he gave it a policystill the same todaythat tribal consciousness must be replaced by national consciousness if tanganyika is to become a real nation in and again in he went to new york to address committees of the united nations in he was elected a member of the legislative assembly and in october that year he publicly accepted a new governor sir richard turnbull as the man to guide the country to independence after turnbull had made it clear that he was going to give africans an increasing say in affairs from that moment the struggle of nationalist against colonial administrator began to turn into a classic example of how the two could cooperate previously nyerere had burnt his fingers a number of times becoming involved in cases of sedition being fined though never sent to prison british officials had recognized his potential by and desired to rap him over the knuckles but not to put him away evidently he realized that it would not pay to overstep the bounds for he began to respect them he had learned perhaps from gandhis example that violence is seldom necessary or justifiable and least of all in gaining concessions from the british soon after his acceptance of turnbull nyerere had a european derek bryceson now minister of health as his deputy on the opposition benches later he was to snap up kenyas able minister of finance sir ernest vasey whom kenya europeans had voted out as being too proafrican finally after tanu won the general election of september nyerere was called upon by the governor to form a new government and take office as chief minister the first in east africa he later became prime minister nyerere has set out since then to create an african democracy in which minorities are protected when it seemed likely before the elections that minority communities might be swamped in the african vote minorities of europeans asians and others total only per cent of the populationhe insisted that they should have reserved seats in the assembly and when from a platform beneath the green and black tanu flag he introduced his new cabinet including both european and asian ministers to a wildly cheering crowd he said we will continue to show the world that it is possible for the peoples of different races to live together as one nation not that he wants multiracial government on principle he wants the best people available to take part in his african democracy and he will not let prejudice deny him the abilities of europeans while africans are training nor will it be easy for nonafricans to qualify for citizenship but equality there will be for all who are citizens he is explicit on what independence really involves what is freedom he asked his fellow members in the assembly it is the power we have to decide what is going to happen in tanganyika and when it is going to happen and that power we have all that remains is hard work we are not going to be frightened to tell the truth to our people because building a nation is not merely building roads and hospitals and schools it is building the character of a people and we cannot build the character of a people if we fool them and tell them it is easy because it is not easy life is not easy and we as their leaders reveille in rhode island he tall thin boy wearj rip ing the greasy cap the j k dirty tshirt and the faded suntans slammed a foot down hard in the center of the sagging old porch floor his brown face which needed its first shave twisted up in a scowl he pushed his hands into his rear pockets and swaggered over to the creaky railing he narrowed his eyes and stood there brooding down on prairie avenue in south providence this boy was angry but he was not as angry as he pretended to be he was perhaps the leader of the other rough young negroes on the porch however they did not compose a gang they were not organized there was silence i had asked the boy at the railing a question and he was taking his time about answering the others probably remembering bruises suffered for talking out of turn watched him respectfully and waited he turned slowly and looked at me with the coolness such fellows feel for outsiders you dont want to know what i think about rhode island man he said shaking his head no sir i want to know exactly what you think you cant write what i think in the journal man i dont have to write it i want to know rhode island is a good place for white people its worse than the south for me in some ways let me ask you a question how come negroes in the south stick up for their rights and they dont around here theyre beginning to where man this was just after the trouble police had with a crowd in the area during the summer i had been trying to find out what these fellows thought about policemens use of dogs to disperse the crowd and about things in general they didnt seem to be thinking much but they were feeling plenty running through their talk was a theme of admiration for the southern negro and contempt for the northern one in some vague way too they had been influenced by african leaders although they knew practically nothing about them they had gained a certain amount of information from television shows and glances at captions under black faces in newspaper photos it seemed to me that much of their militancy was a pose they were behaving the way they thought negroes are supposed to behave these daysthat is except for negroes in rhode island they had joined the openly defiant ones but they had joined without direction without leadership and for this reason were potentially dangerous a young negro in the south would find it hard to believe that these boys in providence rhode island have the same feeling of being isolated from the general community that he has and it probably wouldnt occur to the young southern negro that psychologically he is far better off these days than the rhode island boys he is for this reason he can walk downtown and see the most respectable people in his race raising hell with officials about the way he is treated he is an actual witness to a mass assault against racial discrimination and more than likely he is in some measure a participant in the attack he is doing something about his isolation and consequently is less frustrated by it the young providence negro seldom has known the people who were working in his behalf because the most prominent of them have been white people generally of a high intellectual and social standing and they have been few the question raised by the south providence boy covers a multitude of halftruths that have been passed around for years and it makes a joke of the souths contention that the regions negroes are happy until stirred up by agitators from the north if there is truth in the boys argument and there is then how can the northern negro who does not fight much for his own rights lead a southern crusade of course one does not need to resort to abstract logic to answer the southern contention the facts apparent refute it what then is the attitude of the rhode island negro community in a country painfully undergoing vast social change it is of course an attitude shaped by the communitys traditions which are breaking down the fact that the push for racial equality in the state has been directed most effectively by a small number of white citizens is not a criticism of the negro community rather it is a criticism of the community as a whole almost any negro will tell you that for a long time many bright young negroes left this state as fast as they finished college because they could not find here jobs commensurate with their training the state had the worst reputation in new england in race relations says george lima president of the providence branch of the national association for the advancement of colored people i remember when i was a kid in fall river i used to hear the old folks telling each other not to go to providence looking for anything unless they intended to change color with so much of the talent being drawn to other places there was not left here a pool from which much leadership could emerge the smallness of the negro population has had a bearing on these things in the total providence population of almost there are little more than negroeshardly enough to support much of a professional class it is true that some professional negroes here and elsewhere serve white people as well as colored but any young negro who started out in a profession gambling on serving enough white people to support him would be out of his mind even now providence proper has only one negro physician and two dentists there are three or four lawyers and a handful of schoolteachers there are some social workers one or two in executive capacities but the list of providence negroes who have achieved professional success elsewhere is quite impressive the small size of their group also has discouraged negroes from seeking public office as a forum for aiding their grievances and it has worked against their obtaining legislative relief from discrimination for equal rights legislation to get anywhere here an awful lot of white people have to stand up and be counted or at least indicate they dont care one way or the other as they eventually did in a case of fair employment legislation legislators who opposed fair housing could not have been on safer grounds politically and they knew it any negro who has gone househunting in providence knows it too the movement for racial equality here also has been shaped by the subtle form discrimination takes in the north generally it is hard to strike at what you cant see clearly and moreover as long as things arent too bad a man may tend to put off correcting them until tomorrow another possible hindrance to the development of the solidarity negroes need for mass social action has been the pattern of urban redevelopment here it has kept them off balance bogged down in the intensely personal problem of finding individual shelter relocation has undermined the morale of some proud longestablished negroes by throwing them out of their traditional sections and into areas with southern negro migrants whose ways are strange to the new englanders this is not a question of anyones being a snob it is a question of his being human white friends have asked me why the older colored settlers dont do more to help the newcomers from the south the answer i think is that such a sense of group responsibility is rare it is especially rare among people who have all they can do to take care of their own families where it exists it usually is rooted in cultural origins foreign to american negroes i have a friend whose answer is considerably ruder than mine he says they are more the responsibility of the whole society than they are mine after all i didnt make them what they are none of this should be interpreted as discounting the valuable service of individual negroes and negro organizations to their group and to the community as a whole ministers have afforded sound leadership the urban league under the direction of james n williams has been one of the states strongest forces working for equality the league however again points up the contributions of white people who make up most of its members the naacp here has been relatively weak until recently its current operation illustrates one of the changes which i told the south providence boy is taking place thanks largely to the urban league and the states commission against discrimination better jobs gradually have been opening up to negroes and the youngsters who go to college are beginning to come back home to fill them and they come back home to join george lima himself a young man in a kind of protest that sets some of the older leaders teeth on edge a young man like john maddox doesnt waste time worrying about whose official feelings are going to be ruffled when he says flatly that police have brutally used some south providence negroes he lives over there and hes an naacp officer and not even the staunchest opponent of fair housing legislation could have failed to be impressed by alton wiley a young lawyer when he bitterly described his experiences with housing segregation in testimony before a general assembly committee the naacp in the past two years has staged mass demonstrations on the state house lawn and held all kinds of meetings to protest job and housing discrimination if george lima had had his way negroes would have refused to budge from lippitt hill until guaranteed decent housing and ralph allen a field worker for the commission against discrimination doesnt seek the soothing phrase to report injustice that he uncovers if the action of these men is not entirely new in this community then the tone is the tone is impatient and it is determined officials and many of the public often as not shrug these fellows off as hotheads who lack responsibility the way they go about things is not considered very polite it is for some negroes as well as white people somehow not quite respectable but their sound is the sound of the students who demonstrate at the lunch counters in the south and it will grow louder if rhode island gets annoyed by the noise were going to make then let rhode island give us a reason to keep quiet says george lima perhaps by now the south providence boy knows that some young men from his area have formed an organization called the south providence athletic association the idea for the association came from south providence without any prompting from outside although the charter was written by ralph allen but ralph allen didnt write the bylaws which among other things take the trouble to ban drinking and the use of profane language during any activity sponsored by the association this is no insignificant development considering recent relations between police and south providence residents it is also interesting to note that the fee for the organizations charter was contributed by the fraternal order of police the members say they intend to work in fields far broader than their organizational name indicates they are interested in the guidance of youth and in working with agencies that try to offset the special social deprivations to which negroes are subjected there are other signs of increasing social awareness in the negro community for example scitamard dramatics spelled backwards is a popular negro play group they are preparing to produce raisin in the sun a highly successful broadway play that did not depend on racial protest for its impact however scitamard says that the plays strong plea for equality in housing was a main consideration in the decision to produce it in some ways the rhode island negro has been like ralph ellisons invisible man kept off the community stage by a complexity of historical and sociological circumstances what we are beginning to hear is his cry for a leading role negro subculture the white mans problem a few months ago i a heard a distinguished r f anthropologist refer to the community life of the american negro as a subculture within but quite apart from the main cultural life of the american people this was quite shocking to me and at first evoked feelings of resentment on my part as a negro however when one surveys life in the united states and particularly in the southern and border states one must admit the existence of this subculture the framework of living to which most negroes must submit one notices for instance although legal standards of marriage and family are established for the entire community departures from these standards such as common law sex relationships childbirth out of wedlock and the like frequently find acceptance and respectability among segments of the negro community by reason of residential social and even religious ramparts which shield them from the light and censure of the community at large in economic development the motive and drive for selfimprovement and achievement among negroes are largely squelched by these same racial barriers which prevent employment of negroes on selfrespecting levels or advancement to higher positions in education the segregation barrier permits application and acceptance by the community of false standards of accreditation to substandard negro schools furnishing substandard negro education which is seldom openly and honestly recognized as substandard until the unfortunate negro graduate attempts to compete on an equal basis in an unsegregated educational institution or until some local board finds it expedient to use a twograde differential in achievement between negro and white children as an argument for continuing segregated schools in recreation and culture the negro subculture develops most negro children and adults in segregated churches a few segregated playgrounds and in loitering around segregated bars nightclubs and street corners the main community on the other hand develops its white children and adults in wellfitted ymcas ywcas clubs and playhouses school scientific fairs symphony concerts in park and school sports competition mock state governments and other such activities sometimes attempted by negro schools as training in citizenship are almost completely emasculated of reality or educational value by a segregated environment with segregated characters far removed from real life for many years the fact of this substandard subculture has been usually either ignored or rationalized along lines critical of the negro as an ethnic group not only by the white population but indeed by probably the greater portion of negroes likewise its consequences upon the whole life and development of the community have been largely ignored except in accusations attempting to stereotype the negro group on the basis of these consequences thus our politicians and others frequently decry an alleged disproportionate amount of crime births out of wedlock social diseases tuberculosis and other symptoms of social maladjustment said to be prevalent in the negro community seldom discussed however are the more basic problems of the extent to which racial segregation helps to create and perpetuate these conditions and the adverse effect of such conditions when allowed in one segment of the community not only upon the people comprising that unfortunate segment but also upon the community as a whole aside from the general contagiousness of social disorder and maladjustments the symptoms may have even more direct and practical effects breakdown of the family usually results in increased public expenditures for aid to unmarried mothers and dependent children as well as in greater juvenile delinquency and crime unemployment or low income from employment based solely on racial discrimination clearly adds to the social and economic burden of a community loss of manpower and brainpower through restrictive and inadequate training and education of any portion of our educable population is loss of one of our most valuable resources when the southland is competing for industrial and cultural development in the nation and the nation is competing for survival in the world the main thrust of the relatively few negroes who have escaped to some extent the crippling effects of the negro subculture upon their initiative and intelligence has been mostly toward elimination by lawful means of the legal bases by which the segregated subculture was imposed and maintained with the help of many enlightened dedicated white people who recognized the dangerous impact of enforced racial segregation and its concomitant negro subculture upon our society these efforts of negro leaders largely through the courts and more recently through the sitin demonstrations have met with some success in recent years but the experience of the last few years has demonstrated acutely that the efforts of a few leaders negro and white are not enough a man can remain in a dungeon for so long that he is reluctant fearful and momentarily unprepared to meet the beauty of the sunlight our enlightened leaders went and are therefore confronted with two major problems first the attitudes and habits of fear timidity indifference selfdeprecation deference to a mythical white superiority and lack of civic and community responsibility engendered among a tremendously large portion of the negro people by thiir continuous subjection for decades to the negro subculture and to the white supremacy propaganda superimposed thereon second the tendency of probably the majority of the white population to view the situation as a negro problem wherein the negroes as a sort of unwanted poor relation are seeking to enter schools parks and other community facilities which really belong only to white people seeking to acquire jobs that really belong only to white people and seeking to live in residential areas and in a social climate which is owned solely and exclusively by white people these twin attitude obstructions are illustrated on the one hand by negroes who refuse to accept the advantage of sending their children to a desegregated school and on the other hand by decent law abiding white people who look the other way in large numbers in implied approval when public officials spend thousands of dollars in public tax funds contributed by both negro and white citizens solely to prevent one negro child from enjoying his legal rights i submit that this is a community problem rather than a negro problem its likewise apparent that although negro leaders in the time that is left from fighting in the courtrooms and at the lunch counters can and should do much by persuading and educating the negro people to accept the duties and responsibilities of full citizenship in a free democratic society nevertheless even with the assistance of the white people who have helped them in the past these few negro leaders should not be asked to solve the white mans share of the problem when negroes demand the right to accept the responsibilities of and participate in the life of the community it seems a poor answer to say the majority of the white people of our community are prejudiced and selfish they do not want you to enjoy citizenship on the same basis as other citizens they do not want your dollar to be earned as easily or to buy exactly the same merchandise or privileges if community progress means having you participate in community life the same as they do then they do not want community progress its up to you to convince them that they are wrong the time has come when responsible political civic business church and social leaders in the white community can no longer continue condoning or participating in either expressly or by implication such attitudes and habits even though they themselves may be privately victims of the arbitrary racial prejudice which nurtures and sustains such group attitudes i sincerely believe that these many white leaders who have for so long held back must now come forward and take an open affirmative stand for truth and for total community progress whatever the personal consequence may be they must work to change the attitudes and habits of their white brethren which are inimical to progress and the betterment of our community they must attack with all their hearts the white mans side of the problem in so doing they will help immeasurably in the solution of the whole community problem if they miss this golden opportunity we shall not be their judges but history may the sunburned soldiers was one of those late summer afterp noons that would have d been pleasant ordinar jicssw a r ily as it was our unit of the nd infantry division negro had been tramping fullpack plus over the tuscany mountains since dawn and the sun bore down hot and merciless suddenly as is common in the italian hills our path opened upon a little village snugly stuck between the hills a small island of ancient stones stucco huts and narrow winding alleyways in the ocean of endless mountain peaks our spirits rose for in these tiny villages there was always cool spring water and shade for restingand sometimes even a few bottles of wine but as our column moved into the village square we found we had been beaten to the punch sprawled out wearily in the shade of the gray crumbling buildings were white u s infantrymen who had apparently just settled there for a break in their long trek to or from the front at the head of the column of white soldiers eager little italian children were collect ing and filling canteens from the village springs those soldiers toward the end of the column were waiting impatiently calling the chattering group of boys and girls and offering bribes of chocolate and cigarettes to get water in a hurry then the bustling youngsters sighted the column of colored soldiers moving into the square they stared at us in astonishment much to our bewilderment they quit the white soldiers and came screaming and howling to us collecting our canteens and rushing off to fill them with precious water we were stupefied and so were the white soldiersand resenting the injustice of the whole thing several of them cornered the busy little deserters as they hurried past and demanded to know why the newcomers should be given preferential treatment but paisanos we heard the peasant children explain surely you do not mind these are your comrades soldati americani like youbut see they have been walking in the sun so long it has burned them black there was no persuading the children against serving us first it was the firstand onlytime i had known being colored to be of special advantage sun sea and sonnets west indian literature y tstkt yin the making is the vv name given to writing g in english by writers native to the british colonies in the caribbean which include besides the island units forming the present federation of the west indies the two mainland territories that have opted to stay outside the federation namely british guiana and british honduras west indian literature born of a region surrounded by french and spanishspeaking peoples is historically very much the result of english education and british institutions however comprising as it does numerous races and religions and having been influenced by centuries of european imperialist rivalries in the caribbean the west indies bears many marks in its physical and mental life of its divers origins and the historical events it has witnessed the west indies had been written about from the outside for many generations before the first upsurge of local writing at the beginning of this century it is a popular fallacy that west indian writing sprang suddenly into existence during the last decade or so jamaican writers like herbert de lisser and tom red cam were active at the beginning of the century and in the thirties c l r james and alfred mendes were prominent figures in trinidad jamess black jacobins is still the most moving account of the haitian revolution under toussaint louverture and alfred mendes black fauns can hold its own beside more recent novels on west indian backyard life aldous huxley wrote a preface to the first novel of mendes in pointing out that the mixed population of trinidad was a gift to any novelist after these writers there was apparently a dormant period but in fact west indians continued to write and publish locally although the seal of quality and acceptability was not set on their efforts by uk publishing houses until the postwar resurgence of west indian writing with several names of novelists well known to many readers of english today this resurgence of west indian writing was due principally to the effects of world war ii when the caribbean was brought directly into world affairs with lendlease agreements between britain and the usa almost overnight tracts of tropical jungle were transformed by bulldozers into army and air bases and sleepy little villages were rudely awakened to the presence of british and american troops in their midst samuel selvons first novel a brighter sun gives an authentic account of this awakening and transformation of the mental life of trinidad peasants several west indians went abroad to america canada and the united kingdom to support the war effort by joining the armed forces or working in munition factories these west indians men and women were kept in touch with one another and their homeland by the bbc programme calling the west indies a sense of solidarity of being west indians instead of natives of rival islands and territories of the caribbean began to emerge and it was in that the bbc caribbean voices a literary programme was started with miss una marson a jamaican as producer this programme more than anything else helped to discover and encourage west indian writers after its inception and to stimulate the growth of west indian literature as it is known today contributors to caribbean voices began to feel a sense of community through the weekly broadcasts which stimulated further creative effort and selfcriticism in this way too the little magazines in the caribbean were given a fillip and two which started then are still in existence bim in barbados and kykoveral in british guiana short stories and poems which were originally broadcast by the bbc were occasionally printed in bim recent collections of short stories like selvons ways of sunlight and the one edited by andrew salkeywest indian stories contain some that were first published in barbados the verse broadcast in caribbean voices is to be found in bim and the university college of the west indies caribbean quarterly also in england during the war years were cricket ambassadors like the great allrounder learie constantine who was ostensibly reading law but was soon drawn into welfare work among west indians in england he contributed two books on the history of west indian cricket though not in the same class as neville carduss books they deserve a notice in any survey of west indian writing for their breezy quality like the irrepressible gaiety of learies performance with bat and ball and when one recalls the apocryphal match in which jingle of the pickwick papers took part in more than years ago it seems proper to include constantines books on cricket in the corpus of west indian literature like cricket literary activity had been going on for some time and finding an outlet in local sunday papers and ephemeral magazines and little reviews side by side with printed matter there was folk poetry in the form of the calypso but there was no stationery office in trinidad the orig inal home of these extemporaneous ballad compositions to keep a record of even the titles the corpus of these oral ballads often composed on the spot in carnival competition would serve as a social commentary on west indian life combining the topicality of the elizabethan broadsheet and the piquancy of the continental fabliaux bold bawdy satirical and sententious these compositions were generally in the idiom of trinidad english though they may have originated as ballads in the french patois of the island similar to the st lucia patois in parts of derek walcotts play the sea at dauphin there is no doubt that the calypso has been grossly neglected by the official purveyors of west indian literature there has also been a tradition of local drama but no serious attention was paid to west indian drama until the founding of the university college of the west indies the extramural department tutors stationed in the various territories advise in the production of local drama and at the college itself in jamaica the poet and dramatist derek walcott has had his playsthe sea at dauphin and henri christopheproduced in he was commissioned to write the festival play drums and colours for the inauguration of the federation the university college has also published plays by walcott and other west indian dramatists nothing however has appeared in print in the united kingdom except errol johns prizewinning observer play moon on a rainbow shawl which was produced in the west end other west indian and west african plays have of course been produced at the british council centre in london but it seems necessary for one to be on the spot to follow the progress of the work being done in drama by west indians and west africans in the caribbean africa or the united kingdom it is easier to keep in touch with developments in the novel on both sides of the atlantic since writers have caught the eye of united kingdom publishers and critics with the advent of such writers as selvon lamming and mittelholzer from the west indies and amos tutuola chinua achebe and d o fagunwa from nigeria the west indian novel starting out as mainly descriptive and autobiographical has tended especially of late to move towards the sociopolitical and satirical lammings four novels move along this line from the largely autobiographical in the castle of my skin and the emigrants to the more introspective and politically biased of age and innocence and season of adventure naipauls mystic masseur and suffrage of elvira are unmistakably satirical and the work of john hearne combines the purely descriptive with sociopolitical analysis in such novels as a stranger at the gate and the faces of love bearing in mind the political emphasis of the recent novel from sierra leonewilliam contons the africanand the more detailed analysis of achebes no longer a t ease as compared with his first novel it is quite reasonable to suppose that the novel in west africa will follow a trend similar to that of the west indian a comparison between west indian and west african writing reveals that of recent years similar influences have been at work the great difference of course is that in a country tike nigeria there have been compositions in several languages whereas in the west indies writing has been almost entirely in english french and english writers in contiguous countries both in the caribbean and west africa are only now beginning to exchange ideas this literary dialogue between french and englishspeaking peoples and the establishment of a west africacaribbean cultural liaison is likely to produce very interesting results already african themes are emerging in west indian poetry but the french antilles haiti and cuba have been quicker to explore the literary possibilities of cultural affinities between africa and the caribbean it is difficult to estimate the influence of such french writers as aime cesaire leopold senghor and camara laye on readers of english but there has doubtless been a leavening of the intellectual life in west africa generally since the appearance of black orpheus the literary journal that has done more than anything else in english to establish cultural contact between french and english writing in west africa and the west indies there are also signs of a growing vernacular literature especially in nigeria and ghana drama in twi fiction in yoruba notably the stories and novels of fagunwa the publication of olokun a literary periodical in yoruba new translations of the bible in mende and twi the oxford press projected series of african literature texts with translations all these are clear indication of a vigorous literary life beginning to blossom in this part of the world a crossfertilisation of vernacular and englishfrench writing will ensure the uniqueness of west african literature the existence and growth of a west african literature owes a great deal to the work of pioneers who tend to be forgotten in the present upsurge of creative writing in nigeria ghana and sierra leone henry swanzys voices of ghana is a good sample of writing that has been going on for longer than most people imagine short stories translations essays dramatic pieces sketches of everyday lifeexamples of these are to be found not only in swanzys anthology but also in the files of newspapers and magazines throughout the west coast from nigeria to the gambia and as in the case of the west indies although little has been published in the way of plays there is a strong tradition of indigenous drama in nigeria and ghana at least the university college ibadan has been encouraging with great vigour the writing and production of plays and the presence of the young nigerian playwright wole soyinka as rockefeller research fellow in drama attached to the english department of the university college ibadan is helping to give nigeria a living theatre his own plays produced in the arts theatre and oneact plays written by students and produced by themselves on improvised stages in the various halls of residence are exciting events at ibadan some interesting work in comedy is being done with the pidgin english of nigeria but to return to the earlier writers of english and west africa there was gladys caselyhayford of sierra leone whose poems sketches and short stories some of these are to be found in back numbers of west african review must have influenced such compatriots of hers as william conton the novelist and abioseh nicol short story writer and manofletters dedicated to the idea of a west african literature tutuola ekwensi and achebe were preceded by denis osadebay whose prince of utete seems completely forgotten and by the ghanain r e obeng whose eighteen pence was once hailed as a classic verse in krio by thomas decker and gladys caselyhayford and osadebays use of pidgin in africa sings were antecedent to present experiments with pidgin english in verse and prose finally this is the moment to pay tribute to henry swanzy who for many years as editor of african affairs in which he published several pieces broadcast in calling west africa and as producer for the bbc caribbean services and for radio ghana has done more than any other single individual to foster the growth of west african and west indian literature during the last two decades andfuls of lemon it it colored leaves clung ifni p to the blackening limbs and twig s of the bos mjrcem cage along the road near the house a dull tuft smoked from the cabins chimney fallwillie lee was getting restless the mill was about due to reopen and mary kates maidmoney from mrs rice had stopped coming in mr rice himself was in a world of money troubles he was a bookkeeper at the mill and even he was laid off and broke this meant that he and mrs rice had to lay mary kate off it was a mess all the way around willie lee walked to the steps in front of the porch it careened like an overloaded skiff and willie grabbed the banister to keep from falling he decided to fix that thing this year for sure he turned around and went back out the yard pulling his pants up and tucking in his shirt tails he was very tall and he wore a set of long bushy sideburns once hed seen a picture of frederick douglass and had thought about wearing a beard like douglass but hed changed his mind and settled for sideburns abraham his stubtailed hound got up when willie walked back into the yard he wagged his stub and followed willie to the big persimmon tree willie sat on the ground and started to play with the dogs long flappy ears what to do what to do the screen door slammed and a screaming little girl tumbled onto the porch it slammed again and a little boy hurried after her the girl dark and very skinny jumped off the porch and fled squealing to willie the boy stopped tucked his plaid shirt in exactly the same way willie did and pursued the girl again diving at her and crashing into willies chest willie stood and slapped his i thighs and started to cough in the brown fog that rose from his overalls now you little scounds just quit it make somebody break his nake the girl lifted a circle of dust around willie

orange edges willie watched them run dont youall go too far your motherll be after me if you go too far they zigzagged through the shadows and branches abraham yelping and scrambling to keep up and they did not answer willie lee got up he started back into the house he stopped something very bad hit him in the chest this was the second time the first time was last spring in the plant he was unloading a bale of cotton for the mattress fillers hed thought at first that it was indigestion but the pain went from bad to worse and before he knew anything he had dropped the hand truck with the bale of cotton on it and stood there heaving and gasping for breath hurting in the chest like the devil the foreman noticed him and ran up and started hitting him on the back it seemed to help and he caught his breath and sat down for a minute the foreman was a signifying old something youd better take it easy with them young girls willie lee you look like you was goin on away from here willie lee tried to smile but he couldnt do it the pain was still filling his chest and he felt weak verlee the foreman watched him for a moment then called luther sammy yall come and do something with this cotton i think willie lees had too much of that young stuff he caint get his breath willie lee started to reach for the cotton im all right i can make it okay sammy and luther hesitated willie lee stooped to the cotton and started to lift it back to the hand truck sammy and luther quickly put hands to the bale and willie lee grabbed the handles of the hand truck and took the cotton to the bathead machine that was the first time now it was happening again willie stood near the great tree weaving and gasping for breath the pounding in his chest beat against his ears and in the thick of his tongue he called bubba but his voice was too weak to carry he sat down the pain was back again and it was getting bad he called his daughter florida still no more than a croak from his throat he lay on his back but that hurt even more he lay on his side it was no good he sat up and another pain screamed out of the old one this was worse than any of the others he pulled his shirt open at the neck his stomach started doing something funny it didnt feel so hot he tried to scream but this time nothing came the sky began to move the trees turned baby blue and the house wobbled and rippled and went gray he thought about mary kate he heard the childrens voices abraham barked voices came near him then they washed away the barking grew louder he felt m another pain and the sky and the trees and the house went real light blue and melted into the voices and the barking he felt something rough and wet slide across his hand now a barking again he heard some squeals and somebody called his name he tried to answer when mary kate reached him he was dead he was buried the next friday on the following monday the plant called the men back to work the south african underground it was oclock at t night when the telephone jangled in my johannesburg hotel room an unfamiliar you came here to study apartheid you should meet the people who are fighting itthe voice said underground then came an order to be outside my hotel at am i waited nervously outside the hotel fingering my homburg and stick this had not been the first mysterious telephone call i had receivednor would it be the last a small car drew up and a well dressed indian held the door open for me with him were two afri cans we were going i was told to an anniversary ceremony for the seventyone africans who were shot down at sharpeville a year before we drove mostly along bumpy unpaved roads beyond the vast beigecoloured slagheaps of the goldmines that surround johannesburg it was nearly am when we reached an isolated group of houses and stopped beside a dilapidated stuccofinished cottage i was led down to a basement surprisingly large and jammed with more than men and women they were nearly all africans in native dress the women barebreasted squatting on the floor they fell silent when they saw me in chairs at the far end of the room a dozen white men sat obviously in charge of the meeting on one otherwise bare wall hung a portrait of nikita khrushchev draped with red flags on another a picture of one of the leaders of the bloody sharpeville gathering a tall fairhaired white man about forty appeared to be the leader he wore a smart brown suit he told me quietly dont be afraid were not going to hurt you we have brought you here to show you that our movement is the only hope for africa you have been talking about communism and your hatred of it but after seeing this meeting we believe you will change your mind and will tell your people the true facts the meeting then continued in an african tongue there were pauses to translate into other native dialects i gathered it was a discussion of plans for unified action for some future time when not taking part in the discussion the tall man explained that this was a group of freedom fighters who were working to unite all parties in a common struggle for an allblack africa how i asked do you propose to oust verwoerds government he smiled thought for a moment then said ill show you something but first you must swear in the name of black africa not to reveal to a soul in africa what you will see his voice hardened and his entire countenance changed as he added if you do we will track you down and kill you at one end of the cellar was a wooden partition the tall man leaned over pressed a short steel rod into a small hole on the floor and a section of the partition swung open inside i could see a large room he rose took my arm and led me inside while the others watched the inside of the partition including the door was faced with steel stacked against the walls were wooden cases made of pine he lifted the lid on one and inside it were riflessomewhat like the leeenfields i had handled during the warin one corner stood two barrels like rum kegs and in them were hand grenades wrapped like apples in foil when i lifted one and unwrapped it the tall man recoiled and shouted a warning i reminded him that i had used many of them during the war and that i had not removed the release pin im afraid i spoke scornfully when i asked if this armament was intended to free africa the tall man smiled and said there are many places like this one day we will use them all back in the meeting room the gathering had begun chanting the welldressed indian who had brought me said its time to go as i left the tall man said someone would contact me later no matter how much you may hate communism he told me we are the only hope of africa next evening i heard another voice on the phone it was an african voice it said our leader told me to contact you you will say nothing of what you saw when you return to canada you will be reached again goodbye i tell this story not because it indicates the intent of all black africans but to show the ends to which a desperate and hopeless people can be driven my second story begins at the railway station in johannesburg i bought a ticket at the nonwhites wicket entered a whites only coach and took a seat in a moment the conductor appeared and with a sneer demanded cant you read you know your kind belongs back there he pointed along the train to the noneuropean coaches i said im staying here im a canadian a dozen white passengers watched quietly some sympathetically as he barked the sign says this coach is for white passengers only when youre in south africa youll have to learn to read i sat tight and told him in my country i may sit in any coach for which i paid my fare i thought this was a commonwealth country too i pointed to my war veterans british commonwealth service league badge but the conductor ordered me off the train at the next station to walk back to the coloured coaches so i wouldnt pass through other white coaches when i refused the train superintendent appeared they talked about me in afrikaans then they left from every side white passengers spoke up they smiled and several shook hands an afrikaner said ive been trying to get my houseboy to do this for years but hes too frightened an english woman said if more of you would do that you could break apartheid thus i began to learn of black africas white friends when i applied for a visa to visit south africa it was granted on condition that i agreed to be met by government officials and visit the places they selected the south african high commissioners letter to me granting the visa explained this was necessary in order to enable you to obtain a complete picture of south africa at jan smuts airport outside i johannesburg i was met by white representatives of the south african governments information bui reau i was greeted warmly and courteously in a motorcar with a white driver i was taken to the carlton hotel where my registration caused considerable excitement but it was apparent they expected me i was ushered to an excellent room but was requested not to enter any lounges bars or other public rooms i would eat in my room i was soon interviewed by reporters i told them i had been impressed by the south african governments programme for the education of africans for the establishment of their own communities for a form of local selfgovernment i had said and repeated that these things should be seen and evaluated fairly with guides and escorts provided by the government i toured the townships or locationsthe vast sprawling native communities in which south africas nonwhite populations must live my first visits were to the johannesburg townships of orlando and meadowlands these are comparatively new some townships in the very shadow of huge power developments had no electricity children scurried everywhere ragged yet surprisingly clean on every hand were pathetic evidences of pride tiny patches of struggling lawn flowers in windows spotless washing hanging above the pitifullysmall backyards and despite my realisation that i was seeing the best my horror grew in the knowledge that these were prisons camps of captive and subject people here was obvious deprivation malnutrition poverty in the rags clinging to the clotheslines but still pride in the carefullypainted doors and bits of salvaged furniture the worst slums of the western world fall far short of conditions in many of the native townships in many there are only a few central points where water may be obtained it must be carried in buckets a great distance open privies are a source of infection no one can question that south africa has spent vast sums in an attempt to provide housing and other necessities for its native populationpoor though these remain but one has only to talk with the people to realise that the governments proposals for gradual development of the native peoples their education and eventual local selfgovernment and so on are starkly and cruelly reactionary here is an example we were to attend the opening of the new native agricultural college in zululand mr m d c de wet nel minister of bantu native administration and development was made to frame me on trumpedup morality charges and i was threatened with injury or death once i walked down the street with the wife of a white lawyer i was stopped by a policeman and threatened with a criminal charge when her husband who was to meet us arrived his intervention prevented my arrest many times my taxis were stopped and i was threatened with a search for liquor or weapons if i ate with a white personexcept those officially approved by the government guide it had to be done secretly one sunday evening i was called to the telephone in my hotel a woman said she wished to meet me she was anxious to go to canada and hoped i could advise her how to seek permission would i come to the following address puzzled i was on the point of going when caution stopped me instead i called a friend a clergyman he asked me to remain in my room an hour later he arrived with his wife and my caller the latter was a white woman he explained that he had gone to the address sought the woman who had given me her name and brought her to talk to me we talked for a long while when suddenly she broke down and confessed she had no interest in coming to canada was an employee of an hotel where i had stayed once and had agreed to lure me to her place where police would rush in to hear her accuse me of an attempted assault i was amazed but i was also terrified when i remembered a minister of the government had said in the assembly in capetown that not one black man has raped a woman in this country and avoided the gallows i had known discrimination at home no one can say it does not exist in north america but what i saw and felt in south africa was something far more horrible after a month i came away frightened and disappointed i was frightened by what obviously lies ahead further betrayal of democracy and if something is not donecommunism by dr broadus n butler although an image is q a only a surface phenom enon which merely a outlines how one is t seen by himself or by another person and images may fail to reflect the true character of the person images are powerful social determinants because they condition the way a person behaves toward himself and how others respond to him the same behavior evokes different responses depending upon the image of the person engaged in the behavior eating watermelon is an example imagery is one of the most powerful social factors in these united states and how images are manipulated is of significance to the whole world in these serious times a social image then is an appearance or set of appearances which is imputed to a person or group and becomes so ingrained in the social setting as to command acceptance whether or not it truly characterizes the person or group racial images in the united states have taken on a character of sacredness and inviolability in a very short period of less than years the myths underlying these images have given coherence to a highly elaborate and institutionalized system of prejudicial attitudes and behaviors all of these myths have economic reasons for being and they support an economic arrangement of which we are a part during years americans of african heritage have been successfully subdued humiliated enslaved exploited degraded freed segregated and now discriminated against the last two racial segregation and racial discrimination are not the same there is a distinct difference segregation is overt physical separation which is subject to legal and economic control discrimination is covert subjective and deceptive so it is more difficult to isolate and more elusive of control by regular legal and economic measures it is in the area of racial discrimination that imagery is of pivotal importance because the image which supports discriminatory attitudes operates with equal detriment upon the victim and the perpetrator of discriminatory practices in the united states the awesome fact is that the survival of this nation and the peace of the world may largely depend upon the elimination of discrimination in the united states moreover it is quite conceivable that segregation may be eliminated without discrimination being eliminated witness many northern states but it is inconceivable that discrimination could be eliminated without segregation going by the board this makes discrimination much more important to us than segregation the ingrained attitude patterns of racial discrimination historically worked interchangeably with a whole framework of myths to justify the establishment and perpetuation of racial segregation racial segregation has worked reciprocally to condition and reinforce attitudes of racial discrimination the three main image myths which have been most damaging to the american negros selfimage and have done most to deprive him of the opportunity and capacity to conceive of himself as an equal of other americans and to live as a free equal american are the following the myth that american negroes have no cultural past the myth of negro biological and social inferiority and the myth of negro poverty i shall not address myself directly to an analysis of these myths but the mention of them constitutes a necessary background for any discussion of the negro selfimage today to use a biblical metaphor which has a genuine appropriateness for those who are imageconscious we are in the second millennium of the development of a democratic american life the first millennium was introduced by a violent raid on harpers ferry in and lasted ninetyfive years to the supreme court school desegregation decision of the main character of the first millennium was that it started with the painful sixyear process of emancipation of africans by now called negroes and forged back together a divided nation the war that eventuated in the emancipation brought on segregation in the wake of that emancipation only eight years later the signal for the end of that period came with the legal decision to eliminate segregation the supreme court decision of which introduced the second millennium pointed to the damage visited upon its victims by the inherent evil in the reciprocal relationship between segregation and discrimination the court addressed itself directly to the question of racial discrimination when it declared that segregation is inherently unequal and that equal physical appearances of school buildings and equipment do not constitute equality for the human constituency the important thing about these two junctures in american history is that the survival of the nation rested then and does now rest upon the resolution of a national problem in which negroes were and are of key importance moreover what negroes did during the first millennium was pivotal to the survival of the nation but what negroes do in consequence of the beginning of the second millennium may very well determine the survival of the world as we know it this is a tremendous responsibility and i think that not enough negroes are aware of the enormity of the task or the meaning of their historic role although we talk about it daily to each other let me begin the heart of the discussion by saying that these are hard and crucial times this is the first time in the history of mankind that the prospect of freedom and the concept of universal freedom have been treated on a world wide basis the freedom of mankind in africa in asia in south america in latin america and indeed in europe is for the first time treated in one universal context of approach to mankinds problem such hard and crucial times require that we negroes take a crucial look at ourselves for we may be the midwives of freedoms birth or the nurses of her maturation provided we do not permit her to arrive crippled and become warped at an early age as we did in because of our incapacity to utilize a historical opportunity to nurture freedom to her full maturity incidentally the old adage goes that opportunity knocks but once but this is the second time within a century that the opportunity to be free has clearly knocked upon our doors what happened during the first millennium why did not emancipation eventuate in real freedom the plain fact is that negroes were so consumed by the burdensome effort to carve out a bare subsistence and to gain relief from physical degradation that they had neither time nor energy nor courage to respond to frederick douglass call to continue to struggle until they were completely free they could not hear his warning that physical survival was being paid for at the cost of human dignity and that the loss of dignity would usher a regression to a condition of being not less than half slave nor more than half free we even now talk about dignity without realizing that dignity must be undergirded with some kind of power or else it becomes a weak and surface sham douglass described the ironical social process of the relationship between dignity and discrimination about a hundred years ago in a remarkable parable which i can only paraphrase this parable also pointed up the main distinction between his philosophical approach to the achievement of freedom and the approach of those who advocated conciliation gradualism and obsequiousness under the duress of the necessity to eke out a bare physical and economic survival frederick douglass put it this way injustice can become so firmly established that the perpetrator cannot distinguish it from justice consider that you the peer of another pass him on the sidewalk and you yield in courtesy as befits your gentility he thanks you you yield the second time and he thanks you but with less enthusiasm you yield the third time and he begins to think that you do this either in consciousness of his superiority or in awareness of your inferiority you yield a fourth time and he begins to think it is his right to your part of the sidewalk about the eighth time your inferiority and his superiority become laws of nature and your claim to access to sidewalks becomes an affront to his rights and violation of the laws of nature he paralleled this message with a ringing philosophical observation that went unheard then and has continued to go unheard by the majority of negroes even in the wake of the sitins and freedom rides of the past months of listen to douglass speaking in response to urgings by negroes to go slow and not rock the boat because it made a bad image for negroes and it disturbed race relations if there is no struggle there is no progress those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground this struggle may be a moral one or it may be a physical one or it may be both moral and physical but it must be a struggle power concedes nothing without a demand it never did and it never will so here we stand again on the threshold of a second great opportunity we stand here with only a partial realization that if we had had the resources during the first millennium to get beyond the quest for physical relief to demand that we be really free the institution of segregation would not have emerged in the s nor would it have been crystallized in the supreme court decision of i say partial realization because now segregation has become so imbedded in our own thinking that for the most part we ourselves contribute to its perpetuation and do not distinguish it from discrimination and worse we do not realize that segregation initially adopted in the s as a political expediency in the short time of eighty years has come to be treated as if it were a law of god and nature by exactly the process that frederick douglass described indeed this is how it is projected by segregationists both negro and white how do we get beyond segregation in this second millennium and at the same time avoid regression into the pitfall of discrimination which depends upon the perpetuation of an inferior image negroes of a century ago got beyond slavery only to fall into the trap of segregation we must deal with both segregation and discrimination the legal and the attitude and get beyond both we must frankly begin by remaking remolding recreating and reevaluating our own selfimage the greatest need that we negroes have at the moment is for cultural mirrors that will magnify ourselves to ourselves in such wise as to enable us to stand foursquare before ourselves clearly and reflectively this cannot be just a legal mirror because we must come up with profound social and moral answers about our own selfimage before we can use the image to demand equal equality in dignity instead of mere legal equality we must literally transform our j own myths which have supported the image of the american negro j as a spontaneously generated in minority group which has no past and whose members are by i nature inferior in behavior in j ferior in mentality inferior in culture inferior in value standards and inferior in biological station where do we start we must obviously begin by removing the ingrained mote that segregation has placed in our own eyes and has made us look confusedly upon ourselves this is no easy task because to many of us the occasional irri tation of the mote is not nearly so troublesome as the awesome prospect of the responsibility of freedom many of us have adjusted quite well to the blurred image because we have not allowed it to deter our pleasures nor disturb our pocketbooks but for the few who must bear the mantle and the armor of the next generation there must be a threefold look into the mirror of this day the first look must disturb us perturb us and make us restless to do something i mean something much more than scholarships and freedom fund dinners and something on a continuing organized coordinated scale which looks beyond the piecemeal year to year campaigns otherwise we will not be seeing the truth about our responsibility the second look must encourage us or we are not geared to the reality about the real impact of the legal and political work of the naacp the educational and employment pioneering of the national urban league and the charismatic inspired moral and social demonstrations of the sitins and freedom ride movements of core the third look must sober us to our opportunity and discipline us to the responsibility that the survival of this nation and maybe western civilization has placed in our charge let us review these three reflections in some detail the look that disturbs presents us the oldnegro selfimage and the painful necessity that is upon us to divest ourselves of it i do not mean old in the chronological sense of age i mean old as a designation for the product of the segregation period that image has the following content it begins with the baffling falsehood that negroes are a minority race even in full knowledge that twothirds of the people of the world are colored and that no other group of people in the united states has as many members as that group which is classified as negroes this is just the beginning the oldnegro selfimage looks upon the american negro in exactly the same way that whites look upon the negroas inferior the oldnegro believes that he is inferior and all of his social actions and responses start from that assumption there are interesting behavioral byproducts of this selfimage which have been detrimental to himself first he has elected to grow in the shadow of and mainly in imitation of nonnegro european cultural values instead of cultivating and preserving his own african and american cultural values he has been very contented to be the main supporter of the myth that negroes have no past because he in his ignorance about african culture did not maintain our historical continuity now as we view the tremendous resurgence of african culture we occasionally pause to regret that he did not maintain our historical identity and occasionally we even get angry with africans when they say that they are not negroes there is more here to disturb us as we look at the oldnegro he always believes that the next generation will be a little better off and he will think about making efforts towards that end but he does not really believe in his own capacity to live as a free equal unsegregated undiscriminatedagainst american who can be proud to be both a negro and an american moreover although he wishfully believes that the next generation will be better off he does not devote his attention to preparing an economic base and a historical or cultural image which are the necessary foundations for the freedom of that next generation american jews bought back their past when they invested billions in israel bonds and millions in the revival of hebrew and near eastern studies in the united states negroes have not yet seen fit to invest more than token conscience fees either in the independence of african countries or the revival of negro culture studies the economic picture is the most paradoxical here his selfimage is that of poverty and deprivation there are three interesting facets of this economic image first he thinks that he is poor yet he spent billion last year he is spending billion this year and his spending is rising toward billion at the rate of better than billion increase per year this billion is mainly earmarked for consumer products and for companies which do most to discriminate economically and socially against negroes moreover it is simply amazing that negroes who cling to the poverty claim whenever they are asked to give for group improvement or for investment in the necessary economic foundation for future freedom are most conspicuous users of luxury consumer products of these companies the same man who cannot afford for a freedom fund dinner for the united negro college fund for the tom mboya scholarship fund or even for a patrons of the arts membership will spend extra for a golf bag to carry his new set of golf clubs simply because his three or fouryear old bag does not look good enough for his new clubs and if the salesman is the least alert the man will toss in another for a new cart when he buys a new car he thinks nothing of adding a accessory which may be more decorative than efficient moreover he will pay to more for a sports car or a luxury model and consider this a social necessity but he would not consider it a social responsibility to buy a good comfortably equipped car and use the difference to invest in the consolidation of his own freedom the most damaging byproduct of this poverty image is that the only economic right that the oldnegro guards zealously is the right to appear wealthier and freer on the outside to hide what he feels on the inside oldnegroes are as dutifully concerned about this as whites are concerned about the right to appear superior the main problem is that the oldnegro has no real drive to earn the wealth and to be free so that the appearance will be unnecessary we do not yet realize that a cadillac does not dignify the man if the man does not dignify the cadillac we have not become fully aware that such luxuries can make us look absurd when we depreciate among ourselves the value of investment in the struggle for the very freedoms which will gain that measure of dignity that will make the luxury trappings unnecessary to prop us up it makes us look even more absurd when we can spend so much for so many costly things and then have to go begging others to support our students our educational institutions our civil_rights campaigns and our cultural enterprises the second byproduct of the economic image is that we genuinely perceive ourselves as mass consumers not as producers we do not produce in any large measure we do not support producing negro enterprises we believe negro products and services are somehow inferior and we will not organize subsidiary enterprises to support our main enterprises we would not buy an investment interest in a single negro production enterprise with any degree of confidence there is not a single bond drive for any negro or african country which is producing we will not organize a single country club or combination business and social club where foreign and domestic dignitaries can be entertained contracts can be consummated and invitations that we get from comparable organizations can be reciprocated on a basis of equal dignity this is because we think we are poor not because we are poor this is a heavy indictment of the oldnegro but it is a social reality which we must face up to quite frankly in order to purge ourselves of its insidious effect upon our social and economic welfare the third and equally devastating byproduct of the economic image is that negroes have produced some of the greatest artists scholars statesmen scientists professional men entertainers and athletes as individuals but negroes as a group have not supported them neither have they supported the educational institutions and cultural enterprises in which they received their own education and professional training moreover where there have emerged great negro imagemakers the negro community has ridden upon them in the glory of their achievements but failed miserably to sustain their images when they were over the hill ironically when the joe louises and the ethel waters and the e frederick morrows are at their peak we are all with them but when they lose their lustre we find some way to blame them as individuals for their decline the lonely wait of andy razaf andy razafs name is a distinguished one in the history of american p pular music admired his lyrics long before my own songwriting career began and have known him as a friend for years perhaps my indignation in his behalf is personal bias but i doubt it razaf who wrote dozens of globally known hits was stricken in by a still unexplained form of paralysis since then he has lived mainly on faith hope and the merciful security provided by the ascap and royalty income from his early successes recently i visited him in the quiet los angeles house where alone except for a nurse he spends hours a day bedridden and four hours strapped to a wheelchair meeting him is not a cheerful thing for one who knew him when he was a lithe and busy figure around tin pan alley but if it is not pleasant to see him wracked by the pain spasms that hit him a dozen times a day it is a great deal less pleasant for him to endure them pain and loneliness are his constant companions as we talked andy showed me how he occupies his time answering mail from penfriends all over the world writing letters to newspaper editors dreaming up an occasional poem he writes few songs nowadays disgust with the rock n roll fad and the physical restrictions that keep him from promoting new works are the chief deterrents bom andreamenentania paul razafinkeriefo a grandson of the united states consul in madagascar andy was born in washington d c the shows for which he wrote were those that made broadway and harlem glamorous in the ebbing years of prohibition blackbirds keep shufflin connies hot chocolates fats waller was his most frequent collaborator incredibly while the major record companies chum out album after album of joe doakes sings cole porter annie zilch salutes irving berlin and heaven knows who sings jimmy mchugh not one company not one single artist has bothered to assemble an album of hits by the man who gave us to name a few at random sposin honeysuckle rose memories of you aint misbehavin my fate is in your hands massachusetts in the mood keepin out of mischief now gee baby aint i good to you youre lucky to me how can you face me christopher columbus and on revival day the reason i suppose is that andy has no big publishing house backing him no highpriced promotion men to arrange such dedications and is physically incapable of meeting the right people in the right places to the countless artists who owe at least part of their success to the razaf songs they have sung and to the record companies that needed men like andy when good songs represented a growing rather than a dying art i say what the hell are you waiting for for andy to die so that you can start the mad rat race to see who can come out fastest with a memorial album give the man a tribute while hes around to enjoy it though andy cant help feeling a trifle bitter about old friends who have deserted him and about a couple of famous and very wealthy singers who live nearby but have never taken the time to drop by and relieve his solitude he is a man of deep religious faith and contents himself by thanking god that he has been spared the great contribution that andy razaf has made will be a little more permanently remembered and his morale immeasurably lifted if and when somebody gets around to a commemorative lp the ugly face of hypocrisy when negroes were displaced by a chicago hotel fire the last week in june the red cross called the rev albert h constien of holy cross lutheran church with a request for hospitality mr constien immediately agreed his church stands in one of the numerous white islands on chicagos south side not far from the residence of mayor richard j daley when he found that his churchs supper guests were negroes mr constien continued to act in a hospitable manner but much of the neighborhood particularly its teenage element did not soon a crowd of indeterminate size gathered threatening to vandalize the newly decorated church in the ensuing confusion all parties agreed that for the safety of hosts guests and church building it would be wiser to move the negroes all chicagoans were not villains in this incidentjust as all the citizens of little rock or jackson are not villains the villains were the toughs who gathered around the church the silent many who create the climate in which the mob unrest is produced andmost of allthe chicago police of the deering district who resorted to that frustrating inventiveness police can show when they want to evade responsibility chicago is shamed its police are being investigated the parable of christian hospitality has been lived out once more the ugly face of northern hypocrisy has again been unmasked as a nation we are learning that we cannot play around with the racial issue without coming upon its ill effects everywhere a passing note conservative lutherans who pride themselves on their customary distance from the social gospel and the days issues officially and unanimously backed up mr constien not long ago a lutheran vicar in alabama was beaten up by the ku klux klan after he had invited negroes to attend an affair at his church from such incidents all denominations are learning that the gospel is very much related to all life and that non involvement is its own kind of dangerous involvement
does integration doom negro colleges the supreme v court decision outlaw ing segregation in the public schools made the negro colleges shockingly aware of the fact that they will soon be in open competition with white institutions what will happen then to the predominantly negro college does it have a future will it be needed what role will it play in american education and what will become of negro professors some people have assumed that when integration comes into full force these colleges will not be needed because negro students will flock to white institutions i believe that this assumption is false college enrollments will double in the next decade and this fact alone will assure the need for all existing institutions plus additional ones but quite apart from the enrollment increase it would be unrealistic to expect the white colleges in the south when they open their doors to negroes to recruit and welcome them in large numbers they will continue to select them very carefully and the great majority of negro students in the south must continue to look to the desegregated negro colleges for their education if these colleges do not perform the task it will not be done negro colleges however can adapt themselves to integration more easily than white colleges because they have no prejudices to overcome and no fears to subdue they are not bound by the customs and traditions of yesteryear they are free to become experimental centers for democratic education and living in the heart of the south and if negro colleges do not play this role it will not be performed any time in the near future certain centers of negro education will become the main source of interracial intercultural and international education in the south with a faculty and student body composed of teachers and students from all over the world representing every culture race religion and nationality atlanta for example might well be one of these centers the six institutions atlanta clark the interdenominational theological center morehouse morris brown and spelmanthat make up the atlanta university center are by practice and tradition a natural for developing this kind of education for decades these colleges have been building bridges of interracial understanding and good will a score or more interracial gatherings meet on these campuses annually and this has been true for decades it cannot happen anywhere else in atlanta on such a wide scale the faculties have been integrated from the beginning speakers of all races and cultures have always been free to speak to students and faculties of these colleges white people are not segregated when they attend cultural and educational programs it seems clear that negroes are not rushing to attend the formerly allwhite colleges that have desegregated some of these were open to negroes long before berea which began as a college open to students of all races and later became segregated opened its doors to negroes for the second time in thirty negroes are enrolled in berea this semester st johns college in maryland began admitting negroes in but only one is now enrolled the university of virginia began accepting negroes as undergraduates in but only six are enrolled today meanwhile the negro colleges in these same areas are crowded with students recently we wrote to a large number of white colleges that have been reported to have desegregated since the supreme court decision of asking two questions what year did your college decide to admit negroes to your undergraduate college and how many are now enrolled we received replies from of this number thirtythree colleges keep no records on the race of students and sixteen accept negroes but have none enrolled eight said they do not accept negroes the remaining institutions reported that they enrolled negroes in the second semester of the academic year this is a start toward desegregation but the total number is small in proportion to the thousands of negro students desiring higher educaiion i believe that for some time to come the negro enrollment in the white colleges will be relatively small negroes will not go to an institution merely because it was formerly all whitethey will seek good institutions we also sent questionnaires to the presidents of the thirtythree colleges that make up the united negro college fund and the presidents of the ten largest taxsupported colleges for negroes the dominant question was what effect did the may decision of the united states supreme court have upon your college of the thirtyeight that replied twentynine said the courts decision did not cause a change in their charters many said in effect our charter has always forbidden discrimination based upon race three said their charters had been revised to permit integration prior to six institutions reported however that the courts decision did result in a revision of their charters to make it possible for them to admit students irrespective of race we also asked about the enrollment of white students in these colleges both before and after may we found that nine of them had enrolled a total of twentyseven white students immediately prior to that date and that since then twenty of the thirtyeight colleges have enrolled a total of in six years sixty of these white students have graduated these negro colleges expect more white students in the future but so far the numbers are not impressive these figures however do not include howard university which has a long record of admitting and graduating white students or lincoln university in missouri where hundreds have enrolled since in many of the colleges for negro students the faculties have been integrated for a long time white colleges however will accept negro students more readily than they will hire negro professors and for a long time faculty integration in southern white colleges will be token of the many southern colleges and universities that have token integration in the student body i do not know a single one that has added negro professors even the few that have gone beyond token integration have no negro professors i believe that the institutions now designated negro colleges will become colleges without designationcolleges serving all the peoplebut they will not go out of existence their enrollments will grow if their future is precarious it will not be because of desegregation but because of difficulty in financing their programs if for some reason all negro colleges were abolished at the end of this academic year i believe that per cent of all negro students now in college would have nowhere to go and the number entering college in the immediate future would be greatly reduced it will take a long time for most negroes to overcome the disabilities imposed upon them by years of slavery and segregation regardless of his inherent ability a child cannot escape being handicapped if he is born and reared in an environment of semipoverty and semiliteracy and in homes and communities where he is culturally restricted such an environment is the lot of the vast majority of negro boys and girls now enrolled in our schools the encouragement and motivation they need to make them aspire nobly must come mainly from teachers who themselves have experienced what it means to be a negro in an integrated situation where negro and white teachers work side by side the needs of the negro student are more likely to be understood than in one where the student body is integrated but all the professors are white no college whatever its origin has a right to survive unless it is needed and unless it is willing to strive for educational excellence but many of the negro colleges are better than some white ones and the best negro colleges compare favorably with the best white colleges in their areas these will compete and will survive colleges with a long tradition of providing higher education for negroes can play two unique and necessary roles they can administer to the spiritual social economic and cultural needs of the majority of negro students and they can at the same time provide a truly integrated education that rises above the barriers of race culture nationality and faith greatest craftsman of them all if movies of the i oldtime heavyweight champions prove nothvy emg else they would seem to indicate beyond even a reasonable doubt that the most superlative craftsman of them all was jack johnson a rare opportunity for inspection was given when sam himmell tossed a luncheon for harry hershfisld and several writers they watched film shots from the private collection of jimmy jacobs some that had never before been seen in this country jim corbett bob fitzsimmons jim jeffries tommy bums and jess willard failed to impress but johnson stole the show it wasnt just that he was big fast clever and a deadly hitter it was the way he performed his chores he talked to the customers at ringside he laughed he clowned at the end of one round of his bout with burns in australia for the title johnson was so disdainful of his smaller foe that he pushed tommy away as the bell sounded then he broke out in a big grin good bye tommy said jack waving farewell so sharp was the clarity of the film that even inexpert lipreaders could get the message tommy got it too he was on the verge of a knockout when the police swarmed into the ring and stopped the fight with johnson the champion the film record of this fight was only recently uncovered because the two battlers could not agree on sharing the loot for the movie rights no camerasor so they thoughtcaught the action however hugh mcintosh the promoter bootlegged it he put men on a platform to hide the peeking eye of the camera it got it all in the jacobs collection is the first showing of the highly controversial bout between johnson and willard at havana in the only still picture that received widespread use in this country is the famous one of johnson flat on his back and presumably shielding his eyes from the sun that proves i threw the fight said johnson afterwards a man whose scruples and morals were not of a high order but the segments of the fight that were shown yesterday gave emphasis to several points the huge willard was not the grossly inflated goon who was slashed to ribbons by jack dempsey four years later he was a trim giant who moved well johnson was then years old not quite the magnificent physical specimen he once had been if he threw the fight however why did he go brutal rounds under a blazing havana sun in degree heat why did he launch assaults particularly in the th and th rounds that came perilously close to toppling willard the eyeshielding episode has been publicized to such an extent that the natural assumption was that johnson took the count and then escaped from the glare of the sun it didnt happen that way at all when willard belted johnson the elderly champion crashed down on his back by some peculiar reflex action his arms came to rest across his face when he was counted out they still were across his face into the ring stormed wellwishers to greet the new heavyweight king leaping across the still prostrate body of johnson with his arms in the same position that knockout was no phony it was for real yet johnson in his prime was a magnificent animal when he fought fireman jim flynn the man who later knocked out dempsey in one round johnson so frustrated his foe by his cleverness that flynn actually engaged in the most flagrant butting ever seen this side of a pasture filled with billy goats big jack didnt complain to the referee he pulled back his grinning face completely unruffled frank moran a topranking heavyweight found the johnson defense so impenetrable when they fought in paris that a strange thing happened when a moran punch finally landed frank stepped back and laughed in an irresistible show of delight what did johnson do he clapped gloved hands together in applause the film gave a brief glimpse of sam langford famed boston tar baby this was the first movies ever seen in this country of this uncrowned champion he too was a superb craftsman so were george dixon and george gans the fellow who came out with escutcheon most smudged was philadelphia jack obrien supposedly the paragon of boxing masters if his bout with burns is any indication the reason no one ever could put a glove on philadelphia jack was because no one could catch him he ran like a thief all the time glimpses of the collection provided a rare treat it even showed the first exhibition ever captured on film an exhibition between corbett and peter courtney on september the cameraman was a fellow named thomas alva edison york the slave explorer unbelievable and mighty it lay before him the thing that had been their one netic objective through months of danger and hardship and excitement stretched away to a western horizon as unlimited and unmeasured as the vast power that came pounding and surging towards their feet while the small thrilled group of white companions watched the young man stripped off his elkskin mag shirt kicked off his pants and shoes and stood ready in his nudeness powerful arm and chest muscles lay exposed under his black skin the loins and legs were like those of some adonis sculptured in ebony he pushed his hands through close kinky hair and with a whoop of joy dashed into the breakers of the blue whitecapped sea when he came out shivering for it was novemberthere were hurrahs and resounding slaps on his back york boomed a gleeful explorer do you know you are the first black man to do it the first negro to start traveling west overland from st louisand wind up wetting his feet in the pacific there was more laughter more congratulative shouts while the shivering young athlete pulled on his clothes no one knows if he realized at that moment he was also the very first negro to a have his name recorded as part of an official u s frontier exploration in our west b be seen and known by many important north american indians c become a skilled hunter of our western buffalo elk and other big game also a rocky mountain fisherman d introduce typical negro dancing jigging buckandwing tapping and folkdancing beyond st louis e act as a trader with the indians for a governmental agency f discover species of wild life in our west g have his act of heroism recorded in an official army account of westernfrontier action who was this man york he was a man whose fantastic and colorful life began as a slave and ended in our history books he was the slave and traveling companion of captain william clark usa of the famous lewis and clark expedition to the pacific northwest in to being a slave only the skimpiest of records exist today on his life most are mere notations on capt clarks logs or in clark family papers apparently capt clark inherited york he had no other recorded name in from his fathers estate clark also inherited five old negroes seven above years three under and three children in this group were old york his wife rose and another man named york it was the latter that became clarks invaluable aide on his explorations and a historic personage young york was beautifull v built athletic and comical records indicate he may have been born in kentucky or possibly in virginia historians say he was worth upwards of his rather remarkable linguistic abilities remember he was an uneducated slave were acquired around st louis then the jumping off place of adventurers and furtraders york spoke french and several indian dialects only estevanico the acamor arabia negro slave of explorer narvaez who was shipwrecked in off florida had exploring adventures to compare with york estevanico incidentally became a medicine man and linguist with coronados southwest expeditions in the s and a big dealer in turquoise and women but york was a nativeborn american before we get into yorks adventures perhaps it is advisable to recap briefly the lewis clark expedition studied in grammar school president thomas jefferson commissioned army captains meriwether lewis and william clark to explore certain lands of the louisiana purchase the man expedition left st louis on may they ascended the missouri river to the mandan indian villages wintering around presentday bismarck north dakota in april they pushed into todays montana thence into the flathead mountains of the rockies striking the snake river they reached the pacific coast near the mouth of the columbia river in november wintering there they explored their way back to civilization in the autumn of though a slave york was fond of his master clark treated him like a trusted companion admiring his skills york could when asked do everything from cook to hunt he had a diplomatic gift with the indians when the chips were down he was a shrewd and welcome indian trader expedition logs repeatedly prove young squaws delighted in his companionship conversational and amorous an early log entry october highlights yorks personality it was so windy rainy and cold in the mandan country that the two captains suspended conferences with indian chiefs nevertheless bucking the weather three great chiefs and many others came from two indian villages to watch in amazement my black servant who did not lose the opportunity to display his powers and strength this nation never saw a black man before york put on a oneman show of calisthenics fast dancing and caricature that gave big bellylaughs to the soberest chiefs the york charm over the comely maidens is logged on the october visit to the lodges of recaras capt lewis and myself went with a chief to visit several of the huts people were kind and much pleased with my black servant their women were very fond of caressing him using yorks drawing power many of the gros ventres or big bellies came to see my black man who entertained several curious chiefs during the councils of october in the future york would cash in on his publicity indian chiefs would return his hospitality with choicest indian maidens even their own squaws to enjoy within tribal tents for example there is the affair with the recaras whose chiefs proffered young handsome squaws for the explorers pleasure one historian says the black man york participated largely in their favors explaining that instead of inspiring any prejudices his color seemed to procure him additional advantages from the indian girls who desired to preserve among them some memorial of their wonderful stranger one recara invited york into his lodge presented his squaw to york then retired outside the door just then clark came looking for york but the gallant husband forbade molestation until his squaw signalled she had entertained york to her satisfaction then there is the meeting with the nez perces their first sight of a negro terrified them so much that they fled into the woods abandoning a papoose strapped to a board york was told to approach them cautiously then to put on his marvelous exhibition of a huge friendly man dancing and laughing with mad abandon this enticed the indians from hiding to talk to the explorers again york was rewarded with the company of a comely temporary wife months later on returning from the pacific york discovered his offspring one historian reported several kinkyhaired nez perces resulted from yorks visit indeed legend is that chiefs tried to borrow york for mating purposes to preserve his attributes of wonderfully lustrous skin great strength and fascinating agility any virile young man can appreciate then the neartragedy that overtook the southernbred york when he endured his first northwest winter records clark on december this day being so cold several men returned a little frost bit my servants york feet also frosted and his ps a little however future quixotic entries prove york lost none of his manpower although his genitals were exposed to temperatures lower than degrees below zero few negroes would have remained undamaged in more academic realms york may have been one of the most important expedition members despite the oversighting historians in order to understand this it must be recalled that important guidework was done by the youthful indian wife sacajawea she and her foreign husband frenchcanadian voyageur charbonneau were hired at the mandan villages bright sacajawea with a good speaking knowledge of indian languages also was skilled in universal indian sign language her husband a wandering furtrader had taught his wife his frontier french too charles mackenzie of the thenpowerful northwest fur company explains yorks role a single word to be understood by the party of explorers meeting indian stran gers was required to pass from the natives to the woman sacajawea from the woman to the husband charbonneau from the husband to the negro york from the negro to the captains in the process indian frenchcanadian and english languages were used actually as is seen much of what lewis and clark recorded in their priceless logs was the interpretation of a negro slave when food supplies ran short the expedition cashed in on yorks appeal to indians moreover york was a shrewd and resourceful swapper the log entry of may is typical york and squaw sacajawea proceeded to the indian village on upper kooskookie to get some roots for our party two days later they were home with several bags of roots and indian bread gotten in trades on the second of june york and private mcneal fetched home three bushels of roots and bread when all else failed york had swapped uniform buttons for food his foodgetting ingenuity did not fail even when afloat on the missouri as clark explains york dived off the deck and swam out to a sandbar to gather greens for our dinner and returned with a sufficient quantity of wild cresses or tung grass while doing this york discovered some sauk indians preparing to go on the warpath against the osages not a soldier york nevertheless was given a gun and shot for food use buffalo elk and deer geese ducks and speckled broats he fished oregons winter streams successfully during the pacific layover when meat was hard to get it was during such food forages that york as clark records discovered new wildlife species york would risk his life to rescue companions once on a june day capt clark with charbonneau sacajawea and her infant son were exploring a deep rockbound ravine york was scouting brim areas suddenly a tornadic wind with violent hail and rain struck a flash flood came roaring down the ravine charbonneau always selfish started to scramble up the rocky banks clark shouted for him to give a hand with his wife and backborne baby charbonneau only yelled back for them to hurry up and come along clark managed to get sacajawea atop his shoulder and with the churning waters at his feet began to boost her ahead of himself up the rockfaced banks the commotion had alerted york he dashed through the downpour to the rim and saw the predicament immediately he began slipping down the treacherous face of the ravine until he got alongside the endangered people then in drenching rain york used his powerful physique as a human hoist and a block against slippage soon he was literally dragging the two over the rim saving the indispensable people along with important and historic materials york the log says revived sacajawea with spirits administered from his canteen at other times york had swum mightily alongside improvised craft in treacherous mountain streams he helped with dangerous portages he was a skilled aide with an elkskin line in towing craft or helping others in hazardous alpine climbing when a homemade canoe pirogue or bullboat capsized he was the first in the water to rescue irreplaceable gear and records the warmth of yorks personality is shown by his funmaking with indian kids he spoofed that he was once a wild monster until capt clark caught me and tamed me whereupon he would start stalking off the kids swarming after him suddenly he would whirl bare his teeth and roar terrifically the kids scattered screaming in mock fear then pied piperfashion they would regroup and trail york until he would pull the same frightening gag often he would let kids wet a finger and try to rub off the black paint from a white man or dance endlessly for them when the explorers returned to st louis capt clark gave york his freedom what happened thereafter is vague and unproven one historian says clark provided his former slave with a freighting business near louisville so he could be near his slave wife zenas leonard furtrader and adventurer of says york became a negro chieftain of the crow indians near todays yellowstone park york returned he says to this frontier from missouri about knowing white mans ways and many languages chief york has four wives with whom he lives alternately and enjoys he says perfect peace and satisfaction he became skilled in furtrading yorks death some say occurred in albemarle county virginia by freezing others say he died of cholera in tennessee en route to st louis to see capt clark one date given is late december since his death no one up to this day has fittingly memorialized yorks contribution to our countrys history but on the record there is a wonderful tribute by the nez perce indians who invested him with the name tsemooktsemook totokean black indian they said simply that of all the men in the famous expedition york was the man with the biggest medicine why racism hurts law enforcement the police officer should not be guided by public sentiment in the performance of duty he should be guided by firmness fairness and impartiality it is certain that if duty is performed in a manner commensurate with these standards it will meet with public approval and commendation firmness does not mean belligerence the former is characteristic of good policing and the latter is characteristic of bad policing it is essential that the police officer act with such firmness and resolution as is necessary to deal with any given situation unless he does so it is impossible for him to command the respect that is essential to keeping the peace however he should avoid assuming an attitude that would create hostility in the minds of either those involved or onlookers the police are only one source among several that must be utilized if we would master the problem of human relations and minimize the consequences of minoritygroup tension often the police are unjustly accused of aggravating and promoting tension this arises out of their crucial and necessary constant involvement in incidents threatening public order it is likely that the police will continue to be the butt of much undeserved criticism and attack they will be damned both for what they do and what they do not do they are like minority groups a convenient scapegoat for those who have failed to accept their responsibilities in coping with major social problems they will attempt as do frustrated and insecure groups generally to deny their own failures and shortcomings by blaming the police we have noted that the police can do much to avoid this criticism however their central role in the protection and securing of civil liberties makes them a rallying point in the mobilization of all the forces of the community the police can do much to indicate the responsibility of related community elements and at the same time to bring about more public support in times of crisis the mobilization of constructive community elements to deal with tension is first an informal task the police department is in an unusual position to spot those localities where tension is rising and to make known the fact in responsible circles here it would be well to utilize the vast network and coverage of the police force in reporting the state of mind of the community every patrolman should be required to record all incidents involving minoritygroup relations in his experience these should be reported as a matter of form and cleared in the central offices of the police department such a record might include the following items what took place what appears to have set off the incident where did it take place who were the parties to the dispute and what others were involved other details this information should be carefully examined by supervisory personnel these supervisors should in turn alert their subordinate officer the same type of report could be made available from other strategic agencies with a similar citywide coverage such strategically located persons as school teachers community workers ministers transportation employees housing directors and social workers with officials of the police department would offer comprehensive and important information on tensions and possible developments informed contacts make possible a complete and rounded picture of the communitys condition incidents nearly always occur in public and quasipublic places the police officer who has established friendly contacts with key individuals in his locality local business men tavern owners pool room operators etc can be constantly informed by them as to incidents of this kind it is absolutely essential that police officers keep close tab on the activities of juvenile gangs since it is out of the predatory acts of such groups that many of the most serious incidents of racial friction arise the experience of minority groups with police authorities has not always been a happy one indeed the negro has had good reason to look with suspicion and fear upon the uniformed officer the police authorities should not be lawenforcement officials as we know them only with reference to the white community the police officer must treat negroes in such a manner that they will be aware of the law as an agent of the entire community the effect of wrongful treatment will cause negroes to carry over the memories of their past experience to the detriment of the whole community the only manner in which the confidence of all groups can be won is by impartial and rigorous enforcement of the law absolute impartiality requires that the law be enforced against all violators the idea that race creed or nationality are extenuating factors permitting different applications of the law must be abandoned equal justice is not merely a term the police officer who is tempted to vary his role according to personal notions as to the worth of various groups is himself in violation of the law an officer has a capacity for delivering equal justice only to the extent that he has this problem under control an unwitting evidence of an officers inadequacy is the persistent use of insulting terms such as jig nigger kike or wop an individual may insist that such a usage is not meant to be offensive such an explanation is lacking in insight for such terms are the symbols of offense and they are violently resented by the persons so labeledprotestations of impartiality mean nothing to an individual who has been so addressed to the injured person the very process of labeling means that the victims right to be treated as an individual has been violated he has been classified in terms to suggest that he enjoys only an inferior or secondclass status the use of such terms must be scrupulously avoided unequal law enforcement also has the effect of encouraging a concentration of questionable activities in certain areas these in turn become associated with the minority groups among whom they become lodged much of the commercialized vice is foisted upon the colored community by virtue of the larger communitys willingness to permit such activities to flourish there to deliberately permit questionable activities to become concentrated among certain minority groups is not only to invite the corruption of that group but it further aggravates the problem of the police in dealing with that group a good standard of fairness would be treatment of the individual in the same manner as the police officer would desire to be treated if he were the individual and the other party the police officer a good reputation for fairness in dealing with the public is an invaluable asset to a police department because it instills public confidence making police work more pleasant and effective acts of partiality are likely to result from excitement excitement in turn may be caused by any happening that would shock a normal individual he must remember that he is not a participant and must refrain from taking sides he is a law enforcement officer and must remain cool and deliberate he is interested in facts and causes which he proceeds to ascertain being very careful to follow the facts wherever they lead him and to treat everyone just the same there is no more important element in disturbing the confidence of minority groups in the enforcement of the law and building up resentment against the police authority than reports of brutality modem police science has long abandoned extreme and repressive measures in dealing with law violators furthermore it is a fundamental tenet of american law that a citizen is to be regarded as innocent until proven guilty correspondingly brutal police methods are especially disturbing since they presume the guilt of persons who may be innocent it is a mistake for a police officer to conceive of his relationship with a member of a minority group as an affair which concerns only himself and an individual minority group members invariably recite their experiences with the police in the community it follows that an instance of police brutality becomes identified with the entire police force and the whole minority group becomes hostile to all policemen each police officer as the uniformed symbol of the law is constantly shaping the attitudes and opinions of minority groups toward the apparatus of law enforcement hence while police brutality may subdue a given individual it at the same time creates hostility in the rest of the community toward the entire police force in some police circles there exists the mistaken notion that the most effective police officers for minority group communities are those who know how to handle the negro this usually connotes the use of forceful and repressive measures by an individual police officer concerning which no questions will be asked experience has proven how mistaken this is the entire police force suffers as a result of the brutal measures of an individual officer the true victims of police brutality are the police themselves since it develops widespread hostility and disrespect for law among the members of the minority group the power that men are permitted to exercise over their fellow men is rigidly limited by the laws of the community nevertheless men desire power and it is nowhere more obvious than in the unbridled actions of a mob it is incredible but true that a mob can derive a kind of satisfac tion out of beating up members of a minority group burning their homes and pillaging their places of business the members of a mob receive from these acts a sense of personal satisfaction this is related to their ordinary helplessness and feelings of unimportance in their everyday lives for the one fleeting moment of a mobs existence its members gain a false sense of personal power they have a passing chance to exercise control and take things into their own hands anyone who has seen a mob in action is well aware that it overrides reason its sense of power is like a tidal wave that sweeps over all who would resist it in addition to the adult insecurities and frustrations there are more intimate and personal experiences of childhood which affect men children often carry into adulthood the effects of damaging childhood experience the alarming amounts of adult insanity and general neurotic and unstable behavior have been partly attributed to unfortunate childhood experiences psychiatrists have pointed out that much hostile behavior in the form of race hatred and prejudice can be traced directly to childhood difficulties it is these highly emotional and excitable individuals who play a large part in crowd and mob behavior they communicate their own personal excitement to others and thus help to organize itthere are always available at any moment and in any gathering a large number of individuals such as we have described they are ready at the slightest provocation to vent their own feeling in the form of aggressive and hostile acts toward the scapegoat minority groups frustrated and insecure individuals numerous as they are are ready and willing to search out others who can be blamed for their shortcomings and failures incitement to racial tension and disturbance comes not only from the extreme right but from the extreme left as well it is important to recognize the sense in which race has become a weapon in mobilizing groups against one another in the interest of other issues which may be concealed from the minority or majority groups themselves hence the police must always be prepared to deal with artificially created incidents as well as those which develop naturally the police must here be doubly cautious since the moods and sympathies of the contending groups are played upon by persons who are calculating and deliberate if the police do not act carefully in the protection of individual rights and in complete impartiality they may become the goat in the situation and play directly into the hands of those who are deliberately fomenting racial antagonisms impartial enforcement of the law and impartial treatment of the public are essential in our society operation roadblock committee y yi the citizens commit ml mv j s o tee for employment has been getting jobs for men leaving the cook county illinois jail for the past four years some five years ago the chaplain of the jail spoke at our pta meeting his description of the conditions within the jail and of the plight of the men was so moving that john and i volunteered our services at first we began by collecting books and clothing for the men this of course was easy to do and required no involvement on our part then one day the chaplain told us that if we really wanted to help the men we should try to get jobs for them the beginnings were haphazard the chaplain called us frequently about men whom he wanted to help our mail and telephone calls were filled with requests from men in penal institutions all over the country we had many visitors at the door the need was unquestionably established but we were only two we realized almost immediately the need for a formalized program and a committee of coworkers the committee was organized and the operation formalized in order to let us concentrate on employable men who really wanted and needed a job this meant screening men who were poor employment risks or who had problems too serious to take their places immediately in society with the exception of warden jack johnson and thensheriff joseph lohman who were both extremely cooperative and willing to let us try just about anything we ran into a whole corps of unbelievers the professionals to a man said that we were not trained to work with prisoners the sociologists psychiatrists psychologists did everything but refuse outright to work with us it was true that we could not work in their fields but on the other hand we could see no reason why if we limited ourselves to those men who were good employment risks we couldnt obtain job interviews for them undaunted we began the classification office agreed to select each month men of those being released the ones they felt were the best job risks this selection was based on men who were not psychotic narcotic addicts or alcoholics men who wanted and needed a job we decided our first step would be to get some idea of each persons capabilities we wanted to test them using a test that could be scored by laymen and could be given to the inmates in a group thus facilitating the jails moving of the men from their cells to the testing room we settled on the army beta and the otis and tests as well as elementary and high school tests depending upon the amount of education of the man these tests are noninterpretative and can be scored by anyone the tests are given to the group by one of the members of our committee later they are scored by other members then a group of men from our committee go to the jail and interview individually each of the men the volunteer interviewers are men who are bankers lawyers writers personnel men after a lengthy interview these men ask themselves the question would i hire this man if i were able why or why not our interviewers become very discerning in a short while and we all know we can depend on their judgment this careful processing helps to eliminate our placing any man in a job which he is unable to handle it also protects our program for if a company were to have a bad experience with just one of our men it would be reluctant to take a chance on another now comes the most difficult work obtaining appointments for job interviews for each man these appointments are obtained by women by telephone jobs themselves are hard to find women to locate job openings and then to do the work of persuading employers to interview the men are even hard er to find the time required can often be quite lengthy but so far we have always managed to get an appointment for every man recommended to us and if he can qualify for the job he is hired there are many disappointments sometimes the men dont show up for their interviews sometimes they cant qualify in the type of work they had said they could do but percentagewise and we are working with very small numbers our successes are better than most employment agencies participation in our program is advantageous to the employer too we know so much about our men we can give potential employers more information than they learn from their standard interviewing of men at the gate thus they take less risk than with average applicants we also claim to have opened up a new labor field because we confined ourselves to one area where we knew we could produce results we have been able to establish ourselves securely in this institution this brings results beyond the jobs we have found for a couple of hundred exprisoners let me give two instances of these further results we have persuaded a few companies to revise their hiring policies toward exprisoners and of course this is a continuing effort with other companies our effectiveness on this is in indirect relationship to the experience we have as to the workableness of hiring properly screened exprisoners experience we can draw on in discussions with personnel executivesand their top management without experience we would have little effect on these men a recent specific instance of further results is a justcompleted study it is an important study that will be very valuable to us in our future work and to others in the field too we had become interested in job training for the prisoners before their release in order to discover accurately what the potential for this is a university sociologist developed for us an intensive sevenhourlong test to be given to a large group of men at the time they are admitted to the jail we were able to do this test because we had the cooperation of jail officials my point is we could have interested these officials in the study if we had not already been established in the institution known to them and having their confidence because we had been working with them for years and performing a service helpful to them and the men for whom they are responsible the main thing our work has taught us is that ordinary citizens can definitely change institutions in their community when this becomes necessary however there are a few rules of thumb to follow ones that fit the seejudgeact formula see when people begin to study the needs of a local institution such as the jail many areas needing improvement and correc tion come into focus the institution must be observed closely to see exactly what these areas are judge then an evaluation should be made as to how and in what area these people can best serve the institution act concentrated successful effort in one area however small produces far more results than scattered efforts on several or all areas that need correction a person or a committee trying to address itself to all the needs becomes a research committee which still leaves the actual correctional work undone reprinted from community white house story not since mary todd lincolns dressmaker caused a national uproar almost years ago have the published memoirs of a former white house staffer created the kind of furore stirred up by the bestselling tidbits of the little washington d c seamstress lillian rogers parks published early last spring mrs parks my thirty years backstairs at the white house parted the backdoor curtains on a view of life at pennsylvania avenue which the important guests who enter by the front door could never expect to know the publics enthusiastic reception of mrs parks newsy white house gossip swept the book onto national best seller lists and kept it there for several months it was one of the five best selling books published in the best seller of all books published by the fleet publishing company and still a good seller in the bookshops a year after its initial publication fleet editor oscar collier said that excerpts from my thirty years backstairs at the white house have appeared in some newspapers in the united states and in france switzerland finland belgium and holland portions of the book also were published in negro digest july paperback rights to the book were sold to avon books for because of the rash of similar books appearing on the heels of mrs parks reminiscences fleet agreed for the paperback edition to come out in november rather than three months later both versions of the book are selling well mrs parks success far outstripped that of her th century predecessor elizabeth hobbs keckley whose behind the scenes or thirty years a slave and four years in the white house was published in because mrs keckleys book revealed intimate details of the life of president and mrs lincoln the book was suppressed temporarily by the murdered presidents son robert although no effort was made to suppress mrs parks memoirs steps were taken to make such future publications less likely the white house issued a directive that domestic personnel would be forbidden from publishing such books in the future there is nothing particularly scandalous in my thirty years backstairs at the white house but the glimpses the book gives of some of the tenants of the white house are not always flattering for instance after applauding bess trumans relationship with the servants the former maidseamstress takes a polite slap at two other former first ladies she mrs truman didnt keep looking over her shoulder as mrs eisenhower did mrs parks wrote and she didnt ignore the work that was done as mrs roosevelt did mrs truman was the most considerate first lady in recent decades the strange customs of some foreign visitors and some particularly amusing diplomatic booboos are described by mrs parks as well as some of the more dangerous hazardssuch as assassination attemptsof life in the nations number one household even the fabled white house ghosts come in for some considered attention in mrs parks light and frothy book the author of this runaway best seller is not a professional author and it was with the able assistance of collaborator frances spatz leighton a veteran washington correspondent that the book was written however mrs parks had been encouraged by her mother who before her death also was a white house maid for thirty years to jot down notes toward a view of someday developing them into a book the book is dedicated to her mother maggie rogers now that the book is a fact mrs parks is busy compiling notes for a possible second try at authoring i see so many changes here in my city she said i think there is much to tell recently i was two blocks from the white house and it was amazing to see the large mansions coming down all the old landmarks will soon be gone it makes me feel very sad because it is taking some of my best memories away in the year since her book first appeared lillian rogers parks has been almost constantly in the public spotlight in the process of promoting the book she has made trips to new york two to the west coastwith stops in cleveland chicago and new mexico she has made almost television appearances about the same number of radio shows and has been featured at a number of autograph parties and lectures when it is considered that little lillianas she was affectionately known at the white house is a whole inch under five feet tall and has to use crutches to get about she was crippled by polio while a child her schedule over the past year has been truly remarkable despite all the feverish activity and a continuing flood of mail and phone calls from readers mrs parks insists that her life has not really been changed substantially i still cook my own meals wash iron press clothes and clean she said i dont have time to make my clothes but i do alterations on all that i buy perhaps her new routine seems less revolutionary than it is because keeping busy is natural with her i read as much as possible even when i watch tv she explained i just must be doing two or three things at the same time i have very little social life i visit old friends on the phone or we see each other for lunch or dinner occasionally what has she missed most since the end of her tour of duty as white house seamstress for such a demure little lady the answer is surprising all the races that i intended to see when i retired she smiles shyly i simply love horses by bernice davis a man who goes to bed a y drunk begets a daughr tershakespeare there is little dispute that the bard of avon m l or the victims of his thievery possessed a keen perception of human behavior and apparently a very poor knowledge of human biology sex predetermination has long been a favorite topic for oracles sorcerers and old wivesoh yes and parents too with the feudal and medieval laws of inheritance and particularly with respect to the enthroned royalties the question of the sex of an unborn often unconceived child was of prime importance even today the emphasis upon a male heir has been noted in some regal bed chambers the pride in the continuation of the family name is the basis for many fathers quest for a son the mendelian laws of hereditary distribution were not known until the past century and as does often happen in the absence of scientific fact and knowledge old wives tales became widely known and accepted although most of these superstitions are merely fancies of the imagination some have been scientifically investigated and a few have been found to have some logical basis preference surveys indicate most couples would like to have a boy as their first child and these same people are just as anxious that the second child be a girl in the days of aristotle they could have their druthersfor everyone knew the first egg produced a boy and the second a girl the ancient biologists neglected to specify whether the first egg to which they referred was the first egg produced or the first egg fertilized here we have what is perhaps the grand daddy of the origin of the ovum theories which have received some serious scientific attention since this theory states that the sex of a child is determined by the origin left or right ovary of the egg on the other hand some contended it was the origin of the sperm and they were on the right track which con trolled the sex factor confusion reigned when the wrong ovary and testicle were matched but boys and girls were born all the same in the literature and legends of the world many folklore superstitions regarding sex predetermination are recorded a prospective bride of palau island has often been admonished to wear mens clothing to bed the night before her wedding in order to present her husband with a son as the first born in sweden a baby boy was taken to bed by the bride if she wished her first child to be male other tales warn that if a brides garter hurts on her wedding day she will bear only girls should the newlywed couple upon leaving the church be greeted first by a male their first child would be male too according to new england folklore a man could help determine the sex of a child by taking a doll for a girl to bed or for a boy wearing his boots or hat during coitus which brings to mind an old georgia legend that if you want a hen to hatch pullets put the eggs from the hen under a young girls bonnet the koreans believed that by turning a certain stone around once a boy would be born into the family many knew when a mother gave birth to a child on the waxing moon her next child would be of the same sex there were theories which insisted the younger the mother the greater the chances of begetting a son and in the same vein if the husband were older than his wife the possibility of a son was increased some thought the intensity of relations during conception affected the sex of the fetus while others maintained that the child would acquire the sex of the parent who had most ardently desired the baby it is very characteristic to find similar folktales in which requisites or results are reversed this last theory is a contradictory variation of starkweathers law of crossheredity the sex of the child conceived will be the opposite of the sex of the stronger parent the hypothesis does not seek to define the form of strengthmuscular virility character longevity desire before the universalor almost soacceptance of the idea that sex as all traits was determined at conception people believed the sex of the unborn child could be influenced by the diet of the mother undernourished women naturally gave birth to young tadpoles eating lots of meat and other protein foods would insure a male heir while mother gooses sugar n spice would produce a girl a news items from iran called attention to the fact that the shahs wife farah had included many nuts and herbs in her diet during her pregnancy it would seem to have had some coincidental bearing upon the recent birth of the long awaited heir to the thronea french physician dr drelincourt published in text in in which he described over common superstitions about sex predetermination these the good doctor held to be pure bunk and proceeded to expound a theory of his own whereupon someone was wont to note that the number of foolish ideas regarding the regulation of the sex of unborn children had now been increased by one not entirely in the realm of folklore are the interesting figures collected by statisticians regarding certain conditions which seemingly are more conducive to the conception of either sex perhaps the idea that if a man spends much time in the sun he will beget a daughter can be traced to a survey of children born to greenhouse workers figures indicate the number of male births increases and supersedes the number of girls immediately after wars insufficient feeding breeds more male tadpoles than female frogs were told according to one figure finder who did his research in buenos aires argentina around parents of mixed racial strains produced more boys than girls many undoubtedly in disgust finally gave up any hope of choosing the sex of unborn children and were content with early determination of the sex of the fetus once it was thought pains on the left or right side indicated a female child obviously an offshoot of the ovarian folklore more of this idea is carried over in some of the french folk medicine if the right breast of the woman were larger than the left or if she threw her right leg forward in walking a boy was to be born it is said some doctors suspended rocks by string or used their pocket watch to determine sex if the object were noted to swing in a pendulum arc or clockwise the mother could expect a boy contrary wise a circular or counterclockwise motion indicated a girl one person currently engaged in medical research claims a similar method is used with a great deal of success the motion or nonmotion of a suspended magnet determines the sex of newly born mice a cornwall legend determined sex by using a shoulder of mutton but pig has been reported from other areas one was to clean all the meat from the shoulder at the evening meal then the blade was held to the fire until scorched using the thumbs a hole was made through which cord was passed the bone was then hung over the kitchen door accordingly the child would be the same sex as the first person exclusive of family members to come through the door if the number of letters in the proper names of the parents and those in the month of conception were added and then divided by seven an odd quotient indicated the child was male some thought the father would be sick the first three months of his wifes pregnancy if the child were a boy during the fourth month one could determine sex by grabbing a cat by the tail and flinging it into the air if the cat landed on its feet the fetus was male even suetonius records that livia mother of the emperor tiberius took an egg from a brood hen and warming it successively in her hands and those of her servants successfully prophesied a male heir when she hatched a finecombed chick in this area too old superstitions have been displaced by modern techniques chemical tests and biological assay methods are helpful in determining fetal sex as early as two weeks after conception a few folktales have found some justification through scientific investigation although in some cases these hypotheses are rejected altogether and in others not widely accepted experimentation of the effect of body temperature the time of mating the time of ovulation the origin of the ovum or sperm and the alkalinity of the vagina have some logical basismore so than stones and phases of the moon couples who have not been successful in childbearing are sometimes advised to try the temperature method based primarily upon investigations with rats this method suggests a definite body temperature pattern which is repeated at regular intervals when the body is at its highest temperature or the female is in heat ovulation occurs this hypothesis of the correlation between body temperature and ovulation serves as the experimental basis for the effects of temperature time of mating and time of ovulation theories regarding sex determination but if you are nonplussed by science and newfangled ideas and that first child or the sixth after five girls must be a boy then furnish the bride with a baby boy and a complete outfit of mens clothing on her prewedding night time coitus to occur about one and a half to two hours following maximum body temperature present the husband with a fine pair of riding boots insure the sobriety and strength of the maleand keep him out of the sunthen take what nature gives you altruism is certainly f fashionable in present dealings with the un derdeveloped world however when they are approached with a plan to help them africans and asians are just as likely to wonder whats in the deal for the other party one small business firmoverseas regional surveys associatesis having a run of success in africa by having ready a somewhat disarming answer to the question money it is owned and managed by two young men howard imbrey forty a former u s foreignservice officer who served in india and ethiopia and thomas goodman thirtysix a onetime explorer in southeast asia for a u s museum from a small office suite in manhattan they have initiated more than two dozen americanafrican enterprises with profitable results for both sides the modus operandi is deceptively simple an african with or a substantial sum in much of africa is advised by these americans to start a small local manufacturing or processing business preferably making a product that heretofore had to be imported readymade the americans match the africans capital purchase the necessary equipment teach him how to operate it and get in return per cent of the ventures shares the african businessman is then left in complete control of his own operation getting advice only when he asks for it and selling his product in the manner traditional to the area in which he is doing business typical of the operation is overseas regionals arrangement with the unegbe brothers in ibadan nigeria learning that the unegbes had a few thousand dollars they wanted to invest in securities imbrey and goodman convinced the two african brothers that they should put their money in a local manufacturing business of their own they suggested it should have something to do with bicycles easily the no form of transportation in urbanized africa after a week of research howard imbrey asked the unegbe brothers what they thought of making rearend carriers for bicycles these parts were then being imported from europe and japan a little pencil work showed that would have to be raised to get the whole project under way the unegbes put up and overseas regional furnished the other meanwhile goodman was busy on the phone to japan ordering thin iron rods the only raw material the new project needed in order to start production a secondhand machine for bending and shaping the rods was located in west germany and a welder from england was hired to teach local help how to operate and maintain the machine in november unegbe brothers ltd went into production its bicycle carriers won immediate acceptance because of their low price made possible at imbreys suggestion by replacing chrome with paint and by doing away with packaging altogether another of the carriers charms was that it was designed to fit both the back and front of the bicycle after less than six months of operation the company was showing a profit at that point the nigerian brothers got in touch with imbrey to ask for advice about expansion into other products his advice stay with bicycle accessories but make a greater variety once more the initial equipment was purchased by the new yorkers a short training period was arranged and unegbe took it from there today the unegbes who own per cent of the stock and are per cent in charge of their companys management arrange deonly this time with wax candles between us we founded congolon co on he bought the bulk wax and we bought the dipping equipment n goodman and imbrey are now running into competition as other small firms similarly delve into africa at the same time the experience of such small operations is bound to encourage larger u s firms to look to manufacturing opportunities in the area but the two men are little worried about such competition says imbrey by the time a major american company gets through making surveys calling in consultants who have never heard of africa negotiating bank loans analyzing their market potential and i dont know what else well have been there and gone leaving an african company making or adapting their product bebehind us has organized labor failed the negro worker n the late nineteen thirties and early forties during the phenomenal rise of the congress of industrial organizations there was a great hope for negroes within organized labor with the rapid growth of industrial unions in the basic mass production sectors of the economy where tens of thousands of colored workers in steel automobile rubber and packinghouse plants joined cio unions on the basis of equality there was reason to hope that the old line afl craft union tradition of racial exclusion and segregation would be thrust aside in the forward surge of the new industrial unions but unfortunately the course of events i n the past decade and especially since the merger clearly indicates that the social consciousness of the industrial unions with their sensitivity to the problems of the negro wage earner have now all but totally vanished instead trade unions are responding like other conservative institutions in american society to the new demands of the negro for full equality and recognition of individual ability in the early years of the s the leadership of the cio repeatedly joined with the negro community in publicly condemning the vicious racism of several major afl unions when they abused negro workers this occurred for example when the international brotherhood of electrical workers upon becoming the collective bargaining agent at the bauer electric company in hartford connecticut demanded that all negro electricians be dismissed from their jobs as negroes could not be admitted into membership when the boilermakers union forced negro workers out of their jobs in several shipyards and the similar action of the international association of machinists at the boeing aircraft company plant in seattle in its time the national cio filed amicus curiae briefs in support of litigation initiated by negroes and assisted in a variety of ways the protests of colored workers against the operating railroad brotherhoods and other discriminatory labor organizations but this has long since come to an end the industrial union bloc in the aflcio hardly differentiates itself from meany and the building trades council on racial issues the leadership of the industrial union department remained silent when randolph as the spokesman for negro trade unionists was repeatedly attacked by meany and they voted with the rest of the aflcio executive council in denouncing randolph and in rejecting proposals to eliminate discrimination and segregation in affiliated unions in addition many of the former cio unions have themselves compromised especially in the south with antinegro practices it appears that on racial issues the industrial unions have made their peace with the narrow and bigoted afl craft tradition there was a time when they challenged that tradition but today they remain silent and acquiesce as organized labor becomes more conservative and rigid unable to organize vast new industries and basing itself upon an increasingly small and limited section of the work force in the united states the aflcio has greatly compromised the social objectives declared at the time of the merger in and in addition has not realized the basic collective bargaining goals it set for itself at that time thus today the militant negro worker is confronted not with a trade union movement that is a force for social change but on the contrary with a national labor organization that has become a very conservative and highly bureaucratized institution closely allied in many cities and states to reactionary political forces and defending that status quo which is now directly attacked by the negro in virtually every area of american life a significant manifestation of organized labors conservatism on noneconomic issues is the rigidity of antinegro practices in many important unions the refusal to yield on racial matters to bitterly resist change in the status of negroes is responsible for the fact that today many trade unions lag behind the progress made by other institutions in the community in east st louis illinois and tulsa oklahoma for example negro children attend integrated schools during the day but their parents attend segregated union meetings at night if they are admitted into labor unions at all recently a philip randolph called for a crusade to desgregate the southern aflcio state conventions and city central bodies and stated that this is a problem probably not less significant or difficult than the desegregation of public schools in the south there is a deep distrust among many negro wage earners and others within the negro community toward trade unions it is a distrust well founded on experience for today as in the past there is a profound disparity between the public image presented by the national aflcio and the daytoday realities as experienced by many negro workers this is true in the north as well as in the south there are some few exceptions especially in the mass production industries where historically there has been a large concentration of negro workers and in some unions such as the united automobile workers uaw and the united packing house workers upw where there is an ideological sensitivity to the negro question but for the negro in major areas of the economy in the building and construction trades the railroad industry among the boilermakers oil and chemical workers and machinists in pulp tobacco and paper manufacturing in metal working in the printing trades and in many other industries highly unionized for a long period of time trade union practices are characterized by a broad pattern of discrimination and segregation the pattern of union responsibility for job discrimination against negroes is not limited to any one area of the country or to some few industries or union jurisdictions but involves many unions in a wide variety of occupations in manufacturing industries skilled crafts railroads and in maritime trades as for example the seafarers international union which operates union controlled hiring halls on great lakes ports such as duluth chicago detroit buffalo and cleveland over the years negro members of the seafarers international union have repeatedly protested the systematic practice of dispatching negroes for menial jobs only as mess boys in the galley but to no avail as the union continues discriminatory job assignments in its hiring halls on occasion after much protest one or two negroes have been admitted into an allwhite local union as token compliance with a state or municipal fair employment practices law as with the international brotherhood of electrical workers in cleveland the bricklayers in milwaukee the railway clerks in minneapolis but this is essentially a limited and strategic adjustment to community pressure and represents very dubious progress after six years of protest and the threat of legal action by the attorney general ibew local in washington d c gave one negro a temporary work permit the ibew in most cases excludes negroes from membership in the key local unions having jurisdiction in construction installation thus because ibew local in washington refuses membership to nonwhite persons negroes were prevented from working on the construction of the aflcio national headquarters building the new house of representatives office building and other public and private construction in the nations capital local remains a lilywhite union there are also many instances where unions have removed the lilywhite exclusion clause from their constitution as a public relations gesture but continue to exclude negroes from membership by tacit consent as long as union membership remains a condition of employment in many trades and crafts and qualified negroes are barred from union membership solely because of their color then trade union discrimination is the decisive factor in determining whether negro workers in a given industry shall have an op portunity to earn a living for themselves and their families this is especially true in the construction industry where aflcio building trades unions exercise a high degree of control over access to employment in the south and especially in alabama and georgia this situation is further compounded by the fact that white citizens councils and the ku klux klan began taking control of some important aflcio affiliates soon after the supreme court school segregation decision in following the federations practice of avoiding internal conflict on racial issues these local unions have been permitted to become virtual extensions of segregationist organizations white citizens councils kkk and other racist organizations make no secret of their recruitment activities among union members negro members have only to read the local newspapers in montgomery and savannah the ku klux klan advertises its meetings in the carpenters union hall and in these two cities as well as in others officials of several building trades unions are known klansmen newspapers have also printed reports and pictures of union officials speaking at white citizens councils and klan meetings and the point has hardly been lost on the negro worker during the yearlong negro bus boycott in montgomery alabama leaders of the montgomery building trades council and of the montgomery bus drivers union repeatedly led the attacks against the negro community and on several occasions were identified as klansmen in macon georgia the klan meets in a local union hall and has repeatedly intervened on behalf of white workers where there have been grievances filed by negroes alleging violation of seniority and other rights by white workers in savannah the carpenters union hall is the central headquarters for the white citizens council and is so listed in newspaper ads placed by the council the same situation obtains in lithonia georgia where the kkk and the stonecutters union share the same meeting hall no wonder then that negro workers throughout the south feel increasingly alienated from organized labor recently they have shown this by voting against union certification in several significant elections conducted by the national labor relations board aflcio affiliated unions engage in four categories of discriminatory racial practices these are outright exclusion of negroes segregated locals separate racial seniority lines in collective bargaining agreements exclusion of negroes from apprenticeship training programs controlled by unions the brotherhood of railway and steamship clerks which operates many segregated local lodges in northern as well as southern cities is among the important international unions responsible for a i broad national pattern of segregation in the brotherhood the existence of more than segregated allnegro locals with separate racial seniority rosters limits job mobility and violates the seniority rights of thousands of negro union members this union has persisted in its racist practices despite repeated protests from negro workers and community organizations on april the new york state commission against discrimination ordered the merger of the lilywhite george m harrison lodge and the allnegro friendship lodge the white union refused to comply and the local lodges remain segregated to this day similar situations exist in chicago where negro workers are in segregated local lodge and in tulsa oklahoma where they are in local lodge in east st louis and st louis there are allcolored lodges and allwhite lodges which function through segregated joint councils ironically the president of the brotherhood of railway and steamship clerks george m harrison is a member of the civil_rights committee of the aflcio and a federation vice president soon after the merger of the afl and cio in two international unions were admitted into the federation with lilywhite exclusion clauses in their constitutions although this action was clearly in violation of the policies an nounced at the time of the merger agreement they were the brotherhood of railroad trainmen which later removed the clause and the international brotherhood of locomotive firemen and enginemen which did not in november the brotherhood of locomotive firemen and enginemen successfully defended its exclusion of negroes from union membership in a suit brought by negro firemen against the union in the federal district court in cincinnati ohio oliphant vs brotherhood of locomotive firemen and enginemen despite many appeals the national aflcio refused to intervene or make any public comment and this union continues to exclude all negroes from membership on october negro workers in st petersburg florida and memphis tennessee filed affidavits with the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity against the brotherhood of railway trainmen aflcio in these complaints it was charged that the trainmens union conspired with the atlantic coast line railroad and with the st louissan francisco railroad company as well as with other railroads to have all negro brakemen classified as porters that competent negro railway workers are consistently denied opportunities for promotion and advancement that because of improper job classification they are discrimi nated against in wages and that the brotherhood of railroad trainmen a union that is authorized and recognized by the atlantic coast line railroad is a lilywhite union and that said union accepts only white employees as members obviously when the brothererhood of railroad trainmen removed the caucasian only clause from its constitution in this was done mainly for public relations purposes since the union continues in most cities to exclude qualified negro railroad employees separate lines of seniority promotion constitute yet another injustice to the negro worker these are negotiated into collective bargaining agreements effectively denying negroes equal seniority rights with white workers and preventing them from developing skills the result is that negroes are unable to rise from unskilled and menial jobs into more desirable classifications negro workers employed at the sheffield steel company in houston texas were forced to initiate litigation against the united steelworkers of america and the company and as a result succeeded in eliminating the most extreme features of the separate seniority lines in the union contract very slow and isolated progress has been made in a few other instances as a result of protest by negro workers and action by the naacp nevertheless the fact remains that the pattern of such discrimination remains practically intact in southern industrial operations where trade unions hold collective bargaining agreements many thousands of negro workers who are members of aflcio unions in southern paper mills chemical plants pulp works oil refineries steel plants and in tobacco factories suffer the acute disadvantage of separate lines of progression in lake charles louisiana for example the metal trades department of the aflcio is directly responsible for negotiating such clauses in its union contracts with several major oil and chemical refineries collusion with management in regard to unequal seniority rights is common typical offenders in the rapidly growing paper manufacturing and pulp and sulphite industry in the south are to be found at the huge union bagcamp paper corporation savannah georgia where all the negro workers are limited to membership in two segregated locals local and affiliated to the international brotherhood of pulp sulphite and paper mill workers all white workers hold membership in local and of the same union and local of the united papermakers and paperworkers union similar conditions exist at and in virtually every plant organized in the south by the united papermakers and paperworkers union and the international brotherhood of pulp sulphite and paper mill workers in these and many other paper mills throughout the south these two unions hold joint collective bargaining agreements and maintain a rigid pattern of racially segregated local unions with separate seniority lines limiting negro employment to laborer classifications the harmful consequences of rapid technological change and automation upon the unskilled negro wage earner is compounded by the exclusion of negroes from apprenticeship training programs because there exists a disproportionate number of negroes in the unskilled labor force a disproportionate number of negroes are being permanently dismissed from jobs as a result of automation and other technological change it follows that the plight of these unskilled negroes can become an economic disaster for the entire negro community where these workers are not permitted to learn new skills ie where they are excluded from apprenticeship programs and other forms of technical training such exclusion is widespread in the north as well as in the south according to recent studies no significant breakthrough has been made by negroes in those craft unions in the building trades or in the railroad operating brotherhood which have traditionally excluded nonwhites in the tenyear period from in the state of new york the increase of negro participation in building trades apprenticeship training programs rose only from to in most of these programs the role of the labor union is decisive because the trade union usually determines who is admitted into the training programs and therefore who is admitted into the union almost equally exclusive are the printing trades unions with exceptions being found in some areas of the assistant printing pressmens union and the lithographers union open access to plumbing and pipe fitting apprenticeships controlled by the plumbers union is a rare experience for a young negro in the north as well as in the south similarly negro youth are almost completely excluded from apprenticeship programs operated by the sheet metal workers union the ornamental and structural iron workers the glass workers the tile setters the machinists and the bricklayers union the exclusion of negroes from apprenticeship programs controlled by aflcio craft unions prevents thousands of young people from realizing their full potential and dooms them and their families to a marginal existence it is in this area of apprenticeship training that the disparity between the public relations pronouncements of the aflcio on civil_rights and the daytoday reality for negro workers is most sharply delineated many traditional sources of negro employment the nations railroads and massproduction in dustries for example are rapidly disappearing as a result of automation and other technological changes in the economy today the status of the negro wage earner is characterized by drastic change and crisis thus the virtual exclusion of negroes from apprenticeship and other training programs forces them to remain as marginal employees in the economy they are the ones who are hired last and who can be dispensed with easily with the added advantage that their displacement can be rationalized in terms of lower attainments in craft skills the concentration of unskilled lowpaying jobs with a lack of employment stability together with other income limitations such as denial of access to union hiring halls in the building trades and separate racial lines of seniority promotion in collective bargaining agreements all contribute to an explanation of why negroes constitute a permanently depressed economic group in american society in the dramatic and historic conflicts in little rock in front royal virginia in tuscaloosa in montgomery and elsewhere organized labor did not meaningfully intervene on the side of the embattled negroes all too often local labor groups were involved with the white citizens council or the ku klux klan this fact has not been overlooked by the negro leadership and by the entire negro community whose views on organized labor are not based on any theoretical assumptions about a mythical trade union movement but are rooted in the painful realities of daytoday trade union practices of course pious resolutions proclaiming shock and dismay were adopted at labor gatherings in washington miami and new york but no action of any consequence was taken where it really mattered instead when confronted with their conservative and donothing record by negroes the labor leadership invariably responds with hostility or crass paternalism as they privately explain that these negroes are going too fast and after all they should appreciate what we are doing for them the negro is now making the same demands upon organized labor that are being made upon all other institutions and it is certain that the attacks upon racism within trade unions will proceed with the same intensity as against other groups in the community the negro struggle is emerging as the really important and decisive issue of conflict and confrontation throughout the united states and it may be well that the fight of negroes for equal treatment and leadership responsibility within trade unions will become the basis of a renewed effort for internal union democracy and for a halt to further stagnation and decay the protest against racism within organized labor may become the rallying point for the regeneration of the american labor movement if this is to occur it will be the responsibility of the best elements among white trade unionists to join with negroes and vigorously support their demands but for the moment it is evident that the aflcio and all other institutions will be judged by the negro on the basis of their actual daytoday performance and not on the exercise of empty ritual the black anglosaxons to any large j tjtjjtt l city in the united vv states and look for that section where more than per cent of the population is nativeborn when once you have found that section you may safely assume that you are smack dab in the negro ghetto ask the names of the people you meet and you will note that the anglosaxon names now extantjackson brown and johnsonare pretty much the property of the negro inhabitants this is just one of the cues to the identity of a curious but littleknown classblack anglosaxonsnow flourishing in american society if you now proceed until you come to the better negro dwellings known as the homes of the high class or the biggity you will find yourself at last amid the black anglosaxons proper though not all of the high class belong to this tribe black anglosaxons are such chiefly in that in their natural struggle to throw off the smothering blanket of social inferiority they exaggeratedly seek to sever their own historical and social past in order better to assume that of the biological descendants of the anglosaxons they relate to and long to be a part of the elusive and hostile white world whose norms are taken as models of emulation likewise the white world is to them a looking glass for taking stock of their personal behavior they acquire in this way what sociologists call a looking glass self an image they must keep on grooming to make what they think the white society thinks they are accord with what they themselves would like to be more and more like whites for several years now in diverse localities throughout the country i have been subjecting members of this group to casual but intensive observation i have watched them close up in their private lives for many were and are close friends relatives and neighbors as well as in public places from both the private and the public perspective i discovered that black anglosaxons fall into typical categories the imagemakers imagemakers are dithered by their belief that all negroes have to do to break down discrimination is impress the white community with proper public manners and the sincerity of the negroes quest for integration they are constantly fearful lest whites think they are prejudiced against whites or have a preference for negro companionship thus it is more or less mandatory for negroes to spread out when in an integrated gathering to keep whites present from thinking we segregate ourselves points of worry for imagemakers may crop up in many facets of their lives while such groups as italians boast of their spaghetti and meatballs for example negro imagemakers may privately consume huge quantities of lowincome southern foods but disown the practice in public many imagemakers will never buy watermelons when white persons are in sight and i have seen them sit in restaurants mouths watering at unsuspecting whites seated before large red slices of melon which the imagemakers long for but cant bring themselves to buy chitterlings likewise are a basis for hypocrisy although some of the best chitterlings still are to be found in negro kitchens the black anglosaxon housewife typically seeks to hide her appetite for them most take extreme pains to safeguard knowledge of their menu from neighbors this is especially so in integrated apartment dwellings such other staples as mustard greens and blackeyed peas also are privately enjoyed but publicly shunned before whites the mimics or copycats close kin of the imagemakers mimics are especially prevalent among school teachers and white collar workers they chronically mimic white mannerisms in the quest for a feeling of similarity or closeness to their white ideal a white accent for example is to them honorific because it is taken to represent a high degree of association with the better class of whites in the effort to talk like a white person mimics effect a snarl or twang imitative of whites when talking publicly or to strangers though if you listen long enough you are likely to hear an i pronounced ah plus other telltale signs of their lowly southern origins this enthusiasm for aping white behavior pervades the most personal intimacies of their lives married mimics for example are prone to hold up white men or white women as ideals to their mates when a male mimics wife does something that bothers him he is likely to tell her wouldnt nothing do that but a colored woman by the same token when a female mimic is peeved by her spouse she also talks about his heredity or makes the declaration that his type is no account in general anyway the cultured with the increasing value of education in society and the rising educational attainment of negroes the importance of the college degree has soared to the highest some social scientists detect a degree class those individuals who derive their prestige from the sole fact that they hold degrees but inasmuch as such persons typically are employed as school teachers social workers and church pastors their salaries are often lower than such uneducated negroes as the steel mill hands this leads to some dilemmas and resentments every janitor for example has found it necessary at some time or another to tell off some of the high class tenants for trying to boss him around the degree class is seldom interested in scholarly matters however except superficially books in fact would seldom enter their homes were it not for bookofthemonth clubs even this is no guarantee that the books will be read yet those of the homeowning variety are beginning to acquire studies usually equipped with plush bar facilities relaxing couch and a small book stand conspicuously placed and containing a couple of shelves of textbooks salvaged from college days the chief activities performed in these studies are drinking cat naps and lounging called relaxing in that order at a typical house party of educators a budding discussion will quickly disperse the inhabitants of one room into another where they may resume their efforts to learn the latest teenage dance crazes such as the madison the twist and the chachacha it is true that the twist has demonstrated some capacity for arousing the energies of most negro and white adults but its acceptance by the whites is taken by the black anglosaxon as an irreproachable justification for his own enthusiasm was she a negro or an old white man really made me mad today thus many are able to grow up and take pleasure in the boast that they never knew there was a difference made between negroes and whites until they got grown or reached the age of say or was going on in general the secluded seem to think that the sooner they forget they are negroes the sooner whites will too the foregoing are by no means all of the categories but all have in common an almost pathetic clamor to gain acceptance in the general american society perhaps subsequent to the day when this has been accomplished the black anglosaxon too will disappear from the north american scene the secret storm as she looked at the y magnificent peace roses which centered the speakers table dr gale claren guest of honor fought down an impulse to reach out and pull off a leaf just onelike she used to snip a spicysmelling leaf from her grandmothers straggly geraniums in their rusty tin cans the crowd was clapping and smiling and the applause and the smiles were for her how amazing gale thought this hotel ballroom on a stormy night this interfaith interracial banquet with jew and gentile catholic and protestant white and negro teachers clergymen businessmen members of city council representatives from the y boards the womens clubs the junior college the thunderous applause and the storm lashing at the windows gave way to sudden quiet as the evenings program began gale tried to keep pity from her eyes while she watched the young singer whose trembling hands could scarcely hold her sheet of music i must have looked like that at twenty she thought poor skinny little black girl in her sleazy silk dress which doesnt quite fit poor scared but panic left the girls eyes as her rich contralto rose he plants his footsteps in the sea and rides upon the storm joy and belief rode the storm with him as the girl offered up her last stanza as though it were a gift being laid upon a sacred altar blind unbelief is sure to err and scan his work in vain god is his own interpreter and he will make it plain plain the word disturbed gale as she looked down at her hands square black replicas of hands which had been an alabama slaves and rebellion surged through her as she thought grannie grannie you deserved applause and banquets and honors but it is i who have them along with a phd and an lld along with a lace dinner gown and a corsage of yellow orchids even god cant interpret that not to me he cant god if there is a god knows im nothing but cheating trash the head of the ymca a handsome viking with a yellow crewcut began speaking of what dr claren had done for children and youth the lives of his own small sons he said were inestimably safer because of dr clarens work which had made the city more nearly what a city aspires to be the public playgrounds he said should be renamed clarengrounds for the woman who had persuaded the city fathers again the crowd clapped and the thunder the pounding rain the lashing trees clapped with them gale turned the stem of her goblet thinking grannie used to wait for me there by the well so she could let down the old warped bucket on its frayed rope and get me a cool drink when came home from school she used to tell me not to be scared of storms but now im scared scared of the storm outside and scared of the storms within a dowagerlooking man president of the school board began paying his tributes he talked of the summer camps the preschool nurseries the gale claren high school all of which he said had grown out of dr clarens love of knowledge in torturous detail he sketched her early struggles against sickness against poverty against a slowly aroused public he talked of dr clarens work with the juvenile court and of the resultant channeling of the terroristic west end gangs into useful citizenship until now the entire city counted it a privilege this night to honor the woman whose inborn love for learning inborn gales fingers gently outlined a butterfly woven into the linen damask of the banquet cloth inborn gale saw herself racing from the small shack of a schoolhouse common throughout the rural sections of the south during her childhood saw herself as a tiny black girl wearing a pinafore made from an unbleached floursackracing to her grandmothers to teach an old old woman how to read and write she saw her grandmother smoothing down her stiffly starched calico apron over her billowing lap as she said youre a great woman galey only six years old and already youre a great woman cause you can read cause you can learn me dont never quit galey dont never quit till you can read words longern my arm longern my arm galey and dont you never quit learnin other people neither dont never quit inborn love of learning indeed gale smiled thinking inborn love of showing off inborn love of being called a great woman a flash bulb went off and there was her smile ready for the morning newspapers thunder shook through the room and echoed sickeningly in gales heart we aint poor white trash grannie used to say course we aint quality white folks neither but we aint white trash and we aint black trashhow fiercely she used to add thatwe aint black trash what goes to lying and cheating and stealing galey not never recollections of her aged grandmother were no longer steadying like tearing winds thought of the picture which would be in the morning newspapers and of the caption which would appear under it shattered gale almost moaned aloud oh grannie grannie there are ways of lying and cheating that you never even dreamed of and i can not bear it i can not bear it seeking shelter in her program gale saw that the next speaker was dr everson harvey head of the psychology department at rogers junior college she knew what he would say he would stress the fact that dr claren had built her whole approach to the handling of problem children on love that she had built it on love when this was considered a new approach the storms within her quieted gale found a moments peace in thinking of the many magazine articles and books she had written on love of the speeches she had made and the tv and radio programs on which she had appeared all giving love as the answer the only answer to interpersonal relationships to interpersonal conflict and because dr claren has so firmly established her own life on love said dr harvey because hers has been so deeprooted so outwardreaching so abounding a love this amazing woman has overcome almost insurmountable obstacles dr harveys words slashed through gales broken defenses so well she knew that the love on which her life had been built was a limited loveif indeed it could be called love at all she wondered when did i turn into poor lying black trash when did i lose grannie and grannies teachings andgrannies god when did i starthating she could not remember any hatred within her until after grannie died and the family had come north then over her parents vigorous protests gale had begun walking four miles to attend the nearest high school that first fall a civic group had sponsored an essay contest subject democracy and she had won gale had won first prize five dollars gale now wondered could a little halfstarved colored girl have meant prizewinning words on democracy at any rate she had received the five dollars and along with it a bitter piece of knowledge no mention of the prize was made at the high school convocation no mention of it later in the school paper no mention at all this gale now realized must have been the beginning of her hate the smiles she saw that next saturday as she spent her incredible fortune at the methodist rummage sale must have added something to that hate amused smiles followed her about as she picked out a purple sweater for her mother a plaid wool suspender outfit for her threeyearold sister a white shirtgood all but the cuffsfor her father to wear on sundays shoes for her two brothers measured so carefully by paper patterns she had made by tracing their wornthrough soles and for herself a cerise silk blouse amazingly like the sleazy silk dress which tonights young singer was wearing so very faint were these beginnings of hate that they might never have grown at all if it had not been for the drama festival gale had been chosen for the cast of a play written and directed by a prominent society matron of the town after several private presentations of the play the authordirectors friends persuaded her to try entering her prodigies in the city drama festival gale felt tears sting her eyes as she remembered those wonderful weeks of rehearsal and the final tea given for their allnegro cast by what her grandmother would have called quality white folks pink candles in silver candelabra bluebells and heather and pink roses in a silver bowl a tablecloth with lace squares set into it and knights in armour worked right into the lace sandwiches with the crusts cut clear off arranged on silver trays and the quality white folks treating five young negroes treating little galey morton in her rummage sale blouselike equals she remembered the applause as the curtain had gone down on their play at the drama festival the festival was now wholly superimposed on the present banquet scene gale once more heard the judge who was her high school civics teacher commenting briefly on each of the ten competing plays this play with its allnegro cast she said of theirs this play is the best example i have ever seen of stage presence under difficult circumstances i am sure none of you realized that the babys crying and having to be taken off stage was not in the script or that all four ad libbed until cynthia gales name in the play could return with the quieted baby or that cynthia herself ad libbed the team work and the stage presence of the entire cast was amazing to say nothing of their acting i think we all recognize that this play was of professional not amateur standing and the people those white people had clapped until it seemed they would never stop is it that remembered burst of applause or this present clapping which now hurts my ears gale wondered and is it that remembered hate or what that hate has grown into which now engulfs me for after the intermission when the winning play was to be announced a man came out to report that the judge had taken suddenly ill and that honors would have to be announced through the newspapers the toastmaster of the banquetthe young ymca leader with the yellow crewcut scraped back his chair as he rose gale welcomed his bringing her back to the present occasion after all nothing said here could hurt like these memories he was speaking again about race prejudice saying it was time for all americans to wake up and see the writing on the wall gales sick thoughts flooded back to the past little galey morton at fourteen for all that she looked scarcely ten saw the morning newspapers writing on the wall their play was not first not second but honorable mention the paper went on to say that the first prize would represent the city in the state finals the second serve as alternate gale remembered the two plays she remembered the small amount of applause they had called forth she remembered hate hate over being pushed back into place unfairly hate over knowing why hate centering on her teacher who tried next day to explain that a baby in the cast made their play too risky to represent the city in the state finals hate that made a little colored girl gather up her school books and take them home hate that made her burn them in the rusty potbellied stove hate that kept her from eating from sleeping hate that finally sent her back to school determined to show them hate that grew and grew on to the day when after crying a long night through over a telegram which regretted young lieutenant clarens death in combat gale had gone to take her senior college examinationsgone on a city bus where two women were loudly objecting to niggers being allowed gale clarens life built on love oh no she thought sickly built on hate for anyone and for anything and for everything which hurts my people and if my life has been built on hateas it has then it means that all these speeches and awards are false and that i myself am nothing but a lie personified soon this evening this unbearable evening which has been so much worse than i could have dreamed will be over soon can stop smiling and pretending to listen soon i can go home and put my yellow orchids in the refrigerator lay away my lace dinner gown get into bed and maybemaybe sleep but first she must listen to the old baptist preacher of the small church which still held her membership her nominal membership he had seemed to her an old man a very old man all those years ago when she had first come north stooped shoulders and wisps of kinky white hair making him into a caricature of the uncle tom in the stowe novel he came slowly and painfully to stand before the microphone will he be able to live through a speech gale wondered and will i be able to live through whatever he may say he he used to know me so well the good book the old man began in his quavering voice the good book talks about folks who are fruitless trees and waterless clouds and wild waves of the sea it says they walk in the way of cain brother jude tells all about them and he knew he knew them fruitless trees wouldnt never go to bearing any fruits of the spirit he knew that gale had forgotten the dramatic force of the man if she had ever thought about him at all it was with the sentimental nostalgia that looks back to remembered pleasures of early adolescence now with profound shock she realized that this aged man held in his hands the poetry and the dramayes and the wisdomwhich could move her as no other speaker of the evening had almost too late it came to her that she scarcely dared to listen and be torn anew by the things he might say but the old preacher was now saying nothing a strange silence made the room tense something tightened in gale something of fear which was greater than the dread of what this kindly man might say in alarm she lifted her eyes and looked into his face for a long moment they studied each other then he began speaking his voice slightly stronger the room was so quiet that every syllable could be heard plainly jesus talked about folks just like brother jude did in his little new testament book only jesus called them fruitless waterlesscloud folks serpents and vipers he said woe to you right to them might of sounded to them like hate but it werent it werent hate it were love love what plumb broke jesus heart cause he ended up all them woe to yous by wanting to gather them dumb deaf blind clucks right up under his own wings like a mama hen gathers her chickies together again the old man stopped someone handed him a glass of water slowly his hand trembling he took a few sips the storm outside had quieted quietly the crowded ballroom waited until the man who had so long ministered to the church which dr claren had attended as a child could again minister to the banquet guests setting the glass down gently close to the magnificent peace roses the old minister smiled his black face radiant as he again started to speak his voice rang out strong it were love all right it were jesus own kind of loving and its love when you hate meanness what treats folks mean its love when you hates injustice what treats folks unjust you aint hating folks you is just hating what keeps folks from being fruitfullike in this hungry starvin world and we in this room has to go out and love all the folks who dont agree with what we been saying here we has to do it we has to love them most powerfully cause they dont know they is waterless clouds and fruitless trees and wandering stars they dont know so we just got to love em the old mans voice strengthened but it cant be any weak soft love what darent even think up a woe to you its got to be a big love cause god wants all them wrongthinkin folks gathered up under his own loving wings till they grow up and get a mite bigger and learn how to be fruitfullike tears came into gale clarens eyes she made no effort to brush them away though she saw a photographer turning his camera toward her this aged preacher had probably never seen a psychology book how gale wondered could he know that she was one of the millions who despite their learning have never learned that hatred of injustice is love she reached for her goblet the water was no longer cold not even cool not cool and refreshing like the water her grandmother used to draw from the old well when she saw little galey morton come running from school if grannie were here gale thought she would be whispering to me loudly she would be saying what you been so feared about galey you aint never been no lying cheating trash child you just been learning so many words longern my arm that you has plumb forgot the rightsome meaning of some of the short words like lovei thats all you done the young y secretary was help ing the aged preacher back to his seat the things gale knew her grandmother would be saying if she were there rushed on youre a smart woman galey a powerful smart woman but you aint fooled god none cant nobody fool god all this time all this long time gods knowed you was nothing but a mixedup child hes knowed you was turning from him cause you hated what some of his childruns was doing to some of his other childruns but you aint a hating woman galey you couldnt never be a hating woman you listen and mind what that preacher just got done saying child and youll get along all right gale leaned forward so that she could smile down the table smile into the eyes of the aged minister then she smiled into the eyes of the girl whose singing had been balm a quieted rain touched the long windows of the ballroom as the words of the song came back blind unbelief is sure to err and scan his work in vain god is his own interpreter and he will make it plain gale reached out and gently snipped a leaf from one of the lovely peace roses which centered the speakers table for fun and profit i like nutty nifties because and for just words or less on that why you could be set for life a fortune a dream house a luxury car or maybe a trip around the world may be waiting for just a little effort on your part are you one of the people who enter contests every year a slogan a statement a name for a new product the last line to a jingle or the solution of a puzzle these are gateways to a possible good fortune and pleasant surprise each year there are hundreds of new contests each year millions of ordinary people enter and keep an enthusiastic eye out for the mail man chances are that even if you havent entered any contests lately that you have sometime in the past or will in the future contesting is truly americas leading hobby and its followers are increasing daily some of these hobbyists are just dreamers but others are hardworking sticktoit hopefuls who study plan and prepare entries that have a betterthanaverage chance of success in which class are you or maybe youre one of the scoffers you think no judge could possibly read so many entries its just a matter of chance and you were never lucky anyway its all a lot of bunk you dont believe they really give away all that money and so on well let the choice of whether youll enjoy the great american pastime contesting be yours but rest your mind on one point the contests except a very few tried by getrichquick smalltimers that are soon caught are honest they have to be the united states postal service is used in most of these and its a dangerous business to use the mails to defraud naturally the sponsor expects to profit far more than the cost of the contest by increasing his business volume with the contest publicity the box tops that accompany each entry calls for new sales of his product he also hopes to discover new ideas in your entries that will give him a direction for his future advertising as he learns what facts about his merchandise is making the greatest hit with his consumers so business firms and charities have found that contests are a paying form of advertising from to million dollars is spent each year on commercial contests to the mutual satisfaction of the sponsors and contestants contests are a definite part of our great give away system and have many supporters who judges these contests some few commercial firms and charities judge their own but most of the big contests are judged by professional judging agencies such as advertising distributors of america spotts mailing corporation reuben h donnelley corporation r l polk company bruce richards corporation and lloyd herrold company of course each judging agency has its own preferences and own tabus for winning and losing entries but in general they all have somewhat the same standards rules must be obeyed or the entry is automatically disqualified some reasons for disqualifying are no address given not mailed within the time limit too many words failure to include box top or other qualifier no rhyme when required following the rules eliminates at least half your competition fancy decorated entries are disliked and considered a form of bribery originality is prized after all if most entries are alike all cannot win so all must be eliminated aptness and sincerity are words that are usually included in all judging requirements what do they mean actually they mean that you sincerely gave the product a trial then truthfully describe its benefits to you one box of cake mix may seem the same as another but if you try the sponsors product you may discover that the result is a finer texture the taste richer and more buttery by trying the product you wont risk insincerity by describing qualities that are not true aptness and sincerity can be guided by reading the sponsors ads and wording on the label and then trying the merchandise and reporting the benefit these values have to you personally dont be a phony just be you the result will be the originality and individuality that the sponsor is looking for many contestants become discouraged when they do not win immediately so they do not try more than once or twice then quit they tend to slap off an entry carelessly inviting failure to win with such a haphazard sort of preparation would be like a sweepstakes chance however people do win who are they they are the small percentage who love the pastime keep enthusiastic in spite of failures they try as many contests as they can constantly working to improve contesting techniques attitude is a big factor in whether you will enjoy contesting as a hobby and also whether you will win believe in each entry and in yourself make each entry the best you can do mail it forget it and try some more bitterness discouragement or resentment of others good luck in winning will only block your thinking processes and make you bog down and quit keep your hope and courage up for high creativity by realizing that its a waste of time to be resentful for something you cannot help use that energy to improve your future entries by studying them for weaknesses and comparing them with the winners every winner after years of discouragement invariably declares im glad i kept trying if you give up youve got nothing for sure but if you keep trying youre sure to win eventually one contest fan in tampa florida never owned a television until she won two in contests walked for her groceries until she won a bicycle then rode the bike till she won an automobile now she says shes dreaming of air transportation and is just waiting for some sponsor to stage a contest with a helicopter as a prize dont ever give up says one prize winner recently after she was awarded a total of her first win after three years of contesttrying one woman in massachusetts won a trip for two to florida just after her husband was recovering from pneumonia it couldnt have come at a better time and to think i was almost too busy and discouraged to even try that contest im sure glad i did you too can be a winner some helpful suggestions gleaned from the writers own experience and that of others are given here perhaps the most important thing is to fall in love with words words can make you laugh cry buy or reject they can paint a bright picture or draw a blank get the dictionary habit just browse through and read word definitions when you read maga zines or newspapers read the ads and underscore picture words try to see what the advertiser is trying to do can you forget buywords like happy go lucky dont let your hands tell time selling hand lotion thick and tired of a bad fit foundation garments bewitching stitching swim suits strong legs run that weak legs may walk football game benefiting crippled children words and phrases like these did not come with careless thinking they came from a love of words and a study of wordcombinations words are keys to emotion and emotion is the key to prizewinning entries and forceful advertising wilfred funk suggests the following as the most beautiful words in the english language chimes dawn golden hush lullaby luminous melody mist murmuring tranquil starting with these make a list of your own list hopeful words fear words bouncing action words glad words sad words from advertising list picture phrases that may spark your own mind into more original directions familiar phrases and famous quotations can be used by changing them to suit the sponsors product or to create an entirely new meaning start such a list now of all these you can recall such as home is where the heart is honesty is the best policy make hay while the sun shines seeing is believing etc im sure you can recognize clever reversals of these old sayings in many ads today you can do the same or use them to start other ideas of your own in statement and name contests try making up words by using two or more words fused together like applelicious from apple and delicious in naming a pie or pudding a winning flower name was coined by fusing the words memory and florescent into memorescent in one contest entrants were required to name a bicycle that came equipped with a radio some of the winning names were chattercycle airolympic and audioflyer a winner of a statement contest in describing the whitening advantages of a detergent wrote gone are the ghosts of yestergray this was legitimate borrowing that made an original expression of the sponsors product finally to sum up try many contests all you can find time for then forget each one and go on to others newspapers magazines radio tv and special contest publications all announce current contests obey all rules strictly work hard over all entries if it comes too easy then reject it as ordinary and rework it into something different and outstanding use strong picture words and action verbs use the sponsors product read his advertising be honest be yourself slanted to his needs and yours keep copies of all entries you might be able to rework a loser into a winner in another direction keep an idea file or notebook include unique ads titles pictures sayings phrases anything that may put a spark into a sluggish brain wake it up and start the ideas flowing get a good dictionary a rhyming dictionary a volume of familiar quotations and a thesaurus there are books on contesting techniques you may find at your local library contesting magazines on the newsstands and several schools that teach the subject by mail its a big business for many people no one of course should or could plan on making a living wholly by contesting but as a hobby few fields are more challenging so heres to you come on in the funs fine keep hopeful keep trying keep

name is garry moore fatty arbuckle i called louder as i was heading out the door prince ranier dwight d eisenhower by thomas fuller she was the unlikeliest s of heroes there she jj was young and comese a ly as trim and chic as a model in a magazine advertisement at the most prosaic it was easy to picture her as a youthful matron dainty and decorative waiting in her wellappointed home for the man who adored her to come in from his labors when the little rock crisis reached fever pitch in the fall of and people across the world were wondering about the woman called daisy bates writers were turning out reams of copy in an effort to describe her in her native arkansas of course she was pictured as a firebreathing redlining witch and called every vile name printable and a few names which in a truly civilized society are not printable at all but other writers were more objective seeking to satisfy the curiosity about the woman who had turned the nation upside down a united press correspondent described daisy bates as a businesslike woman of and went on in a kind of awe to list the measurements of her slim figure she wears her black hair in a casual bob sometimes covering part of her forehead he wrote adding newsmen find little trouble talking to her for readers of the minneapolis tribune the famed negro journalist carl t rowan was more to the point actually she is a typical negro housewifedifferent from the average american woman perhaps primarily in that she prefers poker to bridge and has become expert with a rifle inherent in rowans description is the suggestion that had the wanton finger of fate pointed at many another negro woman the results would have been pretty much the same there is nothing in this suggestion to detract from the extraordinary achievement of daisy lee bates rather there is something in it of commendation for all the millions of negro women who have borne with uncommon fortitude the burden of their cultures cruelty and of their mens helpless despair if daisy bates is typical of her kind then she proved a splendid example never once in her long and barbarous ordeal was there a public moment of faltering or retreat if there had not been private ones then she would have been more than human and daisy bates is very human indeed on september the day the segregationists refer to as black monday mrs bates came closest to losing her extraordinary calm the vicious mobs had forced the nine negro children from central high school state police had just intercepted a caravan of some cars loaded with enough explosives to dynamite half the city as it neared the bates home and the threat of violence hung like a living thing over the whole state in the tense stillness of the night the phone rang in the bates home and when she answered it an obscene voice spoke in her ear we have just had our first killing in little rock and you are responsible there will be more before day my heart stood still mrs bates recalls i thought of mr eckford the father of elizabeth one of the nine children returning home from his night job i could envision him being shot down and at the same time i pictured governor faubus gloating in his illfamed glory faith deserted her in that moment i became bitter for the first time i hated everything for which america stood i hated these people who had as much as burned the u s constitution when they put fiery crosses on our lawn i hated the socalled liberals who were too afraid of their social positions to speak out clearly and firmly most of all i hated the frightened and complacent negro of the south and the contented negro of the north i walked into my bedroom and cried how much can a people stand i think that in that moment if i could have lifted the cotton curtain and walked through it to the iron curtain that i would have done so without looking back as these things were going through my mind was praying then something seemed to say to me you cannot spend your time hating you must work and have faith when the report of murder was finally checked and proved to be false i felt like a person who had been given a new lease on life daisy bates did not ask for fame what she sought was indeed what millions of other negro women seekthe freedom for their loved ones which is their birthright as americans simply that specifically as president of the arkansas branches of the naacp she asked that the negro children of her community be permitted to attend without stigma the public schools of the city of little rock and for this she found herself in the eye of a racist hurricane the lady from little rock was first catapulted into the international spotlight on the terrible morning in september when supported by nothing but her courageshe shepherded the nine teenagers through a howling mob of whites to confront a contingent of hostile national guardsmen with orders to bar the children from the white high school it was an incredible and beautiful thing that procession here were nine children scarcely into puberty facing in their tender youth all the ugly madness of rampant racism and facing it with a dignity that was as old and as proud as the human race and here was the woman who had inspired them who had shown them by her example that a human being is not a beast that there is something in a man stronger and more meaningful than the bombs in his hands and the hatred in his heart but though the outside world first heard of daisy bates after that day she had long been a familiar personage in her native state she had arrived in little rock a very young bride with her newspaper publishing husband back in and from the beginning from her vantage point on the weekly state press she had waged war on bigotry with her husband she had worked to inform the negro people of their rights and to urge the white people to respect these rights the state press had been active in prodding the city of little rock to hire negro policemen the paper had been in the forefront of the movement for peaceful integration of the state university law and medical schools long before the supreme courts desegregation ruling and it was inevitable that the weekly would urge speedy compliance with the supreme courts edict daisy bates had long been active in the naacp and a year before the desegregation ruling she was named president of all the branches in the state had there been willing and capable local leadership she would have left the job to others but there was none she stepped in requested compliance of the school boards counselled the parents of the negro children and filed suits against public officials when all else failed it was obvious that the white people of little rock had no wish to obey the national law and it was equally obvious that the courts had no alternative but to compel compliance the final clash was between the power of orval faubus the defiant governor and that of the federal courts on the morning when daisy bates and the nine children walked up to central high school faubus had called out the national guard to turn them back nearly three weeks later acting at last president eisenhower inducted the guardsmen into federal service and sent officers and men of the st airborne division into the city to enforce the courts decision when the children the next day marched off once more to central high school things had changed the mobs were still there spitting and cursing but the danger was gone the children were escorted by paratroopers who made it very clear that they were on the side of the law and that the law was on the side of the negro children for everyone concerned the first stage of the battle was over the negro children did not have to fear the white hoodlums who jeered at them along the streets but they still had to exercise superhuman care and restraint inside the school the racist mobs knew that they had lost but they are poor losers and they shifted their tactics to boycott harassment and terror it did not matter that there were so many others who agreed with the mobs or that they were in high places their numbers and their eminence served only to illustrate how widespread was their affliction and to what tragic extent their disease had been indulged by the nation of course the children were too young to understand this they knew only that they were in the right and that those who abused them were somehow more in need of help than they but daisy bates knew she had after a fashion experienced it all before and she would more than likely experience it all again in the year that followed the morning that the nine children safely went off to school without her daisy bates knew peace only on those occasions when she was away from little rock her phone rang incessantly crosses were burned on her lawn torches were tossed on her roof shots were fired through her house and the big picture window in her living room was broken so often that she finally gave up having it repaired she endured it she also endured the gradual but steady economic pressure on her husbands newspaper that drove the paper out of business and her husband to financial ruin advertisers withdrew and circulation dropped and finally the publisher was forced to vacate the building that housed his plant there were times when mr and mrs l c for lucius christopher bates felt they had been licked at last that those who had schemed to drive them out of little rock had won then for a while sympathetic people from all over the country rallied to their side renewing their hope during those frantic months daisy bates received the avid applause of negroes everywhere and the moral support of people all over the world including some white people among her numerous citations and tokens of recognition is the coveted spingarn medal awarded jointly to her and the nine brave children whom she served as mentor but as so often happens the public soon forgot school integration was an accomplished fact in little rock andbecause of little rockin many other southern cities and daisy bates was no longer news she remains president of the arkansas naacp it is a fulltime job offering no financial reward at all after the demise of the arkansas state press publisher bates was hired as arkansas field secretary of the naacp a job that utilizes his special talents as a journalist and his keen knowledge of the locality but which cannot pay him the money to which he was accustomed needless to say there is hardly any other place in arkansas where he can find a decent job during much of and mrs bates was in new york city working on a book recording her experiences in the drama of little rock the book tentatively titled the daisy bates story is scheduled for publication this summer by the david mckay company in the book she will detail for the first time the behindthescenes incidents which the national press dared notor was reluctant to report she will reveal what happened to the nine children and to their parents she will name the white people of little rock who out of christian principle sided with the negro children and who paid for their religious faith with financial disaster and social ruin but most important of all she will tell what she felt herself in those grim and dangerous days when she struggled with superhuman effort against the specter of bitterness and defeat before returning to little rock this spring mrs bates sat in her comfortable suite in the brittany hotel in new yorks greenwich village and discussed her impending return home i admit that the idea of returning to little rock is frightening when i recall the intense hatred that has been generated against me by the politicians she said this hatred has been manifested in many ways by the bombing of our home death threats to me and my family and the loss of our paper some people have said to me that progress has been made because a limited number of negro students are attending classes in the senior and junior high schools i recognize the fact that this could be considered progress i am also cognizant of the fact that the students are not permitted to participate in any extracurricular activities and that the restaurants theatres hotels and recreational facilities in little rock are still segregated i would like to continue to be a part of the revolution that will surely one day write finish to the vicious practice of segregation in arkansas that is why i am returning to little rock it may very well be dangerous for daisy bates to return home but it also would seem that her return bodes no comfort for those who are not willing to make freedom a reality for all the people of arkansas do negroes and africans really dig each other accompanying the v recent emergence of j independent african e nations has come a great deal of interest in the dark continent as more and more africans come to the united states there are many very intriguing and revealing developments there has naturally been an intensification of interest centered about the black africanblack american relationship the obvious similarities between the two ethnic groups have often led to misconceptions and fallacies concerning the relationship between the two groups a recent article inthe afroamerican newspaper and the all too apparent misinformation therein dramatically demonstrates this point the fact that the article was written by a negro for a negro newspaper to be primarily read by a negro audience merely makes the situation more acutely embarrassing the fact that afroamerican happens to be the name of a publication adds a touch of irony and ludicrousness that is almost too biting to those somewhat informed on the subject the article appeared in a column called a stones throw by editor chuck stone and was entitled we dig our african brothers but most whites dont after reading the article i was reminded of the old adage he that lives in a glass house should not throw stones the author of the article in his inadequate attempt at proving that africans are accepted by american negroes as brothers builds himself a hothouse inside a gravel pit insults the intelligence of his readers and generously supplies his adversary with slingshots approximately a year ago a newspaper article that had appeared in the pittsburgh courier came to my attention it carried a very interesting informative message unlike mr stone the writer of the courier article spoke of and frompersonal experience the gentleman a high ranking nigerian dignitary had this to say about the contact he had had with american negroes they are cold and unfriendly i was not surprised by this the theme of many discussions i have had with africans coming into my office on state department tours has been the irregular response of negroes to africans african students are often surprised and shocked to see and experience the indifferent and almost hostile attitude of the american negro toward them at times they naively assume as many other uninitiated that because of the common color characteristics common ancestry and some common problems there should exist a close bond of brotherhood between them and the negro perhaps this should be the case but unfortunately it is not before the mau mau uprisings probably the most popular conception of africans held by negroes was based on tarzan movies or some other equally enlightening source most negroes were willing to allow the matter to rest right there figuring no doubt that the less said the better for to get involved in such a question would invariably lead back to the painful fact that they were descendants from such people it was only after ghana gained her independence and the triumphant tour of america by kwame nkrumah that most american negroes became aware that africans were more than an ancient race of people from which they had to grudgingly admit descent even today much of the token acceptance of africans by negroes is based on the fact that having african interests and guests is now socially the thing to do ten years ago there were only a few negroes who evidenced any real interest in africa individuals like st clair drake claude barnett w e b du bois and pitifully few others were the only negroes to meaningfully manifest any genuine interest and concern in africa since the founding of liberia i have been too impressed with hearing dr drake and others speak of the difficult often impossible task of getting negroes fired up about african affairs and culture to believe that there has been a wholesale change in the attitude and action of the negro regarding his image of the african it must be a rather embarrassing thing and due to his apparent void of information on the subject astonishing for the author of the afroamerican article to discover that very few negro colleges have quality programs in african studies this remains the case despite the fact that a number of african leaders received their education at these schools it must be a distressing discovery for him to find out that the leading program of african studies is at northwestern university a white institution it must be exceptionally painful for him to realize that the person nationally and internationally accepted as the leading africanist in the united states is a white anthropologist dr melville herskovits dr herskovits gave up the very prestigious position as head of the department of anthropology at northwestern university to direct his brainchild the program of african studies at northwestern since its embryonic and almost esoteric inception sixteen years ago its growth in size and stature has caused it to be considered the most outstanding such program in america it must be known to the author in question that the naacp the urban league and other such organizations have had to depend to a great extent on white support for existence this has been the case despite the type of fight these groups have been waging but if negroes twentyone million strong spending in excess of twenty billion dollars a year dont demonstrate a sufficient concern for their brothers right here in america through sufficient support of these agencies then is it reasonable to assume that they are better prepared to show a special affinity for a people even further removed as desirable as it may be to propose that the american negro generally views the african as brother with all the inherent and indigenous fraternal feeling implied by the term borders on being preposterous nothing happens in a vacuum there are many reasonable and plausible explanations for the apathetic attitude of the negro toward the african for centuries the negro has been trying to deny lose and eradicate his african heritage and characteristics fortunes based on hair preparations and skin bleaches are indicting testimony to this very soon after he reached the shores of america the african became aware of the importance that color apparently played he reasoned that the only real difference between him and the massa was color and the accompanying african features he ignored the importance of economics and its vital role in the scheme of things he naively wrapped all his frustrations problems and aspirations into one big white pill and swallowed it thereafter he saw the world in terms of black white and varying shades of brown and assumed if you white you all right if you brown you can hang around but if you black then you got to git way back having established color as the criterion for his own evaluating scheme the negro set in motion a type of ethnic thinking that plagues us even today premiums were placed on possessing white features light skin keen nose thin lips good hair anything african was allocated a negative value and had to be altered hidden or minimized whenever possible jealousies and discriminations within the race itself often paralyzed and prevented action in concert among the various factions of negroes color neuroses and psychoses retarded a realistic acceptance and appreciation of africanness and thwarted much progress toward finding the real basis for the negros inferior position in america that basis was and is economics color is a very convenient rationalization and disguise behind which the operations necessary to subjugation have been carried on the negros rejection of the african image is further encouraged and molded by various aspects of his everyday existence in the educational system the negro first meets the african in the little black sambo tale later in geography he sees the african as a noble savage at best and often as some scantily clothed uncivilized creature whose biggest claim to progress is that he doesnt eat people in as large quantities as he did formerly for better or worse neeroes are americans as such they are effectively reached and influenced by madison avenue and hollywood for years the negro has been exposed to the same symbols as white america he has been just as effectively influenced by them he regards the gregory peck betty grable rock hudson jane russell type as the ultimate in male and female attractiveness after this brainwashing process he is in no mood to settle for the aunt jemimas and uncle bens not to mention the african with the masses of negroes being conditioned and controlled in his thinking along the same lines as other americans with the gross ignorance that remains about africa with his historic repugnance at africanness there is little cause to wonder at the attitude of the american negro toward the african there has been however some progress made negroes are slowly beginning to feel that there is no inherent shame in being born black but that it is inherently shameful to be ashamed of being born that color many negroes are looking to the accomplishments of the new african nations with pride admiration hope and respect but despite these steps forward there has not been enough progress for most negroes to accept the african as his brother americas forgotten people despite certain limited d improvementson jf paperin the laws americas forgotten people by dale wright reprinted by permission from the new york world telegram sun protecting the migrant farm worker he continues to be americas forgotten manforced to work long tortured hours at substandard wages cheated and exploited at every turn and compelled to live in filth and squalor and danger i know this because for six months on and off from april to october i worked as a migrant laborer along the atlantic seaboard from florida to new york i saw it with my eyes i felt it in my blistered hands i smelled it with my nose and i rebelled at it in my conscience i labored with slept with ate with and more than once suffered with the members of this vast army of men and women and children most of them negroes like myself who stoop and lift and grub from natures earth a great part of the nations food crop these are some of the things i found many migrant workers are forced to work as many as hours a day at a backbreaking task the rewards of which are in most cases a string of broken promises they are grossly underpaid and many times not paid at all by conniving labor contractors who have them at their mercy they are cheated and exploited all along the line by profiteers in the roles of growers shippers packers labor contractors crew bosses landlords and merchants thousands of them live in shabby unkempt hovels and shacks usually hidden behind a clump of trees out of public view without sanitary or plumbing facilities and despite laws enacted to protect them their children starting at age are worked long hours under a searing sun for less than the prevailingor promisedpay under conditions inferior to those afforded cattle and freight migrant laborers are transported from one work area to another in dilapidated hazardous vehicles and at the end of the line when all the crops are worked out hundreds of the migrant workers wind up on relief at public expense in the northern seaboard states the man who sits next to me in this newspaper office allan keller has done much to improve the lot of migrant laborers mainly through his efforts and the campaigns by this newspaper over a period of years a new york state legislative committee was named to look into the migrant labor problem and recommend changes in the laws belatedly teeth were put into regulations to provide better treatment for the migrant the state department of health was empowered to license labor camps and require that minimum sanitary and health standards be maintained other states took stepsalso on paper to help and protect the forgotten man of america the changes in the laws havent helped much the miserable migrants virtually without hope for a brighter tomorrow are still hidden behind those clumps of trees at this moment the migrant labor problem is being investigated anew by asubcommittee of the house labor and education committee with a view toward drafting new remedial legislation its another step in the long investigation of the stoop laborer who has been studied surveyed microscoped and diagnosed over the years as perhaps the sickest segment of the nations economy but i saw little improvement in the condition of the patient the working and housing conditions were bad enough but it was the way hes cheated that outraged me hes overcharged for his squalid shack his food his clothing his bottle of wine at the end of a hard week of work and hes gouged on just about every other item he purchases i found workers in central new jersey who were charged cents for a breakfast of one chicken wing a spoonful of watery rice and a slice of bread an extra slice cost them cents more in the long island potato belt where four migrant workers perished in flames recently i found a large crew of men and women being charged by a labor contractor with weekly dues to a union which didnt exist they also were being charged another for social security far out of proportion to the paltry pay they had received in many cases i discovered workers forced to pay for social security had no ss numbers at all the payments obviously going wholly to profiteers operating at their labor camp in hastings fla the heart of the states potato belt i bunked for two days in a nearcollapsed insectinfested shanty for which i was compelled to pay a night next door in an even more dilapidated hovel lived a married couple whose monthold baby had been bom there they paid a week the infant wailed endlessly from dawn to darkness in its makeshift crib a cardboard cabbage carton as flies and potato bugs crawled in and out of its mouth and nostrils a ragged burlap potato sack served as the babys blanket but florida has no comer on squalor near hightstown n j less than miles from trenton the state capital i found seven men and women tomato pickersnone of them relatedliving in filth in a foot square tar paper shack for which they were charged a week for rent everywhere i traveled i found the itinerant laborer getting a wretched deal and being inarticulate and always on the move he is least able among americas working men to have his cries heard on a warm humid morning last april a rickety old bus jolted along at its top speed between rows of carefully manicured estates along route from miami south to homestead fla although the vehicle had seats for persons it was crammed with passengers i was one of them i was on my way to my first day of work as a migrant farm laborer in the lush tomato fields of southern dade county i had shaped up reported for assignment earlier that morning on a miami street corner and was hiredwith no questions askedby a fat character known as a labor contractor in the south labor contractors round up crews of workers for transport and assignment to farms where crops are to be harvested everybody that gets on this bus he promised reassuringly makes today if you want to work theres plenty of tomatoes to pick and there will be no cheating nothin taken out of your pay and it will be clean work his pitch sounded good but i wanted to see for myself the smirks on the faces of the seasoned migrant workers around me raised my doubts in a vast patch of ground outside homestead our crew joined about other farm workers they were busy when we arrived gathering a crop of red ripes tomatoes ready that day for shipment to the markets and canneries it was just after daybreak and a bright sun already had begun to broil the pickers as they stooped in the long rows the job was to pick and pack the tomatoes into baskets that contained fiveeighths of a bushel each loaded basket weighed pounds when we had them filled we lugged them to the end of the row where they were loaded onto trucks pay promised was cents a basket in the row next to mine an emaciated man of about coughed and spat incessantly as he bent to his task when i noticed the blood and spoke to him about it he muttered yeah they say its consumption it dont make no difference i gotta keep working the doctor he cant do nothing for me i got no money for medicine i got a woman and a lotta kids i gotta keep pickin tomatoes obviously the man was seriously ill and belonged in a hospital but he was trapped by the need to work for his family in the only job he knew how to do later when we stood up to smoke a cigaret he said to me been doin farm work all my life dont know nothin else i cant go to a hospital kids gotta eat he said his name was alonzo and that he lived in a tin and tar paper shack near goulds fla for which he paid a week rent he added that three of his children the small oneshad dry hacking coughs and probably had caught the misery he had in his chest medical treatment no none of the youngsters had ever seen a doctor despite his illness alonzo was a hard worker as we worked along the endless rows of tomato plants he loaded basket after basket of tomatoes and was soon far down the field from me later that day alonzo told me he soon would be moving north from homestead because the harvest was going down to keep living he explained hed have to load his family and his belongings onto a truck or bus going north where other crops were ripening its the same he said this job is just like the last one next be just like this one never no different never will be this sick frustrated laborer doomed long before his time was summing up the lot of todays migrant farm worker the backbreaking labor of stooping close to the orangetinted florida earth begins as soon as a picker can distinguish red tomatoes from green ones in the grey dawn of an endless day his work ends when he no longer can see the tomatoes to pick them at the promised rate of cents a basket a good picker can fill to baskets a day and earn it says therefrom to a day as bad as that kind of pay is it generally worked out that the man in the fields received considerably less than the promised rate often the rate dropped on payday to cents a basket and the field hand who actually took home a day for his work considered himself lucky on my first day in the fields i worked hours with only a minute break for what they called lunch it was the hardest most punishing work had ever done in the first hours of that miserable day my hands became grimy and encrusted with the green insecticide they spray on tomatoes it covered my khaki pants and ate its way into my legs it collected under my finger nails covered my shoes and socks and festered in the scratches i received from the tomato vines but picking the tomatoes was the easy part of the job the hard part was lugging the heavy baskets to the end of the rowsoften as far as feetto be loaded onto the trucks all around me were men and womenall agesdragging themselves along the rows on their hands and knees in the near degree heat toilet facilities there were none the pickers male and female used the field whenever they found it necessary it was more than a mile to the nearest clump of trees that lunch i spoke of a little before noon a battered pickup truck drove into the fields the meal consisted of greasy sausage sandwiches and warm soft drinks the sandwiches cost cents and the drinks cents drinking water was dispensed from a wooden barrel we dipped our water with a sawedoff tomato can shared by some other migrant laborers toiling in the fields because the barrel was in the middle of the field thirsty workers had to walk as much as a half mile for a drink of water as i figured it that first day we picked more than baskets of tomatoes after hours of stooping squatting crawling picking and loading id earned just many of the men and women working with me had earned less the transportation of migrant workers within a state such as florida is a horror story i was in florida last spring riding with and working with the thousands of migrant laborers who follow the harvest of crops for their miserable livelihood travel for a migrant and his family is a nightmare anywhere in florida and other states which dont regulate migrant transportation its worse itemthe federal statutes decree that drivers of interstate migrant carriers must pass physical fitness tests i rode in a bus with a labor crew of including a young couple with a monthold infant the trip from homestead to ruskin fla covered miles the driver in a moment of sleepy candor told me he was subject to violent epileptic seizures itemfederal laws say that rest and meal stops must be made at least every six hours our crew traveled hours before the first stop was made the driver stopped for gas but not for people the infant had to use for toilet purposes a filthy rag salvaged from the bus floor as for men and women their experiences must go undescribed itemevery state requires that bus and truck drivers be properly licensed the driver of the arklike vehicle i rode in admitted that his license had been lifted because of a conviction for drunken driving itemmost state laws require that migrant carriers be maintained in reasonably safe and operable condition but on our antique bus windows were cracked or broken seats had collapsed floorboards had long since broken away from mountings and been removed both rear wheels with their smooth whirring tires were visible from inside the bus the owner admitted to me later that the bus had not been inspected in the five years he had owned it baggage and trash barred access to the rear emergency exit door and because the door catch was broken it had been bound firmly shut with baling wire and thus we migrantsi was one of them by nowrolled along floridas roads we passedand were passed byseveral state troopers and local police patrol cars not once were we stopped our destination was ruskin next stop on our journey to the nevernever land of plenty wed all been promised top wages good food a real nice place to live the crew boss name was david tuten jr of st petersburg fla he made it sound real good every man and woman of you will make a day and nobody takes nothin out of your pay an old man sitting next to me muttered amen which gave me a pretty fair idea what was coming when we arrived at the camp outside a big farm about three miles from ruskin we had been travelingwith just one stopfor hours everybody was tired dirty hungry and then we got the bad news the tomatoes were still green and not anywhere near being ready for harvest sorry to tell you this said the grower but therell be no work for at least days this i learned from friends i had made on the bus often pens when that land of plenty is just around the comer of the winding road it meant just one thing that the workers were there on their own to wait until green tomatoes turned red it also meant that at the mercy of the tomato farmer and the crew contractor they would run up big debts for food and lodging to be paid for later when they trudged out into the fields there were a few shouts of protests but not many this had happened too often before just as it will happen too often again i looked around the camp there were no toilet facilities whatsoever there was no kitchen equipment in the barrackslike living quarters there was no food that i could see the only available water came from an irrigation pump adequate provisions had been made to water the tomatoesbut not the people some of the migrants washed themselves and their clothes in a muddy irrigation ditch the crew boss explained without apology that he hadnt known the crop was late or that the grower hadnt installed facilities for his workers nobody said anything we were all too tired a man who had brought his wife and child along finally broke the silence we got here broke he said mournfully everything we got is tied up in this bundle he pointed to a tattered bedspread tied up by its four corners and now were even worse off than before cause we got to start borrowing money to live on the man then walked away with his family and slowly dug a hole in the ground then he set up a makeshift stove by placing a piece of sheet metal on four empty cans and built a fire under it i watched as he tramped off into the fields in a few minutes he was back with a small cabbage and a can of waterfrom the irrigation ditch he and his wife boiled the cabbage over the can stove it was the first meal that they and their child had eaten since leaving homestead hours before a migrant farm worker expects exploitation as one of the grim facts of his miserable life he knows hell be cheated and he learns to live with it he knows hell be underpaid for his labor and overcharged for many of the things he has to buy for himself and his family because many migrants never get to schoolor have to leave during the early elementary school years to go to work in the fields they are uneducated and illiterate for this reason they are easy marks for sharp operators while driving along a country road through the fertile north shore potato area near peconic l i last august i picked up two hitchhiking farmhands who spelled out some of the gimmicks the sharpies use to separate a migrant worker from his hardwon wages james taylor and evon washington both from polk county fla had been taken to peconic fla last july to work as potato graders they had joined a traveling farm crew headed by a virginia man earlier in the summer on a promise that they would be paid an hour the worldtelegram is withholding the virginia mans name at this time because of an investigation now under way both farmhands agreed that in nearly three months of work with the crew of graders and loaders they had never earned more than cents hourly at the time i gave the two men a lift they were headed on foot for new york city miles away between the two they had cents in cash and only the clothes they wore they had left their camp the night before they said because there was no chance of earning enough money to subsist the stories they told were so typical of the cruel swindles i had heard many times before in other farm areas north and south that i brought them into new york staked them to a room at a ymca and taperecorded their stories two days later i rounded up some shirts and underwear and helped get them jobs at an upstate new york fruit cannery through the state employment service here are some of the things they told meon two hours of tape their crew leader deducted weekly for union dues for a union that doesnt exist the men had not signed any union membership cards they did not know the name of the union to which they paid dues the two said they were told that the deductions would be made for weeks i already knew the reason it was one of the gimmicks frequently used by labor contractors to write off the expense of transporting migrants from one stop to another in their recruiting pitches in the south contractors promise to bus or truck migrants up the road at no cost but they get back the money in hidden charges mr taylor and mr washington also declared that their crew leader deducted weekly for social security benefits mr washington emphasized that although he had lost his ss card he knew his number neither the contractor nor the timekeeper knew my number he said they never asked me the deductions were illegal even if the crew leader had known the number the maximum legal deduction is per cent of gross salary up to annually for the deductions to have been legal the crew leader workers would have to be paid at least weekly the two hitchhikers insisted that they had never grossed more than a week with the crew on paydays the men declared the crew boss charged his workers a pint for wine which retails for cents though state law requires that migrant farm workers be furnished with written statements of hours worked and wages received both men asserted they had never received such records another state law requires that farm labor contractors post in conspicuous places either in living quarters or at grading houses copies of labor contracts detailing wages and hours and charges for food and housing mr taylor who has completed years of public school education said he had never seen a labor contract posted and did not know the procedure was required these are just some of the many complaints of shoddy recordkeeping and questionable payroll operation that both men gave in their interviews mr washington said he had been paid nothing for his first week of work and that at the end of the second week he received for well over hours of work this was after the deduction of for meals weekly and for room rent sometimes the boss would pay us whatever he felt like mr washington explained no matter how many hours we worked mr taylor said that for his best week of work he received after union dues social security and food and lodging both men charged that there were many others at the camp who had been bilked by illegal charges the two men estimated they had been cheated out of a minimum of each one of their biggest gripes concerned what they called waiting time as mr taylor explained it if were loading potatoes off the grader and into trucks and the trucks are late we dont get paid for waiting but we have to work around the shed anyway stacking sacks of potatoes for the next trucks or just moving things around theres sometimes two or three hours between trucks were working but were not getting paid the time stops when the truck is loaded and it dont start until the next one comes in an intense serious young man mr taylors summation of the exploitation of migrant farm workers mirrors the feelings of the essential laborers about come into new york state every year who harvest the nations crops were getting cheated and we know it you gotta take it or leave we left i later made another visit to the camp tucked away in the trees to see for myself what the two men had left behind there glistening in the bright long island sun i found an explanation an expensive sedan was parked in front of the shabby quarters alongside a luxury car i had been told earlier by mr taylor and mr washington that they were owned by the crew leader and his wife
by s carter mcmorris in this time of national insecurity and perhaps because of it the status of the negro in american life is improving at a far faster rate than ever before integration even in t the notsosolid south is becoming a reality while political and economic and racial realism has resulted in greater acceptance of the negro by the majority american the problem of negro acceptance of himself has been neglected at the expense of full psychic benefit from his progress social scientists speak of a cultural lag between material and social progress by this is meant that man has devoted much attention to physical development with out the evolution of a philosophy to cope with the problems which yet remain and are in part a product of industrialization and scientific achievement in the same way there has been a lag between the advance of the minority american and his own selfimage so that as he reaches near equality with the majority american he continues to be the victim of his slaverybegun secondclasscitizenshipperpetuated feeling of physical and mental inferiority this ingrained inbred selfimage manifests itself daily in what i term the negros inhumanity to the negro his lack of confidence in and unwillingness to support and develop his own institutions and businesses and professions resulting in economic dependence to a greater extent than necessary upon the already established majority american the negros rejection of his business and professional class is rationalized in many ways that we must not ourselves discriminate against the majority group is the most popular we hear too that negro physicians for instance are not equally schooled that negro merchants charge more than white ones negro teachers cannot compete and negro lawyers are not respected in the courts all such expressions are only rationalizations and excuses to cover up the real motivating factor the deepseated feelings of inferiority and lack of confidence in themselves which plague the americans of color from the illiterate to the educated during the years of struggle between my graduation from high school and the time when i was able to begin the typically american unsubsidized and unaided college training i was an insurance salesman in various ohio and michigan cities nothing in my life has been more traumatic than this dawning realization of a sensitive young man not yet of majority of the strange loneliness occasioned by my own people literally slamming the door in my face because i was selling nigger insurance perhaps the psychology of the race is well summed up in the reputed statement of a negro woman asked why she did not buy her ice from a negro the white mans ice is colder i like to think that i have come a long way since those depressed years just before world war ii however i still suffer the same pain as a member of the legal profession at the rejection of colored members of my colleagues in preference to the man downtown when you know that the negro attorney has gone to the same schools passed the same examinations often specialized in school or practice and has successfully championed the civil_rights fight of his race from restrictive covenants to the school integration and sitin decisions you wonder what one has to do to convince the negro that his professional men are equal in ability with those of any other race if this race is ever going to find economic security full interracial acceptance and above all selfrespect we are going to have to change our philosophy straighten out our thinking in the first place we must not expect our business men to start out with the corporate capital now in the hands of the white business we must not for the purpose of discrimination but for that of equalization erect a kind of community tariff wall preferring goods and services of others of our race in much the same way that congress has had to erect tariffs to protect infant industries particularly at the beginning of this countrys industrial life when we could not compete with europes already developed economy any other policy is to make jobs with negro spending power for those of other races at a time when the latter have not adopted a policy of equality so that we are victims of a twoedged sword discrimination from within and from without even more important is the psychic effect the acceptance of racial inferiority status which selfrejection implies it is a little difficult to sell the idea of acceptance of the negro by others when he has not fully accepted himself this selfrejection is perhaps a natural consequence of living in a whiteoriented society a natural progression from childhoods white dolls a white santa claus even a white god to a belief that white is right generally but we must not surrender to this selfdefeating and not inevitable reaction the problem is one of racial selfeducation it is no justification to say that i feel inferior because the white man has taught me that i am we must mature become adults as a race and institute our own thinking on so vital a matter as racial equality we have spent so much time on converting the white man that we have closed our eyes to the fact that we have ourselves almost completely accepted white standards and prejudices even of physical attributes which distinguish race from race we must spend more time selling the negro to the negro we need a massed concerted effort which can include classroom discussions lectures editorials books magazine and newspaper articles sermons stories and plays to elevate our selfconception from the slough of inferiority and thus to see an end to the negros inhumanity to the negro the father of negro history mrcarter g j ir r woodson closed the m s book with a snap and threw it on the desk his dark eyes were the father of negro history by agnes behling o wmb stormy and his thin lips more compressed than usual as he arose strode over to the window and stared out over the college campus it is always the same he muttered to himself it is the white man who writes the history books to show that all major contributions to civilization have been made by various branches of the white race through the open window came the voices of negro students on their way to classes what incentive do these young people have to overcome their feelings of inferiority to rise above their handicaps to struggle to attain their rightful place in modem society it was the question to which for many years he had tried to find the answer for a time he stood in deep thought then with the clenched fist of his right hand he smartly struck the palm of his left and exclaimed i will do it today with that he hurriedly left the room to his associates it was inconceivable that at the height of his educational career dr woodson deliberately should decide to resign from his position as dean in order to devote the rest of his life if need be to help put the negro back into the history books to carter g woodson it was only another step in the long climb to rise above the limitations of his birth and early environment and in that struggle to lead the underprivileged to a realization of their hopes and ambitions to james and anne eliza woodson former slaves on december was born a son whom they named carter godwin as a member of a large family he grew accustomed to the many privations due to poverty but only one seriously mattered to him the inability to attend even the poor schools provided when the little farm could no longer provide a living carter went to work in a coal mine in west virginia the work was hard the hours long the pay poor but through sheer determination he forced himself to master the fundamental subjects until at the age of twenty he entered his first school the douglass high school in huntington west virginia so intense was his interest and so untiring his efforts that he finished the four year course in less than two between he earned the degree of litt b at berea college in kentucky just six years from the time he had entered douglass high school as a student he became its principal in the years which followed he served as supervisor of schools in the philippines a teacher of language and history in high schools in washington d c a dean of the school of liberal arts at howard university and finally at the college of west virginia in spite of heavy teaching duties and financial difficulties his relentless quest for more knowledge drove him on to earn the b a and m a degrees from the university of chicago to study abroad and at length in to receive his ph d from harvard during the years of study teaching travel and other personal contacts he learned much that was of interest about his own people but little of it was to be found in books research convinced him that writers of history often distorted facts and either consciously or unconsciously misrepresented information about the contributions of his people to human progress history as it was taught gave the young negro an inferiority complex and left him restless and depressed not to know the stirring and significant events of the past which described his peoples continual struggle for improved living conditions better education and equal opportunities had left youth without a sense of appreciation for past achievements and thus had failed to provide incentive toward which to work for the future more than anything else in life carter g woodson wanted youngsters to grow up with this appreciation of their own possibilities which could be gained only through a knowledge of the contributions which black folk had made to history to this end by he almost singlehandedly founded the association for the study of negro life and history whose objective was to fortify racial pride by supporting facts and knowledge concerning racial heritage this undertaking was soon followed by the journal of negro history which aimed to furnish the factual background necessary for the interpretation of problems related to the education of the negro occasionally dr woodson obtained small grants from foundations but usually he paid from his own modest salaries to support his research projects and the publication and circulation of valuable books about the negro negro history week february with its emphasis on the proud american was initiated by dr woodson because he believed that history is a record of the progress of mankind and in that sense negro history is a necessary part of both national and world history many admired carter g woodsons achievements but few became close friends for his singlemindedness of purpose and missionary zeal frequently did not attract the sympathetic understanding of those about him those who knew him best often described him as stubborn formidable and independent he seemed to begrudge the time and effort necessary to cultivate those personality traits and personal habits which might have drawn others to him and given him wider public acclaim to him these things were unimportant for there was so much to be done and he had begun so late in life when asked why he had no home of his own or had never married dr woodson would explain my work is my only wife modest circumstances necessitated his living in lodging houses and eating his meals in restaurants at times he could be genial but usually he was less at home with adults than children his associates described his life as spartan in its simplicity for he did not smoke or drink tennis was his only sport and about his only pastimes were the theater and the long soltary walks during which he planned future activities mary mcleod bethune a contemporary characterized him as living for decades among his books constantly searching collecting studying writing and editing when he died on april there was no need to erect a memorial in his honor for during his busy lifetime he had built his own as tangible evidence of his achievements he left a legacy of sixteen books about the negro hundreds of articles and monographs in his chosen field and many reviews of books written about the negroes of other lands his journal of negro history and negro history bulletin still are an invaluable source of information for those research students who would study or write about the negro the negro in our history now in its eighth edition still is used by colleges throughout the nation and the story of the negro retold is read as eagerly by high school students as elementary school children learn about their heroes from the negro makers of history death came before he could complete his most ambitious undertaking a six volume encyclopedia africana however any such encyclopedia when published undoubtedly will contain many of the articles edited and published by dr woodson as well as the materials from those whom he inspired to help in his resurrection of the lost history of his people as a living if less tangible legacy he left behind the inspired leadership of those whose minds had become imbued with his principles and ideas perhaps even more significantly by his example dr carter woodson taught the youth of his own and of the present time not to give in or give up but to rise in spite of all handicaps to their highest potential by convincing them that neither the intelligence nor the capacity is lacking once their possibilities are realized in the national association for the advancement of colored people awarded dr woodson the spingarn medal for outstanding achievements in he received an honorary degree from virginia state college and a similar degree from howard university in after his death his people showed the high esteem in which they held the father of negro history by naming him the third distinguished american in the ebony hall of fame the american dilemma e v i s i d as we can now look back over the era of reconstruction with the wisdom of hindsight we see clearly that the reason so much went wrong and why so little permanent improvement of the lot of the negroes in the south resulted was this that the political revolution was not backed up by economic and social reform as usual the leaders of that time tried to do great things too cheaply without paying the costs the slogan six acres and a mule was never taken seriously by those in powerjust as in most of the underdeveloped countries of the world today where land and tenancy reforms are proposed as programs and sometimes even enacted into law but frustrated and nullified by the resistance of the vested interests i draw this parallel between the fate of the negro people in america during reconstruction and that of the downtrodden masses in underdeveloped countries at the present time because i believe it has a lesson to teach us if we want to avert disaster today too a radical revolution has been carried out the liquidation of colonial domination but vicious economic and social systems which colonial governments had found it to their advantage not to disturb have largely been left intact in some countries inequalities are in fact increasing now history is repeating itself on a much bigger scale it is not now a matter of a small minority of a few millions in one single country as it was in post civil war time in america today huge majorities of many hundreds of millions in the greater part of the world outside the soviet orbit are affected the stage is international and not merely national and the problems it presents are immensely dangerous in the present tense state of international relations dominated by the cold war in america this type of reconstruction led to the great national compromise worked out in the late s the negro people were left again to the mercy of the white upper caste in the south now embittered by all that had followed their military defeat economically the south deteriorated to a colonial status in its relation to the north and as late as the thirties franklin roosevelt could still characterize the south as the nations problem number one in the north there was instead exceedingly rapid economic expansion though under rugged individualism and rampant corruption of government from which america as we know has still not entirely freed itself thereafter for more than half a centuryindeed until the end of the thirtiesthe status of the negro people remained on the whole about unchanged there were advances on some fronts but retreats on others twenty years ago this era of relative stagnation so far as the negroes position is concerned had so impressed itself on american thinking that even the social scientists had generally come to believe that it was the natural order of things progress was foredoomed to be very gradual and slow they believed and nothing very much could be done to speed it up in my study of the negro problem in america at that time i came to the contrary conclusion however that this period of stagnation was only a temporary balancing of forces which were just on the verge of being broken i saw big changes in the offing and as we know this actually happened these last twenty years have been filled with advances on all fronts in the labor market in education in the fields of social welfare and housing in the structure of law and law observance and generally in the enjoyment of more equal opportunities to do things to move in society to work produce and consume without meeting segregation and discrimination no historical trend of social change is a straight line and there have been occasional setbacks prejudice itself is also slow to disappear though its legal and institutional retaining walls are crumbling there is still a long road to travel before america becomes in fact the egalitarian country of its creed but in historical perspective the rapidity of progress is astonishing let us remember that practically all of this progress has taken place in the short period of the last twenty years following six decades of stagnationand that its coming was not anticipated by most students of the american scene i have found it not inappropriate to use this occasion for reminding us of some broad traits of the history of the negro people over the past century just as an individual for the sake of his sanity needs to maintain continuity with his earliest memories so also groups of people need to be clear about where they came from and how they have fared if they are to understand where they stand today and the direction in which they are moving the progressive achievements of recent years have not been won without efforts every individual advance on the whole broad front has had to be fought for sometimes against fierce resistance in the general advance unfortunate in cidents occur which deeply disturb the participants but we should not expect the uprooting of racial inequality in the face of inherited and emotionladen prejudices to be frictionless in a sense unpleasant incidents even have a function to fulfill in this process of advance in the last chapter of an american dilemma i quoted a remark once made to me by a prominent and conservative negro social scientist in the south i can now reveal that the man i characterized in this way was my late friend charles s johnson the great sociologist and the first negro president of fisk university he stated as his considered opinion that tensions are not necessarily bad and that under certain conditions even race riots may have wholesome effects in the long run he continued in about the following way they stir up peoples conscience people will have to think matters over they prevent things from becoming settled if the race situation should ever become fixed if the negro were really accommodated then and only then would i despair about a continued great improvement for negroes as long as there is friction and fighting there is hope in this light the little rock disturbances and the many other unfortunate incidents reported daily in the american press have their positive role to play in giving momentum to social advance i realize that it is much easier for an outsider to take this lofty philosophical view than it is for the american citizen who has a duty to take a part in pressing social advance as rapidly as possible and it must be particularly difficult for the young negro intellectual who bears scars in his soul from all that yet remains of segregation and discrimination in american life nevertheless i maintain that it is important to see clearly that the trend moves steeply upwards in order to avoid discouragement and to sustain the determination required in the skirmishing that may still be necessary in this new epoch the negro cause is a winning one i have not the slightest doubt that we shall continuously see great improvement in the negros status in american society and i even foresee that the rising trend of the past two decades will accelerate it would take me too far afield to explain all my reasons for this conviction but among them on the material side is the growing affluence of society which provides more elbow room for everybody and has little interest in pushing anybody into the ditch on the spiritual side there is the reality of the ideals enshrined in your constitution and rooted in the hearts of the american people with rising levels of education the hold of these ideals in america is continuously strengthened increasingly the false and derogatory be liefs about negroes whiih have filled the function of rationalizing prejudices can be expressed only by those willing to betray their own lack of culture as the white and negro people are increasingly mingling in work and pleasure all are discovering that they are the same sort of people with the same cultural moorings the same likes and dislikes and the same aspirations and ambitions for themselves and for america just as until women are completely emancipated every ambitious woman has also to stand for womens rights so even today every negro intellectual must feel called upon to supplement his work in his chosen vocation by being a race man this situation will remain until negroes are generally accepted everywhere on par with the whites it is for this reason that we find my friend and former collaborator ralph bunche who is working with so much distinction in the united nations peacebuilding efforts in the world taking off time now and then to speak out for the negroes but increasingly the spokesmen for negroes are finding that there are white people championing the same cause the changes now underway have important implications and they will require more radical adjustments than earlier generations were called upon to make what we shall see happening and what has already happened to considerable extent is that the negro intellectual increasingly steps out of his spiritual isolation and becomes simply an american amongst other americans and a human being amongst us all the negro social scientist will less and less be preoccupied with research on the negro community and will strike out in other and broader fields the negro doctor and dentist and lawyer will increasingly serve white patients and clients this implies however that negroes also will go to white doctors dentists and lawyers similar changes in the activities of negro clergymen and teachers can also be expected i should not be fully candid with you if at this point i did not stress another implication of the integration of the negroes in the wider american society namely that the negro professional middle and upper class will have to surrender economic monopolies which they have held and are still holding on the basis of prejudice the future society of equality is a society of free competition and you will have to face it and prepare yourselves to deal with it successfully you cannot cry for the breaking down of the walls of segregation and discrimination while at the same time hoping to retain petty monopoly preserves among a negro clientele to give you a comfortable and uncontested economic safety you must have the courage to choose a harder life in which your abilities will be tested against the norms established in the wider american society and indeed in the whole world in the future america of our dreams not only all schools but also all institutions for higher education will stand open to all according to personal merit and independent of race and color this will ultimately happen also in the south in such an america there will be no place for a negro university i am therefore confidently looking forward to a day even if it is not tomorrow when howard and fisk and atlanta universities are not dissimilar in the composition of their faculties and student bodies from other universities in this country this of course impliesand indeed requires as a conditionthat all the other universities will have negro professors and negro students as a normal thing as the integration process proceeds the problems of the negroes will gradually tend to disappear as separate problems for a long time yet there will undoubtedly be problems of breaking down segregation and discrimination against negro families in housing but the general problem of slum clearance in american cities is the bigger and more important one and the negros stake in that bigger problem is the greater as there is no hope for a satisfactory separate solution to the housing problems of negroes as long as slums remain a blot on american citiesthe schools most negro children attend are bad in the south and often in some parts of the north but many other schools are also bad and the best hope for negroes particularly in this period of desegregation is a campaign for improving the schools generally likewise negroes as members of the group still most disadvantaged in american society have a particular interest in the extention of social security an area in which america is still rather backward particularly in the field of health and hospitalization by comparison with the most advanced countries in this situation it is both natural and necessary that negroes should support and join those forces in american society which stand for general social and economic progress when narrower group interests are submerged and the pursuit of social advance for the whole community is brought to the fore a major step towards the complete integration of negroes in american society will have been taken it probably still is broadly true though less now than twenty or thirty years ago that the negroes are the last hired and the first fired and the incidence of unemployment on negro workers is disproportionately heavy the state of full employment created by the war and preserved in the immediate postwar years was of great importance on the economic side in supporting the rising trend of the negros status the relative economic stagnation in america and the high level of unemployment in the fifties is for the same reason particularly menacing for negro advance if continued stagnation should be the lasting condition for the american economy in the decades to come it will for america spell frustration internally and externally and it might even slow down the upward trend of negro advance i have talked about to fight discrimination against negroes in the labor market remains naturally a task that cannot be relaxed but much more important is the recreation of the conditions for american economic progress as nothing is more effective in liquidating discrimination than full employment and a rising trend of incomes to all in this way the cause of raising the status of the negroes in america and stamping out the remnants of segregation and discrimination is bound up more closely than ever before with all the progressive causes in the country as american negroes you have no reason to have a split personality the integration of the negroes in american society has already proceeded so far that without any hesitation you can feel that what is good for america is good for the negroesand equally you can feel that what is good for the negroes is good for america by peter pan all this week i have y felt very conspicuous everyone i have met s has seen the pearl primus show the smart cocktail party set the bright intellectuals the very important socialites theyve all been to the j k randle memorial hall in lagos who is miss primus if you havent heard of her i wouldnt blame you although if you take my advice you shouldnt say it because she is publicized as the world famous exponent of african traditional dances and the smart sophisticated thing these days is to know all the world famous exponents of this or that miss primus is an american her nationality is a priceless asset in nigeria today as far as cultural art goes especially as her skin happens to be black i havent seen miss primus dance how unsophisticated and thats what makes me so selfconscious yet if miss primus spent the rest of her life dancing in lagos there is one citizen shell never see at her showme if she packed out of nigeria tomorrow there is one citizen who and me would sing a song of joy breathe a great sigh of relief miss primus and the whole lot of them who are coming to sell african culture to the africans should get out of the continent we are fed up with being treated as children who must be humored and then the condescension the hypocrisy and the amateurishness sickens me i sent a reporter to interviewmiss primus when she arrived the reporter wrote a caption to the picture saying that miss primus had come to teach nigerians how african traditional dances can be adapted to the modem stage afterwards she will return to the united states and dance for her degree i completely lost my temper with the reporter who i asked furiously is miss primus to teach africans their own dances well said the reporter she has been in africa four times now so what i raved miss primus can spend the rest of her life in africa it still doesnt make an exponent of her i made a solemn pledge a few months ago never again to see people like miss primus it was after the ams ac american society of african culture festival in lagos during which some leading american negro showbusiness people were invited from the united states my criticism of their performance did not go down too well with certain people who are only too ready to gloss and gush over anything foreign i was told that i didnt know a thing i was talking about besides the people concerned were worldfamous so who was i to so much as raise a query well you get that kind of people otherwise psychiatrists would be out of business what makes miss primus world famous it is the fact that she has done on broadway what few others have doneape african dances and anyway anyone who is known on broadway automatically is worldfamous even though you and i never heard of her what makes michael olatunji famous in america he started something new on broadway he brought a hoarse african voice to a showbusiness world used to the smooth and cultured voices of the bing crosbys the paul robesons olatunji combined his act with rowdy boisterous drumming and then of course at least the words he sang were authentic african he quickly became a curiosity and a star was born the other day amsac had the effrontery to bring olatunji over here and try to play him up lets face it olatunjis drumming is tenth grade stuff any pennyatune drummer in the streets of lagos given the same opportunity would humiliate him there was that fellow too at the amsac festivala man called geoffrey holder he was billed to do some voodoo dance or some other rubbish like that i felt sorry for him as this giant tried to writhe like a boa constrictor back and forth on the stage as far as he was concerned african dances were all writhing and crying hoa as the mood took him there was nothing african in his dance except the rafia kilt and the commercial beads oh yes the clowns jangling belts too then the message that constantly rings in our ears now that you are independent we will do all we can to help you develop your culture how many times have i heard that since october no one can help us develop our culture our culture exists if anyone wants to exploit it he is welcome provided he is man enough to admit his own limitations the culture of africa may yet suffer the same fate as our history we didnt have the education to write our own history and it fell to british officers to write inaccurate histories it is the same now with our culture we do not have the money to exploit it ourselves but there are people who have instead of them helping to exploit it by cooperation they are steadily imposing their own amateurish standards on us and like the mugs we are we turn out by the thousands to cheer them the underlining philosophy is so fundamentally wrong wrong for the sponsors of these visits and wrong for us who patronize the shows i would gladly go and see a jazz concert tomorrow by any american showman visiting lagos i wouldnt mind sitting for three hours listening to odetta singing negro spirituals the people who infuriate me are the pearl primus kind and the geoffrey holders who have the nerve to come out to africa and bamboozle people and of course the other group of people who drive me crazy are the soppy intellectuals and socialites in our midst twice now samuel akpabot has organized a variety show in lagos were those knowalls who are supposed to love african art there not on your life ask them their impression on felix idubors latest carving and they will ask you if idubor is a russian ask them about emokpae and they turn up their noses and start a learned treatise on rembrandt if the people who imported the geoffrey holders and pearl primuses persist there is one nigerian who wont be buying their ticketme by rev charles h king after a number of years observing shouters i have come to the conclusion that todays shouters lack artistic means of utilizing to their best adother vantage movements that are calculated to bring the desired results shouting is an art it should not be undertaken without the basic understanding that unlike arts the spotlight is forever on the performer during its execution bad shouts attract just as much attention as good shouts a performance is only as good as the performer works to make it shouting is slowly passing off the scene and the reason for its demise is that those who presently engage in this ecstatic spiritual pleasure of our forefathers or more accurately foremothers lack the inspirational techniques that would attract potential adherents to the shouting profession this should be corrected our churches are becoming dry there are times in which no verbal assent is forthcoming even when the minister boards the gravy train this has a tendency to make the minister look foolish while frankly he longs for others to share in his foolishness head shaking nodding and weak amens do little to compensate for his sweating statistics reveal that in times past every drop of sweat during the course of the gravy would produce a minimum of three shouts per hundred pew fillers the tragic consequence of this is that many churches are losing consecrated sweating clergymen to mass churches which guarantee shouts for every explosive truth this exodus on the part of the clergy has left many of our churches high and dry many of them finding that mere tears are not adequate expressions of mixing with the gravy are seeking other avenues of expressionssuch as rapidfanning neighbornudging approvals spikedheel tappings and quick snaps of the head in an up and down fashion consequently running the risk of a broken neck to accompany their broken spirits this will never do and many delta raised chicken lovers have voiced their dissatisfaction at annual state and national conventions where such matters between factional electional squabbles are the main order of the day integration has not helped matters shouters are guilty of appraising the level of listeners and responding in like manner many shouters have been seen cautiously peering behind them to view the ethnic makeup on given sundays and upon noticing the invasion of the service by others then refus to shout even though its mothers day such hypocrisy is unforgivable are honest welltrained shouters the only answer it is obvious that something should be done ministers are growing weak in their efforts to produce calculated calamity it has been discovered that climatic utterances such as early early early one sunday morning even when accompanied by pulling off of coats and throwing of the handkerchief produce only mild ejaculations from sleepy deacons the shouters have failed us aunt jane would turn over in her grave if she realized that our churches are depending upon the badly played organ to give us our shakes and quakes we must remember our heritage and arouse ourselves to the task of shouting integration or no integration our spirits must visibly express themselves on top of pews and up and down the aisles the times demand it somehow we must stir up the gifts that once put clapping in our hands and running in our feet the time is now we are fast losing our young people who find enjoyment in attending episcopalian book review services they are attending churches where the minister instead of praying please suh let love run from heart to heart and breast to breast is praying for such intangible commodities as world peace what is preventing this spirit from running from heart to heart and breast to breast could it be that the spirit is tired of running a heart to heart and breast to breast journey does not on the surface appear to be unnecessarily fatiguing the inability of aunt jane to fill her pulsating breast has left her high and dry in an extensive effort to get to the bottom of this problemthe demise of the artistic shouti have discovered several contributing factors that make for silent pews first of all shouts the few that remain are oftimes completely unplanned and illtimed the hate shout which at one time was as efficient as the atomic bomb has through the progression of love or some other inconsiderate shout preventerlost its delicate touch the hate shout as i recall had its beginning early in the service the hate shouting sister arriving at the door at oclock would completely ignore the seating suggestion of the usher running her eyes over the congregation until she found sister petunia with her head bowed down as the deacon prayed silently tipping down the aisle with a respectfully bowed head she counted the pews until she arrived at her destination with a quick move to the right she gracefully plopped beside sister petunia sister petunia interrupting her meditation sneaked a quick glance to her left she viewed with consternation the hate shouting sister whom she had succeeded as president of the chitterling dinner committee it was not petunias fault that the members of the committee found out that the hate shouting sister had been taking more chitterlings home to her twelve children and lazy husband than the church law allowed it had been an honest election and petunia had won although now viewing the shouting muscles of the expresident she prayerfully wished she had lost as the deacon finished his prayer asking for a place somewhere in the kingdom all upraised heads quickly appraised the situation and from the pulpit to the pews it was silently concurred that some good shouting would take place this morning it was no accident that the hate shouting sister had chosen this morning to wear an outlandish charm bracelet this bracelet had large gilded gold links mementoes of her husbands days on the chain gang lethal perhaps but one had to admit they were pretty even though they were hanging looser than usual sister petunia seeking some avenue of escape from the shout that was sure to come was dismayed to discover that to her right sat big lucy pounds of contrary obstinancy clasping in her arms a sniveling yearold infant resigning herself to the inevitable she sat back to await her thrashing her only hope it appeared was that the preacher would not board the gravy train her hopes were in vain at the conclusion of his message he boarded that train it was between the stations of closing up hymnbooks and bibles and one of these ole days that the hate shouting sister got happy today sister petunia unhappily displays a face that has been marked by the spirit of course loving ones neighbor in spite of chitterling misunderstanding would have prevented the above from occurring but it can be plainly seen that more love would eliminate the hate shout entirely we must refine this type of shout to workable and acceptable proportions let us examine a few artistic means of accomplishing this worthwhile aim first why does not the hate shouter combine her strategy with the art of the running shout the running shout allows its executor more freedom more targets and less chance of being churched this packaged bargain in shouting must not be overlooked let us examine its highlights the execution is simple it allows the shouter to sit where she pleases and at the appropriate moment dash out into the aisle and traverse at will will of course moves out of her way for he knows what is forthcoming with a running start the hate shouter could have flung her arms with deadly aim petunia and the entire committee would have fallen before her happiness what glorious opportunities the hate shouter misses when she fails to utilize the running shout think also of the shouts that will take place the following sunday the prospects of such a high time in the spirit will fill the pews to capacity i think it of sufficient import however to sound a warning there is a danger in the running shout that should be pointed out the direction traversed should be in the direction of pulpittorear and not from walltowall walltowall runners have discovered that the shortened distance can be miscalculated while in the throes of happy hate and the walls can be formidable obstacles that refuse to yield to the runner testimonials are on record that walltowall hate shouters would rather be hate shout receivers than to meet a hard cold unchristian wall admittedly some have not survived to testify at all building committees should bear this in mind when planning the new church many churches have eliminated walls altogether illtimed shouts are those that occur sometimes during offeringthe solemnity of the moment does not lend itself to the dignity of the shouter falling out at a time like this only increases suspicions of dodging of dues likewise during the announcements granted that some church announcements should cause us to fall out we should save these shouts for when they are able to create the most distraction at the most opportune time the meditation period has been experimented on by manyand reports are very effectively those who would desire more and better shouting would do well to learn a few of the techniques and responsive chords that must be struck prior to the eruption one principle that must never be forgotten is that of selfprotection the shouter should not rock from sidetoside while building up emotions such movements only give forewarning to innocent bysitters they do not deserve such warning neither should one slide down the pews church pews are more than often made of solid oak and splinters of this type are difficult to extract glasses should unobtrusively be removed as soon as the shouting target is spotted unless of course you yearn to attract more attention in the future by being known as the blind shouting sister admittedly it might enhance your shouting prestige but all shouters should intelligently weigh the pros and cons of the issues involved now that we have dealt with self protection let us move on to key words that will allow us to shout with trained proficiency shouting requires the utmost discipline and we must train ourselves to this end what are these key words first you must choose the words that fit your makeup good shouts vary j with the tastes and the moods of the i shouter since new words are be i ing discovered every sunday that i bring about emotional responses let us deal only with those words that we know are tried and true mother is effective only if she is gone normally permission is granted for unusual shouting on mothers day born again a word of caution here do not shout on this word unless you really are really born again again a word of caution shouting on really bom again is normally reserved for members of the mothers board jesus shout here only if the word is repeated ten times in succession and the preacher is sweating it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the minister is appealing to your intellect or your emotions be certain which one you respond todont mix them up hes all right there are no restrictions here this has been a timetested shoutgetting expression shout as often as you like on this one heaven statistical analysis has discovered that heaven today is entitled only to a short grunt do not exert yourself to reach this goal for you probably wont the susceptibility of any given shouter to the key words mentioned unfortunately depend upon the hard times and tribulations experienced during the week and herein lies the answer to the dilemma of the vanishing shouter if a really hard time has been experienced one may safely shout after hearing the word jesus one time if a really hard time has been experienced during the week this same word should authenticate a screaming yell upon its second rendition let us face facts because of the lack of hard times shouting is disappearing from our churches we can blame this on the welfare poor relief and reciprocal child support laws prosperity has left the shouter speechless miracle drugs have taken us off our beds of affliction consequently taking away good shouting material penicillin vitamins and other enemies have invaded the sacred territory of our once happily decaying bodies divorces are freeing us from unhappy shouting gems of trouble those who shout now must be really sick the emergence of negro college stars and teams in integrated competition is one of the great but unheralded sports stories of our times there are several aspects of significance the success of the ralph bostons willie galimores wilma rudolphs tennessee states and florida a m universities prove that negro coaches too are talented it proves that when trained properly and properlyequipped negro athletes can overcome the vast handicaps imposed upon them in southern states to compete on even terms with others who are more fortunate it proves that segregated white schools make themselves appear ludicrous when they go chasing white athletes all over the country in a mad quest of wins when right there in their own territories are to be found untapped goldmines of athletic talent it proves that slowly but surely times are changing everybody agrees that times are changing for the better everybody that is except the segregationist soreheads and people who would like to see the clock run counterclockwise for a while the only basic reason why the allnegro college exists is racial prejudice and racial segregation which is perhaps being attacked by a slowlycreeping death in the south which is not to say however that the nowallnegro college will soon disappear except such schools as lincoln university in pennsylvania lincoln university in missouri possibly west virginia state central state college in wilberforce ohio and howard university in washington no major allnegro or once allnegro college exists outside the south a certain amount of integration principally involving children of caucasian teachers and exchange students has existed in a few of the allnegro schools for years in recent years the two lincolns howard central state and west virginia state have increased their own integration process and to some extent this has been reflected on their athletic squads pennsylvanias lincoln university listed a caucasian lineman on its football team roster in the late s or early s but the original purpose of these schools dating back to miners teachers college washington d c and lincoln university pennsylvania was to provide college or university education for negro students who otherwise never would have been beneficiaries of this vastlyimportant privilege booker t washington and his students at tuskegee institute in alabama founded were so hungry and thirsty for knowledge that they built their own college up from the ground with their own hands manufacturing bricks mortar cement beds chairs benches mattresses raising their own food making their own clothes in each case where men were enrolled in sufficient numbers in these schools sports entered the picture as a part of an aimedfor wellrounded educational program often there was but one coachin some cases a volunteer in others a graduate of the big white northern universitiesand he taught classes coached all sports set up schedules laid out athletic fields scrounged for equipment handled his own secretarial affairs and was just about it and all on the job working for a pittance but determined to do a job and dedicated to an ideal those negro college coaches were heroesas heroic as any fullback or guard or homerun hitter they ever developed into stardom and fan adulation this obtains even until this day in the south for a s jake gaither is no less a heroic figure in florida a m university annuals than is their prided football graduate willie galimore of the chicago bears no amount of praise is too lavish for the early negro college coaches or for that matter for the jake gaithers over the years they have developed more outstanding negro athletesthough many of them were never heard of outside the negro press and negro communitiesthan any other agency they provided an opportunity for healthy competition for play for athletic development in the face of common official disinterest and lethargy one famed negro college president whose school received hundreds of thousands of dollars annually was so callous to football that he refused to provide a training table for the athletes and other difficulties which would have broken the strength of a fullhaired samson one scans the negro college coaching ranks and finds supercoaches among them coaches whose records match or surpass those of rockne rupp leahy brown among those supercoaches were or are little eddie hurt of morgan state college baltimore cleve abbott of tuskegee henry kean of tennessee state harry jefferson of virginia state and other schools jake gaither of florida a m and johnny mclendon of tennessee state north carolina college hampton et al in this context it is interesting to note that william h lewis and w t s jackson attended a negro schoolvirginia normal and collegiate institutebefore migrating to amherst johnson c smith university and livingstone college played the first negro college football game on thanksgiving day j c smiththen called biddle collegewon the game to lincoln howard tuskegee began playing football with hampton shaw of north carolina and virginia union football quickly spread to negro colleges throughout the south and the fables told about the roughandtough roc em sockem negro stars of that era are no less fantastic and bloodcurdling and unbelievable today than similar feats credited to fielding yosts pointaminute boys bronko nagurski pudge heffelfinger et al football of course was merely one sport the negro colleges played all of the popular games baseball basketball boxing track and field adding as time passed tennis swimming a bit of golf but no known polo often particularly in the early days equipment was inferior and the depth of onfield talent and coaching was no match for that of the caucasian schools but the zeal was there the players had a ball and so did the fans arkansas baptist college and tuskegee were early greats in baseball arkansas baptist was undefeated during the season during tuskegee won games and lost only three not a few negro baseball as well as football and basketball stars moved from college into semiprofessional and professional games satchel paige claims to have matriculated at tuskegee a few weeks he is also credited with having attended knoxville college or months wherehe has saidhe sang with the quartet tuskegee also pioneered a good grade of tennis in the early days and the negro colleges even in our time play an important role in the development of this game althea gibson attended florida a m university as financial conditions improved negro colleges built gymnasiums football stadiums tennis courts baseball diamonds and a few installed swimming facilities hampton students were blessed with a waterfront campus in recent years particularly since when the supreme court outlawed segregation in southern education statesupported negro colleges have built physical education plants equal or superior to those of similarsized caucasian colleges of the south and north grambling in louisiana tennessee state florida a mto cite threeare excellent examples of this trend negro colleges have played a leading role in womens sports particularly in track and field which is generally downgraded by american caucasians tuskegee again was a leader here and the world is now familiar with wilma rudolph and the tigerbelles of tennessee state the tuskegee team won the national aau womens track and field championship in the athletic world was just beginning to become accustomed to the onslaught of male negro athletes on records and to negro champions in sports says edwin henderson when the tuskegee girls bolted up from the south it is conservative to say that press dispatches created a sensation the first athletic association among negro schools was organized in in washington d c it was called the interscholastic athletic association of the middle atlantic states members were an unusual combination of colleges and high schools their first event a track and field meetwas held at howard university on may a few years later several negro college conferences sprouted among them the colored intercollegiate athletic association southern intercollegiate athletic conference midwestern athletic association and southwestern athletic conference these conferences established rules of control and conduct arranged schedules and in other ways gave the negro college athletic programs a form of organization never before evident among the leading organizers of negro college conferences were charles h williams of hampton ciaa e m walker of haven miss teachers college south central athletic conference organized in j c williams of cheyney pa teachers college middle atlantic athletic association r b atwood of kentucky state college mwaa w b metcalf and e c silsby of talladega in alabama and b t harvey of morehouse si a a and d c fowler of texas college swaa these organizations inaugurated and stimulated interconference competition as well as increased intraconference competition established a system of maintaining records and sparked the citing of national champions americas second oldest postseason football bowl gamethe prairie view bowl game started by prairie view college of texas was first played in but the biggest bowl game in the history of negro colleges is the orange blossom classic sponsored each year by florida a m and played annually in miamis orange bowl stadium the organization of conferences brought another important development tournaments and championships both regional and national public interest in negro college play was whetted by negro newspapers the first permanent negro newspaper sports section was founded by frank a fay young and the chicago defender through the years all substantial negro newspapers have developed sports sections among the most sportsconscious publications were or are the defender pittsburgh courier afroamerican kansas city call cleveland callpost michigan chronicle norfolk va journal and guide new york amsterdam news houston informer atlanta daily world founder also of the wideawake progressive wrong fan club and the los angeles sentinel prominent negro magazinesparticularly ebony and jethave devoted much space to the reporting or featuring of negro sports activities during the s jet magazine became the first negro publication to promote an interracial allamerica team including the best negro and white players in both negro and caucasian schools without regard to race or region among the most appreciative athletes honored by jet were caucasian gridders from southern schools in order to develop relations with the press negro colleges too have hired sports publicists fewif any college sports publicists in the nation surpass the talent or production of florida a ms charles j smith gramblings collie nicholson and tennessee states earl s clanton in negro america of late many racial organizations have formed the habit of removing the words negro or colored from their organizational titlesthe controversial theory being that racialtagging lessens the worth and effectiveness of these groups in democratic society the colored intercollegiate athletic association following this trend became the central intercollegiate athletic association from the ciaas th anniversary brochure one learns a great deal about how sports began and grew not only in ciaa schools but in all negro colleges the early history of the central intercollegiate athletic association was tempered by a conscious effort to control athletics and intercollegiate competition says frank w render ii in an article allen washington and c h williams of hampton institute earnest j marshall of howard university george johnson of lincoln university w e atkins charles r fraser and h p hargrave of shaw university and j w barco and j w pierce of virginia union university met at hampton in creating the genesis of the association which was then known as the colored intercollegiate athletic association in addition to the original colleges virginia seminary and college lynchburg and virginia normal and industrial institute now virginia state college at petersburg joined the ciaa during its first decade as late as the conference had an annual expenditure of less than but the conference was tightknit had firm resolute leadership in the founders and w a rogers va normal w r brown hampton l l watson howard f j rogers shaw and t l puryear va normal athletic buffs of the midtwenties will not forget the realization of the firm unquestionable establishment of the ciaa when the conference proved that it was stronger than any one member institution and would not fold the howardlincoln controversy with the ciaa which resulted in the withdrawal of howard from the league until gave evidence to the strength of the association which by this time had admitted st pauls a t and j s smith to membership virginia seminary and livingstone college salisbury n c resigned from the conference in the latter having been admitted only a year earlier north carolina state now north carolina college at durham bluefield w va state teachers college and morgan state baltimore were admitted during this period when the country was troubled with the beginnings of farreaching financial problems creating the great depression the ciaa survived the nationwide monetary decline and before it was over st augustines college had come into the fold the bitter mixed with the sweet a historic session of ciaa officials meeting at virginia state college voted for the suspension of lincoln university pa in february for violating a conference regulation the institution was reinstated in september of the same year the field of sports broadened for ciaa schools although football basketball and track have almost unwavering popularity baseball and tennis were in their heyday while boxing and wrestling were relatively new sports the conference became affiliated with the american olympic association in having joined the national collegiate athletic association in still the ciaa exercised its aim to keep its members in line and when in morgan state was found guilty of not honoring a league regulation the college was suspended war was the issue in the early forties when west virginia state was admitted as the ciaa extended to its western limit the second great worldencompassing conflict depleted the athletic ranks of all colleges and particularly some of the colleges with limited enrollment a special meeting of ciaa representatives convened at morgan in may and september after which league rules were modified so that colleges could use all available men in their respective athletic programs after the war ended in the original regulations were again enforced delaware state and winstonsalem entered the ciaa and athletes became more plentiful during the postwar period in current history racial integration helped the west virginia members move into their state college league west virginia state left the ciaa in after producing nearlyunbeatable basketball teams and bluefield slipped out in leaving a history of rockhewn football powerhouses but not before fayetteville n c state and maryland state entered in to give the ciaa its greatest number of members extending miles northsouth from and just west of philadelphia almost to south carolina and miles eastwest from the atlantic coast to the heart of the west virginia coal region lincoln one of the original five dropped intercollegiate football and resigned from the conference in with the most recent addition elizabeth n c city the ciaa sustains a membership of colleges and universities the conference is operated through its officers and the newlyestablished office of the commissioner former coaching great harry jefferson located at hampton institute as founder williams stated probably the ciaas greatest contribution has been its pioneer work in promoting clean vigorous amateur athletics and high standards of sportsmanship this work has been in a field fraught with wonderful possibilities not only has it helped to give the public a finer appreciation of young men and women giving them some elementary conception of the fundamental truth that the great results in this world are attained only when men work loyally and heartily together for the attainment of a common end the history of the ciaafirst and oldest of the major college athletic conferences among negroesspans a most significant eraof sports development among negroes at the beginning this conference or association and all others like it experienced hunger pangs as it sought to survive it overcame personality and political problems as it sought to build soundly it worked without the advantages of unlimited budgets great press mills in all the handicaps of discrimination andor segregation yet today the ciaa like virtually all the negro conferencesboasts notable success in integrated competition including olympic games and ciaa officials watch proudly as negro college athletes star in professional sports among the ciaa graduates are johnny sample of maryland state college and the pittsburgh steelers roosevelt brown of morgan state college and the new york giants and john baker of north carolina college and the philadelphia eagles these athletes and fellow graduates and many more like them from other negro college campuses have perhaps done more than any other group to familiarize the general american public with the basic existence at least of the negro schools some schoolssuch as morgan state tennessee state florida a m have achieved general public recognition on the strength of their performance within purely conference competition but more important these three schools and many more are today recognized and respected throughout the nation if not the world because of their notable athletic achievements outside the restricted world of jim crow competition grambling college which rode to popular recognition on the sturdy shoulders of former los angeles rams fullback paul tank younger is now a must stop on the itinerary of many professional scouts the college baseball squadscoached by the president himself dr r w e jones have sent many players into organized professional competition in the summer of three grambling players signed bonus contracts totaling more than grambling football and basketball teams also are quite productive of starring pros florida a m is another negro school productive of great pros no longer do caucasian daily newspaper writers blink their puzzled eyes and ask wheres that when a negro athlete says he hails from famu or grambling or prairie view or morgan or maryland state or any one of the other schools which are today prominent in athletics negro college athletes are getting around and theyre making their presence felt all the way from the naia to rome and on to tokyo im glad im not color crazy anyone who has t f been aware of color all his life in one way or another the idea of living without knowledge that color other than ones own exists no doubt is difficult to imagine yet that is how my life started until well into my school years i was unaware that all humans were not more or less the same color as myself before i went to school i learned to believe the bible including that wonderful piece god who made of one blood all peoples of the earth although my schooling was designed to instill the supremacy of the british race whatever that is it was not very successful according to that schooling niggers or natives were the inhabitants of far countries that worked at a lower living standard than we did and helped maintain ours when white men first landed in africa the natives called them paleface but all this was like learning the battle of hastings it didnt convey anything very real we had never seen niggers the most i could gather was that they were people with black faces nigger meant black and we were whiteskinned that puzzled me because i thought we looked more pink but when color was discussed we were always white how black is black i always wondered to us black man nigger or negro all meant the same nigger was derived from nigerthe river where most niggers originatedor thats how we learned it negro was the spanish form we were english so we said nigger as simple as that sometimes we saw nigger minstrel shows but these were mostly white men made up with theatrical grease paint to look like negroes wed never heard them called negro minstrels we enjoyed the music though any one who knew real negro music would have thought the imitation rather poor but to us it was good occasionally we glimpsed colored people but never had any close acquaintance with them our first real contact was when we made our first trip to america we needed someone to look after our house while we were gone and my wife met a colored woman just arrived from jamaica who was looking for somewhere to live she was grateful to accept the opportunity of living in our home until we came back while she could look for permanent living quarters for herself and her family and it solved our problem she seemed a nice enough person and she looked after the house very well but shortly after we got back i mentioned that my only previous knowledge of people with color different from my own had been nigger minstrel shows to have said negro minstrel would have seemed quite unnatural but because i said nigger minstrel that was the end of what could have continued a happy relationship to her the word nigger could only be coupled with the word hate we could not convince her that we dont hate anyone least of all because of their skin color that taught us one important lesson avoid the word nigger not everyone learned it the way we did the next contact was much happier theodore had married a white girl my wife was talking to his wife about religion and it came out that theodore believed that god was going to use communism to work out his will for mankind my wife talked to him without much success so she took me to see them all the communists i had ever talked to had no place for god theodore was on the wrong track if he thought god would use godless communism to serve him not only was theodore mixed up about this he had been reading literature put out by an african in britain league purporting to protest against color discrimination true color discrimination did exist but this literature had to trump up some situations that werent discrimination just to make colored people mad which annoyed me cases like the railway worker who came from jamaica and couldnt get a job because he didnt have the right union ticket when i pointed this out theodore realized that a white man could not have gotten the job either without the ticket it had nothing to do with color there were many more cases quite similar union rules werent formulated to keep colored people out they were formulated to keep anyone out who wasnt a union member on the communism issue theodore had views more difficult to dislodge in a very short time both of us had forgotten there was any color difference between us i am sure each of us recognized in the other an earnestness born of wanting to know the truth we argued strongly at times because each of us felt he was right and had to convince the other but each of us was also prepared to back down if really proven wrong the battle went on for weeks during which we developed quite an affection for one another sincere people can appreciate one another even if they differ and even if their skins have different colors theodore was a handsome man as dark a brown as ive ever seen i remember thinking that whites who are antinegro must be that way because theyre jealous i still think that is a big part of it deep down theodore conceded point after point first that god didnt need to use communism and finally that communism is antigod and a force that is out to exploit the masses of people in a way far worse than any capitalist system has ever done i was no capitalist supporter i know capitalism has its faults but these are nothing compared to what a totalitarian state can bring in the way of exploitation today many years later theodore is the worst enemy communism has he can smell out communists he knows all the arguments he snatches the rug right from under he must turn away more members from communism than ten communists working full time can convert not long before my wife and i emigrated to america we volunteered our home to accommodate a family of colored missionaries who had been working in nigeria for over twenty years they brought messages from many people back in nigeria who had relatives and friends in london working or going through college they asked our permission to invite all these people to our home one evening quite a party it wasone well never forget as long as we live our own friends in the same situation would have got on with delivering messages exchanging gossip and forgotten all about their hostsit was none of their business anyway these people were not just courteous because they met in our home they didnt want us to feel left out with every piece of news they took time to explain all the details so we would know what it was all about just as if we had known them all their lives that evening we got a picture of the life and the people in nigeria that i wish many of our neighbors could have hada warm living picture that made us feel it was part of our world not something strange and remote everyone present except my wife and i had skin some shade of brown but this was quickly forgotten in the interest of the conversation some had musical instruments with them and we were treated to some real african music we quickly realized how phony were the whiteman imitationsand these people werent even professionals the strangest moment for me that evening was when i went to the bathroom and caught sight of my own face in the mirror after talking to people all with skins some shade of brown my own face suddenly seemed so pale i remember leaning toward my reflection and muttering paleface later the neighborhood had quite an argument among themselves about us some even wanted to make representations to the town hall about us entertainingniggers we solved the matter for themand made their lives dull again by emigrating with white people we often get into a discussion about the segregationintegration issue we meet a proportion who think the nigger needs keeping in his place when a man has expressed himself that way i keep him in his placeout of my company i have no ambition to travel in the south i would not trust myself not to start something by getting mad at those idiotic whites down there who believe niggers are an inferior race there are so many decent people that weve come to hate segregation of any sortnot only of color but of religion nationality or anything else whenever i have to fill in a form with a space to check white or colored i wince i do whats expected check white but i hate it im not a lepermy skin is pink pale but pink im not proud of its color and i dont think it matters but that word white looks as if a segregationist prepared the form when i tell people im not for integration because i dont think there should ever have been segregation to want integrating they often dont get my point theyll go on to ask what i think about intermarriages if there never had been segregation there never would have been an intermarriage question naturally men marry women and women marry menif this is intermarriage im in favor of it but since there is segregation the question of intermarriage does arise i think its a personal one i happened to marry a pinkskinned girl before id met one of darker color that i liked well enough to give it a thought so i dont have to answer the question for myself but i know this if i had met a girl who was what i expect of the girl who would be my wife and she had dark skin it wouldnt bother me in the least id have to know my pink skin didnt bother her either then if we were married and some people wanted to exclude me from their circle of friends or wanted to accept me without my wife that would suit me fine it would save me the trouble of excluding them from my circle of friends there are enough decent people in the world that i dont have to bother about the friendship of the other kind in fact we have in our circle of acquaintance quite a few mixed couples theres nothing mixed about them to us how about working with colored people well my work has brought me in contact with many over recent years the ones i like best are the ones who do a good days work and forget about skin color and let me do the same i hope they get the same pay anyone would get for the job if they dont ill do anything to help put that matter right it was in new york i saw another side to this a colored man who couldnt let me forget his color he was a good tool maker and i needed a tool made i knew because he made tools for me before that he could do a good precision fast dependable job but this time we were depending on him and like the transport workers union when people are depending on transport to do their christmas shopping this man chose just that time to make an issue pay wasnt the issue the job was urgent and we would have met any reasonable demand that would have gotten the job done no we needed the job done and that was his reason to highjack us because of his color he wanted to prove we couldnt fire him new york city has an ordinance to prevent discrimination of any kind so he was right about that and nobody wanted to argue it with him anyway but he lost the job his tardiness lost the company an important contract and all of us were out of a job he called me discriminatory because i would not give him a reference conscientiously i could have recommended himhis work was good when hed do it but he refused to see that his action had not only cost him his job but ours as well if hed conceded that and given me hope that he might have learned his lesson id have given him a reference with a clear conscience color had nothing to do with itexcept as he made it another colored man who worked with me felt his color was against him he was no slower at learning than anyone who is just beginning a new job my boss wanted me to let him go i knew the main trouble was that the man was discouraged with himself let him go and hed stay that way for life most likely you dont have to be colored for that to happen he stayed and became another good worker he learned to forget about skin colorin his work anyway but at the beginning there he was convinced his color made him slow he had done what many doaccepted the false evaluation that a few whites put on coloreds often i encounter this a colored person talks to me as if because im white i think myself superior then hes out to show me hes as good as i am he doesnt have to this whole business of superior and inferior makes me sick everyone is different men are different from women thank goodnesshow dull it would be otherwise lets accept it that way without having to try and prove women are equal to men men will never have the babies they are neither superior nor inferior just different people are different and there are certain racial traits or tendencies that mark a general difference between people with pink or brown skins the negro race has a culture that many whites would give their eye teeth for but they just werent born to it so were different why cant we just enjoy one another patriarch undaunted last spring bulldozers l g and other heavy equip ment approached an l d universi y camp us like a small army marching out to meet a foe but this was a march of progress a part of the kansas city kansas urban renewal plan western university buildings are coming down and a much needed old folks home will rise in its place something of the schools history i walked about its grounds last fall the wind made an eerie sound blowing through the windowless dormitories but the scarlet oaks and the statue of john brown seemed as undaunted as john walker the little snowyhaired man who planted them years ago on the porch of walkers home across the street he rested momentarily then went back to raking leaves with his usual vigor despite the fact that he is years old here almost in the shadow of the school john walker has spent most of his life always seeking improvements for quindaro community and its people a son of former slaves he came to kansas city from mississippi in then a child of nine barefooted and hungry but with visions of real freedom he came with his father and cousin traveling up the mississippi by steamboat to st louis and by freight to kansas slavery had ended but its memories were fresh johns father had been a shoe maker on a large plantation a trade that proved very useful he opened a repair shop in old quindaro and prospered preceding the war in its proximity to the missouri river and parkville old quindaro was a well known link in the underground railroad which slaves traveled to freedom at about the time john arrived eban blachley a presbyterian minister came also with the farseeing wisdom that recognized the need to educate the recently freed negro john at tended this oneroom stone school some eighty years ago when blachley died the rev w t vernon took his place rev vernon was afterwards registrar of the u s treasury and bishop of the ame church in a political campaign in he rendered valiant service on the stump for governor w e standley and it was decided that something should be done for vernons school out of this came western university fifteen acres were deeded to the state on which to construct buildings for the operation of a state industrial school the cornerstone was laid by the colored masonic lodge where john then a postman was a member hundreds of students poured in from every state in the union aside from a liberal education they were trained in wood work mechanics carpentry stenography tailoring music theology and cooking and sewing john walker kept a close eye on the school when he delivered mail he was pleased with the curriculum but it bothered him that the grounds surrounding the school continued to have a look of squalor not green and wellkept like other campuses one day he told his wife and children it will mean a cut in salary but i am going to work for the school i am going to teach our people the value of beauty and orderliness and he told me that was but one of the reasons i wanted to work at the school my own schooling was very limited in my youth it wasnt unusual to see grown men and women learning to read and cipher but i have always had a hunger for learning and the greatest respect for schools where ever i was employed i tried to learn as much as possible for instance at swift packing co i persuaded an engineer to teach me to read blueprints from my father i learned to repair shoes and to cut hair and i figured i could learn a lot more at western i am sure john was right about this for during the years between and when the institution thrived with an enrollment of students he rose from caretaker to general overseer and advisor and according to many of the students this man used all his accumulated knowledge for the betterment of the school flowers and trees were planted and grass and scrubs took shape said mrs kanzetta burnell former student and principal of the public school which finally replaced the university but he taught us more important things than this most of the students were poor and the school had to get by on insufficient funds to offset some of this john cut the students hair repaired shoes and raised vegetables for our tables on part of the land when it became necessary that a new wing be added to the girls dormitory he went to topeka for additional funds and when it was granted he laid the brick with the help of the young men after awhile no matter what one was looking for or what one wanted to know all inquiries led to the same answer see john walker no wonder he is dear to the heart of this woman for it was john that brought her to the attention of dean alexander jones when she arrived to attend western in desiring to complete my schooling she said i worked and saved for three years prior to my coming here at the end of those three years i had saved the unbelievable sum of and some change with the encouragement of two friends who promised me free room and board near the school i mustered up the nerve to go out to western with trembling fingers i laid my seven dollars before the principal for a few minutes he was so shocked he couldnt speak then he said dear heart is this what you plan to pay your tuition with if so i must inform you that this wouldnt keep you here a week just when my knees felt as though they had turned to butter john walker appeared now dont you worry he told me hurrying off to find dean jones the dean then arranged tutoring jobs that enabled me to graduate with certificates for completion of high school normal school and one in domestic arts john watched these young men and women going out into every state to teach and become all sorts of leaders in their communities this and with the schools background it seemed fitting to him thatif a monument to john brown were to be erected anywhereit should be on the grounds of western under his leadership the members of the ame church where john was a member collected for the statue and it was sculptured in italy according to many people including one county commissioner john has been responsible for many of quindaros paved streets and utilities many citizens in and around kansas city still remember the walker military band a school band that became so popular under johns leadership that the musicians federation local made him an honorary lifetime member johns son played the saxophone and the clarinet in this band and today has a band of his own his daughter shares her fathers love for schools and is a teacher in the kansas city missouri school system despite his age john still keeps the ground around the statue trimmed and neat in december the city of quindaro set aside one day known as john walker day to honor this man who has given so much of himself and the hundreds of cards and letters received through the years from almost every state is testimony that he is remembered elsewhere as well tress past the window the white chrysler given him by his congregation bushnells first car with power steering and it handled beautifully a splen np l i did token of recognition to commemorate ten smoothly running was dr years during which under his leadership the church mortgage had been burned the new car responded readily to his touch like the power of god he thought instantly available to all who call upon it dr bushnell remembered the first car he had driven it was sold for junk he remembered his first church and the stamping of feet on the rough oiled boards as the congregation filed in now his welldressed congregation glided in soundlessly reverently over the thick pile of carpeting he had a nice home too at his first church he and mary were treated like natives on a mission field their home furnished with handmedown odds and ends from the attics of all the church members he remembered how bravely mary thanked the ladies aid society for the living room curtains exactly what i would have chosen myself she said as trees flying past the window indicated speed so did fleeting recollections give dr bushnell a sense of progress a feeling that he had come a long way he did not relish the call he was to make now but the service of the lord sometimes includes distasteful details dr bushnell had always managed to dispose of them quickly and move on to more constructive things he could still see peter randolph redfaced as he came banging into the ministers study just before the morning service it was just like peter who once had the audacity the complete lack of taste to get up at a meeting of the deacons and offer to pay for a year of church bulletins in return for a small commercial announcement on the bottom of page three then when one of the deacons objected peter randolph went ahead goodnaturedly and donated the cost of a years church bulletins anyway no strings attached you had to respect a man like that it would have to be peter randolph who would come bursting into the ministers study others may have whispered anxiously to each other but only peter acted standing there feet well apart as though bracing himself for a fight peter demanded did you know there are two colored boys in the sunday school somehow the subtler points of religion had always been lost on peter but he was a loyal and hardworking member for all that a fine fund raiser they are gods children too dr bushnell pointed out gods children or not either you get them out of the sunday school or ill leave mr randolph threatened and dont think ill go alone when i go ill take half the congregation with me this church will be split apart as youve never seen it split before as shepherd i will protect my flock from harm dr bushnell replied when a lion threatened his fathers flocks young david rose up and slew the lion the comparison was a bit melodramatic dr bushnell realized why did peter have to get so excited everything could be handled simply its just a little detail ive smoothed out other awkward situations dr bushnell reminded him self as he turned his car off the main road and down a narrow lane hedged by a thick growth of untrimmed trees they made him think of other trees the tree in the garden of eden the great oak on whose branches the vain absaloms hair became entangled the fig tree that would not bear fruit and was cursed the tree from which the cross was hewn though near his church the area was unfamiliar to him and he slowed the car twice before he found haddock road a lean dog roused itself from the middle of the road as the car approached dr bushnell stopped in front of a shack just like a big box he thought he checked his watch placing his bible inconspicuously under one arm he started up a dirt path through a lawn that was mostly weeds then he paused retraced his steps and locked the car doors in front of the small house he hesitated a moment there was no doorbell and he wondered where to knock before he could decide a young negro woman opened the door for him her appearance slight and frail was somehow not at all what he had anticipated and he felt vaguely resentful at having been surprised reverend bushnell we did not expect you to visit us she said he sat on a chair and she sat on an upholstered crate opposite him she did the upholstering herself he thought and wondered if he should compliment her on her ingenuity he decided it was safer not to notice the furnishings he ran his fingers over the gilt edges of his bible there were marked passages in it he could read if the conversation became too awkward but most of all the worn wellread bible gave him something to do with his nervous restless hands your two boys have been at my sunday school he began and was surprised that his voice sounded sharp yes they liked it so much and they already have their memory work completed they told me i am very glad to hear that they profited from their visit dr bushnell said at divinity school he had always gotten along well with the cook he was the one the other students picked to wheedle betweenthemeal snacks there was a formula for getting along with such people treat them very politely put them at ease and they will be forever grateful but this woman seemed already at ease and his courteous manner did not impress her the cook had averted her eyes from his this woman sat her slender body very straight her eyes focused directly on his incidentally how did you happen to send your boys to our sunday school he asked i dont know reverend bushnell i guess its just that its so close they can walk walk it seems a long way to walk much too far they should trips to the colored church with your boys and may god bless you the mother of the two boys sat motionless her face showing no expression he held the paper money out at arms length obviously the woman needed money badly the poorly furnished room was evidence of this surely she would soon lift one of those limp hands and accept it the whole room spun about the ten dollar bill was its vortex he did not mean to be waving the money in front of her nose but his hand was unsteady she did not stir i insist he said we will call it a scholarship a reward for the outstanding work your two fine sons have completed in our sunday school the woman shook her head slowly i cannot accept it rev bushnell i just couldnt cannot accept dr bushnell did not see how she could possibly refuse if your prefer instead of the money we could arrange for passes on the local bus the woman still shook her head dr bushnell had preached on false pride now he saw it before his eyes a woman who put her own pride before the needs of her children you should consider your boys he said their spiritual welfare i do she said i sent them to sunday school for a long moment dr bushnell could say nothing he searched his mind for some note of conciliation i do admire your spirit he said finally and was surprised to realize that this was true for a horrible instant he had a fantastic image of himself standing up to peter randolph and saying i cannot accept your money he put his wallet away and fumbled for his bible let us close this meeting with a prayer he said it was his custom to pray before leaving any home a custom he had not broken for years this time the familiar words that had flowed forth freely so often simply did not come he saw himself as he must look to this woman the glimpse vanished and could not be recalled but suddenly it was desperately important to be understood he wanted to cry out im not what i seem to be he had to explain instead he found himself saying its later than i realized i have another call to make he was outside the door if there is anything i can ever do to help he turned to say more but the door had closed he raised a fist to knock on the door to call back the moment his hand dropped he knew there was nothing he could say he walked to his car unlocked the door and slid into the seat his hands trembled at first on the wheel but as the new car sped away he had a sense of power and wellbeing while trees like sudden insights flashed past the window and were gone forever the night of the senior ball graduation of course i remember how i felt it was thirty years ago ive made thirty million dollars since then but graduating from highschool is the big one sonny and i remember it all there is something tragic and magnificent about a highschool graduation do you know that youth balancing upon the brink of the abyss of maturity all of them eager some of them afraid and you and i know that growing up is a hard scuffle at best and the ones who will acquire all of the lovely and beautiful things that they have always dreamed about will be few and oh god you want to warn them just because you are older and watching them is like reliving ancient pain do you remember when the old folks tried to tell us but living is a substance that must be handled daily and alone and none of us ever realize how heroic we have been did you ever lay down your life flat and try to see the entire flatness with the little hills of pain and love and pleasure and joy buttoning it all together seeing it with wonder and a funny kind of amused dismay you think why did i ever want this so badly and how did i ever stand up under that but you did and you face the rest of it quietly a bit warily with your inner emotions more firmly established but i digress you are not interested in my philosophical whimseys you were sent up here to ask me what i remembered about my own graduation graduation it was we had had our picnic we had been given our legal cut day we had paid our dues we wandered about look ing nonchalant we clad in somber robes and wearing clipboard caps formed that fantastic line and walked forth into the lighted ritual of graduation night and afterward we had our ball when i got out of college i was a man grown with four years of hard work behind me both in the social and the academic fields and i was merely impatient to go on with what i had started but when i was seventeen it was all so new do you know what i mean i was new gallant shining cleareyed neither my body nor my soul had picked up fat i was a boy wonder my god i was on the board of control i was a rally boy i was busy with track and a little baseball i knew the pretty girls i was the boy that one reads about in adolescent novels i remember feeling very very capable and it was easy to move about in those days i felt in control of everything i never gave war and panic and death a thought my world was limited you see and my parents happily married the senior ball the girls who looked so different in their flimsy gowns with their hair all up and their ears all decorated and those delicate slippers on their feet the boys on their best behavior in bladelike black and starched white with slickered hair and new watchbands gleaming the feel of the evening air and the lights and the muted music and the sound of frailly slender smelling of soap and appleblossoms we danced so formally i could hear the voices i could feel the eyes i had brought something to life in the room and when cora and i finished dancing i knew that this act was an impetus there was nothing that i could not do when i call my wife and tell her that i will not be home for dinner on our anniversary or if i must manipulate the market a bit in order to sweeten a stock or if i intend to enrage the president of the united states or if i thumbdown a twentymillion dollar deal well then i simply recall that intimate important lovely occurrence and i realize that nothing in this world has ever proved to be as difficult to perform as the dance that i danced with cora cora herself why shes a writer she has six great strapping sons you fool dont you realize that it took just as much guts for her to get up and dance with me do american negroes have what africa needs slnce world war ii there has been much talk about the contributions which american negroes could or might make to the social development of africa this is natural since though american negroes were stripped of their african cultural heritage and have become a biologically mixed group the fact of their african origin has not been erased from their minds american negroes have been sent to africa as missionaries especially by negro churches to help in the christianization of the african moreover negro religious organizations have established and helped to support schools in africa many of the africans who have come to the united states to receive an education have studied in negro schools in fact two of the outstanding african leaderskwame nkrumah and nnamdi azikiwereceived most of their advanced education in negro institutions in the united states more recently american negroes have been sent to africa by the american government as technical assistants and as members of commissions concerned with economic and social reconstruction in africa nevertheless much of the talk about the contributions of american negroes to the development of africa rests upon sentimental grounds or represents a type of wishful thinking it is for this reason that i shall undertake a critical analysis and an evaluation of the potential contributions which american negroes could or might make to the social development of africa i let us begin with the contributions which american negroes could or might make within the general field of economics the various territories of africa like the other nonindustrialized countries of the world need capital in order to lay the foundation for modern states in order to secure the necessary capital africa must turn to the industrialized european nations or to the united nations if a fund is ever set up to aid the industrialization of the noneuropean areas of the world to what extent one may ask are the american negroes able to provide any capital for the development of africa the answer is negative and the reasons why this is true are clear the negroes of the united states are poor and they do not occupy positions of influence in the financial institutions which could supply the capital which africa needs during the past decade or so there has been much fanfare about the economic wellbeing of american negroes and the wealth which they have accumulated but upon examination it turns out that the claim that negroes are economically welloff or have accumulated wealth is a myth cherished by negroes and fostered as a part of the propaganda designed to show that negroes have not fared badly in the united states only during the past two decades has a class of negroes emerged in the united states with incomes sufficient to maintain middle class standards of living the new negro middle class is composed almost entirely of professional and technical workers who are selfemployed or salaried whitecollar workers and the more highly paid skilled workers this class includes also a sprinkling of persons engaged for the most part in small businesses in the south about an eighth of the negro population is able to maintain middle class standards while in the north and west where negroes enjoy greater economic and social freedom a fourth of the negro population can be included in the middle class although in the north the average income of negroes is per cent higher than the average income of negroes in the south their average income in the north is only twothirds that of whites moreover negro business enterprises both in the north and in the south are on the whole oneman businesses conducted with a small amount of capital in fact negro businesses are no more important in the american economy and to the employment and income of negroes than they were in when the myth of negro business as a means to economic and social salvation was institutionalized in the national negro business league negroes are neither captains of industry nor holders of any important positions in the management of the industrial and the financial institutions in the united states they are not even owners of stocks and bonds of the great american enterprises therefore negroes as a group are poor and unable to provide africa with the capital which is needed there although all this is true it still may be asked can american negroes provide the managerial ability and the technical skills which africa needs in building a modem economy the answer to this question has been partly given in what was said about the negros position in the american economy the managerial experience of negroes has been limited almost entirely to small negro businesses this experience has been narrow and restricted even in the largest negro enterprises the negro insurance companies and negro newspapers at the present time negroes are beginning to get some experience for example in the sales division of corporations which manufacture and distribute cigarettes and whiskey but this experience has been too brief and restricted to make any contribution to the problem of management which africans are facing in assuming control of their economical life in fact the africans themselves have gained a larger experience with their marketing boards and cooperatives on the west coast of africa than american negroes have had in their small businesses with reference to technical skill the answer to the question posed above requires more attention especially if scientific methods of agriculture are included in technical skills american negroes have been engaged in teaching scientific methods of agriculture in some parts of africa they have succeeded very well in making available to africans new techniques of agriculture and in helping africans to solve some of their agricultural problems on the other hand their contribution in providing and teaching industrial skills has not been of much consequence there are a number of reasons for this first american negroes have only recently begun to acquire technical skills required by modern industry they have been excluded from working in many industries from becoming members of the labor unions and from attending technical schools where they could acquire technical skills for example even today negroes do not have access to any technical schoofs in the south comparable to those provided for whites moreover negroes are as completely excluded from working in the textile industry in the south today as they were when the textile industry was first established in the south in fact in tropical africa the africans are employed in more of the skilled occupations than negroes are in the united states in the united states there are practically no negroes employed as engineers conductors and brakemen on trains and the employment of negroes as firemen on locomotives has been increasingly restricted it is a rare sight to see a negro employed as a telegrapher in the united states it appears therefore that during the process of industrialization of africa africans have outstripped the american negro in the acquisition of industrial skills ii we turn next to consider the contributions which american negroes may make to the political development of africa here again one must evaluate the potential contribution of american negroes in terms of their knowledge experience and skills despite the fact that negroes have lived in a socalled democratic society their experience with political matters has been extremely limited during the short reconstruction period in the south negroes gained considerable experience from participation in politics and produced some astute political leaders twentytwo negro congressmen and two senators were elected to the congress of the united states but after less than a decade of participation in southern politics negroes were largely eliminated from politics and beginning in they were completely disfranchised participation on the part of negroes in american politics was not resumed on a large scale until after the mass migrations to northern cities during and following the first world war as the result of the new political position of negroes in the north there are three negro members of the national congress not to mention the negro judges members of city councils and northern state legislatures moreover since the supreme court of the united states has outlawed the white democratic primary in the south the number of registered negro voters has more than doubled during the past decade primarily however in the nonplantation areas even during their greatest participation in american politics negroes did not sit in the highest councils of the nation where policies are determined booker t washington was consulted by the presidents and other high officials of the united states but this was a sort of system of indirect rule since the negroes were politically disfranchised even under the new deal when many negroes were brought into the government they were simply advisers to whites who formulated the policies concerning negroes even today when negroes are playing an increasingly important role in politics especially in northern cities they do not occupy seats in the highest councils of the nation thus it becomes clear that american negroes do not have the experience and contacts which the african members of the french parliament have what is even more important is that american negroes have not had the experience of africans in those territories where africans have struggled to gain political power moreover american negroes have never had to assume the responsibilities which west african leaders are assuming as heads of new states the lack of education in political leadership has been due to the fact that negroes have been segregated in american life and have lacked real political power negroes have been regarded and treated as wards of the nation sometimes under the control of private philanthropic organizations and at other times under governmental agencies most of their political activities have been within the segregated negro communities and in such institutions and associations as the independent negro church organizations and the fraternal organizations as negroes have migrated to the cities of the north and have begun to participate in the political life of the american community they have become a part of the political machines which are dominated by white politicians thus they have become very adept in the devious ways of local politics in the united states but this experience has not prepared them for the statesmanship which is needed in africa today moreover negroes lack any political philosophy except a narrow opportunism which is more or less effective in local situations where they exercise a limited power this will be considered in more detail in the next section where the question of the contribution of intellectual leadership by american negroes to the social development of africa will be analyzed ill under the heading of intellectual leadership we shall consider american negroes with professional and scientific training as well as leaders of thought in the arts philosophy and the social sciences in dealing with this subject it is necessary to consider first the nature of the education of the socalled intellectual class after emancipation was the result of missionary efforts on the part of whites principally from new england who were fired by an idealistic faith in the intellectual capacity of negroes they met with stubborn opposition on the part of southern whites but through the support of northern philanthropy which represented the triumphant industrial capitalism of the north they were able to carry on their work northern philanthropy was not however inspired by the same idealistic fervor which inspired many of the missionaries who set up schools for negroes in the south they were more concerned with coming to terms with southern whites and having a peaceful environment for their investments within the ranks of the whites who were interested in the education of negroes there developed a sharp cleavage between those who advocated industrial education and those who stood for higher education for the negro the conflict between the two schools of thought was not simply over the question of negro education the conflict went deeper because it was really concerned with conflicting ideas over the status of the negro in the new south booker t washington who built tuskegee institute and became the chief proponent of industrial education was supported by most of the white philanthropists of the north the program of industrial education for negroes involved much more than technical education as a matter of fact the socalled industrial education of negroes was never designed to equip them to compete with white workers in the industrial south the opposition of w e b du bois the foremost champion of the higher education of negroes to the socalled industrial education of the negro was based upon the fact that this industrial education was only a symbolic expression of a policy of racial segregation and subordination of the negro in the south negro schools that continued to offer higher education were generally denied support by northern white philanthropists and foundations until the second decade of the twentieth century when the northward migration of negroes changed their relation to american life nevertheless the majority of negro intellectuals received their college education in the negro schools that were devoted to higher education this is still largely true despite the increasing numbers of negroes who are attending colleges and universities in the north the fact that the majority of negro intellectuals have received their college education in the segregated schools of the south has not failed to leave its mark upon the outlook of negro intellectuals it is only since negroes have been attending northern colleges and universities in large numbers that they have acquired the type of scientific knowledge and professional competence that could be of service in the social development of africa for example one highly trained american negro in the field of tropical medicine dr hildrus poindexter has rendered distinguished service in africa but the number of such trained men is smaller than africans of similar training then too american negroes with firstrate scientific training are being utilized by the united states besides being academically inferior to the colleges and universities of the north the segregated negro college has been dominated by a narrow religious tradition and a puritanical outlook that have restricted the intellectual development of negroes moreover these schools have tended to foster a type of respectability and snobbishness that has alienated negro intellectuals from the masses the emphasis has been upon the uncritical imitation of white standards of behavior and the surviving values of the slaveholding aristocracy and more recently upon the values of the white middle classes however since the negro intellectuals are rejected by the white middle classes and are forced to share many of the disabilities of the negro masses they have developed an ambivalent attitude towards negroes even negro intellectuals who have received a broader education in the north and have gained a more cosmopolitan outlook exhibit the same ambivalent attitude towards negroes in the united states and towards africans negro intellectuals are extremely sensitive to any disparagement of negroes or africans but on the other hand they are eager to claim that they themselves are not africans or negroes but americans they place great value upon being accepted by white americans especially when the latter claim that they are unconscious that negro intellectuals are negroes or of african origin the ambivalence of the negro intellectual is intensified by the fact that a large proportion of them are of mixed blood and enjoy passing for white or being accepted as nearwhite during the negro renaissance in the s it appeared that negro intellectuals had achieved a new orientation towards their negro or african origin the negro renaissance was supposed to hail the emergence of the new negro in the literary and artistic creations of negro artists and intellectuals the new negro was new in the sense that he accepted his racial identification without apologies that he accepted the culture of the negro folk in the united states and that he faced the world with the confidence that the negro or african had the right to a role in creating a new world but as the new negro and negro intellectual were swallowed up by the new middle classes which were growing in size and importance the new orientation of the negro was lost and negro intellectuals sought only acceptance by the white world the ambivalent attitude of negro intellectuals and artists towards their negro or african background is revealed by the question which they constantly pose for themselves should the negro scientists or scholar study the negro should the negro write novels or short stories about negroes should negro painters use negro subjects after all is there any such person as a negro poet or painter generally the answers to these questions are in the negative and negro writers and artists generally protest that they are only american writers and artists and that they have no special concern with negroes there are a few exceptions of course such as langston hughes and richard wright as a result on the whole the negro intellectual and artist is sterilized by the dilemma in which he finds himself by cutting himself off from his negro or african background the negro intellectuals in the united states have never developed a philosophy as to the meaning of human existence or a social philosophy concerning the world they have naturally rejected the philosophy of resignation and submission implicit in the spirituals of the negro folk but they have failed to develop any new philosophy or meaning of existence this has been due partly to the inferior education of negro intellectuals and partly to their mental and social isolation in american life they are touched only in a superficial way by the philosophical currents in the modern world these various philosophies and schools of thought which stir men in the modem world have little or no meaning for the negro intellectual who lives in a world where the exigencies of daily living absorb his energies negro intellectuals have developed a crude philosophy of opportunism which seems to satisfy their segregated existence in the white mans world they seem to have scarcely reflected upon the great revolution which is occurring in the modem world except as it may affect their social status in the united states when one african intellectual was asked what he thought of a group of american negro intellectuals he answered that he thought they were asleep iv we come finally to the question what spiritual or moral leadership can american negroes provide africans or what cultural contributions can they make to the social development of africa the answer to this question is crucial because it conditions the possibility and quality of all other contributions any contribution which american negroes may make in the field of economics or politics is conditioned by their orientation in regard to the changes which are occurring in the modem world likewise any intellectual or professional leadership which they might provide africans is conditioned by their own interests and identification with certain systems of values it is for this reason that in our attempt to answer the questions proposed above we come to the heart of the subject of the possible contribution of american negroes to the social development of africa at the outset it was pointed out that although american negroes had been stripped of their african cultural heritage and had become a biologically mixed group the fact of their african origin had never been erased from their minds the latter part of this statement needs to be qualified for two reasons first it implies that historical memories of africa have been transmitted in the traditions of negroes and their families but this is not true the meaning intended here is that the negro has never been permitted to forget his african origin this leads us to the second reason why this statement at the beginning needs qualification one must take into account the manner in which the fact of their african origin has been communicated to negroes the first fact of importance in the heritage of the american negro is that he has never been taken seriously he has been treated as member of a child race this has been evident not only in american literature but in serious studies of negroes since as it is said negroes are a childlike race they have been shunted from the main currents of american life even the education that was provided them except as we have seen that of some idealistic missionaries was designed for an inferior human being these conditions have influenced the character of american negroes they have not been permitted to become dignified human beings and in the south especially they were expected to play the role of a fool or clown the whites would tolerate them only in this role and negroes played this role in order to surviveone might even go so far as to say that in the united states especially in the south there has been a process of dysgenesic selection from the standpoint of character building the negro who was dignified and courageous and possessed integrity was eliminated in favor of the negro who was sly cowardly and clownish foreign observers and some more thoughtful white americans who did not expect negroes to play clownish and childish roles have been puzzled by the playfulness and immaturity of negroes they have often contrasted the dignified and mature behavior of africans with the immature and childish behavior of american negroes how then would one expect american negroes to contribute to the spiritual or moral development of africans the truth of the matter is that american negroes have never been free physically or psychologically despite all the fanfare over the new status of negroes in american life they are still far from enjoying the freedom which other americans enjoy in the united states it is not necessary to recount all the limitations upon their freedom in the south where they are still segregated and where they are still the objects of physical violence there is an even more important lack of freedom which affects the contribution of american negroes to the social development of africa i refer to the lack of intellectual or spiritual freedom the schooling negroes have received in american civilization has prevented them from developing the spiritual freedom that would enable them to contribute to the social development of africans the entire separate institutional life under which negroes have lived has discouraged or prevented the development of a free and independent spiritual life the intellectual leaders of the negroes as i have pointed out have been the beneficiaries of the philanthropy of the whites but there have been other important reasons which have discouraged a free and independent spirit the two chief separate institutions in the negro community the church and the school have been organized on an authoritarian basis even the baptist churches with their local autonomy have been dominated by strong leaders of groups that have permitted little selfdirection and selfexpression on the part of their members the methodist churches with their hierarchical organizations have been dominated by bishops who were more autocratic than the russian czars the negro colleges have likewise been dominated by presidents who were backed by the absolute authority of the white community or by the autocratic authority of negro church leaders the rise of the new negro middle classes to power and importance has brought into sharp relief the conflict and confusion which result from the anomalous position of negroes in american society and seriously limit the possibility of contributions by american negroes to the social development of africa the new negro middle classes as we have already seen have a small stake in the american economy this class is composed of salaried white collar workers and professionals nevertheless the new negro middle classes have taken over the values of the wealthy white propertied classes in the united states they indulge in all forms of conspicuous consumptionexpensive homes and automobiles and luxurious forms of entertainmentall beyond their economic resources the negro press which provides a mirror of the outlook and values of the new negro middle classes has helped to create the world of makebelieve in which the middle class seeks to escape from its feeling of inferiority this feeling of inferiority is intensified because of their attempt to make themselves over into the image of whites by insisting that they are only americans while rejecting identification with negroes or africans although the negro middle classes would not openly admit their rejection of negro or african identification it is nevertheless true it was revealed for example when the editor of a leading negro newspaper stated patronizingly that negroes could now be proud of africa since ghana had become free it is also revealed when all other ethnic and racial groups in the united states on parade identify themselves with their racial or ethnic backgrounds through dress insignia etc but american negroes object to a comparable identification as negroes or as descendants of africans thus by insisting upon being only americans they become nobody there are reasons of course why american negroes insist upon being considered only americans some of these reasons have been suggested in the discussion so far we have seen for example the manner in which the negro or african has been represented in america moreover the important fact can not be overlooked that negroes in american society are a sort of ethnic wastebasket into which all persons who are not white and have no other racial or ethnic identification are dumped the census report of the united states has a category nonwhite into which all persons who are not white are placed american negroes who are largely a mixed race constitute about per cent of this negatively designated group but instead of seeking a positive identification in the traditional culture of the negro folk in the united states or in their african origin the middle classes seek to escape from their negative identification by becoming pure american the middle class intellectuals can not deceive themselves so easily as the middle classes generally therefore they exhibit considerable ambivalence in coming to terms with the world about them we have already noted how the ambivalence of the american negro has tended to sterilize him as a thinker and as an artist it is interesting to note in this connection that it is more often the white man than the negro who digs up the negros past and interprets the negros experience in the united states in a new frame of reference or in a new artistic dimension on the other hand as the result of his psychological and social isolation and his acceptance of the smugness and cheap values of the middle classes american negro intellectuals and artists seem to be ignorant or unconscious of the cultural problems which concern artists and intellectuals in the modem world they have become mere parrots or phonograph records repeating the ideas of reactionary and conservative white people there are rare exceptions like w e b du bois and paul robeson but they are considered dangerous by white people therefore middle class negroes regard them as dangerous africa is demanding an intellectual and spiritual leadership that has caught a vision of a new worlda world freed from racism colonialism and human exploitation but the new negro middle classes in the united states appear only to seek an opportunity to share in the exploitation from which they have been excluded and continue to be excluded except on an insignificant scale therefore it becomes evident that the aims and aspirations of africans in creating a new world can not be limited by the narrow aims and aspirations of the leaders of american negroes who are merely seeking acceptance in the white mans world as it is the american negro is willing to pay the terrific price of the most servile conformity to the ideas and values of white americans in order to be accepted by them but of course there is no assurance that negroes will be completely accepted in american society even if they conform with every new advance they make towards integration into american society they feel more keenly the frustration and insecurity which result from incomplete acceptance and restricted social mobility it is conceivable that in an attempt to escape from their frustration and the emptiness which they experience upon the attainment of middle class status they will turn to africa for spiritual and cultural roots the publication of this volume might be interpreted as evidence of a new orientation towards africa however there are economic and social forces which are transforming american society and the negros relation to it and which render this unlikely the integration of the negro into american society results in the increasing disintegration of the negro community and its institutions thus the very basis of a really effective cultural awakening in which negroes would find identification with africans is being destroyed an increasing number of american negroes may go to africa as advisers and specialists but they will go as americans representing american interests not african interests in fact there is evidence that middle class negroes in such positions are deriving great satisfaction from what they regard as a new status and acceptance in american society conclusion in concluding this essay i shall attempt to bring together the main points i have attempted to formulate in analyzing the factors involved in a realistic appraisal of the possible contributions of american negroes to the social development of africa first it seems clear that american negroes can not make any contribution to the economic development of africa because they lack the necessary capital and do not have positions of influence in the large financial institutions that could provide capital american negroes lack the managerial experience and skills needed in the modernization of the african economy moreover american negroes are only beginning to acquire the technical skills required in modem industry a fact which places them behind the africans in those industries dependent almost entirely upon skilled african workers likewise in the field of politics american negroes have scarcely anything to contribute to africans who have a long experience of political struggle and are assuming positions of responsibility not open to negroes in the united states but can american negroes make a contribution in the field of intellectual and professional leadership here again if one looks at the facts of the situation one must conclude that american negro intellectuals have been limited in their education and in their general outlook and therefore they have nothing to contribute to the intellectual leadership needed in the development of africa although some prefessionally trained american negroes could offer a type of knowledge which africa needs they are needed in the united states where there is an increasing demand for their skills and services the limitations of american negro intellectuals and professionals become apparent when one considers them from the standpoint of their possible contribution to the spiritual and cultural needs of africa their general outlook is dominated by the provincial and spurious values of the new negro middle classes they live in a world of makebelieve and reject identification with the cultural traditions of american negroes as well as with their african origin they seek acceptance by white americans at the price of losing all their racial and cultural identity and of being swallowed up in white america their attitude towards the future is that of the gladiators and slaves in the roman arena who cried hail caesar we who are about to die salute you on the other hand the african has a future in this world and has a place in shaping a new world as an african perhaps dr e franky lin fraziers position that there is nothing of importance which american negroes can contribute to social development in africa can be attributed to his genuine concern for africa and his chagrin that american negroes cannot contribute more be that as it may his paper while serving to bring the claims of the overzealous into focus represents a considerable overstatement of his case inadvertently it also gives support to those officials in america who for so long refused to use negroes in the foreign missions of the united states on the grounds that negroes had nothing to contribute it is true as frazier says that negroes in america are not a major source of investment either in terms of the management or possession of large amounts of capital the fact is however that one of the major sources of capital in america for investment both at home and abroad is the united states government negroes who have considerable political power in the election of the president in the united states can certainly expect that government capital will flow to the countries of their origin just as it has flowed to the countries from which other americans originated provided the national interest of the united states is involved there is moreover a growing though small negro experience in big corporations in america in the new york area alone one can name negroes who hold important positions with the leading corporations in the fields of electronics communications atomic physics chemistry mathematics publishing investment drugs engineering of many types etc the united states has changed more rapidly than frazier has realized moreover it cannot be said that such men as bunche hastie wilkins white brown weaver lloyd knox aggrey dawson wharton and wright are without political skills of a high order it should be remembered that another social scientist said in his an american dilemma that he was impressed with the political and diplomatic skills of a considerable number of trained negroes whom he met in the united states he specifically said that america was wasting a good amount of talent by not utilizing such skills in its government service and specifically in its diplomatic service in spite of what frazier says the negro college in america has produced its share of distinguished intellectuals although white northern schools have taken only those negroes with the highest secondary achievement who in addition had the resources to pay for expensive education the negro colleges have produced more negro scholars than white northern institutions frazier himself a leading american human ecologist and a past president of the american sociological association received his ab from howard university poindexter re ceived his undergraduate degree from lincoln university other distinguished scholars from similar origins include john hope franklin abram l harris kenneth clark horace mann bond leroy williams william fontaine and a host of others some of whom can be noted in the biographical data provided in this volume what is more important is that these negro colleges have produced practically all of the fighting and effective negro leadership in america w e b dubois walter white thurgood marshall robert l carter martin_luther_king ben azikiwe kwame nkrumah to name only a few frazier is of the opinion that american negro artists and writers generally protest that they are only american writers and have no special concern with negroes without exception all of the important american negro writers and artists are greatly concerned with negroes an attitude which frazier also quixotically objects to as for example augusta savage richmond barthe langston hughes richard wright ama bontemps claude mckay sterling brown bruce wright gwendolyn brooks saunders redding james baldwin ralph ellison w e b du bois ann petry and chester himes in sculpture painting poetry the novel and the essay these artists have told all humanity what it means to live under a caste system because one is black two other assertions of frazier deserve comment his statement that american negroes are of mixed descent and therefore not negroes ignores the reality of being a negro in america as well as the obvious negroid appearance of practically all negroamericans it also assumes that all the mixing occurred in america and not any of it in africa his position that american negroes have no expertness to give africa has already been refuted we have already sent engineers dieticians doctors teachers economists sociologists accountants public administrators parisitologists atomic scientists and other experts not only to africa and southeast asia but on occasion even to europe in this volume dr poindexters careful description of the nature and cause of tropical diseases and delineation of the methods of treatment and control are in part an answer to dr fraziers contention dr poindexter has served the people of the world in africa and southeast asia and is at present serving them in latin america e franklin frazier is a distinguished american sociologist but his position in this volume is certainly more personal opinion than it is objective science since there is no paper in this issue that gives a different view of the picture frazier presents i have used a portion of this introduction to challenge him similar sociological changes between the two world wars was the presence of the automobile industry the early negro migrants from the south had been among the first ford employees and they had made good use of their aday and upwards wages at a time when that much money seemed lucrative to other workers they bought homes and property started businesses and most important educated their children there existed in detroit then a very large group of educated negroes with an appetite for the cultural contacts which were not always open to them they early took up the practice of journeying to less restricted citiessuch as montreal and new yorkto enjoy facilities closed to them at home and more important they began to create within their own community the climate of culture for which they hungered the communitys reputation for refinement spread over the nation in the years before and after world war ii detroit attracted an uncommon number of brilliant and talented young people who together with the nativebred raised the level of civic political and social awareness to a level unmatched by any other major city many of these young people now occupy positions of local state and national authority posts they were more than ready to fill when the barriers finally fell locally they include damon keith william patrick and broadus n butler statewide they include otis smith and wade mccree and nationally they include hobart taylor jr charles wartman and eddie sylvester racial separation remainsfar too frequentlyan integral part of the detroit scene and therefore it is not very surprising that a white reporter writing for a white magazine did not bother to look outside the establishment for evidence of cultural activity and leadership this is an inescapable aspect of the racial realities and yet by any objective standards it is apparent that there is an extraordinary level of cultural activity and awareness in the detroit negro community on page there appear three photographs of detroiters whoover the past yearshave figured importantly in the cultural development of the community they are top to bottom dr broadus n butler assistant dean of the college of liberal arts wayne state university and chairman of the research committee of the association for the study of negro life and history nellie watts retired schoolteacher and founder of the nellie watts concert series and the patrons of the arts and the late fred hart williams initiator of the e azalea hackley memorial collection in the main library and a mainspring of cultural interest until his death in in the following pages a general survey of the arts in detroitpast and presentwill shed some light on some of the principal organizations activities and individuals who make the pursuit of art and excellence a vital part of life in detroit art in terms of ascendancy painting is the newest of the arts in detroit in the old days of course there were painters of talent and some renown but none ever attained the repute and possibly the technical brilliance of the current crop of artists fifty years ago there were no leroy mitchells ernest hardmans or leroy fosters no arts extended group nor any plans to build a permanent gallery and studio as the contemporary studio group is determined to do by paintings rise to preeminence may be said to have begun with the old pen and palette art club which flourished under john dancys patronage at the urban league back in the forties most of the painters in this group were quite young then and some of them are stilunder perhaps the most representative artist of this group is henri king a driving force of the dynamic contemporary studio and director of the groups gallery one of the most outstanding artists of that period was myrtle hall who doubled as star model at both cranbrook academy and the society of arts and crafts after winning prizes and considerable acclaim mrs hall deserted painting for ceramics in the late forties and now is one of the most accomplished ceramists in the midwest her studio and workshop on erskine are among the most professional in the city some of the former members of the old pen and palette art club reorganized as the arts extended groupe in the late forties among them were mrs hall architectpainter rodney warren teacherpainters charles and leverne finger mae morris alice lightfoot james wilson cledie taylor and richard kenny in the group opened a studiogallery on warren just east of woodward in the heart of the rapidly expanding university center it marked the first time a local group of negro artists had undertaken the task of maintaining a gallery the group had been holding regular exhibitions in such places as the federated womens clubhouse but now it had its own center in due course classes were added and a sustained effort was made to interest the community at large in the artists work the gallery flourished with immediate beneficial results one of which was the organization of the second negrooperated gallery it was perhaps inevitable that the success of the arts extended groupes gallery would lead to the opening of at least another one in the first place there were far too many exceptional artists to be absorbed as members in the arts extended groupe and in the second place the first gallery was too small to service all the artists who deserved exposure and now were sure to demand it in henri king and harold neal conceived the idea of the contemporary studio becausein kings wordsit was felt that detroit had no cohesive art movement headquarters or location offering unlimited opportunity for local artists to show their work meet the public and gain recognition the artists who met to draw up plans for the studio included some of the bestknown and most talented detroit artists names long familiar to art patrons and connoisseurs these included leroy foster charles mcgee and ernest hardman all veterans of the annual michigan artists exhibitions at art institute and all former students at the highly respected society of arts and crafts the group leased a secondfloor fiveroom flat on the john c lodge expressway and converted the apartment into a studiogallery in the succeeding four years more than shows have been held at the gallery along with art auctions art discussion programs art classes and seminars all the detroit newspapers and critics have heaped praise on the group and its work and the visitors to the gallery have included persons from europe africa and south america the contemporary studio currently is searching for larger quarters in order to expand its program and provide more exhibition space the advent of this group signaled the beginning of a revolutionary era for art in detroit the detroit negro artist with farthest reaching famehughie leesmithis a detroiter only during the summers now having moved his permanent address to the washington square neighborhood of new yorks greenwich village several years ago leesmith a painter of surpassing grace and lyricism remains the darling of art enthusiasts in the wealthy suburbs and he returns each season to teach in bloomfield hills and birmingham during the past summer leesmiths star pupil was mrs henry ford ii wife of the auto magnate and the one cultural leader singled out by show magazines chronicler of the detroit cultural scene prior to his departure to new york leesmith maintained his own studio and was one of the few local artists of any race who earned a living solely from his work like leesmith painter leroy foster supports himself through his art foster is a brilliant portraitist and one of several artists who have studied abroadat the academie de la grande chaumiere in paris and at the heatherly school of art in london he has won four prizes in the annual art institute competition and sold more than paintings in the past years no mention of art in detroit would be complete unless the names of sarkis sarkisian and guy palozzola were included for these two excellent artists exerted great influence on most detroit negro artists indeed only a few of the topranking artists did not study under sarkisian and palozzola at the society of arts and crafts theater the local theatrical tradition is closely allied with the musical arts which have a very long history in detroit two uncles of the late fred hart williams back in the s regularly held amateur and professional shows in the old merrill hall fred hart ball one of these enterprising gentlemen also was the grandfather of herb jeffries the detroitborn balladeer such oldtime favorites as sisseretta black patti jones and zoe ball fred hart williams aunt enlivened the local theatrical scene with their performances in creole belles some time later from the sarnia area richard harrison emerged as an actor of power and he eventually won immortality as de lawd in marc connellys allegory green pastures in the thirties and forties a series of paradise valleycentered theatrical groups briefly flourished and then perished some of them succeeding in inspiring local actors to go on to new york or hollywood of these perhaps bill walker is the best known after world war ii the paul robeson theatre group provided a showcase for young people of talent it was succeeded by the detroit actors guild which was sparked by alma forrest parks one of the several anna lucastas and a youthful veteran of the old american negro theatre in harlem the actress came to detroit as the bride of singer benjamin parks from this group anna whitsitt english went on to broadway as the saucy zarita in langston hughes simply heavenly perhaps the most successful product of local theatre is lloyd richards the actordirector who is a teacher at the paul mann workshop in new york and the director of a raisin in the sun like richards walter mason and karl farrar received early training with the wayne state university theatre and went on to roles in the professional theatre in new york although there have been the usual number of small theatre groups in the fifties and early sixties the new emphasis on raciallyintegrated theatrical groupssuch as the unstabled make it unlikely that negro theatre as such will achieve much more of a record in the future than it did in the past while none of the local theatrical groups racked up any outstanding accomplishment a detroit playwright scored great personal success in the forties demonstrating more guts and ability than any local writer before him and since arthur coar both wrote and produced two plays which drew nearcapacity audiences to the art institute auditorium the first dual flame which also was the better of the two remains a challenge for young playwrights of the present or future in young ron milner winner of a john hay whitney fellowship and woodie king jr there is considerable promise milners life agony recently was performed before a coffee house audience by actors sylvia king and woodie king jr the dance as is true with the theatre the dance was always closely tied to music in detroit and perhaps subordinated to it detroit has produced no great dancers in the mold of dunham or primus or ailey but it consistently develops extraordinarily good ones scores of exceptional dancers have been turned out under the aegis of laclair knox the dance teacher who was responsible for much of the vitality of the old delta sigma theta jabberwock extravaganzas under the direction of gladys mills johnson and clem mills mrs knoxs school still holds its own in competition with the schools of such relative newcomers as joe ziggy johnson and toni lewis the beautiful clemons sisters gained brief fame in the fifties but the most successful detroit dancer is eddie robinson a former dunham dancer who now operates a school in paris and trains stars for movie and tv roles bernard johnson who was discovered by josephine baker on the fox theatre stage works on broadway and clifford fears is in las vegas and hollywood the two dancers now holding local laurels are vera embree and jimi hunt the latter a dunham alumnus who also works in ceramics literature the literary scene in the detroit negro community is at its brightest currently a total of three john hay whitney fellowship winners are working on projects and generally generating literary enthusiasm the youngest of the three yearold ron milner has produced a play life agony and is writing a novel rogie clark who is a music teacher and folklorist as well as a writer is polishing a series of articles on negro folklore margaret danner a chicagoan transplanted to detroit is in the process of publishing her first book of poems the resurgence of local literary interest has had the effect of arousing to action poet dudley randall poetscuptor oliver legrone and playwright arthur coar the renaissance also has turned the spotlight on poet edward simpkins poethistorian harold lawrence and the previously mentioned woodie king jr for many years in detroit the mainspring of creative writing was fred hart williams the genial and lovable community leader who contributed so much to the citys cultural life williams concentrated his efforts on negro history and over the years wrote for every local negro newspaper and for many white dailies throughout michigan when williams died in detroit lost a great and beloved leader but fortunately he left behind a fully capable heir the mantle of leadership fell to dr broadus n butler who has indicated that he might undertake to complete the book on the history of negroes in detroit which williams left unpublished this fall appropriately under the direction of dr butler detroit writers will be represented in a special issue of the negro history bulletin dedicated to the memory of fred hart williams sculpture one of the most promising of detroits sculptors abandoned her studies in midcareer and focused her energies on the one of her several talents which most interested her florence pate sampson a poet actress and singer as well as sculptor gave up all her other interests for concert singing a pursuit she shares with her pianist composer husband leroy however several of mrs sampsons worksincluding the stunning yom and the poetic les enfantsremain highpoints in creativity the exquisite work of cledie taylor deserves far more attention than it has ever received possibly because her sculpture has taken a back seat to her jewelry oliver legrone fashioned busts of great power during his most creative period at the same time incidentally that his first book of poems was published locally of the current sculptors perhaps the two most prominent are robert weil and oscar graves weil a member of the arts extended groupe is a former john hay whitney fellow and a winner of the albert kahn prize in the annual michigan artists exhibition he is a sculpture instructor at michigan state university at lansing graves a member of the contemporary studio studied at the famed cranbrook academy in bloomfield hills and at wayne state university he has been employed for the past eight years with marshall fredericks the internationally known sculptor and producer of the spirit of detroit sculpture adorning the citycounty building and the opening page of this feature music if painting can be said to be the newest of the creative arts in detroit then music must be termed the oldest in the years when slavery still was an accepted institution in the south music played an important cultural role in the life of the detroit negro community the lambert family one of the citys first negro families made musical performances the principal form of entertainment during the prewar social functions the family sponsored in later years henry and fred hart ball made their barber shop at gratiot and beaubien the center of musical interest and activity they sponsored amateur and professional musical events in the old merrill hall and played hosts to visiting minstrels the most important musical performers of that period the names of zoe ball and sisseretta jones already have been mentioned and these singers were followed by e azalea hackley and the worldfamous maggie porter coles the advent of the automobile revolutionized the total structure of detroit life in the years before world war i and correspondingly profound changes occurred in the negro community as thousands of negroes arrived from the south there were inevitable dislocations and transformations in community leadership for a number of years new leadership was slow in evolving partly because of the serious economic crises of the postworld war i era then during the height of the depression a new leader emerged in the person of a schoolteacher named nellie watts despairing of waiting for the es tablished impresarios to bring in top musical talent to masonic temple miss watts undertook to do so herself in using her own funds miss watts initiated a concert series with the contralto marian anderson the first concert proved an overwhelming success and the annual nellie watts concert series became a detroit tradition in its years of existence the series has presented virtually every topranking negro musical personality from miss anderson to detroits own metropolitan opera star george shirley in in an effort to broaden the participation of the community in her concerts and to cut her frequent financial losses miss watts organized the patrons of the arts apart from helping to assure a larger audience for the concerts patrons of the arts was designed to offer encouragement to young artists singers and musicians significantly miss watts was one of the newcomers to detroit being a native of atlanta ga most of the cultural leaders who followed miss watts had their roots in other localities but were quick to recognize the wealth of possibility in the community and to seize upon it celeste cole a texasborn soprano who studied in russia helped to make excellence a standard of musicality in detroit a singer of extraordinary precision and power she instilled in her many students the drive for perfec tion among her students were florence pate sampson soprano vivian martin pianist leroy sampson and contralto ollie macfarland miss coles opera workshop is unique in its quality and conception last year her presentation of the pearl fishers at art institute employed members of the detroit symphony orchestra for accompaniment this season in commemoration of the centennial of the emancipation proclamation the opera workshop will do excerpts from hiawatha and the kubla khan by the english negro composer samuel taylor coleridge and also excerpts from boris godunov an opera based on a story by the russian negro poet alexandre pushkin miss cole is an instructor in applied music at wayne state university as well as one of the most soughtafter independent music teachers like miss cole robert nolan served as instructor in applied music at wayne state university and is a teacher who has launched some of the citys ablest musicians on professional careers a native of cleveland ohio nolan has spent more than years in detroit and his name is virtually synonymous with local musical activity his school of music sponsors annual musical scholarships and arranges recitals for promising young musicians graduates of the robert nolan school of music include charles coleman founder and director of the northwestern school of music and dance brazeal dennard and concert pianist arthur lebrew winner of a scholarship to the mozarteum in vienna austria nolan is music critic for the michigan chronicle a pioneer in detroits music circles is jerene macklin a graduate of the detroit conservatory of music and founder of the detroit civic opera mrs macklin has worked diligently and quietly for decades to discover and develop musical talent in the community and she was among those promoting opera long before negroes broke through into the ranks of international opera the names of cole nolan and macklin are best known in the field of music but there are many others whose talent and efforts help to make detroit a leading musical center in the nation among those who should be mentioned are carlotta franzell canadianbom concert singer who first scored as cindy lou in the broadway production of carmen jones composer rogie clark whose opera ti yette was performed by celeste coles opera workshop last season and whose new opera the stranger is scheduled for the coming season teachers ollie macfarland louise sargent and katherine ellis baritone james harkless jr bassist russell greene and pianistcomposer william mann christening of an african baby is observed with an equal excitement and joy as the birth itself the ceremony is one of many reunions in an african society that seal strong family ties an african family means more than the parents and their issues it implies the patriarch and his descendants the patriarch is the symbol of the familys pride tradition and customs families of a ghanaian clan have two main sets of traditional names for their issues the names are meaningful they identify the clans of the children easily and give a synoptic background information of the children themselves mere names can inform one for example of a childs seniority in the family whether a child is the only one with a particular name in the family whether the child is the second or third son or daughter in the family or even reveal the circumstances of the childs birth christening of an african child falls on the seventh day after birth the long wait is traditional to determine the chances of survival of the newlyborn baby at dawn of the seventh day members of the family assemble in the courtyard a senior member with an exemplary reputation is nominated godfather great importance is attached to the nomination because of the role the godfather plays in the father or godmother officiating at the initiation has a powerful spiritual influence on the baby a godmothershe is a likely choice usually for her known sensitivity to spiritual forcefaces the east holding the baby in her arms thrice she raises it high to the heavens and down to the earth thrice she feeds it drops of water and liquor while performing these acts she invokes the blessings guidance and guardianship of the universal mind for the baby the baby is then christened and corn beverage is served the guests as a token for witnessing the ceremonyceremony the reunion is ceremonial to hail the new born it also has an esoteric significance to initiate the baby into society it is therefore assumed that a virtuous goda birthday name can be added to a formal family name to help differentiate first cousins with the same name tettey born on tuesday will be tettey kwabla and the other tettey born on friday will be tettey kofi strong family pride is attached to these names grandfathers granduncles and grandaunts look forward with anxiety to the christening of their grandchildren grandnephews and grandnieces respectively after them a fathers failure to follow tradition in naming his baby because of enmity or obvious reasons could spark a lifelong quarrel between the offended grandparent and the babys father the father under such circumstances has two choices one is to name his baby after the day on which it was born or to give it a proverbial name these proverbial names narrate family history or refer to wise sayings of the society a child born out of wedlock whose father has disclaimed it is named obetsebi fatherless a father who continuously loses his babies can name a new born baby obaya i will lose you soon or esefuo there is an end the beauty in these meaningful names is another example in african culture to enshrine knowledge of the secrets of nature in symbols festivals music and songs names of africans are therefore something more than mere proper names they are microscopic biographies which are recalled to mind whenever their names are pronounced
the desegregationintegration issue is clearly one of the most delicate and serious problems confronting society in the latter century it has been one of the most discussed analyzed and illuminated controversies to be carried by the media of public communication yet in spite of this mass coverage one aspect of the desegregationintegration crisis has almost completely escaped the f spotlight that of integration as a threat to negro culture perhaps one of the major reasons for silence on this question is because it is a question on which it is extremely difficult to commu nicate without being misunderstood mislabeled or maliciously libeled it is a discussion that lies along a path paved with pitfalls of potential misunderstanding v given this state of affairs it would seem unwise to plunge into such a discussion without prefacing it by a short explanation of the barrier to effective communication on the topic hopefully this will re duce the inherent tendencies toward misunderstanding and clear the way for a reasonable and rational dissertation on the issue how to be misunderstood without really trying one of the most potent barriers to effective communication on any aspect of the desegregationintegration issue is the failure of too many communicators to clearly distinguish between the concepts of desegregation and integration segregation means to cut off from others to isolate and collect together in a concentration at a particular placehence desegregation signifies a freeing of such compulsory isolation and restricted concentration integration on the other hand means to unite parts so as to form one whole integration therefore signifies an obliteration of differences and a forging of all distinguishable parts into one monotonous mass integration and segregation are the two extremes of a continuum of which the center portions can best be represented by the concept of freedomfreedom to integrate or segregate according to the wishes of each individual the primary objective of the current legal litigation is or should be to take this crucial decision out of the hands of the state and give it back to the individual its objective is not or should not be aimed at merely removing this decisionmaking power from one inappropriate place which happens to favor segregation only to lodge it in another equally inappropriate place which happens to favor integration desegregation and integration are separate and distinct courses of behavior and each individual who chooses to exercise a choice must recognize these differences and should he choose to communicate his decision to others he is sure to encounter some awful barriers to communication unless he and his listeners keep the two terms distinctly apart another significant barrier to intelligent communication on such an issue as integration as a threat to negro culture is the suspicious atmosphere that has been created by the loud and rowdy voices of the extremists and extreme antiextremists of various political shades while most of this has centered around the pro and con john birch society protagonists the desegregationintegration controversy has been similarly involved the extremists in this case however have been the rabid white segregationists on one hand and the rabid black muslims on the other he who openly and publicly identifies integration as a threat to negro culture runs grave risks of being lumped with one or the other of these groups perfectly reasonable pleas for the preservation of one of the countrys major cultural assets may and likely will be simultaneously construed as supporting the cause of the segregationists and voicing the chauvinistic sentiments of the black muslims the only safe position between the extremes nowadays it seems is the extreme middle which may be as harmful to a growing democracy as the other extremes a third though less serious barrier to communication on integration as a threat to negro culture is the strain and minor discomfort such public utterances may cause for negrowhite interpersonal relationships negroes who want to integrate into the mainstream of predominantly white american society pay a certain tribute to the latter this is a form of flattery that most of the flattered secretly enjoy negroes who deny any ini terests in entering the mainkl streams are frequently viewed with suspicion by white associates as if not being for their mainstream automatically means that one is against it the last barrier to be mentioned here is identical to the one above except that it occurs as a strain on negronegro interpersonal relationships among negroes the we want integration position has become such a powerful partyline that one of that group who dares to publicly buck it may be in for a hard time from his negro associates instead of accepting dissent as a healthy sign of political and intellectual maturity a majority of ones negro associates would interpret deviation from the partyline as a form of race treason and a threat to the unity of the group the net result of this is the relegation of such heartfelt opinions to the intimate interactions between very close friendsnever openly vented in the free market of ideas these then are some of the barriers that prevent effective and open communication on the question of whether integration is a threat to negro culture after presenting such a catalog of potential barriers it is hoped that the way has been cleared for honest consideration of an admittedly unpopular view namely that integration does present a clear and present danger or threat to the preservation and growth of negro culture the contention here however is not that integration per se presents such a threat but that the pattern or model that the process follows when negroes enter the mainstream is one that is inherently destructive to that complex of distinctive attainments that constitutes the background of the american negro we propose to develop this thesis by describing the dynamics of the integration process which we dubbed the integration model and by pointing out those of its features that account for the conclusion claimed above the integration model it is said that we are forced to think in terms of models willingly or not whenever we wish to think systematically about anything a decade ago karl deutsch brilliantly described a model as a structure of symbols and operating rules which is supposed to match a set of relevant points in an existing structure or process a major disagreement between model theorists however centers around the question to what extent does a model perfectly correlate with the reality it represents the claim made here is that these descriptions of the integration model do not match their reality in every single case but that they are what the social scientists calls significant at the level meaning that they are valid in cases out of the integration model consists of the following system of interrelated propositions proposition i negroes ini tial interest in integration is accompanied by feelings of cultural selfdenial proposition ii negroes initial experience with integration is accompanied by reduced esteem for their own cultural background proposition iii negroes continued interest in integration and prolonged experience with integration results in further emotional and psychological detachment from their own culture and extreme imitation of what is perceived as mainstream values and behaviors the discussion and support of each of these propositions comprises the main argument of this dissertation it follows negroes interest in integration cultural self denial proposition i is supported mainly by the following crucial observation those negroes who are publicly associated with the integration struggle are seldom active in the promotion and preservation of negro culture those whose major purpose is to integrate this or integrate that give no evidence of being equally interested in gaining recognition for the distinctive cultural contributions of american negroes they base their arguments for integration not on a conviction that the negro has made certain contributions that deserve to be made a more integral part of the national cultural fabric but merely on their conviction that negroes are equal and therefore ought to be admitted to the mainstream of american society if the charters of the discriminationfighting integration organizations make any provisions for the development and preservation of the negros cultural contribution such pronouncements serve only as window dressing judging from the public concerns of the civil_rights group negro culture is a thing that is of no major importance or does not exist at all while it is true that negroes who are interested in integration deemphasize the significance of negro culture it is also true that negroes who are active in racial uplift are not particularly vocal on the merits of integration the nation is dotted with small little known study groups of negroes which are devoted to the study and preservation of negro history and culture if the charters of these bodies make any provisions for supporting the integration fight these pronouncements receive little if any program emphasis in summary integration and cultural uplift are two goals that appear to be incompatible as far as negro organizations are concerned the inverse relationship that is found to exist between the two guarantees that negroes interest in integration inevitably leads to deemphasis or denial of negro culture negroes initial experiences with integration reduced esteem for their own cultural background proposition ii is supported mainly by skilled observations of the interactions of negroes and whites in newly formed integrative situations usually when negroes become part of a predominantly white group the most interesting characteristic of the vast majority of these newly formed mixed groups is that discussion or even mere mentioning of any racial differences in the conversations between negroes and whites introduces a certain amount of strain into the relationship in almost all cases taik about race and race differences is more distressing to the negro conversationalists than to whites the net result is that all talk about race becomes taboo and this includes talk about negro culture these circumstances are responsible for some ironic interactions such as when whites who sincerely admire negro spirituals express this admiration and suddenly become suspect in the eyes of their negro associates the explanation for such behavior on the part of negroes in mixed groups results in the main from their attitudes toward the value of their own culture negroes initial contact with mainstream culture results in reducing their esteem for their own to a point where they are embarrassed by its mentioning in mixed company they seem convinced that what they have to offer culturally is so inferior that any evaluation of it in mixed groups jeopardizes their chances for full acceptance iii negroes continued experience with integration detachment from own culture extreme imitation of main stream value and behaviors the observations that support proposition iii grow out of the occurrences noted in support of propositions i and ii only by now the process is so far gone that any chances of reversing it are all but nonexistent at this point integrated negroes detachment from their cultural background becomes so complete that they begin to resent being called negroes im not a negro im an american to remind them of their old environment of negro spirituals race music and rhythm and blues the forerunners to the integrated rock and roll and gumbo and chitterling dinners would do serious injury to the new image they have of themselves besides becoming fully detached from their own culture negroes with prolonged experience with integration begin to imitate what they perceive to be mainstream cultural values and behaviors to a degree that is ridiculous they in effect become whiter than the whitest white more american and more conformist than anyone else in the group they come to the integrative situation culturally naked feigning a clean empty slate and grasping for traits of the new way some negroes become such convincing imitators that their white associates secretly refer to them as white niggers a term and concept familiar to remarkably few negroes in summary the integration model describes what is claimed to be the reactions of negroes to negro culture as they seek integration and experience various degrees of integration the outstanding fact of life of this process is that the distinctive attainments of negro culture get lost in the shuffle but need this be the case does it follow from what has been said that any significant change in the existing social order comprises an inherent threat to the preservation and further development of negro culture the answer is no absolutely not the current pattern of integration as described by the integration model is not the solution to what is wrong with negrowhite relations in america a much superior and more desirable pattern of change which does not destroy but fosters greater growth for negro culture is summarized below dubbed the desegregation model an alternative the desegregation model the desegregation model consists of the following phased events phase i negroes recognition and acceptance of the fact that americas greatness grew out of and is dependent on individual creativity and cultural diversity not conformity and cultural sameness phase ii negroes recognition and acceptance of the fact that negro culture is uniquely american and played a giant role in the building of this nation phase iii negroes recognition and acceptance of the fact that their becoming like whites culturally is not and should not be a requirement or price they must pay in order to receive the rights and privileges due them as americans phase iv negroes recognition and acceptance of the fact that the beauty and richness of negro culture is deserving of their maximal pride and efforts toward further development phase v negroes and whites recognition and acceptance of negro culture as a major national asset and of the desirability of its continued growth as a distinctive form on the american scene peacefully coexisting so to speak with the predominant mainstream culture the desegregation model offers a more fruitful pattern of change than that which is being pursued in addition to preserving a major cultural asset it also points toward the solution of a more basic problem for american negroes the quest for identity after all there are no rational reasons why this tenth of the population should sacrifice its cultural contributions as a prerequisite for first class citizenship there are no rational reasons why they cannot live in the nonsegregated communities of their choice and dine from tables of gumbo and other culinary specialties attend any public educational institution for which they qualify and maintain the rhythmic splendor of negro spirituals and jazz be employed strictly on the basis of merit and create the dissimilar dance forms of the texas hop the mashed potato or scotch the question of whether or not the american dilemma is solved on this basis is not only closely related to the survival of negro culture but equally related to the survival of the whole american culture and way of life as well dear mr jennett every time that you see your blackness mirrored in the blankness of a white mans stare you are glad that you can go away from him and everything that he stands for away from him and back to your own kind where you can relax and lick your wounds and listen to the comforting sounds of frying fat dialect easy laughter and race music coming over a radio you sit there wherever it is you go to seek your solaceat home in a beerjoint in a real estate office or on a comer bus bench and you deplore the way that your blackness restricts your life you find many agreeable listeners they tell you about all of the distressing occurrences that they have had to face and you understand each others dismay you feel that you are in this country only on sufferance and you go armed with wariness every day of your life and smiling yet sure ignore it sure consider the source sure be bigger than they are sure keep on striving for a better world for your kids you know that you shall do all of these things but nothing alters the truth most negroes are afraid they suck in this fear with their mothers milk they hear the fear voiced while they are growing up the fear is masked by bravado or antagonism or cynicism or laughter the kids hear ol mista charlies got it and i got to get it they hear i cant quit ill just have to take his abuse and keep my mouth shut they hear she wants all of the floors waxed on your hands and knees what the dickens you expect me to do you know the baby needs a pair of shoes they hear the bastard called me a nigger i hit him thats all they hear i hate em hate all of emno there aint no good ones they hear he loves colored peoplehe was raised with em and as you grow up you absorb the resentment and the anger that is based on the fear the fear isnt a physical fear mr jennett it is a sapping wasting wearying wariness that has kept an entire race of people apathetic and incapable it is a most complex emotion perhaps it began when the negroes discovered that they really had no emancipation to proclaim and when the white people began to forge the chains of their own slavery because as long as they stifle us they are emotionally imprisoned themselves it is true that there are more and more educated and effective negroes such as you sought to buy your home but they have not yet channelled their growing power it is a confusing time for them when they go gaily down from their hillside homes to buy gas for their cadillacs it must hurt to have a white attendant slap you with a hatestare while he signs the esti mable credit card you hand him fl negroes who do live in the sub i urbs bend over backwards trying to behave themselves ive heard them say this we have to be so careful no matter what we do somebody looks at us askance often however they find a cau f your letter has a ring of real truth to it i can sympathize with all that you say i wish to god it were in my power to do something about it but apparently it is not those of us who were bom white can never really know what it feels like to be black but i can tell you this there are lots of white people more every daywho believe that color like beauty is only skin deep and that all the really important qualities about a person such as character and compassion lie beneath the surface in the heart and mind and soul i think the phrase color blind best describes those of us who feel that way but once we become color blind we still have our human feelings about individuals i dont care a hoot about a persons race or creed but i will continue to judge each person as an individual when a person white black red yellow or brown lives in such a way as to command my love and respect i will grant such love and respect to this person negroes must learn to live good solid lives as individuals i dont mean perfect lives none of us is perfect and those of us who try become so stiff that we are dull i mean just normal and average i suppose lots of negroes feel it isnt worth the effort white people resent you for the effort and claim you dont know your place negroes who refuse to improve themselves resent you for it feeling that you are by your actions implying that they are not as good as you all i can say in encouragement is that white people suffer the same problems they are problems involved in climbing they have little to do with your color although that makes you a special target i was bom in a charity ward myself my life has been a long climb and i dont plan to stop climbing until i die i ran into opposition from those around and above me but i also ran into people who helped with no thought of reward for themselves at first some friends resented my climbing i finally made them see that i didnt believe i was superior to them i was just trying out the wings god gave me to see how high i can fly i still have most of the friends we had before our climb began they understand now that all i want to do is meet the challenge of life and serve my fellow man as much as i can im scared sure ive been scared every day since i stuck my neck out and tried to be different but ive found that everyone else is scared too thats why were all voting ourselves into the new form of slavery called the welfare state and i find that by meeting my fears head on they dont bother me as much this is the attitude taken by our pioneer forefathers including the negro who was the first man to give his life for freedom in americas revolution your battle will be a long one but you will win it i know you will this story comes to me i think because it is spring and it comes in silence from the far edge of yesterdays as easter time approaches with reminiscences of old lang syne when much of what i recall was told me by my ancestors perhaps only the old can tell of onceonatime when in africa all slaves of whatever trend in religion made special celebration of whitsuntide or as it was called by the natives pingster perhaps it was the original of rock and roll the season was passed in what we today term wild dances with unusual contortions and complete lack of restraint however untamed or uncultured the natives the affairs seemed to prove a respite from their labor as they were not obliged to work during that season frederick douglass who with a great heart and great talents devoted much time in attempts to improve his downtrodden race once said from what i know of the effect of these holidays on the slaves i believe them to be the most effective means in the hands of the slave holders in keeping down the spirit of insurrection were they to abandon the practice i would not have the slightest doubt it would lead to immediate uprising among the slaves the holidays act as safetyvalves to the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity but for them they would be thrown into the wildest desperation and woe betide those who remove these operations or hinder their conduct i warn you that in such an event a spirit will go forth in their midst more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake in the following story i have paid reverence to dead fame which i have drawn from shadowflocks of memories i quote the words often repeated by sojourner truth and he moved from there and digged another well for the lord has made room for usuns and he says to usuns to be fruitful in the land sometmes human features come to mind from almost fors gotten concealment in clouds of memory ralph w emert son once said that in the culminating hours of life memory is associated with certain books which one has read and laid away for years and so it happened as i picked up a little volume given me many years ago as i opened it the picture of isabella looked out from a page at close range i recalled the admonition given me by the donor dont ever lose this for you know it is very rare she might have added in the language of the street you cant hardly ever get them no more the life of isabella will not be found in any story book today the title page of the little fifth edition reads as follows the book was first published from stereotype plates in and was entered recorded by act of congress in for the author mrs frances titus who lived in washington she intended her manuscript for postscript only the narrative itself was written by olive gilbert an amanuensis isabella could we be transported to africa in the late or early period we would find but few white settlements apart from the north and western sections the natives were of the darkest type with characteristic high cheek bones thick lips and flat noses many natives of the egyptian sudan in the east had migrated to the westward and the family of whom i write came from upper guinea to liberia a colony on the west coast and there isabellas parents james and bettsey bomfree with their ten children were driven aboard a slave ship with a full quota of other negroes under command of white men to be taken to america to be sold into slavery upon arrival and they were sold to the highest bidders history relates that ships used for the purpose were returned to africa laden with indians for the same treatment it is reported in some accounts that isabella may have been born in ulster county n y but her age was never known nor were the ages of her parents and the other children the bomfrees were like other negroes of their day they could neither read nor write and their only language was the low dutch of their natal land upon arrival in new york the bomfrees and all their family were placed as a group on the auction block they were immediately sold to one col ardenburgh of ulster county who was of dutch descent and could understand some of their lingo isabella remembered nothing of the circumstances of their first master however he was considered to be in the main kind and considerate when he died all his slaves became the chattels of his son charles all the older bomfree children had by then been sold and taken away they were never again seen by the parents isabella could recall that charles built a new house and she and her parents were moved there the cellar under the building was assigned as sleeping quarters for all the slaves some twenty in number of all sexes ages and sizes their beds consisted of planks laid over the rough dirt base where surface water seeped in and settled adding offensive odors and dampness conducive to rheumatism and ill health tobacco quids and human excrements also added to the foul atmosphere isabellas mother died when she was perhaps eight or nine years old her father lived for many years but seldom saw his daughter as she had been sold many times and lived at far distances she was first sold to one nealy for that experience she said was like being driven like dumb animals being condemned to death she was obliged to suffer every pain and indignity which her race at that time had to bear she was flogged while her hands were tied in front of her until her back was lacerated and bleeding and once she said she was whipped because she herself was cruel to a cat again she was sent to the scullery to bring a skillet and returned with a kettle and trammels her penalty was a terrible beating years dragged on and eventually brought romance to isabella she was to marry a young slave who came from a nearby estate but learning of their tryst his master forbade him to see her however he persisted in seeing her and was followed on his last trip by a gang sent by his master he was caught flogged into unconsciousness tied with ropes and hauled away isabella never saw him again time which is said by some to be a cureall went on crutches so to speak until ultimately love came again and in due time she married and became mother of a large family however the joy of motherhood was not hers for long her babes were seized forcibly and given into slavery while white babies were given places at her breasts designed for her own and she was forced under threat of dire penalty if she refused for one reason or another her freedom from slavery was not granted until some ten to twenty years after she might have claimed it had she known her age when freed she had been working for a gentleman who had paid seventy pounds for her service in his household he was john j dumont who lived directly opposite hyde park on the hudson in ulster county new york after many years there in his employ she decided to go to new york city then having about or inhabitants there she labored at numerous jobs in households she cooked cleaned scrubbed polished brass trimmings doorplates and railings and all the time earning the very first money she ever had of her own and that amount was scanty indeed isabella seemed to possess a power of speech in behalf of her race and had gained quite a reputation in speaking to small groups she then decided to go on a crusade she started out with two york shillings in her pocket and a bundle tied in a bandanna she left the city on foot and unshod much of the way took a route easterly through long island she lectured where and whenever she could make arrangements sometimes in churches sometimes by the wayside she never lacked an audience and she received many donations of money which were freely given after a successful trip across the island she boarded a little boat which carried her across the sound to connecticut and pursuing her way she reached windsor fame had preceded her and she was accorded unusual cordiality she remained several days and people listened to her with fervor she declared her intention of going on to massachusetts so on she went afoot and alone along mere trails and roadpaths through wild sections stopping occasionally at some little cabin settlement if no sleeping quarters were available she could always crawl under the low branches of a friendly evergreen tree and rest like a homing bird peaceful as a dove then at dawn she would resume her journey until another sundown after many many days she reached her destination at springfield massachusetts work was secured for her at the home of samuel hill esq and there isabella remained for sixteen years always promoting the principles which coincided with those of the state of massachusetts which was the first commonwealth of new england to resist slavery while living at springfield isabella decided to go on further missions she also determined to change her name to do this she wanted names which would in some way signify her ambitions she chose sojourner as a term for one who dwells a short time in one place and then moves on to another in effect a traveller here and there for her last name she gave the matter a long time and then declared that truth would be the right word from then till her days were ended she became famous in more than twenty states and in washington d c and wherever she spoke for her race sojourners voice was not confined to her time and place for it breaks forth today and may still reach the high mission which she espoused for the rights of all races it has been said that the best in mankind lives in obscurity for ages and then comes out in a people the voices of whom cannot be forever stilled sometime in the s i believe sojourner left massachusetts accompanied by several abolishionists also the hon george thompson for a tour of lecturing in western new york state her cause at that time was both imperilled and dangerous for their meetings in public were often broken up by proslavery mobs sojourner and her aides went on into ohio where their cause was also unpopular at intermissions sojourner would rise and offer the first editions of her little book for sale the proceeds were given to her as a benefit she also carried a blank note book in which she asked people to write their signatures many signed and expressed their sentiments pro and con and there were many donations of from five to ten dollars her own personal sense of ignorance and nothingness overwhelmed and depressed sojourner at times and it seemed as though nothing could raise her spirits except her implicit faith in god as she said god only could make people hear me and he did it in answer to my prayers and added you wouldnt doubt it if you could see me in my ignorance and destitution trotting about the streets bareheaded and barefooted her perfect trust raised her above fear and shielded her from her enemies that faith carried her on to the consummation of plans which filled her mind her knowledge of events was remarkable for one who so keenly lamented her lack of schooling but her wit and repartee were boundless it seems almost unbelievable that the woman could become so shrewd and so widely acknowledged and reach such acclaim as a public speaker of her day all of which is evidenced in the words of the noted bishop haven of massachusetts who wrote there is no more deserving woman of her day than she as one of the famous women of famous times covering in her own experiences the emancipation period from the declaration of new york state in to abraham lincolns proclamation she deserves special honor the nation could rightfully grant her a pension for her service since the war for the amelioration of those still halfenslaved about the year henry clay then living in kentucky formed what he called an americanization society of which he was president its purpose was to form a colony of emancipated slaves and give them a chance to live free three acres of land in guinea was to be given to each applicant but the location proved unhealthful and another site was chosen vermont history points proudly to the name of one jehudi ashman who graduated with the first class of uvm in and five years later led his first mission from america to liberia upon the sesquicentennial of that event the university of vermont made a notable celebration one of sojourners high hopes was to secure land from the northern part of the louisiana purchase as a reserve for freed slaves instead of sending them to africa her goal was to reach washington and present her plan there and so on she trudged bearing the scars and stripes of her slavedom a tall supple wellbuilt muscular figure never shrinking from opposition or danger her wit wisdom and humor with her strange dark personality brought her fame and popularity her activities became widespread and her talks more convincing harriet beecher stowe said of her i never knew a person who possessed so much of that subtle controlling power called presence sojourner lectured in many small towns in york state and at rochester gowanda and buffalo while working her way on towards the nations capitol in various ways and byways she met much harsh criticism and censure with crisp and well directed replies while offering her little book for sale she was accosted by a man who asked in effect old woman what do you think youre doing we dont care no more about what you say than we do about a flea bite she replied well chile de good lawd willing ill keep ya scratching she faced many accusations in her travels a man in one audience challenged her to prove that she wasnt a man she told the people present that she was a mother of a large family but that all except one had been snatched away from her for eventual slavery that she had been forced to suckle many a white infant at various times at washington sojourner was guest in the best of homes and was received with unreserved cordiality at one occasion she was directed to a guest room which was furnished in the most sumptuous manner she had ever seen when ready for bed she concluded that such luxury as exhibited on the bed was not for her so without disturbing the rich materials covering the bed she lay down on the floor and slept underneath at next sunup she turned down the bed covers and mussed up a pillow a bit as if she had slept there so that her hostess would not know where she had really rested walking past the administration buildings with the stars and stripes floating overhead she folded her hands as in supplication and thanked the god of love that they no longer floated above the scars and stripes of her free people asked what her work in new york had been she told of housework washing cleaning scrubbing and polishing brass door plates and railing and then added now i go around scouring copperheads replying to a man who asked what she thought of politics she told him she had just come from kansas and witnessed the wheat crop failure where there was no grain in the heads just empty hulls and she believed politics was just like that too many weasels in it i recall a story of sojourner who had smoked a pipe from early childhood in her advanced years she became ill and in talking with a minister the conversation ran something like this the reverend speaks now you believe in the good book and how it tells of heaven what a clean lovely place it is and i wonder how you expect to go there with such a vile smelling tobacco breath as yours and she told him well chile when i goes to hebben i spects to leave my breff here on earff but when her physician advised her to stop smoking on account of her health and said she would stop if it killed her she did stop and lived on and on in amy post writing from rochester n y sent sojourner these words of commendation dear friend sojourner the announcement in the antislavery standard of thy having laid aside the pipe is receiving considerable attention i received a letter from dr trask of fitchburg mass who rejoices greatly over thy grand and triumphant to cast aside the abomination also a letter has just come to me from our highly esteemed friend jonathan walker the original subject of the poem the branded hand he was captain of a small vessel running from new york to the gulf ports he secreted numerous slaves and brought them to the free states he was nabbed and imprisoned and the letters s s were branded on his right hand as a slave stealer the vessel was confiscated with its cargo and the crew and captain walker lay in a filthy jail in florida for several months jonathan walker himself wrote the following letter in from muskegon mich my dear and venerated friend your earnest and effectual devotion for so long a time to the cause of human redemption from the first knowledge of your mission services to the present time impresses me as well as many others with the warmest fraternal regard for your welfare and usefulness when i saw that you had abandoned the pipe at your advanced age i could form no other conclusion than that you had done it under the influence of keenest moral and religious sensibilities i have known ministers and professors of religion who have tried hard and long to abandon the habit and yet could not conquer i distinctly remember also the tedious and desperate struggle i had to emancipate myself from the foul weed after years of slavery to it one of the finest letters printed in the little book of narratives was written by william lloyd garrison of boston who was a strong abolitionist in he began publication of the liberator which he had bought from a quaker named lundy he had declared that he would neither think speak nor write with moderation he burned a copy of the constitution publicly to show his abhorrence of the legalization of slavery professional men and mercantile classes became as bitter against garrison as the southerners and demanded that such literature as that of the liberators incendiary type be legislated against the bitter attitude toward garrison resulted in his being tarred and feathered on boston common garrison wrote in regarding sojourner having been long acquainted with her eventful life and marvellous experiences i heartily commend her to the respect hospitality and goodwill of those among whom her lot may be cast and because of the cruel wrongs and sufferings endured by her during so many years of slavery and because of her timely selfsacrifices laboring among the wounded and the destitute during the late rebellion and for her venerable age and necessarily increasing infirmities calvin fairbanks who was confined in prison in franklin kentucky for aiding a slave was a signer in her autograph book charles sumner called the belligerant wrote his famous words equality of rights is the first of rights and signed his name james boyle md of new york signed as coworker in the antislavery movement he presented sojourner with the stereotyped plates for the first edition of her book a few other names signed in person were a lincoln u s grant parker pillsbury wendell phillips gilbert haven stephen and ann foster gerrit smith gen o o howard elisabeth cady stanton and mary mapes dodge during the administration of abraham lincoln a washington news paper published the following it was our good fortune to be in the marble room of the senate chamber when that old landmark of the past that representative of the forevergoneage sojourner truth made her appearance it was an hour never to be forgotten even in our magnanimous age of progress that we see our revered senators even he who holds the second chair in the republic vacate their seats in the hall of state to extend their hands of welcome their meed of praise and substantial blessings to a poor negro whose old form under the burden of nearly four score years and ten tells but too plainly that her marvellous strange life is drawing to a close but it was as refreshing as it was odd to see her who had served in the shackles of slavery in the great state of new york before these senators were even born now holding a levee here where less than a decade ago she would have been spumed from the outer corridor by the lowest menial much less could she have taken the hand of a senator surely the leaven of love is working in the hearts of the people pointing with unerring certainty to the time when ties of affection will cement nations and kindred of tongues into a common brotherhood sojourner made her mark in the world without any education or booklearning but if thought produces intellect that she certainly had in harriet beecher stowe wrote a story of sojourner under the title the libyan sibyl which was printed in the atlantic monthly there is a statue of sojourner somewhere made by a sculptor named story he became interested in her while in italy working on a magnifint model of cleopatra and he was contemplating a trip to africa to id an exact opposite type to copy he had talked with the author of ijourners narrative which led to his producing some two years later e statue of sybilla libica which was exhibited at the worlds fair in liladelphia olive gilbert wrote the following letter from leeds mass in how little we know of the world we live in you and i seem to move about as easy as soap bubbles i suppose here and there making our mine is a very quiet one compared to yours i did not hink you were laying the foundation of such a worldwide reputation when i wrote the little book but i rejoice and am proud that you can make your power felt with so little education susan b anthony in her day wrote and asked sojourner to make her mark on a petition against the constitution shutting out all women from voting for president vicepresident and congressmen although they might vote for their own states officials sojourner truth died in battle creek michigan where she lived in a little hut built from donations of numerous friends and that was her final earthly home her last employment was in a large house built on the same property which the owners had bought with the agreement that sojourner was to remain living in the little home which her own hands had helped to construct on college street from the first marker placed at her grave are these words though now the etching is dimmed by time in memoriam sojourner truth bom a slave in ulster co n y in the th century died at battle creek mich nov aged about years and at the base of this data is the quotation is god dead history has recorded the words as spoken by sojourner at a meeting being addressed by frederick douglass for the promotion and liberation of negroes he was evidently discouraged and was speaking with deep emotion when sojourner rose and said frederick is god dead there is a later newer stone placed at sojourners grave by a religious sect which is tall and slender like the old one and bears only her name in the shape of a cross in memoriam sojourner truth the only clue to the age of sojourner appears to be in the following letter written in which seems to refute the date on the tombstone the letter was written by waring lattimer a nephew of john j dumont previously mentioned whose dateline reads feb having heard that many persons have expressed doubts as to the age of sojourner truth i feel it is my duty to make a statement of what i know on the subject it is already known to you that when she was a slave she was held many years by my uncle who lived on the west bank of the hudson and it was during my frequent visits the last time was about at which time she was still held in slavery though i have i no doubt she was entitled to her freedom some years previously it was impossible to tell her age exactly as i now recall her appearance i at that time i feel quite sure she could not have been less than fortyfour or fortyfive years of age which would make her from to or years old and as extraordinary as it may seem i am firmly convinced the above is about her true age dear old sojourner yours respectfully waring lattimer why racial peace is imperative as governor of michigan i was proud that the bishop of my church was in the fore front of the fight for civil_rights and fair employment practices but by the same token i was more than unhappy when some of the parishioners used to ask why must the bishop have a colored man carry his insignia of office i was especially unhappy when they not only asked such questions but when some of them began to drift away from the cathedral church where there was brotherhood not only in the bible but in the pulpit and in the pews why i used to ask myself is there no corporate response in the church to racial discrimination why no ringing support of the bishops stand on human dignity why no positive affirmation in word and deed of christs brotherhood did not christ say if ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well but if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin stung by these questions and of course i speak here in my private capacity and as an episcopalian you can imagine that i was filled with real joy when i heard the still small voice of conscience assume corporate strength in the episcopal society for cultural and racial unity i will be happy to be a shorttime member of this society shorttime i say because the challenge to each of us is to work ourselves and our society out of a job as it were in other words i trust that we shall shortly achieve that unity we seek and that there will no longer be a special need of any i group to remind christians of the second great commandment fthou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself just a few weeks ago in africa this point came home to me in another way when i heard an african comment when the white man first came to africa he had i the bible and the black man had the land now the black man has the bible and the white man has the land while there is no question of the good done by the white mans contributions in africa it is a great tragedy that although the white man brought the word of lifeand many lived and died for italltoomany white men didnt live by that word the result is that many africans converted to christianity by the word brought by the white man have been shocked to disbelief by some white mens acts the new generation of educated africans is examining closely christianitys claim to be a universal fellowship many of the younger africans have lived among large numbers of europeans in african cities they have lived among europeans in europe they have lived among us in the united states and those who have not lived abroad get their impressions of western christianity from their newspapers and radio both of which devote considerable attention to the problem of racial relations as a result of this exposure to many nonmissionary whites africans today are giving deep and serious thought to the fundamental values of christianity young africa stands waiting father trevor huddleston has written and his eyes are vigilant eyes we have baptized him into the fellowship of christs church we have told him that he is the child of god and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven we have taught him to say our father with us we have placed upon his lips the body of christ and told him that it is a pledge and proof of our communion with one another in every possible way we have driven home to him that truth which we recite every time we say the creed that we believe in the catholic churchthe universal church the church in which all barriers of language and culture are broken down and what do these vigilant eyes see as they look at the present along with sitins and freedom riders they see whites entrenched in the best lands and the best jobs they see their ambassadors turned aside at the doors of white restaurants on route they see apartheid trying to reverse the course of the th century they see ghettos for the black man adjoining every white city as peter abrahams wrote in his autobiography all my life has been dominated by a sign reserved for europeans only which in some parts of the united states could read whites only the question is how can african converts balance what they hear about christianity with what they see happening to black people in christian nations in many cases they cannot when they see us fail to live up to our religious principles quite often they will waver in their religion and then cast it aside in disgust and become agnostics although many africans recognize that we in the united states are actively seeking to remove the cancer of discrimination from our societyand many recognize that we are doing more in this direction than most of the worldmost feel we are moving too slowly they are newly independent proud and prone to make quick judgments when their judgments of us are made on the basis of our racial discrimination it involves practical as well as moral implications for us to consider modern africa is young it is impatient and it is in a hurry to make progress africans aspire to move quickly into societies as advanced as our own and their aspirations center around three key areas they want genuine independence for all africans and those who have it guard it jealously they want rapid improvements in their standards of living and they want equality and dignity both national and individual both for themselves and for all colored people wherever they may live thus racial discrimination in the united statesin addition to i being wrong for its own sakeis a i serious detriment to a successful u s foreign policy in africa and in asia and latin america as well t typical of how seriously discrimination is treated in the african mind is this editorial comment from a west african paper if the west led by the united states of america and great britain loses africa to the east it will not be in the race between both blocs to possess more arms or to award more foreign aid rather it will be in the race problem man does not live by bread alone a number of other things go into the making of man to lift him above the herd of beasts and chief of these is what the western world has sung through the ages as respect for human dignity it is the denial of this right to be accepted and treated as human beings to people of dark skin in both the united states of america and the united kingdom in particular that will cost the west dear and another but what has the west with all its religious trappings to show in practice to get ahead in the race for the friendship of africa discrimination in the bus discrimination in the bar and discrimination even in church and on african diplomats in america there is this comment it does not take long for them to discover that in the corridors of the united nations or at state department functions they are accepted as equals and even petted for the favor of their friendship outside this spherein restaurants parks swimming pools clubs and in busesthey find to their amazement and chagrin that white men are more equal than yellow or black faces jwhile the problem of discrimination in housing against darkskinned persons is in origin a domestic race relations issue it also is inextricably linked with the conduct of our foreign relations one prime example of this interrelationship is the situation where many darkskinned foreign diplomats from asia and latin america and especially from africaencounter great difficulty in obtaining suitable housing in washington it is not difficult to imagine the harmful effects of this situation upon the foreign diplomats estimate of our national capital from my own contacts with diplomats i know how distressed some of them have become with housing restrictions they have encountered another place where the question of the american racial situation never fails to arise is in my press conferences throughout africa that is one question i have to be prepared to answer the minute i sit down to face the press and i am always asked it this is also a matter of great concern among african youth just as night follows day i am asked about race relations in america whenever i speak to african students on this last trip i met with the faculty and students of the university college of sierra leone and among the first questions from the audience was one on racial discrimination these are the young leaders with whom we and our children will live for the next several decades the impact of our discriminatory policies on africans cannot be exaggerated this is an open wound in the tissue of africanamerican relations and every incident keeps it inflamed furthermore this impact is important because it affects not only specific problems but also the philosophy and very way of thinking of colored peoples the impact of white mistreatment of darkskinned peoples already has developed for them special definitions for general concepts thus independence to them means first and foremost getting rid of white domination in the same way colonialism for many africans doesnt mean domination of one people by another but the domination of black men by white men such definitions distort and obscure our whole fight for freedom and our struggle against communism to many africans therefore the soviet satellites do not represent colonialism because they are not countries of blacks dominated by whites it is hard too to interest the african in berlin as a fight for freedom partly because by definition there is no oppression of colored people by whites and partly because the black african has felt we have had alltoolittleconcern for the black man deprived of freedom sometimes thoughtful people wonder why the newly independent afroasian countries are so little interested in some of the things that concern us so much and rightly so but i think we must also ask ourselves if we are interested in manifestations of the same things in their part of the world communists can use the line that the united states cant really be sincere in its interest in africa because of our discrimination at home our own transgressions make it extremely difficult for us to answer such charges in a way that satisfies many africans and the fact that the russians discriminate themselves doesnt seem to surface let me make clear right here however that neither the communist challenge or our need for friends abroad is the primary reason that we should be concerned with ending racial discrimination in the united states the important reason is that it should be ended because it is the right thing to do if we are to abide by the words of jesusthe reason that motivates escru and brings us together let me also make clear that there is a need for very rapid progress in the field of racial relations this is pointed up by the comment of msimangu the african priest in alan patons cry the beloved i country who said there is one great fear in my heart that one day when they the whites are turned to loving they will find that we are turned to hating as of today the africans are not full of hate in fact while there have been a few passionate exceptions the africans are remarkably forgiving for the centuries of enslavement and mistreatment they have suffered at the hands of the white man nevertheless we must feel a deep sense of urgency to get on with what remains to be done if we are to attain our goal of dignity and equal treatment for all we cannot expect that the charity shown us by the darkskinned peoples of the world can last forever the challenge to christianity is to grasp the leadership in the fight to assure all people their full and equal rights this is a job that merits the best efforts of christians of all colors in all lands if we are to fulfill the highest principles of our religion a missionary who experienced the fall of china to the communists has said the root of our failure lies in an introverted religion we have forgotten that god must be the god of politics since he is the god of history and of the whole of life we have forgotten that christ died to save the world and not the church only and therefore as christians we have failed to identify ourselves with the rest of mankind in all its human misery and in all the legitimate desires which if unsatisfied clamor for revolution which brings me back to escru and the real tragedy of the white mans relations with the black the real tragedy oddly enough is not what has happened to the black man bad as that has been the real tragedy is what has happened in the corruption of the soul of the white man and the degradation of his character while there is no good to be found in the discrimination against the black man the ultimate loser before god is he who has sinned not he who is sinned against thus escru in hard point of fact is not a crusade to improve the life of the black man but to save the eternal life of the white man finally returning to the words of msimangu the ultimate sin would be if with unsensitive hearts we not only warped our own characters but turned the colored peoples of the world to hating this would be to them and to our children a legacy of horror as dreadful as the bomb as i see it it is our task to lead the battle to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of mankind thus is a task that we must be about without a moments delay and let us pray that with gods help we may be successful in this allimportant endeavor miscegenation is a phony issue i have been cegenist it a misseems for over a quarter of a century i am neither ashamed nor especially proud of this in fact im not even sure im spelling the word correctly miscegenation is a phony issue a false tempest in the modem tea cup and the whole issue would be amusing if this new bogeyman didnt have such tragic meaning in our countrys affairs to give but one amusing example i recently happened upon a list of tv taboos along with rape child molestation and other real hideous crimes miscegenation was also listed the tragic side of this issue is evident in our daily headlines everything from education to drinking a cup of coffee in a restaurant in some parts of the u s a becomes an issue on the alleged grounds that it will all end in that horror of horrorsintermarriage it hasnt in the north the reasoning completely eludes me why should anyone assume their sons or daughters are such morons that they will swoon away upon sitting in the same classroom with a negroas though colored people were newcomers from mars during the depression years of the early thirties negro families invaded to use the real estate term our street living in a large northern city our homes were typical lower middle class private houses the white families promptly sold out and moved away there were no harsh words violence or even the hint of a mob most of the whites never saw the new buyers if anything we white families were rather happy about fleeing times were bad most homes had a large bank mortgage which in the case of my family we would never have been able to pay off suddenly via brokers there were buyers for the houses mostly show people we were told offering a price above the mortgageproving even then the fallacy about negroes lowering property values to this day the prices of these same wellkept homes have constantly risen there wasnt any housing shortage in those days my folks moved downtown and the money helped put me through a year of college but the depression remained a threatening cloud above our heads and i had to leave school after the usual barrage of no jobs and odd jobs i was fortunate enough to become a mailmana very big deal in the days when any civil service job was like winning the sweepstakes true it was only a temporary job but it lasted for several years one christmas a bunch of temps were sent to the post office serving my former home for the christmas rush yes i found myself delivering mail to the house id lived in for most of my life never having returned to the old street i was curious to see the inside of our house now i explained to the family i had formerly lived therewhich didnt make them overly happy as they were sweating under an even larger mortgage than wed had but they let me walk through the house to my surprise it was furnished in almost the same horrible stuffed furniture wed had except for fixing up the porch and a new fence in the backyard the place looked pretty much as i remembered it the family had a daughter a darkskinned yearold it turned out she was interested in art and commercial illustratingas was i i made a point of delivering the mail there as often as i could after christmas the daughter and i began visiting art galleries twelve months later we were married and this year well celebrate our th anniversary if i were asked to highlight the one thing about our marriage which sticks out id have to say its been a very ordinary average life understand im not advocating intermarriage not on the grounds that it is wrong but merely because marriage is a personal matter and it is ridiculous to urge anybody to marry or not to marry this or that person because they are fat or slim bald or hairy of light or dark skin the fact is i would not advocate any marriagefor some people nor am i a spokesman for anybody i can not speak for other mixed couples but i can state that weve had a very normal life weve had our high points and low ones like any couple but none of them have been due to a difference in skin pigment mainly our problems have been the same as yours keeping up the car payments wondering if we will be able to take a cottage for the summer if we can afford to send our daughter to college etc etc we have never lived a furtive life been thrown out of restaurants or cafes assaulted on the streets or even subjected to nasty remarks this is not to say that the threat of possible indignities doesnt hang over ussomething we are more aware of or more aware of the relief from it when we go to europe it is also true our choice of vacations is a trifle limitedweve never considered going to miami beach for example which hasnt bothered us in the least as many americans became suddenly and sharply aware when it took the u s army and world indignation to get even a handful of colored kids into a little rock school our country suffers from a major infectionbigotry certainly this is far from native to the u s a its a world sickness but we seem to have open or belowthesurface prejudices against nearly everybody some of us hate jews catholics protestants indians foreigners northerners southerners progressives reactionaries the rich the poor the educated the uneducated fat people and skinny people while im neither being facetious nor trying to equate the viciousness of these hatreds the fact remains that everybody is a victim of prejudice in our nation to some degree which is also why this article is anonymousin addition to my love of privacy while it is a difficult thing to sum up i think in our case prejudice has hit us mainly in the matter of housing not that weve ever lived in a shack but neither have we lived in an apartment quite in keeping with our income although j in the last year i think this has i changed somewhatthe trouble now is all new rents are so darn f high it is also true some of my relatives still do not speak to me but then weve never been a closely knit family i have aunts living less than two miles apart who only meet at family funerals when i was in the army i probably would have suffered isolation perhaps even physically if it had been known i was married to a negro but the few lasting friends i made in the service visit our apartment to this i day as we visit theirs looking back i think we have had a full life it may be weve lost some white and negro friends because of our marriage but i doubt if we would want them anyway certainly weve never made color a criterion for friendship among our friends we have a few boyhood pals of mine and their wives some of my wifes and a number of people of various colored skins perhaps due to our being a mixed couple we have also met many negro and white intellectuals we would never have known on our own in addition i think our marriage has given each of us a deeper and more mature understanding of humanity and dignity i must add that we have also come across a few well meaning bores who felt our life not their i own should be one long hot civil i rights battle my wife and i have u been active and still are in many i community affairs including the v struggle for civil_rights but we t long ago realized life cant be only a battle there also has to be plenty of time for plain living but as a white person ive had my eyes opened to the many subtle shades of discrimination most whites dont know or care to know for example very few whites can realize the true courage it takes for a negro family to move into an allwhite neighborhood never certain of the reception theyll meet of the physical and mental effect on their kids but happily if humanity has its brutes and fools we always seem to have our heros too the nuances of racial misunderstanding often leave me completely confusedon both sides of the fence i have negro friends who are well aware of my average financial income yet they often ask for outrageous and impractical loans for some wildhair ideas i sometimes believe the only reason they ask me is that they still cling to the oldfashioned idea that all whites must have money i have heard negroes bitterly condemn the hate they found in the south yet in the same breath they will spew out an equally stupid brand of hatein antisemetic and antipuerto rican remarks some people cant believe hate is hate no matter who says it in the course of my work i spend some time in a downtown hotel which has a white staff and about per cent of their guests are negroes including a number of people in the music world on the surface it would seem a well integrated hotel the desk clerk and bellhops are most polite to the colored guests ive often seen and heard them go out of their way to give negro guests detailed instructions on seeing the city or finding a certain theatre with the permanent negro guests the white manager and desk clerks are on a firstname basis they laugh and exchange jokes yet ive also heard these same clerks say upon seeing new negro guests entering here comes a couple of dark clouds or a more bitter phrase i dont know even the socalled new wave french and italian movies with their sophistication and fairly high level for pictures of intellectual understanding still relate mixed couples with sin they will only show a negro man with a white woman for example in some bar or wild party as if their very presence proves what a dive they are picturing on the screen but then these are small shadings and i suppose of no real importance in fact i often think the white desk clerk says his chauvinistic remarks more out of habit than meaning our daughter will be old enough to think of marriage in a year or so to date she has gone out with young men of various skin colors i will be greatly dismayed if she decides to marry or not to marry a young man because his skin is or isnt a special color being a sensible young lady i trust she will decide on a marriage partner by one standard onlydoes her heart and mind tell her they can make it as for those idiots who frighten themselves into a lather over the whole idea of miscegenation both the hysterical dupes and those who use the dupes to keep the cushy for themselves status quo of white is rightlet me remind them that the days of ghosts and bogeymen are long over and ask them to really grow up but please dont tell me we have to grant equality to negroes or what will the russians think most of us never read our constitution but we have one stating all men are born free and equal and it is our own laws we must follow regardless of what any other country will think obviously the reverse of this silly tongueincheek agreement is that if there wasnt a russia it would be okay to keep jimcrow i dont think anybody believes that but sometimes whites have to take a roundabout way of saying things perhaps to allay their own sense of guil by paul crump the pale dusk of evening was settling over the jangling early night of black babylon as i cursed the lethargic battery in the old sedan damn little man i guess shes dead were gonna have to hoof it to the swanksters i told crow yeah well lets dont forget de juice huh momma he said throwing his skates over his shoulder and slipping one of the two fifths of wine i had bought into his hip pocket under his sport shirt i did the same thing with the second bottle as we got out and started walking up the street that dead battery was going to make my scheme a little tougher as i had first planned it it would be a fairly simple matter to get crow loaded at the swanksters roller rink and then instead of driving him back to dots house deliver him home to maxine and the folks he would never stay of course not with dot in her condition but at least he might be able to feel that he had ties beyond her something to keep his life from seeming so miserably hopeless then it would be no problem to get him home by the thanksgiving holiday how did you happen to get tickets to this place guy crow wanted to know as we headed for the swanksters ive never even heard of de joint its new i explained just opened up a couple weeks ago i hear dipper got his hands on four tickets and gave me a couple he had a date with a new broad so he went on ahead that dipper is one straight ofay crow said yeah i said thinking of the lone white boy we called friend man its hot walkin crow said when we had gone about four blocks he paused and took a long swig from his wine bottle good little man i thought glad to see him in a drinking mood youre doin fine we alternately walked and drank the rest of the way to the swanksters with me just taking small sips to encourage crow by the time we reached the lobby of the rink crow was feeling no pain as we approached the pimplyfaced tickettaker he stared at us momentarily then looked at our tickets before raising his blue eyes back to mine dig mani mean he started apologetically like i hope you cats dont take offense i mean i just work here but the fact is mani mean i dig you cats the most and all that yeah you may have seen me dancin at the vipers i looked at crow he was staring at the white boy with openmouthed wonder a hush had settled over the crowded lobby and a sense of shame engulfed me as i felt the play of many eyes upon us i returned my gaze to the white boy he was still talking its not me baby you dig its just why all the gab dad i interrupted feeling a slow anger building up within me just this man i cant let you cats in you dig he said i snatched the tickets yeah man i dig you the most and thats sayin the least i said with suppressed fury come on crow lets dust this democratic den of albinos ah hell guy why crow protested de tickets was bought on de square this is a public place and i wanna skate man grabbing him by the elbow i steered him back through the lobby running a gauntlet of resentful stares as we started to cross the alley a which led to the entrance of the i rinks parking lot a long blue auto i pulled into it and stopped block ing the sidewalk i oh honey look at that funnylooking runty little nigger the blonde girl inside the car exclaimed pointing a redpainted longnailed finger at crow she wore more paint than a japanese geisha girl i grabbed crow as he lunged furiously at the car yanking open the door hands grabbed the girl as she started to tumble out i fought to hold the struggling crow let me go guy he yelled furiously let me lam de pig no bloody sluts gonna call me no no no for craps sake cool it crow were off the reservation man i shouted shaking him another car pulled up behind the first boyseight nine maybe tenscrambled from it hollering rebel cries the other three boys in the first car got out too they all formed a circle around crow and me i released crow he stared around with drunken belligerence the boy who had been driving the first car swaggered to within a foot of crow a cigarette drooped from the comer of his mouth and his eyes were halfclosed as he gazed insolently down at him say spade what was you intending to do to my broad i know you didnt mean to put your black paws on her the malice in his voice caused me to reach towards my belt whoa shine one of the fellows wearing a rebels jacket said stepping up and snatching the belt from around my waist that action will only get you to the graveyard a little earlier his movement toward me left a fairly large hole in the formerly tight circle as he turned the girl cried out slap that little black snot dont talk to him i reached up and grabbed my hat shouting cop and blow crow shouldering the boys aside and lunging through the open hole with crow close on my heels i ran as we raced down the street we could hear the girl screaming get the nigger get the nigger jake dont let them get away ah hell i came to skate not to play in mud after a couple of blocks of hard running i stopped for a breather satisfied that there was no pursuit i stepped into a doorway and called crow as he came charging by sliding to a stop he came back to where i was standing of all de damned and dirty luck he said finally what do you mean i asked were black yeah i said passing him the wine bottle well drink up crow and dont worry about it somebody had to be dark look not upon me because im black because the sun has looked upon me my mothers children were angry with me i quoted in angry disgust then took a long drink of the sweet wine to clear the bitterness from my mouth yeah they were angry all right he said snatching the bottle from my hand to take a drink come on lets make it to the stick hall there should be some tricks there by now buddy if i ever meet that horsefaced tickettaker at de vipers his head belongs to me oh he seems like people crow the cat was only doing his duty yeah he said but de good has got to die with de bad his job to hell with his job de cat on de gate at de vipers does his job too but he dont bar nobody i dont understand well neither do

had for the skates well i told you to cop and blow man why didnt you hold on the damn things yeah i know but what am i gonna do he asked wretchedly go to the cops for what i asked your best bet is to chalk it up to experience yeah but if i ever get my hands on one of those hunkey bastards im gonna he let the threat trail off ominously tilting the bottle he drank half of what was left noticing that he could hardly stand up i took his arm and led him into a nearby hallway we sat on the steps crow with his head hanging between his legs and his narrow shoulders drooped in drunken dejection he muttered my skates damn then in a surprisingly sober voice guy have you seen my family lately the question and the loneliness in his voice were the last things id expected hiding my surprise i said yeah momma i saw maxine i promised to get her a thanksgiving present in fact i nodded at the bottle go ahead man knock yourself out hey baby i wonder how im gonna make it after dots gone i mean until summer when i go with you to this phoenix place you know watching de person you love die is worse than dying yourself in fact i wish it was me aw crow thats foolish naw thats love love hellthats weakness so all of a sudden youre a superman what about you and your momma ive grown up thats over not wanting to pursue this line of conversation further i grabbed him by the arm and got to my feet come on man those tricks wont wait all night i said as we crossed the railroad tracks he said guy you know i im trying to kick my habits thats i why i been drinking so much late ly i figure after we have come f back from summer camp i might go back home just then a car came speeding by one of its satinjacketed occupants shouted hey black boy heres one of your skates the skate fell at our feet crow picked it up with tears in his eyes the leather shoe was slashed to ribbons oh de bastards ill get even he said as we watched the receding tail lights screeching tires caused me to turn around quickly the blue auto from the rink was coming up fast snatching the almost empty bottle from crows pocket i threw it as the car came even with me the force shattered one of the car windows brakes locked tires burned as the car skidded to a stop crow i said running for the car surging with rage as i neared the car heavily mascaraed eyes stared through the shattered window as i got within several feet of it the car pulled away in rapid acceleration i stood trembling as the tail light disappeared into the night crow caught up with me and we continued to walk down the street as we were getting ready to cross bishop street the blue auto pulled up again a sense of danger gripped me i made a desperate grab for crow as he lunged toward the curb his body slammed back against me knocking me down a thunderous sound was ringing in my ears i tried to get up crow lay sprawled across my leg i shoved his shoulder roughly hey man get the hell off my leg crow raised his head a painful smile split his dark face ii cant momma the dirty bastards shot me i sat up quickly turning him over in my arms his hands gripped his stomach blood gushed from between his fingers coloring his white turtleneck sweater crimson i started to lift him hold it momma he croaked in pain of all thefrigging luck tell dot max thethe old folks ii his head slumped to my chest i raised it blood trickled from the corner of his mouth the dirty foulfighting bastardsthethe momma momma ththeha he laughed thethe he sighed his body shuddered into stillness i knew that he was dead too horrified to speak or move i sat and clutched him to me tightly staring at the hole in his stomach which the fall of his lifeless hands had exposed i realized he said the instead of de for the first time since i had known him he wouldnt say de or the any more yeah the de had been shot out of crow one boom and the des had begun to flow a whole lifetime of des flowing going going gone dead killed thou shalt not kill son never let a blow from a white man go i rocked back and forth with crows head in my lap as the voices rang in my brain finally there was a louder voice saying all right i said turn him loose well take care of him now i looked up in the direction of the voice white hands extended toward me i leaned away from their touch clutching crows body close to me i thought of my promise to maxine crow would be home long before thanksgiving let go boy well take care of him the voice repeated keep your hands off him i screamed leaping to my feet as the white hands touched crow blue eyes opened wide with surprise i jabbed my fists at them with all my might and felt my knuckles smack against flesh the eyes disappeared white faces began to pop up around me i lashed out at them again and again trying to empty myself of all the frustration id ever been made to feel hands tried to hold me i bit at them the street lights reflected on a silver star a woman screamed as i staggered from a blow to the back of my head i reached out blindly for support and felt cloth guy guy for gods sake stop it before they kill you another blow to the head knocked me to my knees i felt myself sinking into oblivion no officer he doesnt know what hes doing the womans voice shouted again was that luzon luzon dont let momma know i yelled as a third blow fell blackness covered me talents new wave in recent years much has been made of the new generation when the spotlight turns to education and civil_rights the attention has been deserved for the young and the newdirected negro indeed has served notice that a new day is at

published in accent in and his stories and articles appeared in the urbanite the harvard advocate and the new york times sunday magazine prior to publication of a different drummer at harvard die he says exploring until there is no longer anything to explore or until i become interested in other things the plight of negroes as individual human beings in america i want to understand it all but do not think i will ever venture any answers and then the question put to this articulate representative of the new leaders what do you feel about the future of the negro in america and the answercool thoughtful assured this is a very personal view and though it may be right for me it can be completely wrong for the race though i think it perhaps will ultimately have to be done i feel it is time for the individual negro to come out from behind the shield of race each negro must realize that his worth as a human being comes from his being unique not a member of a race or party or club or group a sixteenth of an inch of skin is nothing either to crow about or to feel ashamed of if you are a human being and know it you will remain a human being even if you are brainwashed deprived of food clothes and shelter drugged beaten or shot you are a human being until you die any respect you get is because of your humanness i do not mean that the negro race should not weld itself into one great power to achieve equality in this country but what will happen to these people when they go home and are alone being negro is a relative thing each lone negro must find something in himself that he feels is worthy of respect and decent treatment and that in my view can only be his unique quality as one lone human being in death of a salesman arthur miller gives some lines to mrs linda loman she is speaking of her husband willy i dont say hes a great man willy loman never made a lot of money his name was never in the paper hes not the finest character that ever lived but hes a human being so attention must be paid hes not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog attention attention must finally be paid to such a person and perhaps this is true of each man when thinking about himself attention must be paid by each one of us to what we really are human beings not simply members of a race young alvin ailey is in a class all his own a superb dancer he is hardly less talented as choreographer and actor above all he is a pacesetter and innovator in his field exploring new areas of the dance with spectacular success last august he crowned a busy and meteoric career at the american dance festival at connecticut college the following is part of what allen hughes of the new york times had to say about mr ailey and his dances and dancers at the new london festival some of the most exciting dancing our country has to offer was seen at the american dance festival when the alvin ailey dance theatre appeared at connecticut colleges palmer auditorium this second event of the festival season was planned to focus attention upon influences that ethnic traditions have wrought upon the dance of our time the chances are however that hardly anyone in the audience bothered to reflect on the origins of anybody or anything for the proceedings on stage were simply too engrossing most of the time to allow for any meditation continuing with his enthusiastic assessment of the ailey performance mr hughes wrote as it happens it is considerably easier to be enthusiastic about mr ailey and his dancers than it is to say just why they seem so good he and the five colleagues with him are american negroes and their major work revelations is based on nine negro spirituals unfortunately these bare facts explain little if anything nor is it of much use to speak of the dancers infallible rhythmic sense extraordinary physical suppleness and inherent grace one must turn rather to the galvanizing personality of mr ailey himself there one might find sweetness and rage hope and despair the sacred and the profane all battling with each other for ascendancy weakness resigna tion and compromise would hardly have a chance alvin ailey is an alumnus of the late lester hortons dance troupe from los angeles the troupe that also developed the dazzling carmen delavallade and the enchanting lelia goldoni in new york where fame awaited the trio ailey often teamed with miss delavallade in dance recitals and performances in the metropolitan area miss delavallade shared the spotlight with ailey on the state department sponsored tour of the orient from which the dancers returned just prior to the connecticut college triumph the tour of course was an unqualified success it was five years ago in the broadway musical jamaica that critics first realized a new star had risen in the person of alvin ailey since then he has appeared wherever excellent dancing is important in this country including the young men and young womens hebrew association dance center and jacobs pillow his brilliant ideas have been realized in such choreographic masterpieces as cinco latinos blues suite creation du monde revelations and the more recent gillespiana mr ailey has been featured on television notably on the red skelton and dave garroway shows but early in he exposed an extension of his extraordinary gifts at which he had only hinted in the past he appeared as one of the trio of lead actors in the offbroadway call me by my rightful name and scored as a dramatic actor of power and promise but it is with alvin ailey the dancer and choreographer that this article is concerned for it is in the dance that he has forged new paths which it is his duty to explore more fully it is significant that alvin ailey achieves the first peak of what can only be a long and fruitful career at the very moment that his most famous predecessor katherine dunham returns with a new revue in another era it was dunham who showed the world how ethnic traditions could revolutionize the concept of modern dance from the dancing in on your toes to the sensational choreography of west side story the dunham influence has been everpresent it is fitting then that at an ailey performance hardly anyone in the audience bothered to reflect on the origins of anybody or anything this is the goal toward which the long hard bitter struggle has been directed to the moment when talent needs no recommendation except itself howard n meyer a lawyer living in suburban new york is one of those staunch and determined people totally immune to the defeat usually induced by endless encounters with arrogance obstinacy and ignorance frustration seems only to goad him onward mr meyer is an avid student of the civil war and reconstruction periods and he happens to feel that the real truth about that era has rarely been told moreover he also feels that the communication media television movies radio books magazines etcresist pressures in behalf of the truth like a growing number of scholars and historians mr meyer maintains that the souths howard n meyer point of view toward the civil war and negroes graduallyin the years following the civil warbecame the accepted national viewpoint in the november issue of negro digest we reprinted his article did the south win the civil war which made the point that for all practical purposesit surely did but let mr meyer speak for himself i think that the most important and the most neglected area of the civil_rights battle is the teaching and writing of historyfor as long as million white kids north and south are brainwashed with what i see in our american history books as the story of reconstruction just so long will they continue to grow up feeling that the negro was and therefore is something less than human for several years mr meyer sought to get publishers to reissue thomas wentworth higginsons allbutforgotten army life in a black regiment a classic inside report of the first south carolina volunteers in the civil war higginson a colonel commanded the negro troops and his sympathetic record of their problems and performance refuted all the myths of negro military inadequacy last year two different publishers released editions of the higginson book at and respectively now at last mr meyer has persuaded collier books to issue an edition of army life in a black regiment at the popular cent price this edition one of the collier civil war classic series suitably boasts an introduction by howard n meyer the book should make an appropriate souvenir of the civil war centennial celebrations currently underway and which for the most part imply that the south and the slave holders were on the side of the angels negro digest recommends this highly entertaining and enlightening book to the readers tuesday the allimportant day to james henry when the art supervisor made her once a month visit to the abraham lincoln elementary schoolnow no longer for just colored children but which still had rv just coloredon the outskirts of town the building was a hastily reconverted warehouse in need of painting again with windows so constructed that james henry could easily peer out without turning his head and see miss higgins five year old ford make lined tracks in the road in his own way james henry knew it really wasnt miss higgins who sparked this tremendous wave of excitement within him there were times the short plump white woman unnerved him by the way she hurriedly talked and looked into the chalk flecked space above their heads as if she were anxious to be somewhere else other than the always stuffy room with too much heat in the winter and burning sun warmth in the spring finally if she did deign to concentrate for a moment on one of the small heads before her she seemed to look through but never quite at the little one there no it wasnt miss higgins that caused him to often lie awake sleeplessly the night before but the longer art time enabling him to make things real from his mind to his hands onto paper after what appeared to be an eternity of time he saw miss higgins drive up the graveled lane and park beside the school all right class his teachers voice broke into his reverie were going to put up our readers and prepare for our art supervisors visit the heavy sound of desk tops being raised and books carelessly thrown into them were almost one now remember boys and girls were going to act very nicelike intelligent little people when miss higgins comes miss cain always said that and james henry often wondered why since to him they acted like nice people all the time carefully miss cain began to pass out the scarred paint boxes used by too many small hands in the past along with the coarse looking drawing paper of which there never seemed to be enough from the way she counted the eager dark eyes over and over again to be sure when the last tin of water had been apportioned miss higgins opened the door she perpetually arrived billowing a heavy shower of lilac perfumeher face powdered too thickly beneath the black felt hat worn throughout the school year good afternoon boys and girls good afternoon miss higgins they unisoned miss cain smileda different smile from her regular classroom one her mouth appeared jerky and tight making the thin coffee tinted cheekbones more prominent without taking off her hat only pausing long enough to quickly shut her purse and jacket in miss cains tiny locker miss higgins began today were going to try to do a spring scene now what do you think about when you think of spring a collection of multihued hands assailed the air since miss higgins j did not know their names or even seemed interested enough to askj voices tumbled out and over onj another flowers y warm weather birds yes all of those and were going to put down our thoughts of springa nice warm southern spring like we have hereright on paper first lets james henry began to feel the familiar surge of excitement causing a tingling sensation to course through his body he picked up his brush staring at the small half dips of red blue green and yellow colors in the opened paint box before him already he could see touch and smell his spring on this chilly april day the spring he would soon like to see in his yard along the narrow wooded path to school and by the bank where the grass grew tall and cool smelling fresh and feeling damp beneath his outstretched form it was his yard he began to shape the flowers he had planted around the house and the old gnarled bent tree older than time shading the ground in the summer and warding off the wind in the winter oh this is delightful miss higgins exclaimed beside him then he looked up james henry paints very well miss cain said pride in her words maybe youll grow up to be an artist someday young man miss e liggins said someone like remrandt or michelangelo rembrandt and michelangelo lames he had never heard of but yet they were artists people who drew to live and lived to draw vaguely he wondered if they were colored much too soon miss cain said class im sorry but our art period is over over and to him it was just the beginning tell miss higgins good afternoon class good afternoon miss higgins they chorused politely on the way out of the room miss higgins suddenly turned to miss cain with a tiny surprised gasp oh my dear i almost forgot the community art league wants to enter some of the schools pictures in the state childrens art festival in all fairness they asked me to get a few representative pictures from here of course they just cant be any old thing and im not promising theyll even be accepted i understand miss cain said with the funny tight smile around her mouth again well see what we can do wonderful well goodbye class goodbye miss higgins when school ended james henry ran all the way home to the grey shingled house with the jagged yard around it his mother was in the kitchen busily frying the perch they had every friday for supper look mom look excitedly he clutched the paint box and piece of smooth white cardboard miss cain regretfully had said was all she had miss cain let me have these for the weekend who son my teacher mom what for to draw with she said james henry you take these home and paint whatever you feel like wiping her hands on the wide apron the woman squinted curiously at the tightly clutched box and paper thats nice son thats certainly real nice miss cain says maybe ill be an artist when i grow up maybe she said sighing looking at and beyond him like she was already seeing him grown up she reached over the stove and put a heavy iron lid over the huge skillet covering the fishgolden brown hard crisp git ready n eat son you got to take your daddy his dinner hes got to work late tonight wonder what i can draw mom up to you n god son clear up to you n god after dinner he sat at the window gazing out trying to make the picture thought come i got it all ready son he took the brown bag his mother handed with the fish sandwiches and thermos of hot black coffee be careful now your daddy aint eaten since this morning i spect hes awful hungry all right mom he walked quickly down the dusty road beginning to loom dark in the twilight shouts of partly clad children playing in the road dust around the rows of shot gun shacks raked the air further on he could soon see the railroad track and knew it wouldnt be long before he reached the canning factory where his father would be waiting by the gate ahead he saw a car approaching and moved closer to the side of the road suddenly the car pulled over beside him and stopped two white men peered out the one closest stared directly into his eyes hey you boy cmere tentatively he walked towards them wonder what hes got in that bag hes holding like a pot of gold the nearest one said james henry could smell the beer on his breath as the man pushed his face out the window he knew the smell from passing the taverns while shopping in town on saturday with his mother especially in the summer the smell would come out the door and blend angrily with the hot pavement damned if i know the driver said maybe it is gold boy you got gold in that bag his mother always told him to answer white people quick and polite then get away as soon as you could no sir james henry said shaking his head its my daddys dinner sir the man leaned over the bag hummm he said wrinkling his nose smells more like his mothers youknowwhat the second man laughed uproariously body pressing hard on the car horn thats a goddam good one a goddam good one its fish sir james henry said softly eyes a little frightened now your daddys dinner hey well dont believe it think its a pot of gold here gimme the bag n lets see instinctively the boy hesitated moving back slightly you hear me nigger boy gimme the bag the arm reached out quickly grabbing sandwiches sprawled over the road into the dust and the thermos fell and broke spilling hot coffee over his feet and ankles the hotness burst into hard pain well ill be damned it was his daddys dinner the first one said in mock amazement yeah and not his mas youknowwhat hawhawhaw then just as hurriedly the car roared forth with the laughter and the motor sound quickly gone first he wanted to cry and then he did all the way to the factory where his daddy was waiting in the grey dusk hey boy whats wrong a reassuring sound of a familiar voice in spurts gasps and in between tears he told him well dont worry bout it boy itll be all right them things happen to people like us best thing to do is forgit it i can wait only four more hours anyhow you go on home now ill be there directly the next evening he walked to miss cains house and gave her the picture carefully covered with brown wrapping paper he didnt wait until she looked at it but silently turned and left no more was said about the picture and soon spring came and june quickly followed then just before school was out for the summer miss cain took him to the principals office miss higgins was there and when he went in she looked at him very strangely for the first time he noticed her eyes were greyjust greyand that was all james henry the principal began coming from around his desk youd better brace yourself for a big surprise you won the first prize in the state childrens art festival ridiculously his tongue felt weightless and immovable after a while all he could say was yes sir the principals round brown face was smiling broadly and miss cain looked is if she was going to cry you know miss higgins said the award presentations will be made in our new museum and art institute in the state capitol the program will mark the official opening of the institute and your picture will be displayed there still smiling the principal patted james henrys shoulder itll be a big big day for you son only the big big day got all tangled up first his mother and father dressed up in their sunday clothes that monday his daddy looked different in the blue suit he seldom wore that was too short at the ankles and his mother looked odd in the one good black dress black hat and white gloves but they seemed very happy his mother kept flashing warm smiles at him and brushing imaginary lint from his blue suit when his daddy looked at him and said im sure proud of you son im sure proud he felt better than he had ever felt in all his life together they got in the car with miss cain to drive the fifteen miles to the state capitol after they got to the sprawling new museum and art institute with the two stone lions on each side of the iron gates and a confederate general in the middle of the steps they were stopped by the institutes guards the guards were sorry but they couldnt come in because it wasnt julythe one month in the year set aside for negro visitors just at that time miss higgins and a man dressed in a white linen suit hurried out of the building toward them thank goodness we were wondering if youd get here on time miss higgins said breathlessly the programs about to start well the man said staring down at james henry is this the boy why yes miss higgins murmured glancing fleetingly at james henry thats james henry miss cain supplied hand lightly brushing his shoulder quickly the man extended his hand congratulations im mr rusick chairman of the state art festival committee you people should be mighty proud of this boy mighty proud we are suh his father answered softly eyes focused on the center of the white mans black tie we certainly are james henry was surprised that it was his father who had spoken and not his mother his father didnt have much to say especially to white people but neither did his mother for that matter lets go in before we hold up the works mr rusick said taking james henrys arm these people cant go in there the guard repeated blocking their path what do you mean cant go in there mr rusick said frowning i told em the institutes rule is for colored in july i miss higgins and mr rusick i stared at each other in amazement i both turning a deep red this is ridiculous mr rusick f finally managed to say absolutely ridiculous why this boy won first prize sorry mister rules are rules didnt make em groups of welldressed white people began climbing the steps and entering the building a small number of colored james henrys minister friends and a few relatives who had heard about the picture prize started up the steps saw them and paused nearby then the orange and black school bus bearing his classmates and the fifth grade teacher drove up the students got out quietly and stood beside the other colored and they all made one big shadow in the sun god mr rusick mumbled angrily wiping his face with a clean white handkerchief this is preposterous he glanced embarrassed at the colored waiting out of hearing but somehow knowing this program was planned for this particular time to commemorate the opening of the new building we just assumed everyone would be welcomedregardless besides miss higgins said in a tiny awed whisper almost as if to herself but not quite to herself we had no idea a colored boy would win dont care if a green eyed toad won mr rusick said this boy won the prize and he should go in there and get the award like everybody else well miss higgins began ive lived here all my life and its been like thiscertain times for colored at the state placesand will bei suppose but this is a joint school project mr rusick protested the schools are integrated i just dont understandi just dont understand he said over and over again the neat white gloves didnt conceal the quivering of james henrys mothers hands nor was the sun shining too brightly in his fathers eyes which kept blinking like he couldnt see or didnt want to see im going to call the governor mr rusick said turning and stalking pass the confederate statue from somewhere a newsman appeared and quickly snapped their pictures while it was being decided what to do with them later mr rusick came back shaking his head hes out of the state and cant be reached nobody else will handle it ratherfunnyisnt it miss higgins laughed shakily suddenly james henrys father spoke up quietly distantly mouthing words he had echoed over and over again at other times and places we dont want to cause no trouble suh well miss higgins interrupted smiling graciously at the bent colored man the programs been delayed long enough ill just have to bring the prize to the boy at school next week maybe miss cain can think of a nice little assembly program and then miss cain spoke up a hint of tears in her eyes lips trembling slightly nono we wont do that james henry earned that prize and it should be awarded by the committee as its supposed to be miss cain was tall but when she drew herself up like she was doing now it seemed she was tall and straight and brave as a warrior mr rusick go in there and get that picture and bring it out here tell that committee it can either come to us and present the award or the boy will reclaim the picture mr rusick looked at her quietly for a moment and all the world stopped in that moment then when he smiled the world came alive again youre quite right young lady quite right thats exactly what well do in a few moments the steps and yard were surrounded with guests award winners and the committee the small colored group did not move but remained there quietly impassively until james henry was given the silver cup prize with his name on it then the group broke into restrained applause faces lighting like multiple lit candles when the picture was unveiled there was a stunned awkward silence as they saw a small naked black boy standing in the dimmed greyness of a twilighted road looking toward the sky and crying large red blood tears while there was nothing around him except the penetrating dusk later they hung the picture in the art gallery but james henry never went back again after that to see his little black boy crying in the twilight not even when colored were allowed short story writing in black south africa the short story by black and controls restrictions and prosouth africans is the hibitions the principal feature of literary record of the these stories is the analytical study system of apartheid it of the african character the psymirrors the total im chological adjustment the accompact of that system upon the af modation to the system this charricans the coloureds mixed acter is conceived as a hero far rebloods and the indians caught in moved from the standard code the complex mass of regulations of moralitythe antihero concept the heroes of these short stories are pickpockets hijackers payroll robbers beggars and other generous assortments of social maladjusts acts of heroism are marked by games at beating the law stealing from whitesa calculated defiance against law and order the police and whites in general are the villains or the victims this short story hero is invested with a birdofpassage morality concentrates into every minute or every hour the feverishness of intense living our hero abandons himself to the lower freedomsthe freedom from morality and the freedom of vice and because of the dichotomy of the social structure of south africa the hero functions on the fringe of a culture which is rejecting him in a society which has labelled him pedigreed him and then discriminates against him to understand this character the motives behind the seemingly irrational behaviourit is necessary to understand the psychological mores of the kind of society which produces this state of mind nadine gordimersouth africas most perceptive writeris illuminating in her analysis of it the greatest single factor in the making of our mores in south africa was and is and will be the colour question it is far more than a question or a matter of prejudice or discrimination or conflict or loyaltieswe have built a morality on it we have gone even deeper we have built our own sense of sin and our own form of tragedy we have added hazards of our own to mans fate and to save his soul he must wrestle not only with the usual lust greed and pride but also with a set of demons marked made in south africa a colourcaste society like south africa must establish definite identifiable groups with consistent group attitudes in a society like britains where the visibility of the social groups has been lowered by the commercialization of the uniformity of dress and the democratization of social institutions it is still the establishment which is surrounded by the symbols of opulence they dominate the economy and therefore the social structure but in south africa where the different social groups have high visibility the whitesa numerical minorityhave arrogated to themselves all the symbols of wealth and authority and have arranged themselves as a political majority the nonwhite groups africans coloureds indians form the numerical majority which is invested with symbols of inferiority and are a minority politically against the background of this social dichotomy the short story highlights attitudes between blacks i and whitesextragroup relations j and the attitudes among the i blacks themselvesintragroup re y lations the problems of race the attitudes and the relations that go with it are present in all life in south africa we are born into race prejudice we live with it we die with it and are buried with it with all these groups arranged against each otherthe one dedicated to maintaining it the other committed to smashing itforce becomes implicit conflicts arise and since race prejudice is written into the law there is no common arbiter the parties must decide for themselves the arbitrament of the sword becomes if not the moral but the real arbiter and thus force becomes the expression and violence the clarification of the society the tone of the short story is primarily that of protest the african character must arrange himselfsurviveunder the system with some personal dignity his reaction is implicit in his behaviour to the white man and this behaviour will be determined by the circumstance and the situation in which he finds himself his behaviour is changeable and his pattern of behaviour may be analysed into these three forms submission and accommodation aggression and escape or flight in the first category the attitude of the african to the white man is that of servility he observes the proper forms of address using the appropriate terms of reference he exploits these proper forms of address when in trouble or when seeking to extract favours from his overlords the africans whole existence his personal safety depends on depth studies of the south african white thus the african understandshe has tothe white man more than the white man will ever know the african the white man mourns with lyricism the passing from the scene of the good native thus the african in trouble will obsequiously resurrect the image of that noble savage this character merely accommodates the system without in any way beginning to accept it the african character differs from the other nonwhite characters in that he acceptsrather than regretsthe blackness of his face in my own short stories the characters accept the physical reality of their colour and then proceed to exploit it in exactly the same way that a beggar needs to be horribly deformed to be able to milk peoples sympathy in the short story the professional beggar to the disability of being black is added physical deformitya kind of double indemnity nathan serurubele is educated to highschool level but is condemned to being a beggar for a living not that he is unable to earn a living but because he is crippled he submits to their construction that to be disabled is to be necessarily dependent upon the charity of a society which will destroy a mans pride rather than set aside the charity mentality nathan serurubeles pride is too humiliated by the degradation and it is this humiliation which sustains him he becomes a professional beggar organizing himself into a commercial enterprise he is arrested and the scene before the magistrate is a cynical exploitation of peoples sympathy the disability is used mercilessly as a weapon to assault the sensibilities of the whites your lordshipmy honour most of us beg because we have been ostracized by our parents by everybody people treat us like lepers they have trained us conditioned us to look up to them for all the things we need no one wants to employ uspeople are more willing to offer us charity rather than give us jobs all they ever do is show us pity we want to be given a chance to prove were as good as anybody this character has realized that ability is rejected inclusively with the colour of his skin that being black is analogous to being deformeda physical handicap in the athletics of earning a living his personal philosophy becomes thus if anything is worth doing its worth doing well nathan serurubele accepts this condition and the commitment to it in south africa privilege is white and nonwhites are placed on different levels of underprivileged the indians and the coloureds are situated on a higher level of privilege than the afri cans psychologically the indians and the coloureds tend to gravitate further and further from black nearer to white to them it is a misfortune not to have been born white and they emphasize this by their own brand of rejection of and discrimination against the afri cans these two groups are obsessed by a white complex this is perhaps understandable in a society where white is the positive standard and black the negative as it is implicit in the label nonwhite in the short story the bench j by richard rives whose story the strike appeared in the april negro digest an indian schoolteacher living in cape town the indignation at being nonwhite instead of white is shown as the motivation behind the social protest it is not white domination which is being protested against but its singling out of those who were not born white it is the effect it has and not the condition itself which is under fire being white and being privileged are confused to mean the same thing richard rives captures the essential tone of the ambivalence to the colour white the scene is a political meeting and a speaker says we form an integral part of a complex society in which a vast proportion of the population is denied the very basic right of existence a society that condemns a man to an inferior position because he has the misfortune to be born black a society that can only rej tain its precarious social and ecoj nomic position at the expense of an enormous oppressed mass the coloureds and the indians are a lighter skin colour than the africans a pigmentorial quality which places them closer to white the coloureds in particular since they are publicly described as the appendages of the whites requestby commensurate approximation proportional privileges improved conditions in their social status and gradual integration acceptance and accommodation as a reaction to social prejudice is determined by the situation as illustrated in the short stories themselvesthe individual finds himself in thus the african policeman the teacher in bantu education schools the people who serve on tribal councils school boards etc have to accommodate the system even if it is implied that they are the instruments of their own oppression the next pattern of behaviour analyzed by the short stories is that of aggression directed against the system like america south africa has a frontier or voortrekker mentality a savage throwback to the days when the law dangled in the holster or the shot gun and justice was swift informal and prejudiced lynchings and horse whippings are deep in the traditions of these countries both are compulsive addicts to horse operas under stress the average man in america and in south africa will resort to violence in south africa violence exists as the expression of the public conscience this violence is contained in the law it is the instrument of maintaining law and order the african character lives in the screaming wake of this violence and unlike most south african attitudes violence is truly colour blind compulsively driven by frustration the african directs his aggression against himself this ingroup aggression is directed against the more successful afri j cans who are by and large re sented for being successful because success is seen as the quality of being white on the surface the motives for this aggression may be for material gain or just lawless rebellion against form and cohesion where form and cohesion are symbols of authority which is white this african character lives so close to death that death becomes the reflection of the empty gestures of the living a defiance against his life death revenges the african character against life it is both sides of a single reality death is the master who must be paid and although this character may fear death he is fascinated by it because he is familiar with it he courts it he jokes about it he dares it he surrenders himself to it and then death becomes a refuge from the burden of being black in white south africa in the short stories of arthur maimane a journalist on a london news agency death purges bis characters from being black his m characters defy death they run from the police ignore the order to stop and defy the warning shots compulsively runningrunning away from south africa into death arthur maimanes stories just a tsotsi and a manner of speaking probes the depths of desperation which his characters have reached in the story just a tsotsi his character is arrested for a pass offence and during the assault upon him by the police he breaks from them and starts running he is ordered to stop but he continues running now hes asking for trouble hannes said seeing a chance to vindicate himself with one fluid motion he grabbed his rifle from where it was leaning against the wall and fell down on one knee he wont be cheeky any more after this he fired deliberately low the bullet hitting the ground between the running boys legs and ricocheting at an angle with a whine the boy yelped and ran faster dont kill him hannes the corporal said in a low tight voice hannes laughed this is what ive been waiting for his next shot whined close by the boys ear with another frightened yelp the boy crouched down and started running zigzag fashion he had almost reached the gate now he straightened up to grab at the post and swing round it hannes grinned and fluidly shifted his rifle to the hand holding the post he fired two quick shots smashing the hand vith the first and hitting the boys head with the secc id as it came round and above the t ost the violence strikes out against everybody and perhaps with more eroticism against ourselves the incidence of drunkenness crime and violence in urban black communities is alarmingly high the anger of the african character is always a going to extremes we love parties nicetimes noise and people we are sweating in a world where death is all around us a world in which only death has value in our attempts to obliterate timethe minutes of our lives we intoxicate ourselves with orgiastic pleasures noise and people and then when we are dizzy we annihilate ourselves we kill each other for pleasure for revenge for caprice aggression directed against the whitesthe outgroupsis more complex and variable it may be physical as demonstrated in the high incidents of crime and violence or more overt as on the personal level where insolence against the white man is common there is always some sort of rebellion against the race attitudes in the story a manner of speaking by arthur maimane the character is aggressively insistent on maintaining his dignity by being courteous but refusing to conform to the ster eotype of the african being in solent or cheekyby south afri can standardsbecomes a game which at the end of the story is to cost him his life after a minute he coughed the young woman turned her head slowly her eyes narrowed as she recognized him she looked out of the window again he coughed louder ja what do you want she asked without looking at him two tuppence stamps please she took the four steps towards the counter slowly hands on broad hips and head stuck out ahead of the body she stood across the counter from him her grey eyes boring into his say missis she said quietly the middleaged woman looked up from her novel and studied the two he remained silent if you dont say missis youre not getting your stamps look mevrou all i want is two tuppence stamps ive said please and that should be enough say missisor get out he stared back for a moment shrugged his shoulders and walked out physical violence strikes out against everybody the african character is always reacting scratching at the wall of colour prejudice accommodating it being aggressive to it or looking around for escapein compensationor taking flight from it going to other parts of africa or i running away to europe in search of a gentler political climate escape from the colour bar is the subtlest of the reactions of the african character the coloured and the indian the south african public image is white the values of that society are white and all the sex symbols are white and consequently the africans and the coloureds have to arrange themselves under the code of this standard since to be white is to be privileged the coloureds with low visibilityfair enough to pass for whiteescape into the domain of the whites and the africans of lighter skinthe less clearly visible africanssteal into the structure of the coloured group for the coloureds it means the end of living in social igloos the end of discrimination it means sliding into white society access into white restaurants cinemas theaters bars and other symbols of white privilege it is freedom to the lightskinned african it is an end to the regulations and the strangulations of the document called the pass passing himself off as a coloured will give the african freedom of movement the opportunity to select and accept the job of his own choice and the relief from being at the black bottom of the colour scale this escape into another colo r the rationalizations for it are illustrated in my own short story the havenots why go all sentimental this is a battle between the haves and the havenots the haves have made being black too much of a burden and the only way to survive is to fool them by playing their own game they made white a symbol of privilege and comfort so i decided to be as near white as i can bleach its not my fault im lightskinnednothing like enough to pass for lily white that isbut sufficiently to masquerade as a coloured okay okay i said raising my hand as a sign of peace whats in being a native anyway black devil black pitchforking devil black thats alljust black black black well i dont wanna be blacknot any more youll never be a white man steve said contemptously i dont wanna be a white man i shouted i just want to be white just white of particular interest is the way in which the nonwhite groups particularly the africanswill live with this situation and even retain their sense of humour without in any way beginning to accept it the nonwhite groups have been educated into an acceptance of their own inferiority and in some insidious way this educating has had some effect for this doctrine to be acceptedor even suspected the education into this accommodation or even acceptance will be directed towards elevating whiteness as some unattainable ideal some unobtainable standard all ambition will be directed physically towards or to an association with it the coloureds especially the ones with a darker skin have a psychosis about marrying coloured girls with a much fairer complex ion this woman becomes the substitute for white alternately the african man seeks to marry a lightskinned african girlpreferably a coloured girl this preoccupation with skin colour is a feature in the story forbidden love by d can themba the african character falls in love with a coloured girlhis personal substitute for white his psychological rejection of black comes into conflict against the coloured girls physical rejection of black the question of colour foreshadows the conflict she turned her head and placed her chin on his chest somehow mike she tried to explain softened again now i feel trapped by a doubly guilty shame im ashamed that its my people who are in the foreground of every move against your peopleashamed of my father whom i love but whos violent in his hatred of africans ashamed of my sister louisa who ought to feel nearer your people but hates them so unreasonably ashamed of my brothers shame for having been reclassified as an african ashamed of my mothers silence when i suspect i know it that she disapproves of their attitudes and then sweetie sometimes when i listen to them all iii am ashamed in a queer way thatj i hate myself for this secret love of ours another form taken by escape behaviour is one expressed by means of compensation the african character is obsessed with easing his condition he surrounds himself with the symbols of the society which is rejecting him he wants to be accepted he wants to qualify to be civilized so he develops a love for academic trappings and the related trinkets of opulence he flaunts his wealth he drives in big cars prefers publiclibrarysized houses filled with enormous pieces of furniture he erects these monuments both as a symbol of success and to his own sense of insecurity in south africa where opportunity and wealth are white such an african reasons that if to be white is to be wealthy then conversely to be wealthy should be to be white thus the african buys not a car but a status symbol the car must be big and flashypreferably a cadillacfor success has to have a high visibility this reaction is also manifest in the vulgarity of the makeup african women wear if to be white is to be painted with makeup the african woman in her search of this ideal adds on the paint with generous vulgarity straightens the tropic curl from her hair by burning the hair with a hot comb and she bleaches her face with lotions it is necessary that this should be done with vulgarity whatever she does must be better than the best in a tedious succession of escapist short stories published in drum zonk and other south african popular magazines the african indian and the coloured characters are paraded as gaudily successful boxing promoters tough private detectives and other cardboard images of romanticism yet even against this background the escapist short story hero is seldom if everon the side of formal law and order his efforts are directed at flaunting the law but in the short stories of ezekiel mphahlele famous educator and writer the characters do not easily fall into the categories defined in this analysis primarily because the author believes that the african character should be portrayed as a purely fictional character and not as a mould cast in racial tensions in his stories the african exists on a level far removed from the tensions of the colour bar which is not necessarily a hazard in his life author mphahlele insists upon the african portrayed as a human character wrestling with the basic hazards of man greed lust and pride in the story i the suitcase ezekiel mphahlele emphasizes the motive of greed be hind timis action of claiming the suitcase abandoned in a bus but behind every motive is cause and effect the position of the individual in any societyin particular that of south africa and to a lesser extent that of britainis determined by the colour or social caste into which that character is born that timi is black is implicit in the young white typists impersonal attitude towards him the same attitude is seen in the foreman they are not addressing themselves to timi the individual but to a black mask timi reacts by smiling knowingly this reaction is particularly interesting in that timi accommodates the depersonalization the grim reality of his situation returned to him with all its cold and aching pain today he had been led on something of a wild goose chase he had been to three places where the chances of getting work were promising he had failed at one firm he was told weve already got a boy john at the second firm a tiny typist told him youre too big jim the boss wants a small boyabout eighteen you know then she had gone on with her typing clouding her white face with cigarette smoke at the third place a short pudgy white man put down his price in a squeaky voice two pounds ten a week three pounds ten a week timi had said take it or leave it my boy was the proprietors final word timi chuckled to himself as he thought of the mans face his fat white cheeks and small blinking eyes ezekiel mphahleles white characters in the suitcase are not just human characters they are south african white the human character in any fiction has to function within the society which produces that character in the story down the quiet street also by ezekiel mphahlele there is no mention of the white figure nor is the colour question implied the characters come to life vividly with all the humour that is african the orchestration of the characters is flawless it is a recount of the story of the endless funeral processions which trailed down nadia street week after week short ones long ones poor insignificant ones rich snobbish ones there is a kind of escapist romanticism in the setting of this short story and but for the smuggling of liquor the story might be set outside south africa the reasons behind the liquor smuggling is not because prohibition is general but that it operates against africans only the african must drink and to do this he must be one jump ahead of the law no device is left unexplored even the sanctity of the funeral ritual is violated during one of those inevitable human accidents an incident reveals the se cret of those funeral processions one of the coffins cracks and a miniature avalanche of bottles came down to the ground in his more angry moods ezekiel mphahleles characters protest against the colour bar and against white attitudes all life in south africa is dominated by the impact of one colour upon the other the colour bar motivates all our actions all our reactions and all our attitudes the whites act in a manner determined by the roles they have to play in a dominant society the africans the indians and the coloureds react to one another and towards the white man in the various forms outlined in this analysis they may accept or accommodate the colour bar in accordance to the situation they are in they may be aggressive in their rejection of the situation or find a way of escape or take flight from it but there is always the physical presence of the colour bar examined in this essay are the social conditions and group attitudes which shape the pattern of the south african black short story all nuances of life of human relationships are contained in it perhaps in time other influences will insinuate different attitudes order a new society which will have a more fluid social mobility with a new set of relationships the short story will be there to interpret the new society meantime for so long as the social structure in present day south africa persists for so long will the africanrather the south african character wrestle with a set of demons marked made in south africa in june a delegation of six quakers representing o the annual meeting of the progressive friends came to the white house lincoln told them he was relieved to learn that were not ffice seekers for his chief trouble was from that class of persons sensing their mission lincoln informed his visitors that his next most troublesome subject was slavery in the discussion that followed lincoln matched his visitors in earnestness but he did not promise them that he would issue a proclamation of freedom as they wished sometime within the space of the next three weeks however the president decided that the time had come for an edict of emancipation lincoln did not take lightly the wishes of religious groups but more important in shaping his determination was the military situation things were not going well on the war front in late june and early july richmond the confederate capital had withstood a bloody siege thus sending aglimmering the hope that the south would soon sue for peace a prolonged war now became inevitable which meant calling up additional troops and evoking a fresh source of inspiration for this latter moralebuilding component lincoln took the course that had been urged upon him for so many months by church groups abolitionists and negroesa presidential decree of freedom during the first days of july lincoln began to put together the first draft of an emancipation proclamation the writing was done in the cipher room of the military telegraph office at the desk of superintendent thomas t eckert sixtytwo days were to elapse before lincoln could issue the proclamation during this period he had to keep his intentions secret worse still he had to endure the jibes of the abolitionists and the more restrained but equally pointed criticisms of other reformist groups lincoln had to listen to the vehement antislavery views of his friend cassius clay returned from his post in russia he had to receive religious groups who urged immediate emancipation such as the large delegation of chicago clergymen who spent an hour in earnest and frank discussion at the white house on september what good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do he asked the clergymen i do not want to issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be inoperative like the popes bull against the comet i the most influential of the lincoln critics during the two months while the proclamation lay in the darkness of a desk drawer was the energetic horace greeley editor of the widely read letter dated august and printed on the editorial page of the next days tribune was a piece from mr greeleys own pen bearing an impressive title the prayer of twenty millions addressed to lincoln the editorial complained of the seeming subserviency of your policy to the slaveholding slaveryupholding interest loyal americans wrote greeley demanded that lincoln enforce the second confiscation act liberating the slaves of rebels on the face of this wide earth mr president there is not one disinterested determined intelligent champion of the union cause who does not feel that all attempts to put down the rebellion and at the same time uphold its inciting cause are preposterous and futile greeleys public letter was welcomed by lincoln it gave him a chance to do two things restate his own position and prepare the public mind for an emancipation proclamation issued upon military necessity on august in one of his most important state papers lincoln released his reply to the press his opening lines were eventoned and conciliatory if said he greeleys letter was impatient and dictatorial in tone he overlooked it in deference to a long friendship he did not mean lincoln continued to leave anyone in doubt as to the policy i seem to be pursuing as you say my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union these added lincoln in a final short paragraph were his official views and were not intended as any change in his repeatedly expressed personal wishes that all men everywhere could be free by saturday september lincoln was assured of the withdrawal of the confederate forces on the next day he went to the soldiers home and wrote out his second draft of the preliminary proclamation and then read it aloud to vicepresident hannibal hamlin with the document much as he wanted it lincoln was now ready for the historic day of its promulgationseptember on noon of that monday lincoln met with his cabinet in special session with everyone present it was evident that this was an important occasion lincoln sought to reduce the tension by reading a passage from humorist artemus ward then abandoning his light tone lincoln informed his solemnfaced and attentive associates that he had vowed he would issue an emancipation proclamation as soon as the rebels were driven out of maryland that time had now come he had brought them together explained lincoln to hear what he had written he did not solicit their advice on the wisdom of the step he had determined that for himselfbut he would listen to any comments on style or wording lincoln then read the document through making remarks wrote chase on several points as he went along this preliminary emancipation negro colonization the act of march forbidding officers to return runaways and the second confiscation act of july but the heart of the proclamation was the opening phrases of the third paragraph that on the first day of january in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtythree all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforward and forever free after he had finished lincoln waited for comments chase and montgomery blair made brief statements seward suggested two modifications to which lincoln had no objections then the cabinet was dismissed later that afternoon lincoln and seward signed the proclamationas negroes and their wellwishers read over the preliminary emancipation proclamation they could not fail to note the complete absence of any abolitionist fervor or pronegro sentiment plainly lincoln had not followed the abolitionistnegro line that the favor of the almighty was to be gained not by force of arms but by the panoply of righteousness indeed this document of september sounded like a cross between a military directive and a lawyers brief its opening sentence set its tone in it lincoln called attention to his authority as commander in chief of the army and navy and he stated that the aim of the war was the restoration of the union moreover in the edict lincoln stated that efforts at negro deportation would be continued and of course slavery was to be abolished only in those places in rebellion not in places where the stars and stripes actually flew to abolitionists the proclamation had another drawback it gave the rebellious states the opportunity of keeping their slaves if they would lay down their arms by january but nobody the abolitionists included made much of this alternative inasmuch as nobody high or low north or south believed that the people of the confederacy would listen to lincolns terms despite the proclamations limitations negroes hailed it with much joy the war wrote frederick douglass was now invested with sanctity a few celebrations were held the largest was one of new york city negroes at shiloh church on september the man who called this meeting and organized it was henry highland garnet who simply could not wait until january as he had already been waiting for nearly two decades i do pray garnet had written on september from troy new york to g a thatcher that you and i may see that great dayi mean the emancipation day o that the lord may hasten it on at the enthusiastic and crowded meeting at shiloh church garnet presided was one of the main speakers and delivered the benediction most negroes were too prudent to follow garnets example preferring instead to wait until january when the final proclamation was due for negroes while ever hopeful were also ever realistic they knew that lincolns preliminary edict was little more than the declaration of an intention they knew that there was nothing in custom or in law that could compel him to follow it up would the president issue the final proclamation this was the momentous question before the negroes during those fourteen weeks from september to january those fateful one hundred days of the countdown during this period the negro listened intently for telltale sounds from the white house but lincolns words and actions seemed to take on all the ambiguity of a delphic oracle entering into lincolns deliberation and fixing his determination about issuing an emancipation proclamation were considerations of a varied naturemilitary political and diplomatic to lincoln the first of these was preeminent military necessity required that the enemy be deprived of his slaves lincoln knew that the black population of the south was one of its greatest assets the confederacy had not actually put a gun in the hands of the colored man but tens of thousands of its slaves saw frontline service being employed as orderlies teamsters and military laborers slaves who remained on the home front supplied the skills for the factories and the brawn for working the mines and it was the labor of the plantation slave that produced the cotton the south hoped to sell in england to weaken this black arm of the confederacy had become the first order of military business a blunt fact from which lincoln could not flinch in the late summer of on september lincoln told secretary chase that the emancipation proclamation had been issued solely as a military necessity and not because it was politically expedient or morally right nonetheless political considerations had influenced the issuing of the edict himself a republican lincoln was obliged to make concessions to the point of view of his party including its radical wing as the war went on with no end in sight these radicals became more insistent than ever that the abolition of slavery become an officially avowed goal of the war the support of these radicals was important to the lincoln administration and this support could be jeopardized without an edict of emancipation the extent to which political considerations shaped the issuing of the emancipation edict becomes evident in lincolns dealings with the altoona conference governors andrews of massachusetts had called a meeting of loyal governors to be held at altoona pennsylvania during the last week of september as announced in the call the chief aim of the conference was to press for action against slavery lincoln was not asleep by a shrewd stroke he proceeded to undercut the scheduled conference he summoned governors curtin and andrew to the white house and told them of the emancipation proclamation lying in his desk awaiting a battlefield victory curtin and andrew realized that they had been outflanked they had also been won over fortunately for lincoln the victory at antietam enabled him to issue his proclamation before the altoona meeting after their conference the governors came to washington in a group and called at the white house on september they congratulated lincoln on the issuing of the proclamation and lincoln with a straightfaced solemnity matching theirs told them that their approval of the measure assured him more than anything else that he had done the right thing a third important factor in bringing about and supporting the proclamation was european particularly english opinion in england the governing and aristocratic classes were antinorth and would have been glad to extend diplomatic recognition to the confederacy but the masses and the middle class in the british isles were union sympathizers and disliked the south as slaverys strongest bastion in the western world in large measure the groundwork for this british antislavery sentiment had been laid by american negroes who for a quarter of a century had been touring england ireland and scotland many of these negroes were escaped slaves like william wells brown who in five years abroad made over a thousand addresses william and ellen craft moved british audiences to tears with the story of their dramatic escape from macon georgia with ellen disguised as a young slavemaster the procession of negroes did not abate with the war american negroes like j sella martin acted almost as if they were ministers without portfolio in furthering the union cause far from her salem massachusetts home the young eloquent and earnest sarah p remond always effective on the platform exhorted her listeners to stand firm let no diplomacy of statesmen no intimidation of slaveholders no scarcity of cotton no fear of slave insurrections prevent the people of great britain from maintaining their position as the friend of the oppressed negro the greatest drawing card among the american negroes during the autumn of was william andrew davis the escaped excoachman of confederate president jefferson davis these negroes like their counterparts before the war did much to intensify the antislavery sentiment of the british masses lincoln knew that reformist groups and workingmens associations in england would hail an edict of emancipation he was aware too that such a proclamation would be a heavy blow to the foreign policy of the confederacy striking king cotton diplomacy in a most vulnerable spot after the emancipation proclamation was issued the confederate agents stationed in european capitals were no longer able to play down the slavery issue by asserting that the north had no intention of changing the status of the black man member of parliament and reformer richard cobden who was interested in free men as well as in free trade was sure that lincolns edict turned the tide of public opinion in the british isles you know he wrote to charles sumner from londons athenaeum club on february how much alarmed i was from the first lest our government should interpose in your affairs this state of feeling existed up to the announcement of the presidents emancipation policy from that moment our old antislavery feeling began to arouse itself and it has been gathering strength ever since the final emancipation proclamation was signed on the scheduled date considering the widespread discussion of it during the preceding one hundred days the signing ceremonies were quiet and undramatic indeed almost offhand on the afternoon of january the document was ready for the presidents signature after he had spent nearly half a week on and off working it over he had held cabinet meetings on each of the last three days of the year on december reading the proclamation to the heads of departments on the next day furnishing them with copies for their criticisms and on the last morning of the year reconvening them for final revisions the afternoon of that december lincoln spent in reviewing the notes and memoranda submitted by the cabinet members and in framing his language he then began the rewriting of the entire document making sure that his penmanship was spencerian in clarity if not in slant up early the next morning and clearheaded after a new years eve without revels lincoln completed his writing and sent the finished product to the state department to be engrossed shortly before eleven oclock the document was returned to the white house lincoln was on the point of signing it when he noticed an error in the attestation as a clerk had used the phraseology common to a treaty rather than to a proclamation staying his signature the chief executive rushed off to the blue room to undergo a threehour ritual of handshaking the reception at the white house on new years day was a long established custom lincoln and his wife stood in the short receiving line to be wished a happy the first hour was reserved for officialdom diplomats high army brass navy officers congressmen and federal judges then for two hours came the general public by midafternoon the reception was over and lincoln could return to the executive office waiting for him was the properly engrossed proclamation spread out on the desk by secretary seward not more than a dozen informally gathered witnesses were present as lincoln reached for his steeltipped pen its inksplattered wooden handle rough from gnawing lincoln feared that his signature would be tremulous and uneventhree hours of hand shaking he explained to schuyler colfax that evening is not calculated to improve a mans chirography but if his arm was limp and his hand was unsteady his will was firm to himself but loud enough so that it could be heard by frederick seward the secretary of states son he remarked anyway it is going to be done carefully and slowly he traced abraham lincoln not abbreviating his first name as he so often did why lincoln freed the slaves abraham lincoln was a great american and a great president in the civil war crisis one with a vision of freedom for his nation a pioneer in political freedom one who was devoted to duty and to his ideals one who sacrificed for his achievements and gave his life in martyrdom for his cause but even in explaining the emancipation proclamation lincoln did not regard himself as a great man but rather modestly said i claim not to have controlled events but confessed plainly that events have controlled me it is in this spirit that we approach the subject of abraham lincoln in the first place while there is considerable difficulty in discovering the real lincoln it can be said that abraham lincoln was not an abolitionist and he was not a proslavery advocate there were several types of antislavery men there were radical abolitionists i such as william lloyd garrison almost in a class by himself and such men as wendell phillips and gerrit smith there were educators and ministers with antislavery views horace mann and theodore parker there were statesmen with antislavery views salmon p chase and charles francis adams there were also many hundred whose views were antislavery but who were mild in their expressions what was lincolns real attitude and opinion in early years his career in early years was similar to that of a politician who was a rough product of pioneer parents in early rural kentucky and who had married into a slaveholding family he broke openly with the abolitionists and even declined to go along with the free soil party the influence of environment had considerable value upon his career he shared with southerners some of their views concerning the negro the fact that abraham lincoln was born in kentucky taken to indiana at the age of seven years and from there to the great state of illinois had its influence on his lifes attitudes toward colored americans buttressed by the moving events of the civil war the fact that there were antislavery sentiments expressed by him is very clearly shown in one of his early speeches when he said if slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong i cannot remember when i did not think so and feel so attempts have been made to show the origins of lincolns opinions on the negro and slavery they have moved all the way from a belief that god endowed abraham lincoln with a dislike of slavery and used him as his instrument to destroy it to the belief that he was merely an instrument in the hands of events however the official biographers of abraham lincoln nicolay and hay state that these attempts seem an idle waste of labor these sentiments came with the first awakening of his mind and conscience and were aroused into active life and energy by the sight of fellow creatures in chains on an ohio steamboat and on the wharf at new orleans however it is well to note that abraham lincoln differed sharply with abolitionists in reference to slavery at one time it is reported that he appeared as a councilor for a kentucky slaveholder seeking the return of a fugitive slave his first public avowal on slavery was made as a representative in the illinois legislature in this was the period following which congress had declared that all abolition petitions should be laid on the table without discussion the proposal being for the purpose of decreasing acrimonious debate when similar resolutions were presented in the illinois legislature in abraham lincoln and daniel stone his colleague from sangamon county protested against this on march this attitude was further revealed in the lincolndouglas debates in stephen douglas was wont during these debates to accuse lincoln of endeavoring to establish what he called social equality and on one occasion he used the expression abe lincoln and other abolitionists wanted to i marry negroes lincoln answered j on september spurning the doctrine then known as social equality in his fourth debate with i douglas i am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black racesthat i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intimacy with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black faces which i believe forbids the two living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of the superior and the inferior and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race and again lincoln answered i protest against the counterfeit logic which concludes that because i do not want a black woman for a slave i must necessarily want her for a wife he criticized the dred scott decision because it decreed that a negro could not be a united states citizen and yet he said i told douglas very frankly i am not in favor of negro citizenship however it was lincolns view that the states had the power to make the negro a citizen and said he if the state of illinois had that power i should be opposed to the exercise of it lincoln later changed his halfslave and halffree declaration to the effect that all states have the right to do exactly as they please about slavery but yet he opposed the spread of slavery to the territories he also emphasized the moral evil of slavery joining fc the same with his moderation and tolerance and yet as a politician he permitted his law partner herndon to keep in touch with antislavery people lincolns opinions on slavery were maturing gradually with the passing years it would be difficult to prove that lincoln changed his ideas about slavery but it is evident that they were maturing developing and following events of war and that he was not the uncompromising and outspoken opponent of slavery the great emancipator as hero worshipers would conclude however nothing is more compelling and more plain than that one of the background motives of abraham lincolns career was his antipathy to slavery when lincoln assumed office as president his policy was again a conservative one he assured a kentucky democrat that he would administer the fugitive slave law as honestly and as fairly as mr buchanan had done to alexander stephens he wrote do the people of the south really entertain fears that a republican administration would directly or indirectly interfere with the slaves or with them about the slaves if they do i wish to assure you as once a friend and still i hope not an enemy that there is no cause for such fears the south would be in no more danger than in the days of washington in the inaugural address of he disclaimed especially no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists and any design to violate the rights of the states on the subject of slavery this statement was in accordance with the republican platform of which proclaimed the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states to control their domestic institutions it may be alleged that these were the shrewd observations of a politician used by a man who was a master politician to prevent a more decided opposition from the border states to secure to his administration the support of many doubters at the north and to express the view that he would not ally himself with the abolition wing of the republican party not long after he had been in office president lincoln was forced to deal with the practical questions of slavery the movements of union troops released slaves and made them free at first the commanders were permitted to decide the question as a local one when general fremont in had undertaken the declaration that confiscated slaves were free in missouri lincoln overruled him when general hunter in declared the slaves free held by their owners in georgia florida and south carolina lincoln vetoed the measure saying that he reserved to himself as commanderinchief of the army and navy to declare the slaves of any state or states free and when it shall become a neces sity indispensable to the maintenance of our government lincolns policy was a policy of discretion and of expediency which he declared i reserve to myself the important policy of lincoln toward slavery was based on compensated emancipation he believed that the states should emancipate the slaves the slaveholders must be paid for their property in slaves the federal government must bear the cost in bonds the states should have time even until and that the colored people should be persuaded to be colonized in a foreign land with federal aid when horace greeley through the tribune issued his prayer for twenty millions urging freedom for the slaves and that president lincoln should strike boldly at slavery lincoln replied my paramount object is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do also that and yet he said that he expressed his personal wish that all men everywhere could be free here then was the president of the united states speaking not as a man who was necessarily an advocate of negro freedom and negro equality but one who spoke as the president of the united states this is fundamental to the understanding of abraham lincolns attitude toward the negro congress was ahead of the president in emancipation policyand this fact is too often ignored the dramatic announcement of the preliminary proclamation and the emancipation proclamation which seized the popular imagination and has been kept alive by orators and writers has dimmed the emancipation acts of the congress of the united states these congressional activities were prior to lincolns action and were evidences that congress was ahead of the president and also that he ignored the action of congress and acted when he issued the proclamation as if congress had done nothing on july lincoln advised secretaries gideon welles and seward according to welles that he had about reached the conclusion that a proclamation of emancipation was absolutely essential for the salvation of the union two days later secretary chase states that he announced that he would issue such a proclamation finding that he could gather influence from northern elements for there was increase of war radicalism the presence of thousands of negroes within union lines recognizing that the international aspects of a northern antislavery policy would cause distress to the south t particularly in england and supported by general lees retreat from pennsylvania to virginia and general braggs retreat from kentucky the preliminary proclamation of emancipation as a war measure was issued on september this preliminary proclamation was welcomed with acclaim by the abolitionists and by the people of color in the united states but was received rather coldly by the nation as a whole and it was said that states would be turning away from the president in the ensuing elections the emancipation proclamation declaring slaves in the rebellious states then thenceforth and forever free was a war expedient it was a war measure which lincoln said was an act warranted by the constitution upon military necessity it was intended to affect enemy territory for it also declared that the executive government would not act to repress any efforts that negroes in slavery would make for their actual freedom and yet he urged them to abstain from all violence unless in selfdefense this proclamation was not an encouragement to violence but it meant that colored men might fight for their freedom as soldiers the picture of an emancipator breaking the chains of slavery in the united states through this proclamation is false the proclamation exempted parts of louisiana tennessee and virginia and in states under union control it proclaimed emancipation where there was no power to execute it lincoln himself admitted that measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful by be coming indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation however the proclamation was a symbol of the fact that the war was not only to save the union but also to free the slaves for in the freedom of the slave was also the saving of the union he also admitted in a letter to secretary chase september that the proclamation had no legal justification except as a war measure and that he regarded it as expedient and right we do well to commemorate the years of the civil war and the year of emancipation and and we do well to honor one hero who stands out predominantlyabraham lincoln however we should not overlook frederick douglass and the thousands of negroes who were abolitionists and emancipators in their fight against slavery and the subordination of man to man the negroes who gave their best in the cause of freedom and emancipated themselves and the hundreds of thousands of white citizens who believed in freedom and all those of both groups who continue to believe in it the cause of emancipation is one therefore in which millions should join throughout the land for just as slavery had enslaved the black man it had also enslaved the white man for both were in bondage and are still to the concepts of color we now await freedom from color domination freedom from prejudice freedom from false concepts as they relate to population groups and the realization of the freedom of which lincoln was an exponent and for which he became a martyr the great emancipator then and now must have many lesser ones who motivate events and give to him the chosen opportunity

frequently enough to convince both my son and me that his educational and social experiences as a minority member even in a very liberal high school left much to be desired in a youngster destined to be a minority member for life with this thought in mind ole dad began a little retrospection my high school days under strikingly similar circumstances my undergraduate days at iowa and my graduate days at michigan were brought into focus and analyzed what i saw under my retrospective microscope did not exactly please my experience over the past years as a teacher in a system where the prime requisite for promotion is to be a member of the majority group also undoubtedly had an effect upon my thoughts this is all incidental thinking however i feel these background thoughts are necessary if one is to understand the final outcome my sons matriculation at fisk we started our search for a college when butch entered his freshman year in high school upon request we received catalogs from a half dozen of the better small liberal arts colleges liberal arts because my wife and i advised butch to steer clear of the large university campus for undergraduate work as we feel the campus of the small liberal arts college is where the real educative process takes place as we browsed these catalogs the name of fisk as an exchange school was frequently mentioned thus the initial stimulus in our thinking of fisk was planted we then became more aware of the frequency with which fisk was mentioned in the daily press as the alma mater of recently appointed local state and even federal officials so we sent for and received a fisk catalog a thorough examination readily pointed out the excellent reasons fisk appeared in the other catalogs as an exchange school we became enthused and began to five years ago my work took me to swaziland where i had a bad motor accident i was nursed by harriet dhlamini a niece of sobuza ii paramount chief of swaziland f i l from the age of three harriet had spent most of her life in durban training there as a nurse she had only recently returned to swaziland when i met her she was she is goodlooking vivacious with a quick sense of humour softhearted and sympathetic to those she was nursing and yet herself strong and selfconfident i had never before met anyone like her regardless of colour and at i fell in love with her and she with me i determined somehow to make her my wife it was going to be one of the most difficult things to achieve my work was in publishing in south africa but how could i return there and continue my association with harriet apartheid has been responsible for two acts which affected us under the immorality act any association of any kind between opposite sexes where one party is white and the other is coloured is construed as an attempt to have carnal intercourse the act makes this a criminal offense punishable by up to seven years imprisonment and for a man under to whipping in addition the maximum being eight lashes the mixed marriages act not only prohibits mixed marriages but also stipulates that those contracted elsewhere are not recognized in south africa if we were to live in south africa marriage was therefore out of the question i suggested to harriet that she accompany me to durban we would have to wait to marry until we could see our way clear to leaving south africa for good in the meantime she would be my housekeeperour only chance of being together because she knew that i was genuinely in love with her she agreed in the hope that one day our difficulties would be resolved we took a flat in durban each night harriet had to leave me and sleep in the location slum at cato manor to comply with the apar theid laws cato manor about halfanhours ride in an overcrowded african bus is the filthy hideout of every kind of durban african from respectable working people to thieves dope peddlers prostitutes and murderers on a sunday in february we took a run in the car down the natal south coast harriet of course sitting in the back and wearing an overall like a real servant at scottburgh some miles south of durban we had trouble with the car and as it was sunday and no mechanics were on duty at the garages i had to try to put it right myself harriet helped me by passing tools and so on soon we had onlookerstwo boer youths who spoke very pleasantly to me one went away for five minutes or so and returned almost immediately they were joined by a third youth also a boer he announced that he was a policeman and so were the other two and that we were under arrest for attempting to contravene the immorality act by enticing each other to have carnal intercourse we were marched off to the police station where they kept us waiting for three hours whilst the charge against us was being prepared eventually we were called into a sergeant detective who said that sworn statements had been given by members of the public and that we were being formally charged there was no question of bail but they agreed that i could telephone a lawyer however every time the trunk call came through they cut me off on the switchboard after the third attempt i was told that they couldnt be fed about all night and that we were to be locked up the police said that there were no cells for europeans at scottburgh and that i would be taken to umzinto nine miles away harriet was locked up where she was in a crowded cell where she was made to sleep on the bare cement with one ragged blanket that stank of urine and excrement the whole place was crawling with fleas bugs and lice i was put into a scrupulously clean cell with new blankets the next day we were brought before the magistrate at umzinto court and remanded in custody for two weeks harriet was locked up in umzinto goals which was so overcrowded that the women had to sleep on top of one another i was put into a small cell usually used for africans who had been sentenced to solitary confinement it was only just big enough to lie down in they gave me a new sisal mat to lie on and two new blankets i was allowed out only to wash and shave i was not permitted to read or to smoke no one spoke to me when we came before the court again we were charged with attempting to commit an immoral act the police had three fake witnessesan unemployed african and two unemployed indians who i found out later had been bribed with s each before the court adjourned for the day i informed the court that i should require the petrol boy at the garage to be called as a defense witness next morning the prosecutor handed me a packet of cigarettes i knew then that he had thrown in the towel at the end of the case for the state i asked for our discharge and the magistrate granted it back at the garage the petrol boy described how he had been beaten by the police and threatened with the loss of his job in an effort to get him to tell lies after the publicity of the trial it was impossible to return to the flat so using a different name we took a acre farm midway between durban and pietermaritzburg i could continue with my work while harriet looked after the farm we were happy the farm was fairly isolated but a regular visitor was the sergeant of the local police one day he told harriet that she should not share one bedroom with me he said that police both european and african frequently came around in the night and had reported to him we had been there about three months when we paid off one of the african farm laborers who was idling he went to the police to report that harriet and i were living as man and wife the sergeant came again and said he was sorry but the complaint appeared officially in the occurrence book and he would have to make a report to his superiors in pietermaritzburg he advised us to leave the farm within a week before we found ourselves in serious trouble after a couple of temporary moves we bought a house at escombe some miles from durban this was a lovely little house built on the top of a hill my bedroom was at the front and under it with no access from inside the house was a large cellar which was harriets bedroom the large garden was surrounded by a high stone wall except along the nextdoor garden boundary where there was a wire dividing fence with our past experience to guide us we bought two great danes one of which was most vicious we frequently found pieces of uniform and civilian clothes in the morning tom from african and sometimes european policemen and detectives the africans told harriet they hated trying to spy but were under orders eventually the police began to watch from the nextdoor garden causing the dogs to bark most of the night after a yearour longest time in one placeour nerves could stand it no more and we decided to live in basutoland a british protectorate my idea was that i would work in south africa all week and come home to harriet at the week end i transferred my business activities to bloemfontein in the orange free state travelling over miles every weekend but the roads were shocking the house primitive and the cost too high we stuck it out for four months and then moved to swaziland another british protectorate where we rented a small farm while i travelled each week to south africa after three months we again realized we could not afford it there was no other course but to do what we hated doingmove back to south africa this time we took a flat in barberton in the eastern transvaal it had a servants room outside to which harriet had to go soon after dinner usually at about pm the old troubles again beset us detectives were round the house all night one night harriet crept out on three african detectives and threw a bucket of hot water over them we had a bit of quiet for a week or two after that by the end of may we thought johannesburg might be a better bet i went to live with my sister in the hope that nobody would suspect that harriet was anything other than a real servant but one night after we had been there a few veeks harriet and i were awakened by the bedclothes being roughly pulled off us it was the police we were taken to the district surgeon who tried to find evidence of sexual intercoursean examination i shall never forget after we had been twice before the court we were granted bail on september we decided to push off to rhodesia by train through bechuanaland we stopped at francistown and got a travelling pass for harriet since she had no passport we caught the night train which was boarded by federal rhodesian immigration officials just before plumtree the border post as we were travelling together they quickly realized the position and demanded a deposit of in cash from each of us as a condition of entry we did not have that sum so returned on the next train some miles back to tsessebe but the federal rhodesian immigration official had been in touch with francistown and told them that as we were obviously man and wife we were not wanted in rhodesia the francistown immigration officials came out in a truck took us to francistown and told us we were not wanted in bechuanaland either we were ordered on to the next train to return miles to south africa african police travelled with us there had also been a telephone call to the border post so that police were waiting back in johannesburg we were held in custody until trial we did not go on defense since we did not want our history to come out under crossexamination on october last year we were sentenced to six months imprisonment each this meant release on february allowing for remission my main concern in prison was that as i was a united kingdom subject i might be deported on completion of sentence and have no chance of seeing harriet again to defeat this possibility i wrote to the south african immigration authorities a real bulldust letter stressing how i supported apartheid and so on as february drew near i realized there was only one solutionto take harriet to england as quickly as possible we cleared up what we could in a week and travelled separately to lobatsi in bechuanaland we were granted a special license and married by the district commissioner on march the first mixed couple to be married in the bechuanaland protectorate after a couple of weeks together we went separately to cape town and stayed in different hotelsharriet in a coloured one and i in a white harriet got a passport from the british embassy after being registered as a citizen of the uk we caught the ship on which i am writing this with minutes to spare now we have little left with which to make a new start in england except our love and our freedom to us the most valuable things in the world from the time she could toddle a little colored girl bom in went up and down among the rows on a south carolina cotton plantation picking cotton she wore a coarse cotton dress her feet were bare little did she dream that nearly a hundred years later beautiful ladies in rich silken ball gowns would attend a gala ball in washington in honor of her memory but just that happened the ball held in was called the international debutante cotillion it was a colorful affair with women from many lands making a brilliant showing in their native costumes it was sponsored by the members of the national council of negro women an organization founded when she became a woman by the little girl from the cotton patch the money raised at the ball was to be used by the council to help in erecting a monument to its founder mary mcleod bethune the monument the first one in the nations capital to honor an american negro was authorized by the congress and by the president in sponsoring it in the senate senator kenneth b keating of new york said mary bethune has earned her monument it is significant that the memorial honoring mrs bethune will also commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the signing of the emancipation proclamation thanks to that proclamation mary mcleod was bom a free child although her parents sam and patsy had been slaves they had enjoyed twelve years of freedom when mary was bom however being bom free did not necessarily mean that a poor little negro girl could do whatever she wanted to while she was very young mary learned that the hard and painful way two arrogant little white girls taunted her with not being able to read as they could that hurt there was nothing she wanted so much to do as to be able to read but there was slim chance for a little negro girl to learn reading in mayesville south carolina in fact there was no school within many miles and if there had been sam and patsy could hardly have spared even one child from work in the cotton fields least of all could they have let mary go she was their prize picker but as she made her way up and down the rows mary kept hoping hoping hoping that some way some day she could manage to go to school she prayed that she might unexpectedly her prayers were answeredanswered by an unknown presbyterian mission board in the north miss wilson a teacher sent to the south by them managed to persuade sam and patsy to send one of their seventeen children to the little school she had been commissioned to start in mayesville after thinking it over marys parents decided that she should be the one to go shes homely but shes smart yes she is smart sam said so the elevenyearold little girl swishing her bright gingham dress skipped five miles to school each morning and trudged the distance home at night never had she been so happy the day of her graduation came all too soon when she was fifteen after that no further education was in sight for her the cotton fields seemed to stretch endlessly through life for mary mcleod then just as unexpectedly as her first chance for going to school had come to her a second opportunity came again miss wilson brought it a faraway northern seamstress whose father had instilled into her mind the realization of the need for negro education in the south had offered a scholarship to some promising negro girl at scotia seminary in concord north carolina miss wilson herself a graduate of scotia was to select the girl she chose mary even her train fare was provided she started off alone on her first train trip to scotia seminary two hundred miles away in she finished her studies there with credit to miss wilson to her parents and to the unknown seamstress during marys years at the school she developed a great interest in africa and the missionary work done there and still needed there she decided she wanted to go to darkest africa as a missionary after she left scotia she talked this idea over with the principal who helped her get a scholarship at moody institute in chicago he felt that in that school she would get the best possible training for her desired lifework mary made an excellent record in her two years at moody after which she went to new york to apply to the presbyterian board of foreign missions for an assignment in africa from that board she received her first big disappointment they said no she was too young fortunately youth has ideals and determination marys ideal was education for all colored young people her determination was to use her strength her talents and her life to help them get it if she couldnt help negroes in africa she would do her utmost in america from that determination she never wavered as long as she lived years later she wrote in her spiritual biography i give my best at all times and accept without complaint the results i expect the best she went home after her disappointment about africa and did her best in the cotton fields sometimes she even outpicked her father gathering in pounds a day her neighbors were glad to have mary back at home she worked among themespecially among the children she had an exceptionally fine contralto voice well trained at scotia and on sundays she invited everybody to come and sing with her at her fathers cabin door all this time however her dearest hope was for a teaching position finally in answer to her application the board of missions assigned her to a school in augusta georgia it was called haines normal institute the school was in a poor district of the city called for some unexplained reason the terry the streets were swarming with the juvenile delinquents of that day who made walking there a hazard here mary saw a chance to do her best to expect the best from these hoodlums seemed like looking for a miracle but she tried she persuaded the principal of the school to let her invite the young street arabs to come to the school on sunday afternoons walking up and down the dangerous streets of the terry she told each child he would be welcome the next sunday one imagines that the first little rascals who came did so with tongues in cheeks it must have looked to them like a heavensent opening for more and different mischief to their surprise they liked what they were offeredstories singing and no sermons the first comers spread the word that it was fun to sing along with mary and more and more children came as the weeks went by before long the terry became a better and a safer place no doubt mary learned a useful lesson herethat a singing child is a happy child and a betterbehaved child at any rate singing was always part of her program in all her later association with children and young people by mary had married albertus bethune like herself a teacher while they lived in savannah marys only child a son was born while the child was a little boy the bethunes moved to palatka florida education for negroes in florida as elsewhere in the south was in a sad state mrs bethune was consumed by a desire to do something about it it made her boil to see grown men and women unable to read she remembered what that was like herself and she knew how much her own mother patsy wished she had learned to read although patsy was descended from tribal rulers in africa and carried herself like an aristocrat she could not read mary could not rest until she had made a supreme effort to give colored children the chances she felt they should have she learned that daytona florida to which many negro families had come to work on flaglers new railroad lacked schools would that be a place to open her own school she wondered she talked it over with her husband who was skeptical about her ability to help the situation in daytona youve only got a dollar and a half he pointed out to her that will hardly start a school that and faith will answered mary albertus probably said something like well itll be your baby and went about his own teaching in palatka mary however would not be dissuaded from her purpose she set his house in palatka in order took little albert by the hand and accepted a ride to daytona concerning marys daytona venture mrs arabella denniston in later years mrs bethunes private secretary has said i have never met a person who possessed more faith in god and in humanity eventually with a prayer and a promise of future payment to the landlord mary opened her school in a rickety little shack on the edge of a snakeinfested dump she stretched her dollar and a half beyond belief and on opening day welcomed her entire student body five little girls in some way she managed to pay her first months rent eleven dollars soon she had a regular income from an unusual source sweet potato pies she excelled in making that wholesome delicacy which sold like the proverbial hotcakes laborers families loved them and wealthy winter visitors found them a pleasant change from hotel fare as she had proved in the terry mary bethune was an expert at making children sing and sing well as her school grew she trained a chorus which sang at daytonas resort hotels they were at one time taken in a boat to the home of john d rockefeller at nearby ormond beach not only were they paid for their concerts but wealthy men and women down from the north for the winter sent generous gifts to the school it was in that marys school opened now nearly sixty years later the tiny school has grown to be a large accredited fouryear college like other colleges it confers not only earned degrees but honorary degrees at one commencement after she had retired as president mary was privileged to confer an honorary degree on a friend and helper of early days he was a grayhaired negro minister from virginia in her citation she reminded him of how they had gone together to the city dump as scavengers they had picked out bits of broken furniture and discarded packing boxes remember she said how we patched these up glued them together and made desks and chairs for the little girls and for me the old gentleman smiled and nodded he remembered throughout her years as president of bethunecookman college no less than eight other colleges conferred honorary degrees on mary she treasured particularly the one given to her in by rollins college in winter park florida it was the first honorary degree ever conferred on a person of her race by a white college in the south in presenting her to president hamilton holt the public orator spoke of her triumphant struggle against almost insuperable odds president holt in his citation said to her you have in your own person again demonstrated that from the humblest beginnings and through most adverse circumstances it is still possible for one who has the will the intelligence the courage and the neverfailing faith in god and in your fellow man to rise from the humblest cabin in the land to a place of honor and influence among the worlds eminent as she walked down the aisle of the beautiful chapel of rollins college wearing her cap and gown and with the rollins doctors hood of blue and gold over her shoulders perhaps she felt as dressed up as did the gayly clad women at the later cotillion in her honor how any little fivefoot woman accomplished all she did for her college and her country is hard to understand her secretary mrs denniston has written each days work began with a few moments of meditation and prayer with her entire staff for recreation on quiet evenings we would enjoy a few games of checkers she usually came out best there perhaps was part of the secret of her accomplishment days begun peacefully with prayer and ended in quiet relaxation possibly too the fact that she usually came out best buoyed her spirits her students loved her although she had a wholesomely restraining influence on them possibly she remembered when she had had to be threatened with demerits while she was a toolively girl at scotia the students seemed to feel about her as james barrie did about his mother you never knew where she was unless you took hold of her if mary appeared on the campus in a white dress beware she was wearing her inspection uniform any students who had left their rooms in disorder might well quake dusty corners and carelessly made beds never escaped her attention as she made her rounds in mary came to an agreement with the methodist church whereby her girls school and their boys school in jacksonville were amalgamated under the name of bethunecookman college the church assumed all financial responsibility mary as president kept control of the courses of study in the nineteen thirties the nation suffered a crippling depression banks closed and unemployment was widespread it was an especially hard time for negroes so many of them were out of work mary felt that she must help her best was needed by her country as she went up and down and to and fro in the land urging help for her people an inspired idea came to her she thought she would be more convincing if she could say she was speaking as the voice of all negro women not just as mary bethune following out this conviction she organized a group which was named the national council of negro women soon it was strong quite a voice mary was seeking nothing that she was not ready to give herself let her secretary illustrate that she wrote she had a way of talking with people and reestablishing their confidence in themselves a young womanhungry jobless almost at her wits endcame in to see her one day she had no appointment and when she came mrs bethune was in conference she waited more than two hours she went into the room in tears but came out smiling she still had no money no job and was hungry but she knew mrs bethune would help her in a couple of days she was at work she kept in touch with mrs bethune and mrs bethune urged her not to give up her desire for higher education she worked went to school at night finally went into the womens army corps after discharge she completed her law course at howard and today is one of the most able lawyers in washington as the depression became worse president roosevelt created an organization to help young people it was called the national youth administration nya he asked mary to be on the board and assigned her to work among negro youth mary worked very hard but by the end of a year she felt that not enough had been accomplished as she sat down to discuss it with the president her feelings overcame her discretion and she shook her fist under his nose mr president she ordered as though she were talking to the youngest member of her faculty youve got to do better than that for my people she recoiled in horror what am i doing she gasped mr roosevelt only laughed he thought too highly of her to be offended in fact he once said to her you never ask anything for yourself always for others as her responsibilities in the nya increased so did her efforts at last she was so tired and so sick that she was hospitalized then came pearl harbor and world war ii mary sprang into action as though she singlehanded had to win it she was made assistant director of the womens army corps wac her work was naturally among the colored girls she fought for their privileges she wrote regularly to her girls overseas she comforted them she loved them as she was carrying on in texas word came to her of the death of president roosevelt she felt as though life had gone out of her too but she couldnt mourn very long within two weeks she was in san francisco witnessing the birth of the united nations soon after that she came back to the home she loved so dearly on the campus of her college she was over seventy years old she was tired and often sick when she walked among her students she leaned upon a goldheaded cane which had belonged to her friend president roosevelt it was a gift from his wife in when she was years old she was jubiliant over the supreme court decision on antisegregation old and tired though she was she led her students on the campus in grateful thanksgiving yes she was happy but she was also experienced and wise concerning the slowness of change she warned that changes could not bexpected overnight there was still much persuasive work to be done almost exactly a year after that happy day mary bethune died she is buried on her campus behind her little white home mrs denniston her devoted secretary has told the story of her final resting place in these words a former student of bethunecookman asked her for a loan of to complete his tuition i objectedlooking over the long list of borrowers who never paid back she thought about it for a couple of hours called me and asked how much money do we have in the bank do we have enough to send my boy i assured her we did the money was sent the boy completed his course paid back every cent one of the few who did and is now a successful mortician at her death he contributed a bronze metal vault for the preservation of her body another lesson for me in faith will parets ghost ruin griffiths career what does the future q nst q hold for emile grif vv fith can the brilliant young champion go on to take his place among the great welterweights of boxing or will the sickening memory of the night he sent benny kid paret to his grave haunt him for the rest of his career and detract from his remarkable skills gil clancy his manager and the man who is closer to him than anybody else admits even he doesnt know nobody can predict what effect a tragedy like that will have on a boxer clancy said we all know that he is one of the most talented men in boxing today and that he is a dedicated fighter who will always enter the ring in excellent physical condition but wondered clancy it is a question whether he will ever be able to function at per cent efficiency again we wont have the answer until we see him in the ring against strong competition griffith who savagely demolished paret at of the th round of their march title bout has overcome the first hurdle in his inner struggle to continue in his cruel trade when paret died emile thought seriously of quitting the ring clancy said he had a terrible guilt complex it was unreasonable inasmuch as everybody knew emile never intended to hurt paret seriously but it was there nevertheless he was very distraught and he even indicated to some newspapermen that he might quit in his moments of agonizing doubt griffith holed up in a new york state resort for two weeks of solitude and then returned to his native virgin islands to think it over finally he made up his mind two things did it for him clancy revealed he recognized his responsibility to his family and he responded to hundreds of letters of encouragement griffith is one of eight children his ring earnings have been supporting them and his mother he realized said clancy that he couldnt let them down as for the letters they came from priests rabbis ministers doctors lawyers and just plain fans and they all urged him to continue told him not to blame himself and reminded him to think first of his family most important to emile were the letters sent by the men of religion i think they were decisive in making up his mind clancy wants griffith to be a fighting champion but he has yet to decide on an immediate course of action there are two schools of thought some say when you fall off a horse get right back on another and others say go slow i dont know which is right for emile im going to watch him very closely for the next few months and then ill make up my mind clancy a lean sharpfeatured man who has treated griffith like his own son shook his head and said softly but the big question will come when emile climbs through the ropes again will he always see paret standing there and will the vision cause him to pull back on his punches will it rob him of his knockout instinct and paralyze his reflexes i dont know nobody in the world can answer that question except emile himself if its any consolation for griffith boxing history suggests that his career will not be ruined the rec ords show that most of the ring killers were able to shake off the effects of their horrible experience go back to dec the night jimmy barry knocked out walter croot in the th round of their bantamweight bout croot died shortly after the beating but barry was back fighting the following march he fought two more years before retiring as undefeated bantamweight champ of the world former heavyweight champion max baer survived the same ordeal max hammered frankie campbell into submission in five rounds on aug and campbell died a few days later max was back in the ring the following january and fought more times that year he went on to win the heavyweight title and didnt hang up his gloves until when the gigantic primo carnera knocked out ernie schaaf in madison square garden on feb there was serious doubt whether he was really responsible schaaf had been previously mauled by baer but it was the pound italian who had to live with the tragedy big primo however won the heavyweight crown in his very next bout by kayoing jack sharkey in six rounds and he continued fighting for four more years schaaf was carried out in the th round after a spiritless bout that had the fans yelling for action as a matter of fact when camera unleashed the left jab that put ernie away the spectators cried fake fake but for ernie it was the blow that capped the savage beatings he had received not only from baer but also from tubby tony galento and paolino uzcudum in the previous eight months jimmy doyle died in after absorbing a terrific beating from sugar ray robinson even then the question was raised whether robinsons career would suffer but sugar ray was back in the ring two months later he scored knockouts in his next five bouts and has fought no fewer than bouts since the tragedy doyle hit the canvas in the eighth round of his june boutbut he had been washed up long before he met the sugar percy bassett returned to the ring less than a month after his bout with sonny boy west ended in a tragedy and scored five kayoes in his next eight bouts sonny boy was certainly in no condition to fight after the three beatings he had received at the hands of ike williams ko sammy angott and george dunn georgie small snapped back after laveme roach died at his hands on feb he continued fighting although he never rose to championship class roach should never have been allowed in the ring after his murderous ko by rockfisted marcel cerdan and bennie gordon whose fists killed tommy pacheco in a preliminary bout on june continued to campaign until recently so for what its worth history says that griffith will shake off the effects of the tragedy and go on to a magnificent career that will place him alongside ring idols of the past nobody can bring back benny kid paret but nobody wants to see the life of emile griffith ruined too one tragedy is enough no nat hentoff definitions in jazz are chronically imprecise and perhaps the most fluid term of all has been the term jazz singer through the years vehement claims have been made for peggy lee chris connor frank sinatra rosemary clooney and even eileen farrell as candidates for membership in the club moreover judy garland considers herself fully capable of singing jazz and if asked sophie tucker would very likely respond that she is not only hot but swinging the case of ella fitzgerald is particularly enigmatic if her relationship to jazz singing can be clarified it may be possible to come closer to constructing a measuring rod for borderline cases like sinatra and peggy lee we may even begin to arrive at a definition of a jazz singer that will not crumble at its first collision with the next new set of qualifications as proclaimed in a record companys publicity release by my criteria ella fitzgerald is an aboveaverage pop vocalist but a minor jazz singer an explanation of my scale of values requires a check list of the essential qualities of jazz singing it is possible for many vocalists to have one or more of these in varying degrees on this basis of partial qualifications i would call frank sinatra and peggy lee for example jazzinfluenced but a complete fullstrength jazz singer like billie holiday louis armstrong or jack teagarden must have them all swinging and phrasing a flowing pulsation which can vary from the powerful and deeply personal thrust of louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie to the surfaceskimming of maynard ferguson and ahmad jamal is basic to any jazz performance ella swings smoothly and is an expert at play ing with rhythm while keeping the meter accurate but while her facility with the beat often approaches virtuosity she seldom applies it with any great relevance to particular songs as billie holiday did in this respect ella resembles a fleet instrumentalist whose timing never stumbles but who appears unconcerned with the meaning of a songs lyrics this tendency to ignore the original meaning of a song is understandable among jazz instrumentalists because they often use only the harmonic skeleton of a piece to create a new structure and mood of their own a singer however must deal with words and if the way she shapes her phrasing is at variance with the story she tells she has broken a key rule of jazz singing tell a story and tell it from the heart for example when ella sings love for sale she cannot be faulted musically but she communicates little of the aching weariness that is in the song similarly her phrasing of the more urbane cole porter and lorenz hart lyrics indicates an inadequate comprehension of the nuances involved ella in short always swings but she too frequently swings in an emotional and intellectual vacuum she neither remains faithful to the original nor creates a new story just as improvisation alone is not enough to characterize a performance as being jazz pointless swinging is not a certain guarantee of an illuminating jazz interpretation instrumental singing it has be come a commonplace to insist that a jazz singer should approximate the work of an instrumentalist in phrasing and even timbre this requirement is often oversimplified ella does indeed approach a song as if she were using her voice as a horn dom cerulli has accurately noted on up tunes particularly the scat songs she improvises in a steady flow much as a tenor would she jumps octaves and adds little breathy afterthoughts to phrases much as a tenor and she builds vocal riffs exactly the way a tenor would but a singer after all is not simply an instrument being able to imitate the habits of a tenor saxophone is not enough to ensure striking jazz vocalizing there are many timesespecially in wordless scat singingwhen she sounds like an extraordinarily fluent but dehumanized horn the human being with flesh and bones is absent technically these acrobatics are brilliantly sustained but they have less to do with selfexpression than with mechanics billie holiday never approached ellas instrumentlike facility but there was not the slightest doubt about the complex nature and uniqueness of a human personality when billie sang a similar contrast is that between the wry poignant individuality of everything pee wee russell plays and the more fluent but basically characterless clarinet of buddy defranco accordingly defranco is relatively a minor player while the durable russell has made and continues to make a singular and compelling contribution to jazz music timbre the timbre of ellas voice is naturally rather thin and lacking in intensity it is difficult for her to produce as wide and subtle a range of colors as sarah vaughan or anita oday still mildred bailey had an even smaller spectrum to work with yet through the intimacy of her phrasing and the quality of her improvisations she personalized everything she sang like the early blues shouters like the later more sophisticated jazz vocalists holiday lee wiley oday like carmen mcrae and ray charles today mildred bailey brought to her singing a strong sense of life of adult experience had her voice been richer she might have been even more effective but there was no question that mildred bailey communicated basic emotions hopes and frustrations by contrast ella too often sounds like a child and although much popular music is based on the fantasies of actual or arrested adolescents the essence of jazz has certainly never been for children what is jazz the veteran bassist milt hinton once asked rhetorically what makes a great jazzman is experience unless youve had experience and lived what could you have to say a person has to have lived to play great jazz charlie parker put it even more concisely if you dont live it it wont come out of your horn imagine if you will ella fitz gerald singing god bless the child or good morning heartache and then compare billie holidays approach to the same songs the difference is rather like that between paintings by norman rockwell and ben shahn at one end of the nonclassical vocal scale are the shallow mechanical teenage favoritespaul anka chubby checker ricky nelson at the other are ray charles carmen mcrae jack teagarden who are aware in chaucers words that the lyfe is short the craft so long to leme the assay so hard so sharp the conquering in between are accomplished stylists like frank sinatra and peggy lee who use jazz techniques for greater expressivity but who usually stop short of going down to the bedrock of their feelings it is to this camp that ella fitzgerald bem longs a major jazz singer must swing improvise imaginatively and phrase instrumentally but a major jazz singer must also make each song reflect what he has lived and experienced musicianship however skillful is not enough and ella technically brilliant as she is is not emotionally open enough in her singing to merit a place in the first rank of jazz singers after all these years do we know yet just who ella fitzgerald is and if she has indeed revealed all there is to tell there is not enough there for the best of jazz yes leonard feather very well ella fitzgerald is not really a jazz singer segovia is not really a guitarist carl sandburg is not really a poet barry goldwater is not really a republican let us first state our terms eligibility as a jazz singer involves four basic factors musical context musical content timbre and innate rhythmic feeling nurtured by jazz associationthe impact of context is often stronger on the listener than on the artist a singer who would otherwise be ignored or passed off as belonging to the world of pop music may be accepted in some jazz circles through chance association helen ward helen forrest dick haymes and many others who happened to sing with jazz orchestras during the swing era or through their love for jazz and bookings before jazz audiences billy eckstine nina simone on the other hand singers like roberta sherwood and kay starr because they move in the las vegasmiami copacabana orbit peopled by unhip bands and audiences are ignored by most jazz fans and critics although they qualify as jazz singers by every test except that of context ella of course moves with grace and consummate ease from jazz to nonjazz settings at home in a jazz concert with oscar peterson or against a plush background flanked by strings at the hollywood bowl jazz content too involves psychological overtones if the material dealt with has a builtin jazz identificationan ellington standard say or a bop instrumentalthe singer gains an advantage with the critic who subconsciously thinks in terms of jazz vs nonjazz but nowadays ella leans as heavily on broadway and hollywood as on basin street and birdland for her repertoire the matter of vocal timbre in the definition of jazz singing has generally been associated with the jagged throaty quality found in the singing of louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie billie holiday and anita oday but if the presence or absence of this quality were in itself defining louis prima and frances faye would deserve entry to the jazz elite ahead of the softervoiced ella most important of all is a natural rhythmic sense for a singer may have such an overwhelming feeling for the jazz beat that the other factors become unimportant ella a professional singer almost from childhood grew up completely in the jazz tradition singing from the age of sixteen with the unique chick webb band leading it herself for two years after his death and later touring for many years with norman granzs alljazz concert group under such conditions even kirsten flagstad would probably have wound up swinging that ella does not spill her guts before her audience and that she lacks a guttural tone no more militates against her competence as a jazz singer than her failure to acquire a police record psychiatrists couches and stateowned institutions are not mandatory training grounds for a jazz musician mildred bailey jimmy rushing jack teagarden and many others can be cited whose lives were never scarred by traumatic experiences such as billie holiday endured whatever bearing this lack may have on the character of their singing it has none on their emotional honesty and intensity or on their ability to communicate by means of a natural jazz beat seven tracks of ellas lullabies of birdland on decca and eleven tracks of ella sings the duke ellington song book on verve consist partly or wholly of scat or bop singingthat wordless brand of vocal adlibbing entirely indigenous to jazz because of her mastery of this art jazzmen have compared her with legendary instrumentalists as cannonball adderley observed no girl living can sound more like a jazz soloist than ella but even in the more conventional songs with lyrics ella uses every delicately oblique device of syncopation of shading and phrasing that marks the work of a nonpareil jazz singer there is no direct relationship between jazz singing and personal maturity or depth of emotional experience a performer who has lived in shallow spiritual waters may it is true become a shallow jazz singer but a jazz singer nonetheless another performer may endure psychic agonies and grow up to be a judy garland but this does not give the garlandtype singer a passport to birdland i have observed however in the course of listening to hundreds of singers during the past twentyfive years that it is possible for a nonjazz singer to become a jazz singer certainly peggy lees roots were not in jazz and her early records had very little to do with the idiom yet during the past decade she has matured in emotion delivery phrasing has constantly surrounded herself with a rhythm section of firstclass jazz musicians and today ranks as one of the finest living jazz singers as quincy jones lou levy and dozens of other jazzmen who have worked with her will testify but the reverse of this process never takes place it is impossible for a jazz singer ever to become a nonjazz singer the qualities that were ingrained in ella during the years with webb will remain with her always in these times of planned nonconformity i suppose i should be ashamed to admit that my view of ella is shared by the vast majority of her fellowartists in fact she is held in esteem to a degree without parallel in jazz history it would be tedious and of little purpose even to begin a list of the jazz musicians who respect ella as a jazz artist but in a poll i once took among a hundred jazz players and singers she received sixtysix votes as the greatest female jazz singer of all time followed by billie holiday with twentythree and sarah vaughan with twentyone votes incidentally a comparison between ella and billie holiday serves no more constructive purpose than asking a winetaster to compare champagne and vodka to my mind no greater jazz singer than billie holiday has ever lived there was in her work a bitter beauty that is not to be compared with anything contributed by any other jazz singer but ella fitzgerald is peerless in jazz on another level she has virtues that are not to be sought and certainly not to be found in billie or anyone else hers is a different vitality a different not a lesser range of emotions emotions that reach most listeners as completely as billies emotions reached hers to suggest that comparative measures must be used in evaluating the contribution of either artist is to suggest that only one means may be used to reach an artistically perfect end in conclusion it may be apt to summon as evidence one of the most illuminating attempts to separate the jazz from the nonjazz singers undertaken some years ago by a jazz expert who voted in the down beat international critics poll i dig sinatra but i dont consider him a jazz singer stated the critic and for this reason stood sinatra in the comer and refused to vote for him but the same critic in the same poll voted for ella fitzgerald and billie holiday as the worlds greatest female jazz singers in the light of the present discussion this has a special interest for the name of the voter in question was nat hentoff free transportation out of the south to ne r groes who are unhappy here recenty was fferej hy the white citizens councils of the southland negroes professing unhappiness were given a oneway ticket out five dollars expense money and the telephone numbers of their friends in the norththe naacp the urban league and the welfare department within two days after the project was underway the council reportedly had enriched chicago with unhappy negroes this reminded me of a question i sometimes am asked by whites is it true that negroes are happy the inquirer approaches usually with a face of friendly naive curiosity once however in a seminar on consumer behavior at the university of chicago a white fellow of wealthy texas parentage bitterly declared that although negroes are chronic bellyachers the fact is that they are happier by far than whites he was basing his conclusion he said on personal observations along sin strip the name white newsmen gave chicagos rd street between cottage grove and stony island avenues i asked him why since he thought negroes so much happier than himself he did not go down to live on sin strip give the negroes there his money to worry over and accordingly increase his own happiness that response was borrowed from an english professor i once had at oklahomas langston university an allnegro college in the allnegro town of langston the professor who was mayor of the town used to tell us of his escapades among whites in his travels and kid us that the declaration of independence had given us life liberty and the pursuit of happiness with no guarantee that we would ever catch up with it to what extent has the negro caught up with happiness a happy individual the dictionary tells us in part is one favored by hap chance luck or fortune fortunate prosperous such adjectives obviously refer to few negroes i know but the dictionary goes on to say that a person may be labeled happy if he is addicted to the exhibition of joy or gaiety is joyous it is this i think that leads to the controversy revolving around two main concerns in the first place there is lacking an official gauge of the negros relative bliss then comes the inconsistency of the negros outcast state and his jocular public demeanor i have looked for the answers in the stockpile of facts and figures on the negros struggle taking pains at the same time to scrutinize typical specimen chancing to come before me for a firsthand picture or mosaic of the negros inner mood for one important indication i compared the incidence of misery among whites and negroes although much of that contrast is now wellknown i was struck by several interesting contradictions one is the negros disdain for ending his own life during the depression when whites departed this earth in voluntary droves negroes in birmingham alabama for example were less than onetenth as likely to take their own lives in fort worth texas only ten negroes in twenty years to compared to whites chose to end it all recently two sociologists out at the university of washington combed through suicide statistics for the years to and found negroes less than half as prone to suicide in seattle as the negros situation becomes more equal his suicide score along with other social characteristics becomes more similar to those of whites do not conclude however that the negros past and present distaste for voluntary death is proof that he is less fed up with life the seattle study also found that he is more likely on the other hand to attempt suicide without completing it some people sayerroneously i believethat negroes today are very much like those depicted on the plantation in the movie wild river when things go wrong they simply shrug and say let the white folks worry about it anyway contrary to popular fallacy it is not true that whenever a negro starts to worry instead of worrying himself to death he simply falls asleep mental derangement for example which may accompany emotional distress is higher among negroes than whites available figures for revealed that negro admissions to insane asylums in northern states containing large numbers of negroesnew york illinois chicago and californiamore than doubled admissions for whites bear in mind however that most of the insane were migrants from the south more than two million colored refugees between and alone having left the south forever they sought a rainbows end in the north often to their tragic disappointment many never made the adjustment or quite got over the disillusionment however the higher rate of psychosis among negroes is partly due to the lower prevalence of persons of the middle class and above among them sociologist august hollingshead has found that the higher the social class the fewer the psychotics but the more the neurotics persons financially well off can better afford psychiatric help for mending psychotic dispositions they also are more able and prone to shield psychotic relatives from public commitment and common knowledge more the feelings of personal inadequacy infused in the negro individual from the age of four or five onward psychologists say may be too much for some of them to bear negro parents have yet to solve the problem of what and how to tell their tots about racial matters in order to make their egos shockproof enough for the brutal deprivations and humiliating insults to human dignity they will suffer in later life many parents in the middle class go to extreme ends to guard their children from unfortunate racial experiences slum children on the other hand are more impelled to fall back on the juvenile gang for security and acceptance writing in his book slums and suburbs james b conant formerly president of harvard university reported recently that per cent of the young negroes from to years old in a typical slum are both out of school and out of work out of work because of slim chances for employment out of school in large part due to a sense of defeatism or a lack of incentive developed by dim prospects for them in the job market yet many such youths have internalized the american cultural goal of success and plenty while thwarted in their own access to legitimate means of achieving the goal sociologists among them robert k merton of columbia university know this has the capacity for making a man a criminal denied the routine legitimate means to success many individuals cannot resist the temptation to substitute whatever means are available some take out their frustrations on one another by way of switchblade brawls amid the dilapidated squalor of their neglected environment most continue to suffer in adult life from extreme and unfair policies of occupational discrimination quite often this leads to desertion by fathers and to general family disorganization not surprisingly many are driven to drink as a means of dousing their troubles the average negro family vance packard points out in the status seekers spends twice as much for liquor as the average white family does although this is no indication that whites have an aversion for such beverages negroes farthest down of all turn typically to religious enthusiasm in search of a way out wandering from one cult to the next hoping for a brighter day by and by in deserting conventional religions they are rejecting those they have found unrewarding and the god and his followers they feel have rejected them black muslims for instance counter their sense of rejection and abuse by whites with a passionate rejection of whites they say this is sufficient to cure colored alcoholics en masse because it gives them a sense of selfrespect many middleclass negroes on the other hand who according to the muslims are growing fat satisfied and greasy develop an insouciant frame of mind as a mechanism of ego defense i just dont let it bother me they frequently declare and you see in their faces that they are hoping to convince themselves as well as the listener others spurred by a history and personal background of hard labor and the increasing preeminence of the knob and the handle in american culture confuse mere idleness particularly freedom from productive activities with general wellbeing then finding that ease alone does not bring happiness they are led quite like the lower class to compensate through chronic dissipation they hang after ecstasy in pursuit of the happiness that eludes them i found that much of the negros glee is a function of his low general circumstances in most cases his predominantly lower class origins in others persons of middle class and beyond in their groping for social approval typically place proper deportment above the expression of their own inner tastes and emotions lowerclass codes of conduct regardless of race are much less governed by the rigors of social constraint puerto ricans in the slums of new york and chicago for example also are given to a jocular disposition although i have heard it said that this represents the nigger in them i believe their behavior is due to class and culture like negroes they possess the chance to pursue happiness but hampered in the acquirement of it they overindulge in the pursuit too often the mechanisms of pursuit become ends in themselves masks of glee are publicly worn but often as camouflages for private sorrows and frustrations some scholars go back to the slavemaster relationship for an explanation of this tracing the anachronistic grin many negroes exhibit from the yassuhboss front they were forced to present to whites down through the dictates of racial etiquette under the souths system of intimidation subsequent to civil war reconstruction others like john dollard a sociologist at yale university and coauthor with allison davis of children of bondage give a freudian explanation dollard recently conducted research on the preoccupation of many negroes with playing the dozens and came up with the conclusion that they do so and also kid one another a good deal as a socially approved means of releasing racial frustration this suggests that the gleeful negro is not twofaced after all but is acting unconsciously often without knowing why he does so himself freud had explained in his jokes and the unconscious that funmaking is derived from human social relations and a joke will allow us to exploit something ridiculous in our enemy which we could not on account of the obstacles in the way bring forward openly or consciously perhaps many negroes themselves are way ahead of freud when they realize as the song goes that they are laughing to keep from crying i have concluded that the negro is not so happy as he is joyous joyous says the dictionary refers to the emotion excited by the acquisition or expectation of good although the negros joy is far more in the expectation than the acquisition and he has been expecting a fair chance merely to pursue happiness for quite some time he now can see more clearly the impending demise of jim crow barriers the more his access to true happiness the less he will need to drug himself with compensatory ecstasy for six years i worked f as reporter for a chijj cago newspaper that thrived on stories about sex crime and racial discrimination during those years i witnessed a great many murders accompanied police on bookie joint raids rode a taxi into the midst of a race riot at trumbull park and watched a young man who shot to death a theater cashier during a robbery die in the electric chair among the people i find difficult to forget if i could forget any of them at all are the countless narcotics addicts i have seen and still see today in increasing numbers they are without exaggeration among the most miserable people i have known and the pity of it is that too few people care about them at all i say too few people care about narcotics addicts because i have continuously noticed how the average citizen relentlessly criticizes him for being addicted while doing nothingor very littleto relieve him of his plight people are more apt to want to institutionalize him for life separating him from the rest of society than they are to see the necessity of rehabilitating him in hopes that he will become a useful and productive member of society i believe however that while the bulk of the blame for the degrading and primitive status of the narcotics problem in america can certainly be laid to the lack of adequate state and municipal facilities for handling addicts and enforcing laws against peddling the stuff the christian church must share the blame for turning its back on these socalled social outcasts there are a few individual churches that are attempting to help but in the main the church as a whole is not doing all it can to give addicts the fellowship spiritual guidance and understanding they so desperately need narcotics addiction is a lingering living death that is sold on the streets of hundreds of american cities towns and villages its victims teenagers and adults men and women people of all races and religions who live in unbelievable torment and anguish no one knows for sure how many addicts are in the united states estimates of known addicts have ranged from a low of to a high of conservative estimates place the number around to with about being youths under almost half of this countrys addicts can be found in new york illinois ranks second with to percent practically all of them in chicago california is third with about to percent and michigan fourth with six to eight per cent the problem is big there is the need for a larger budget so that the u s bureau of narcotics can strengthen its undermanned staff of agents who are fighting a losing battle in trying to keep narcotics from being smuggled into the country there also is the need for stronger laws and better enforcement of laws that already exist to rid society of suppliers and peddlers of narcotics a bigger problem some think however is what to do with the scores of thousands of unfortunates who are now addicted can society afford to continue to treat them as criminals rather than as medical cases can state and city governments continue in their reluctance to formulate and put into operation adequate medical and clinical programs that could possibly lead to the cure and rehabilitation of addicts can churches continue to refuse to recognize responsibility admittedly what is being done is not enough this is pointed out periodically by large metropolitan newspapers that find sensational articles about narcotics good circulation builders they usually highlight what cities and states are failing to do how law enforcement is not what is should be and how peddlers are treated better than addicts when they are hauled into court but one area which is often overlooked or completely ignored is the responsibility of the church in regard to the total treatment and rehabilitation of the addict it is time the church took a hard look at the problem and translated its pronouncements against narcotics into concrete programs that will benefit those who need help the mostthe addicts like the mentally ill the tubercular the blindthey too are people of special need no longer a problem exclusive to big cities narcotics addiction is now spreading to smaller cities and towns that for years were relatively free of the dope traffic while new york los angeles and chicago still have the bulk of all u s addicts narcotics addiction has been found to flourish wherever there exists wide slum areas and large segments of frustrated minorities at least per cent of the addicts use heroin a yellowishwhite powder of overwhelming addicting qualities powerful potency and strong euphoric effects other drugs used but in lesser demand are morphine a painkiller with great danger of addiction cocaine a stimulant that is most dangerous when the user has a maladjusted personality and marijuana a cheap narcotic that often leads to insanity after prolonged use always in great demand by addicts heroin a derivative of opium is the backbone of a vicious and illegal racket controlled by the underworld despite tight federal and strong international control it i manages to smuggle enough drugs into the country to realize a million annual profit by supplying organized mobsters of big east coast midwest and west coast cities most heroin smuggled into the u s comes from italy other major illicit sources include communist china frequently accused of flooding western countries with drugs to create moral and physical weaknesses as a prelude to war burma malaya india japan turkey thailand iran syria and lebanon since world war i when there was one addict for every persons in america the narcotics problem has continually sparked an increasingly bitter controversy particularly over how best to treat addicts hospitals refused them treatment states and cities declined to pay for rehabilitation centers and often threatened to close the few clinics that existed with state and city governments failing to measure up to the immense and growing task of coping with dope addiction the federal government in was forced to open a public health service hospital at lexington kentucky the first of its kind in the world for treating and although to a very limited degree rehabilitating drug victims in a smaller hospital was opened at fort worth texas none have been opened since for the most part circumstances for addicts have not improved much in the last fifteen years hospitals still refuse them treatment and cities and states still refuse to establish rehabilitation centers many of the clinics that were open have been shut down even in new york where there are some known addicts and possibly thousands of others who go undetected fewer than beds have been made available to addicts wanting to withdraw from drugs however since the state has established addict treatment facilities at three hospitals and as recently as march governor nelson a rockefeller signed a bill providing for treatment of addicts as medical cases rather than criminals the law finally establishes a new central narcotics office in the state mental hygiene department to direct expanding programs in narcotics research treatment and aftercare addiction is a vastly complicated physiological and psychological problem it is complicated by the publics general assumption that addiction is criminal in reality many addicts are much more sick than criminal there is a need many experts feel to ferret out and objectively classify addicts in order to discover whether all addicts are really alike whether all are criminal instead of sticking to the point of view that they are alike because they are essentially bad or because they offend society historically the same was at one time felt about the leper they were either bad or just dirty or the same was felt concerning venereal diseases and alcoholics these narrow points of view have been mastered now with a more enlightened attitude toward these diseases they have responded favorably to treatment addiction can be found in all classes the wealthy upper class the conservative middle class and the lower classes all have their share of addicts the masses however are found in the subculture of the lower classes and in congested slum areas where large numbers of minority groups as negroes and puerto ricans are clustered together and frustrated by the innumerable discriminatory social and economic problems that are heaped upon them one of the nations few narcotics clinics is located in new yorks east harlem protestant parish directed by the rev norman c eddy a congregationalist who has dedicated himself for almost twenty years to an unyielding battle against narcotics the clinic is a rare place where the church is fighting on the firing line it concentrates part of its limited facilities and budget to which four protestant churches contribute a meager amount on helping adult addicts withdraw but out of the scores who come to the clinic for help it can only help a handful mostly neighborhood residents when men and women come in off the street and say they want to end the narcotics habit declares reverend eddy we have to tell them there is no place for them to go right now for treatment we are in a sense saying go out and steal or commit prostitution so you can get the drugs you need this is a vicious position for us to be in the parish was established in to alleviate suffering among the addicted and their families its budget is about a year and because it cannot always prick the conscience of society enough to raise the money needed to continue operating the parish faces a crisis that pushes it near its final days two other churchsponsored programs in new york face the same possibility judson memorial church which set up a narcotics center and proposed treatment plan in in almost two years its active case load is about addicts about addict patients have come in contact with the center and approximately psychotherapy interviews have been carried out with patients the center averages to patient contacts per week the other is the quaker committee on social rehabilitation inc affiliated with the religious society of friends it concentrates mostly on women addicts since the start of their program in women have been interviewed have been helped and referred for jobs during the early s the rev robert t jenks then pastor of st marks episcopal church on chicagos south side established a narcotics anonymous group on the belief that drug addicts could be rehabilitated for two years his small interracial parish with limited facilities was relatively successful in treating addicts with the help of new tranquilizing drugs testifying before the illinois state legislatures narcotics investigation commission in the rev james w mack then the assistant pastor said the parish started its work as a community problem finding the heaviest illegal drug traffic existed in its own neighborhood it used pastoral counseling tranquilizing drugs group therapy and job placement tranquilizing drugs were administered only by physicians after clinical experiments in the police lockup demonstrated that tranquilizers were ninety per cent effective in eliminating the vicious withdrawal symptoms that afflict addicts when deprived of narcotics reverend mack cited cases of twentyone addicts helped at their mission clinic their average age he said was and they had been addicted an average of four years after four days of taking a tranquilizer and nonbarbiturate sleeping pills reported back completely withdrawn jobs were found for them and after a twomonth period ten of them were still known to be clean father jenks was in constant contact with some junkies to whom religious counsel was given nevertheless the program soon failed for lack of funds and community interest there are innumerable aids the christian church can give in help ing to eliminate the narcotics traffic and to cure and rehabilitate those addicted to drugs for one there is a need for closer cooperation and more clearly defined relationships between the probation department the narcotics court and medical counseling clinics which need to be established in greater number churchrelated hospitals which do not now admit addicts can support the establishment of these clinics and even make available a limited number of beds for the treatment of addicts hospitals should have shortterm detoxification facilities to treat addicts wanting immediate withdrawal and then refer them to neighborhood clinics which the church should be operating for their rehabilitation and aftercare there is a need to stress community education most addicts are dependent not grown up the public should learn that the addict feels inferior allies himself with a gang to bolster his masculine feelings but ambivalently takes the drug to satisfy his passive dependent cravings churches can help the withdrawn addict get involved in a nondrug centered society this is one of the addicts greatest stumbling blocks to rehabilitation once he has been institutionalized treated and released he will need a new environment a new set of values he will need additional therapy and rehabilitation perhaps a trade and employment any addict can be taken off drugs once he is institutionalized but once he is released he is strictly on his own and the tide of frustrations and narrowminded social attitudes that engulfed him and drove him to narcotics in the first place will be waiting for him on his doorstep the church can offer narcotics addicts consolation and understanding and encouragement the church can get them involved in churchcentered activities and afford them opportunities to meet other youth who can help them abstain from further use of narcotics few addicts are religious most of them have been reared in families where religion was not a part of family life and have rebelled against the church this is very well pointed out by new york judge john m murtagh and sociologist sara lou harris in their book on narcotics who live in shadow mcgrawhill the church has a superb opportunity to reach addicts but it has thus far failed to do so the church should accept them not shun them as so many other agencies do it can work with parents to make them know that addiction is a disease and not a crime and it can see to it that its young peoples groups offer addicts who are attempting to kick their habits encouragement and normal social associations most addicts cannot ordinarily be reached through religion in their early contacts with the church they claim to be atheists or agnostics and only come to church in the first place because clergymen and counselors reveal warmth toward them and yet despite addicts general lack of religion some members of the clergy report great satisfaction in their contacts with them the hands that are held out to addicts are so few that they become dependent on any that are thus some addicts who begin coming to church out of no more than their need for comradeship may eventually acquire faith and belief society is irritated by the problem of addiction and is anxious for a solution with cooperative efforts of the church federal state city authorities and private agencies effective plans can be put into operation almost immediately if there is a slowness to act on the part of others however it is the responsibility of the church to supply the impetus for actionas it does in so many other areas of life he heat was oppresy sive it quivered from ii the corrugated iron y roofs of the houses t he middle distance was distorted by the waves as they silently rose toward the brassy sky dust devils swirled aimlessly by picking at loose debris as they passed the cloudless sky seemed to press downward compressing the heat into a vast weight until all movement became an effort nothing stirred even the cicadas were silent seemingly beaten into subjection by the glare of the african sun to the man sitting on the verandah of the hotel the scene was not new even though he had not been in the town before it was no different from a hundred others a few stores a post office government liquor store garage and ubiquitous barclays bank all these were spread along the main street which led north and south only hunters and africans went east or west there was nothing out there except bush and beyond that more bush nobody wanted to go into the bush this weather or did they sweat coursed down the chest of the man as he lounged in his chair his shirt was dark beneath the arms from perspiration his thinning hair wet as the beads of moisture evaporated he grunted and moved into a more comfortable position boy he called an african dressed in white with red sash worn around the body bandolier fashion moved from the doorway in which he had been lounging he had in his hand a small looseleaf book and a stub of pencil which he held out to the man who took it and wrote slowly hurry back eh he said handing the book and pencil together with a silver coin to the other the african waiter left his bare feet making no sound as he crossed the floor away to the north a vague figure appeared in the heat the waves of hot air undulating glassily elongated and then foreshortened whatever it was as it moved toward the town it could have been a bus a car a man on a bicycle or just a man walking at that distance and in the heat it was impossible to tell the man in the chair mopped his brow and peered up the road with narrowed eyes leaning forward to make out the image of the approaching newcomer unaware of the waiter standing at his elbow with bottle and glass on a tray blast the heat he muttered as he relaxed turning back to the table and the waiting african the figure approaching the town proved to be a lone man tall wellbuilt his legs bare to the middle of his thighs which were encased in a pair of faded and dirty khaki shorts his tom shirt matched the color of his pants as he walked his hands held a small marimba which he thumbed rhythmically and with some vigor the dust from the road adhered to his black skin and kinky hair he seemed unperturbed by the heat and quickened his stride as he reached the edge of the town presently he neared the hotel stuffing the marimba into a tom pocket he blew his nose between his fingers and beat some of the dust from his clothes mumba you skellum the man on the verandah came to life he rose from his chair and quickly walked down to the road mornin bwana it was always morning to the african even in the middle of the night the greeting was always the same so you finally got here eh take this and get something to eat and rest up for a while then well be off the man handed mumba some money rascal or rogue a term of endearment be back here at four oclock the man turned and climbed the steps back into the hotel where heaving a sigh he sank into his chair again as he sat drinking his beer the man reviewed the events of the past few days last wednesday a runner had come with news of a leopard near kafulata mumba had sent for him to come it was eighty miles from his farm but mumba knew he would not want to miss the kill he and mumba had more or less grown up together mumbas father had been boss boy on the farm many years ago no other white boys being within miles of the farm the two had been thrown together and in their own way had formed a rare attachment for each other the white man would never have admitted to being a friend of the other but there could be no doubt of the affinity it was nicholas the newspaper man who wanted most to be in on this thing he did not believe the african had the courage nor the mind capable of devising any scheme to kill other than by the conventional trap or shooting method well he would see this animal was old or lame or it would not be so bold several goats and a dog had been taken right out of the village and numerous attempts to catch the leopard had failed hence the call of the white man he knew mumba wanted to play to the gallery so here was a chance to put nicholas in his place the man rose to his feet and entered the main part of the hotel he walked down a wide corridor and opened the door of a room wherein a man lay sleeping on a bed sweat rolled off his bare torso as his chest heaved his hair matted with dampness nicholas the man shook the sleeping figure nicholas wake up mumbas here were off at four nicholas grunted yawned and stretched opening his eyes he asked what time is it just after two time to get a bath ill be back in about half an hour must get the jeep filled up some thirty minutes later the man returned with the jeep two water bags hung on either side of the front seat a rifle pointed skywards its blueblack barrel glistening in the sun a canvas covered box was propped in one comer of the back seat and a red jerry can lay on the floor all right mumba well be off in a few minutes the man addressed the waiting african time meant little to anyone in this town even less to mumba he settled down to wait in the shade and soon slept it was well past four oclock when the two white men appeared each carrying a roll of blankets and a waterproof groundsheet both wore toupees on the back of their heads and nicholas carried a khaki bush jacket the three climbed into the jeep mumba in the back the other two in front the engine rumbled into life and they moved out of the town leaving a cloud of dust hovering in the still hot air the road unpaved and corrugated made travelling uncomfortable the vehicle was not built for comfort and was inclined to dance a little on the uneven surface but nevertheless a steady fifty miles an hour soon brought them to a fairly wide bush path into which they turned their progress was slowed now owing to the narrowness of the track which twisted and turned among the trees it was cooler here in the shade but the oppressive air was in no way diminished and all three were eager to reach their journeys end after travelling some twelve miles along this twisting track they crossed a dambo topped a small steep rise in the ground and there on the edge of the bush was the village a cluster of huts low entrances set in low mud walls topped by grass thatched roofs cooking fires smoked as the women tended their pots children played their games as do children all over the world men smoked and drank beer brewed by the women it was a scene typical of africa the queer pungent smell that is prevalent throughout the country was very evident multicolored dogs of varying degrees of thinness greeted the newcomers with yelps a dry river bed and barks scrawny fowls fluttered this way and that scurrying to get out of the way of the dogs the children stopped their play to gaze at the men fingers in mouths little potbellies bulging over their ragged short pants the jeep pulled over to a vacant hut and the men alighted each stretched the kinks out of his legs and then began to unload the bedding from the rear seat a large tree with wide spreading branches stood some thirty yards from the cluster of huts the earth beneath it was loose and sandy churned up by hundreds of playing feet around the trunk fibre baskets of leaves were stacked it was to these leaves that mumba turned his attention after seeing the others were settled in their quarters calling several loungers over to him mumba proceeded to scatter the leaves quickly under the tree until an area of some fifty square feet was covered next he and two others walked over to one of the huts and presently returned with a large piece of dripping meat tied within a fibre net tossing a rope over a sturdy lowhanging branch of the tree the men fastened one end to the net and hauled the meat into the air until it was suspended some fifteen feet above the ground there it was secured by tying the other end of the rope to the tree trunk after some deliberation the men next returned to the hut and brought out calabashes full of honey golden brown liquid which they proceeded to pour out over the leaves starting in the centre each walked backwards pouring as he went presently it was done to their satisfaction and returning the calabashes to the hut the men went back to their various homes where their daily meal was awaiting them the two white men prepared their own meal and as they ate the sun began to sink they watched the sun drop down like a ball of flaming brass orange and reds merging with yellows and gold steel grey deepening pale blue turning to purple and then to black darkness fell soon after sunset and fires flickered near the homes the men saw an occasional firefly flash his light and huge moths dance around the fires before plunging to their death in the flames tonight the fires were allowed to die early the moon rose like a huge lantern swinging in the sky spreading its pale light across the clearing casting sharply etched shadows from the trees there was an air of expectancy about the village as the people waited mumba sat with the two white men a shorthandled stabbing spear across his knees no one spoke the voices of insects and small creatures broke the stillness of the air an occasional night bird wheeled past on muted wings searching for food a faint cough in the distance sent a thrill down the spines of all who heard it and knew it for what it was a leopard somewhere out there in the shadows the spotted cat was on the move perhaps he would come into the village again in his search for easy pickings dogs goats or even a chicken were his prey now the eyes of all were on the tree in the clearing children kept close to their mothers sides fathers gripped their spears waiting alert to every sound and movement it seemed hours before any other sound of the leopard was heard perhaps it had gone the other way hoping to find food near the waterhole beyond the dambo everyone waited hoping it would come each one dreading its appearance and yet knowing that unless it came tonight the hopes of destroying it would perhaps be lost forever and all the preparation be of no avail a brief moving shadow flickered maybe it was a passing breeze brushing the leaves of the bushes perhaps it was the imaginings of a taut mind there it was again nearer this time suddenly the leopard was in full view its body slung low to the earth tail waving slightly as it gazed toward the silent huts its head lifted as it scented the air the stench of the dripping meat touched its nostrils slowly the cat advanced until it reached the area where the drip had wet the leaves cautiously the beast examined the wetness suddenly its whole being sprang into violent eruption like the abrupt loosing of a tightly coiled spring it leaped snarling into the air teeth grinning upward eyes flashing claws unsheathed ready to rend anything within reach for almost thirty seconds this poise was held nothing moved gradually the tension died and the cat looked upwards seeing the meat hanging there it began to pace the area slowly padding in a circle its face turned up for several minutes this continued until it became aware of the leaves adhering to its paws lifting first one and then the other the leopard tried to bite off the leaves but only succeeded in sticking them to its face the more it tried the worse the situation became the cat became infuriated at its failure to remove the torment gradually its eyes became fully covered and in desperation it rolled over on its back mumba rose to his feet gripping his spear the white man picked up his rifle and released the safety catch pulling the bolt back he gently eased a round into the breech raising his hand he gripped mumbas arm in a brief clasp each knew the others thoughts there was no need for words the black man stepped out into the open and approached the maddened beast somehow the animal semed to sense the approach of the man despite its blinded condition it turned to face the newcomer ready to give battle mumba picked up a stick of wood as he walked deliberately toward the great cat when he was within three yards of the waiting beast he threw the wood to the right front whereupon hearing it strike the ground the leopard leaped toward it as it left the ground mumba struck with his spear his whole weight behind the blow it took the cat through the ribs piercing the heart the beast fell without a sound its leafmatted body still mumba stood his hand on the knife at his belt waiting for what might come next the villagers rushed out crying joyfully stopping short of the fallen beast half afraid it might suddenly spring to life again the white men each of whom had sat with bated breath through it all expelled the air from tortured lungs white tensed muscles eased from the rifle sweat ran unheeded from the faces of both satisfied now nicholas nodded my god the nerve of the man ill never doubt them again they walked over to where the leopard lay picking up one foreleg mumba pointed to the joint of the leg and chest two black dots were clearly visible porcupine he said thats why he was hanging around couldnt get around so good the white man replied must have jumped a porcupine and got shot full of quills lame wonder he didnt get them in his heart nasty things those spikes work their way in and never come out he looked at mumba pushed his clenched fist gently against mumbas bare chest and turned away there was no need for anything to be said mumba knew his friend was proud of him watching him return to the darkness of the hut he breathed deeply then speaking rapidly in order to hide his emotion mumba ordered the men to pick up the carcass and move it out of reach of the ants which were already thick among the leaves attracted by the honey fires were soon blazing merrily once more native beer was brought forth a drum began to beat rhythmically feet began to tap and the village came to life mumbas praises were sung songs of his prowess would be sung for many days the story of the slaying of the leopard would be told to all who would care to hear the deed becoming more hazardous with every tellling the celebration carried on until the small hours of the morning and it was two weary white men who rose at daylight to prepare for their homeward journey mumba was on hand to help them load their belongings and after a leisurely breakfast they left the sun was hot already as they entered the shade of the trees the heat was dancing from the road and shimmering above the rooftops when they reached the town nothing moved it was just another african day in a typical african town what caused that cat to jump after it smelled the meat asked nicholas oh that well it was standing directly underneath the meat and a drip must have landed on it from above i never thought of that nich olas said but it did seem strange at the time i suppose you must be off thanks for everything you were right it certainly opened my eyes oh thats alright remember that the african is just as coura geous and just as resourceful in his own environment as the white man is in his the man walked out into the heat and climbed into the jeep the dust trailed behind as the dancing air distorted and swallowed up the retreating vehicle soon there was nothing left but silence nicholas looked out to the east where the trees stretched endlessly it seemed he was beginning to understand the respect the other man had for the african maybe their sense of values was different from his but one thing was sure the baubles the white man held so precious could avail him nothing in the life and death struggle which continually raged around out there in the shimmering heat money could not buy courage nor diamonds the faith in ones ability to meet death on its own terms and come out victorious this was a mans country where weaklings could not survive from somewhere behind him he heard a white mans voice calling boy he smiled crookedly white warrior five years ago f g when arthur spingarn t fresh from the arms of sptkix a sociay prominent and wealthy family was doing his fathers bidding by practicing law he was asked to try a civil_rights case the details of the case have long since escaped his memory but the effect of it has not to spingarn it was a simple matter of indecency and injustice which he says hes never forgotten today he says the fact that hours after our naacp branch in a tennessee town printed the names of their local members the members were fired from their jobs couldnt get credit and couldnt even buy food so that we are now sending milk to their babiesthats something that even with years experience you dont get used to spingarn is a little rolypoly white man of who for the past years has been president of the national association for the advancement of colored people having served it earlier for years as vice president and chairman of the national legal committee he can recall the times when newspapers described the early interracial meetings as sex orgies when he and his negro friends toured city saloons breaking every glass of beer they were served if charged a dollar a beeronce a bartenders habit to discourage negro patronage he also recalls the many times clients left him because they thought he was a nut not all is well now but some things have changed through the years if saloons charge a dollar for a beer it is now levied against white as well as negro as for spingarns clients they seldom leave these days regarding him as more of a celebrity than a nut they talk about the new negro says spingarn but theres no new negro the difference is that now a negro has the courage to tell the truth to a white man fifty years ago negroes wanted their rights as a woman wants a mink coat now theyre ready to die for them today a leader has to be militant and willing to suffer or hes out spingarn has been in this movement for a long time and if when he talks about the young leaders he does so with a hint that they are whippersnappers who somehow got around their elders it is not the most heinous of sins officially and personally his commitment is to them including the rev martin_luther_king and the freedom riders but he wants it understood that these are people who though they travel the south in groups under the auspices of core are members of the naacp and whose energy and purpose were inculcated in them by the naacp for spingarn the dynasty is due some respect a lot of these people like the sitins think they lit the torch he says at the last naacp convention some young kids reminded me that i had led a picket line in st paul last year why i was leading picket lines in in memphis against the assn of social workers none of this is new to me or the naacp we lit the torch and theyre carrying it now we may not be running the freedom riders but weve been trying their cases all along for once they land in jail they turn to us continues spingarn torn as he is between pride and irritation frankly i dont think anything is served by their staying in jail the way to stop segregation is through court action the protest in montgomery over bus segregation wasnt won by the marchers but by a supreme court decision it was magnificent for those people to suffer for their rights but they finally got their rights by court decision the south is playing a waiting game the southern lawyers tell us frankly that their segregation laws are unconstitutional but they know it will take four years before they get to the supreme court and are set aside the young people just dont want to wait i wish they were better organized but i cant blame them after all weve been waiting for almost one hundred years for what were legally entitled to before joining the naacp spingarns late brother col joel spingarn was one of the original signers of the lincoln day call from which the organization grew spingarn a native new yorker studied law at columbia university he was graduated in with an lld and began an extensive collection of negro literature which he presented to howard university in not long after joining the naacp he tried his first case before the supreme courta white primary caseand won establishing the right of negroes to vote in primaries in texas the legal aspect has always been fun he says here you are a snip of a person you try a case and all of a sudden you make history spingarn made history times from to with supreme court civil right victories there is one place he doesnt like and one place he doesnt go the south twentyfive years ago spingarn and his wife who died three years ago spent some time in the south he has rarely been back since the prejudice northem ir ers feel toward south erners is roughly parallel to that felt by english people toward americans and is compounded of many of the same ingredientsa thoroughgoing dislike of their public policies contempt for their level of education and culture and a sort of instinctive recoil at the sound of the accentlarded in both cases it must be said with a thick layer of that particular form of snobbishness that sneers at the provincial it is distasteful to the northerner that a human being should have the name of lady bird it grates on the northern ear to hear an educated person say sumpn and prolly or speak of a mess of fried chicken pronounced maiss of frad chickn the photographs that appear so regularly in the newspapers of white faces caught in the act of hate outside some school or drugstore fill the northerner with uneasiness and almost incredulity for when the northerner segregates and discriminates he does it on the whole slyly rather than overtly and without passion thus the white south comes to be pictured in the northern mind as an undifferentiated arid wasteland of the human intellect and spirit incongruously smeared over with a sticky coating of sugary politeness and sentimentality all the same there are hints that changes may be on the way a high school students appeal for reason in little rock a white minister leading his child past hostile mobs to school in new orleans white college kids extending the hand of friendship to three negro classmates at georgia tech my point in going to the south was as a certain kind of tourist will often put it to see how the people really live to slide into the daily lives of people to soak up their ordinary conversation to savor their manner and manners to achieve an oblique rather than a direct look was my plan slightly easier said than done i found people are always shoving you off to talk to community leaders or to meetings where the problem is under discussion trip notes on the train through kentucky theres already a marked change of atmosphere the women on the train seem to travel in sears catalogue dreamy date dresses one is wearing a beige silk sheath spangled semitransparent top highheeled simulatedglass slippers shes a great

there a negro newspaper editor told me in these border communities its not popular to believe in segregation most whites will tell you they have colored friends even though they generally mean their maids but although theres abstract agreement about the inevitability of desegregation theres no agreement about implementation the when and how the editor asked me if id like to meet some women who were going to do the testing he explained in the wake of a successful sitin movement by students the year before some two hundred eating places had agreed to desegregate and now their good faith was being tested the testers a group of welldressed negro women gathered at the negro ywca for instructions and assignments there were the usual asides so familiar to anyone who has worked in pta girl scouts the usual civic organizations cant work beyond two oclock my jimmy gets back from school then sorry i couldnt come tuesday miz brown but my kids all came down with the flu efficientlooking mimeographed forms were handed out with spaces for place tested time tested environment check one low medium high attitude of waitress or manager check one poor fair good the trouble is you have to drink so much coffee before the days over confided one woman a complaint i had further occasion to hear during my travels for another view of louisville i accepted an invitation to dinner at the country club this was for me a little like being shown around a steel factory behind the iron curtain never having seen the inside of one at home i had no basis for comparison nevertheless a certain amount of southern life revolves around these country clubs and i thought it would be a good thing to have a look we were a party of five two couples and myself rather to my surprise conversation centered for a time on the servant problem i have of course heard and read of such discussions but had never before been actually present at one the subject was first broached by one of the guests a middleaged man whom i shall call mr mitchell he related the sad story of his experience with life magazine which had run a series of articles on domestic servants a life editor had called mr mitchell about his old uncle mo who has been with the mitchell family for thirtyfive years then just when mr mitchell figured the story was all set life dropped him and uncle mo and picked a servant who had been with his white folks a year longer with life many are called but few are chosen i murmured but the other couple now chimed in along these lines why wilfred youall certainly have it easy why our chorine shes simple terrible i mean shes just awful simply ruined the best silver by pouring bleach all over it weve rechristened her chlorine just as i was being overcome with prickly embarrassment mrs mitchell came to my rescue and turned the conversation to books mrs mitchell jerst lerves to read in fact the local branch of the public library simply cant keep up with her she just gobbles up books five or six of em a week why books are just bread and meat to her mr mitchell demurred he never reads anything unless it has first been digested by the readers digest hes a vey vey slow reader always has been cant git through these long long books of threefour hundred pages thats asking too much of a man he means he likes reading but why drag it out so mmm youve got a point i said i felt that time was staggering on and we were somehow missing the crux of life in the south today and undertook to change the subject myself what do you think of the sitins i asked of the general assemblage mr mitchell undertook to propound the position for the group he explained that it was like this inegration may be in evitable but its gotta be fought because just as sure as night and day it will lead eventually to the mongrelization of the race using bits of tableware he illustrated here youve got a racehorse producing a fork and heres a cart horse marshaling a sugar bowl that did look a little bit like a fat plodding old nag mix em and what have you got since reader you have heard this one before i will cut it short youve got sumpn that aint fit for running and aint fit for haulinga crossbreed a misfit and what oh what have you got if you breed a slow reader with a fast reader i asked anxiously but answer came there none fortunately there are other viewpoints to be found among louisville whites louisville is the home of barry bingham publisher and owner of the liberal courierjournal bingham impressed me as one who would be more at home in london or paris than in this provincial setting a cosmopolitan in outlook and by preference yet he works conscientiously with the locals for the liberalization of racial attitudes in his hometown trip notes last day in louisville no fair using taxi drivers for copy but this ones an exception shes a rugged stronglooking woman build of marie dressier i ask her what she thinks of the sitins all for them she calls out gaily goes on to tell me about her sons elementaryschool picnic last year there were about sixty white people kids and parents and one negro boy the park custodian refused to admit the negro child upon which the whites by common agreement decided to chuck the whole thing surprising because tm not at all sure this would necessarily have been the outcome had a parallel incident happened at home in california on to nashville tm told it is known by its inhabitants as the athens of the south leads one to speculate for a fanciful moment on whether athenians ever think of their city as the nashville of greece in nashville i drove to a shady road on the outskirts of town one of those roads bathed in the luminous green that is the hallmark of a southern spring you feel almost as though you were swimming through the weeds of a sunny overgrown pond so exuberant is the vegetation the large tidy house at the end of the circular drive was of the vintage of its inhabitants perhaps a little older and furnished in the style of their youth with lots of leather varnished maps flowery chintz and fringed lamps several ladies were gathered for tea which was shortly served by a prim negro maid the sweet soft voices twittered away i declare francielou these brownies are just mouth watering and i never did get my ramblers to bloom just right last spring but then the weather was downright unseasonable touches of lace rose and fell on dimity bosoms old fingers groped in purses for photographs of grandchildren one might have stumbled into a scene from a mary petty drawing soon enough as often happens in a gathering of the leisured elderly the conversation turned to good works the particular form of good works practiced by these ladies for the past several months was being observers at the negro sitins the role of an observer they explained to me was merely to sit at the lunch counter or in the theatre where negroes were seeking accommodation and in silence to lend moral support to the effort there was no contact between observer and sitin demonstrator and no words were ever exchanged nevertheless by some sort of mental telepathy as one expressed it the friendly intent of the observer was usually somehow transmitted to the negro group looking round at these particular observers i felt it wouldnt require much detective work to divine that a woolworths lunch counter was not their customary eating place nor son of tarzan their preferred form of entertainment i dont think miz beardsley ever set foot in a woolworths before in all her bom days confided one because she turned to me real surprised and said why whod have thought they serve coffee in these places mrs beardsley had good cause to find out that they not only serve coffee but ply the customers with free refills for after two hours during which because of a temporary breakdown of organization no negroes showed up she was heard to complain in an agonized stage whisper where in the world are they i simply cant drink any more colfeeand i must find the ladies room coffee drinking seems to loom large in this struggle with a hundred or more white observers involved mostly women with free daytime hours to devote a few minor hitches were bound to develop one lady sailed angrily up to an acquaintance who had merely stopped at a lunch counter for a bite to eat after a hot afternoon of shopping and snapped what are you doing here this place is reserved for the unitarians integration of the movie theatres presented yet another problem informal agreement was finally reached with some of the theatre managers that negroes would be admitted but to smooth the initial stages of the change they would be expected to walk directly to their seats and not to stand in the lobby patronize the candy stand or use the restrooms a white lady observer seeing a negro patron in front of her move as though to rise from his seat reached forward and grabbed him saying loudly youre not supposed to go to the restroom what early experience or sudden turn in life had prompted the missionary zeal of the observers this was hard to discover i guess ive always felt this way ever since i was a child said one its just that there was never any opportunity to do anything about it until the sitins started i was to get the same sort of answer from many another southern white i spent an afternoon with an elderly intellectual one of those rare women whose entire life is spent in the realm of scholarly endeavor she was a leading authority on boswell and johnson a translator of eighteenthcentury french poetry a student of modern thought from freud to sartreand an alert interesting conversationalist at one point i asked her what she thought the outcome of the segregation problem would be she became exceedingly ruffled and answered quite crossly to tell you the truth i never give it a thought evidently to think about this particular problem would be disturbing and in an area in which she had no wish to be disturbed if one stayed long enough in the company of people like the observer ladies it might be possible to get the wrong impression it would not be difficult to travel through the south entirely in such company for today they exist to one extent or another in every state even in the deep southand like all minority thinkers they tend to hang together they are for the most part a deeply dedicated lot in the north there are countless numbers of white people who contribute occasionally to core or naacp go once in a while to a meeting or lecture on race problems and vote for a local negro candidate but these activities are on the periphery of their lives among the southerners i met who have taken a stand for integration it seems to have swallowed them whole and to occupy their every waking moment once you start out with the integrationists they are likely to pass you from hand to hand and from town to town without giving you much chance to peer at the other side i mentioned this to a young attorney originally from jackson whom i met in nashville he laughed and said you should tra meetin kissin jim folsom thatd open yo ass for a moment i was frozen with astonishmentuntil i realized he was saying eyes trip notes atlanta so far everywhere vve been louisville nashville and now atlanta people keep saying this isnt the real south or its more of a border city yet they look like southerners they talk like southerners they act like southerners i gather what they really mean is that atlanta nashville and louisville have better newspapers better colleges more enlightened leadership and consequently better race relations than other southern communities therefore to say they are not the real south seems vaguely unfair i met a couple of southern belles models the first was a senior at a womens college on the outskirts of atlanta academically the best school in the south she told me she had the delicate look of a spring floweryet a certain bounciness of mannerand that special softness and highness of voice often encountered in southern women what made me join the sitins i dont know i always wanted to do something about discrimination when i saw them there i felt i had no choice but to join in she said she had not known any of the negro participants one day she was downtown shopping and came across a negro picket line i just started picketing with them but the tears were rolling down my cheeks the second southern belle conventionally honeyhaired and blueeyed was introduced to me by her mother who said i want you to meet my lil ole jailbird daughter shes just been in and out of those jails since the sitins started havent you lambchop and now shes on her way to jackson with the freedom riders lambchop an honor student at her southern college is jeopardizing a coveted junior year abroad by making the dangerous journey to jackson but with her as with a growing number of her generation the mewvement as they all pronounce it must come first the little old jailbirds attractive and delightful mother took me to some meetings where i met the men and women of goodwill who were busily organizing for ddaythat day toward the end of summer when the schools would be desegregated for the first time dont ever say integration we like to call it desegregationit sounds so much more palatable somehow a network of committees and subcommittees with their cleverly contrived nameshope for help our public education oasis for organizations assisting schools in septemberwere meeting almost daily often to the background whir of a mimeograph machine grinding out the latest mailing from the toplevel planners including y leaders churchmen schoolboard people to the neighborhood groups and youth committees hundreds were involved in this huge humanitarian enterprise i heard the superintendent of schools tell a gathering that police protection for the entering students would be as carefully planned as the invasion of japan it was all thrilling and heartwarming and inspiringwith one tragiccomic aspect this great outpouring of bestintentioned energy was directed to the very modest end that nine negro children out of a hundred thirtyeight applicants should be allowed peacefully to take their rightful places at high school these nine had survived a barrage of tests academically they had to be above the fiftieth percentile of the school to which they sought transfer their behavior record had to be blameless their personalities had to be declared outstanding no such interpretation of the tests was made for their white classmates which leads one to speculate whether the old phrase separate but equal is being supplanted for the negroes by the concept together but vastly superior trip notes montgomery at last people have stopped saying this isnt the real south my favorite sort of houses everywhere white frame two or more stories most with nineteenthcentury gingerbread trim even in the better suburbs none of this splitlevel streamlined modern that gets so tiresome in wealthy california everything half hidden by the rampaging vegetation of a corotmonetmanet land the frescoes round the walls of the rotunda in the state capitol incredibly like the worst examples of soviet art depicting scenes of montgomery history one titled the golden years shows a group of happy slaves toting bales of something each with delighted smile on face no postcards of this available to my sorrow as i should have liked to tease my friends at home with them the elite cafe fine food pronounced eelight cafe fan fude weeds pushing up all over the tennis courts in the immense public park a couple of years ago negroes won a court decision granting them use of the park so the city authorities closed it up for everybody noses and faces being respectively cut off and spited all over they disbanded the zoo too and now if you want to take the kids to the zoo you have to go all the way to birmingham where the zoo is integrated social gatherings in montgomery are full of echoes of the past the food in private houses tends to be in the shape of thingsicecream boats or hearts fishshaped aspic saladsand almost everything is creamed not only creamed but served with cream sauce the fare is as mild and gentle as the ladies themselves no bitter or pungent taste to offset the bland no crisp consistency to contrast with the soft the very form of conversation seems more nineteenth century than contemporary at ladies lunches the talk proceeds like a croquet game with three standard opening moves the weather well is it hot enough for you the food about which someone is bound to declare pretty near the beginning that rosiebelles whateveritis is just simply out of this world the frontalassault type of compliment where somebody declares that my you get younger looking every day and how in the world do you manage it and goes on to bet your husband doesnt like to let you out of his sight for one single minute this sort of remark may as well be delivered to a matron of fifty as to the latest bride and trips off the tongue as readily exaggeration as a way of life may confuse the auslander my hostess answers the telephone and is heard to say why janie thats just about the nicest thing i ever heard in my whole life upon being asked later what the call was about it turns out that janie has invited us over for a drink no use to comment that my hostess must have had a rather thin time if that was really just about the nicest thing she ever heard in her whole life she merely stares uncomprehendingly as conversation warms up which of course it does eventually the sense of the past is intensified for so much of it deals with endless ramifications of family history and gossip about old times one thing leading to another the longago romances of aunts williejo and sarahmarie cousins robbielou and marigold are brought out for examination and speculation anecdotes often end and the thing of it was he simply up and took a shotgun and blew his brains out and of course she was found in the river we all felt so bad and no one ever did exactly get the right of what happened the poor feller just actually took to the bottle well you know he did and of course its in the family his father died an alcoholic and well anyway i declare one day they found him in the garage hanging from a belt of course nothing was ever proved about it but they do say her death was not accidental few seem to have died in their beds all this in surprising contrast to the peachycreamy surface of life in montgomery the montgomery country club is much like the one in louisville spacious oldfashioned with french windows giving onto a long outdoor terrace presumably for gonewiththewindish occasions as in louisville good whiskey and terrible food are served by old familyretainer types of negroes in white coats there were a lot of young people in the crowd girls in diaphanous evening dresses boys in white dinner jackets their talk was all but incomprehensible their yalls rang out like rebel yells i found myself talking to a middleaged man introduced to me as a member of the school board so we discussed education in its noncontroversial aspects for i was a guest and on my best behavior the topic was the difficult situation of the unusually bright child whether he should be skipped or handled otherwise it is a safe and wellplotted subject with enough on the one hands and on the other hands to keep one going for a while my interlocutor explained that in his district the problem is being tackled by grouping the children within each grade according to ability i rejoined that the same system obtains in oakland californiaand could not help adding that in our grammar school there is a fifthgrade group of six children with iqs of over two whites two orientals and two negroes with genuine foreheadwrinkling puzzlement and no apparent rancor the schoolboard member drawled is that so it dont seem possible no nigra could have an iq of do it now i started to say to me it do when our hostess hurriedly bore me off to talk to someone else for a breath of fresh air i went to the mass meeting in the negro community where reverend martin_luther_king jr was to speak with the freedom riders actually the air was disturbingly filled with tear gas at one point and no one quite knew if wed get out of there alive the hostile white crowd outside which had been gathering for some time before the meeting was suitably attired i noted with approval in the latest thing in mob wear in faded cotton frocks revealing insectbitten bare legs or dirty shirts and jeans they might have been movie extras assembled by a rather unimaginative director to do a corny mob scene a wellread lot they appeared to be too versed in the literature of their region surely that halfbeatendown halfsavage look that casualyetbrutal slouch that mean glitter in the eye could only be achieved by one with at least a passing acquaintance with the works of faulkner tennessee williams and eudora welty there was only a handful of police and a squad of very nervouslooking us marshals to achieve the church i parked my borrowed car nearby and walked past the extras with all deliberate speed as the supreme court would sayfor being hatted gloved and stockinged i felt more than a little conspicuous inside the church was a loud

little boys wriggling in their stiff collars as the evening wore on its nightmare quality began to unfold first there was the tear gas an alien and threatening odor next incredibly reverend king was telling us in matteroffact tones that the mob outside was completely out of control they had injured some of the us marshals and had overturned and burned a car the implication was rather strong that the church might be next more incredibly the vast packed audience was taking it in stride there was not a sign of panic not a shriek not a fainting fit just murmurs of yes lord thats right lots of singing lots of patient confidence it seemed to go on forever and ever later it was announced by a general of the alabama national guard that no one could leave the church until morning because of the danger outside the atmosphere became positively jollylike an impromptu camping expedition i thought as we prepared to make ourselves as comfortable as possible for the long hours of confinement searching that sea of calm determined faces i felt as though id stumbled on the very source of strength that would brace a young girl to exchange a year in paris for a stretch in the jackson prison or a provincial gentlewoman to brave the scorn of her set by publicly giving a hand to the negro sitins some time after five oclock in the morning having learned that my borrowed car was the unlucky one that had been demolished earlier i was driven home in an alabama national guard jeep it was a morning of startling beauty a soft warm breezy dawn in which the lovely town looked its best trip notes montgomery after the freedom riders the fire marshal came round to see me about the burnedup car i was rather hoping he might be interested in finding the vandals who had destroyed it but he asked whether i was connected with core or naacp whether i had made other stops in the south or had come directly to montgomery from california whether l had attended regular church that sunday morning whether i knew anyone else who was at the meeting why went whether my friends had lent me the car of their own free will an editorial in the montgomery journal deplores the view that mob violence will chase industry from montgomery it points out that atlanta had the greatest race riot in history in six hundred negroes killed and carted off in trucks and look at flourishing industrial atlanta today

protect them just before i left i was smuggled into one last drawing room for tea by now there was virtually only one topic of conversation in montgomery the freedom riders and for comic relief the case of the young english girl versus the englishspeaking union after the usual preliminary comments on the weather the strawberry cream cake and the youth and beauty of all present our hostess patiently undertook to put me wise to the basic objection to the freedom riders integration of the busstation facilities would surely lead to intermarriage but does one usually marry a person because

fudes fan too and she has such a pretty room she added reflectively it really isnt so very different from the outside visitors to the beautiful city of seattle of which there will be throngs this worlds fair year will blink no eye to see the stars and stripes floating over the tall buildings nor give any particular thought to the wonderful addition western washington makes to our country they do not realize how it might have been otherwise how our northern boundary line which runs straight to the pacific shore once threatened to loop down around that lovely northwest corner and draw it into british territory had that happened the union jack would now be flying over the canadian waters of puget sound and some southern british columbia metropolis would reign where seattle stands in this connection there is a story which deserves attention but has never been completely and forthrightly told it concerns the impact made on the outcome of the boundary dispute by the personality of a remarkable negro george washington bush details about bushs early years are sketchy and contradictory but best information indicates that he was born in pennsylvania in his parents were servants to a shipping magnate named stevenson with whose household they moved to tennessee when the bushes remained faithful retainers to the end caring for their master and his wife in their declining years they were left the stevenson fortune george their only child was educated among the quakers of philadelphia and though some of their gentle peaceloving philosophy rubbed off on him he nevertheless joined the army during the war of he fought under general andrew jackson at the battle of new orleans and is sometimes credited with having made important suggestions to jackson in connection with the barricades which helped to win the engagement not yet through with adventure george bush became a voyageur with the furtrading companies sometime in the s employed first by robidou of st louis and later by the hudsons bay company for two years he traveled widely over the plains and mountains of the wilderness west and even made a visit to the pacific coastan experience which was to influence the most important decision of his later life undoubtedly the stevenson inherited money helped to stake him to a start in life when he was ready to settle down and he became a farmer stockraiser and nurseryman but it was due to his own intelligence and industry that he prospered possibly he farmed in illinois before his furtrading travels afterwards he settled in missouri first in boone county later moving westward into clay county having remained a bachelor until he was past in bush took as his wife isabella james a twentyyearold girl of germanamerican extraction to the couple five sons were born in rapid succession meantime in faraway oregon the historic situation was building up in which george bush was to play his part this was the international quarrel over the spoils of discovery along the north pacific coast at first four nations were involved but when in spain gave up her claim north of the nd parallel of latitude the oregoncalifornia line of today and in russia agreed to stop her southern advance at the approximate middle of the present province of british columbia the united states and great britain were left to quarrel over the intervening territorya strip miles wide stretching from the rocky mountains to the pacific ocean then generally known as oregon from the beginning the american government was loud and belligerent in its demand for all the territory north to the th parallel which was the westward extension of the northern boundary of the louisiana purchase this would have given the united states roughly twothirds of the disputed territory whereas the most the british felt impelled to yield up was onethird the u s did have an excellent claim to the columbia river and in after the russian position was stablized at the british government offered the columbia as the boundary line from the th parallel to the sea this offer reduced the territory in dispute to about twothirds of the present state of washington including the okanogan valley the kittitas and yakima valleys the washington cascades the fertile western lowlands the puget sound country and the beautiful olympic peninsula the u s unwilling to modify its claim to this extent haughtily refused the offer with the matter thus in stalemate the two govern ments agreed in to continue to occupy the territory jointly which they had been doing by treaty since for the next fifteen years the situation remained virtually unchanged a few american missionaries furtraders and settlers were attracted to the region but these took land to the south and east of the columbia in territory already understood to be american through the last british offer meantime the hudsons bay company had established the trading posts of fort vancouver on the north bank of the columbia fort nisqually near puget sound and fort langley on the fraser river as well as agricultural colonies on the cowlitz and nisqually prairies which strengthened the british position north of the river then in the early s a new force rolled westward over the plains waves of american emigrants boiling with oregon fever bringing wives children and possessions in covered wagons as families descended the columbia it became the duty of dr john mcloughlin chief factor at fort vancouver to direct the settlers into the rich willamette valley to the south and keep them out of the disputed territory to the british the columbia river was still the dividing line and they meant to keep it after a couple of years in which only small parties traveled westward a great migration took place in wagons people head of oxen and cattle early the next year talk drifted back to missouri of rich lands to be had in oregon for the taking of cattle and grain selling there at four times their price in the midwest some of bushs white friends and neighbors were determined to move to oregon to better themselves bushs knowledge of the west gained in his voyageur days would be an asset on the trip and they urged bush to join them george bush was by then a wealthy man but that circumstance had not kept his family from suffering the indignities of race prejudice bush felt that his sons would have a better opportunity in free oregon than in the slave state of missouri which was already growing bitter with the ferments which were to lead to the civil war and where feelings against free negroes were growing virulent so bush decided to go and thus became the wealthiest man to migrate to oregon in pioneer days he took with him seeds nursery trees implements and herds of stock and the story is also told how he carried one hundred pounds of silver nailed under a false bottom in his wagon but unlike many wealthy men he was kind and generous and he furnished teams and money out of his own pocket for some of his neighbors who started west with him the party as made up consisted of george bush michael t simmons david kindred james mcallister gabriel jones their wives and children and three single men mike simmons was a tall resolute kentuckian who was genial generous and strong in his attachment he and bush were very close friends and they complimented each other very well for simmons impulsiveness sometimes needed the temper of bushs sage counsel while simmons was more aggressive in fighting for his friends rights than the forgiving quakerraised farmer the wagons of the bush party joined with others until a train of some wagons was formed the train traveled forward in the spring of under a quasimilitary organization of which mike simmons was elected colonel a position which put him second in command when the general who was in command spent most of his time galloping after buffalo the real leadership fell on simmons shoulders and simmons in turn relied greatly on bushs shrewdness resourcefulness and knowledge of the country the spring proved tremendously rainy rivers were so swollen with flood that the wagons were delayed and the train reached the western slopes behind schedule and with many of its members desperately short of provisions in the emergency bush helped at least twenty destitute families out of his own stores and pocket a nd then on reaching the dalles on the columbia river the ax fell even while the simmonsled party toiled westward that spring settlers from missouri who had reached oregon the fall before had been busy putting their race intolerance to work the organic law adopted by the provisional government set up by willamette valley settlers in included an antislavery ordinance to which in june the slavestate missourians were able to force a harsh amendment the amendment forbade the settlement of free negroes in oregon on pain of a lashing not less than nor more than stripes if any should remain longer than two years thus the bushes after giving up their old missouri home after traveling two thousand miles through the wilderness seeking tolerance reached oregon to find the door slammed in their faces a not wanted sign affixed by means of a stilettopointed whip handle the feelings of the bushes at this point cannot be described their companions reacted in outraged indignation with deep disappointment for themselves for they were too deeply indebted to george bush too fond of him and his family to abandon them and if the bushes could not settle south of the columbia neither would they the willamette valley was out and also the rogue river valley farther south which they had been considering they soon discovered that the jurisdiction of the provisional government did not extend into british territory on the north side of the columbia and on going down the river they camped twenty miles east of fort vancouver on the washougal river where they remained for nearly a year during the winter the men of the party cut shakes which simmons and bush took to fort vancouver to exchange for provisions meantime the party was casting about for a place where bush could settle permanently in the fall simmons had become interested in reports of the inland sea of puget sound to the north and had made an exploring trip in that direction but was forced to turn back before reaching his goal even had he been successful he and his friends could hardly have defied dr mcloughlin they like most of the other american immigrants who reached the lower columbia arrived so short of provisions as to find themselves dependent upon the hudsons bay company the only source of supply the overland migration of american citizens had put dr mcloughlin in a compromising position if some of the american parties should starve after reaching the promised land it would certainly discourage others from starting and mcloughlins superiors desired him to deny the resources of the hudsons bay company to the arriving americans but mcloughlin possessed too humanitarian a heart to let women and children suffer he lent the necessary aidwhich only encouraged more families to come so now here was george bush and his party with a need to escape north from the negro whipping law both bush and simmons were outstanding intelligent men of the type to gain the chief factors regard and the good doctor was a tolerant man who himself knew the stings of race prejudice who had once caned a man for insulting his indian wife so dr mcloughlins sympathies were aroused by bushs plight and sometime during the spring of he found his humanitarian inclinations again running counter to the policy of his company and to british interests in july mike simmons again went north to explore puget sound this time successfully it seems sure that a private understanding with the chief factor had already been arrived at and in october when simmons led the rest of his party to a permanent settlement on the sound he carried with him a letter from dr mcloughlin to dr william f tolmie the superintendent of the agricultural company at nisqually asking tolmie to cooperate with the americans by providing them with supplies bush simmons and their friends spent fifteen days in cutting a road north from cowlitz landing for their wagons on arriving at the south end of the sound simmons took a claim at the falls in the deschutes river bush on the adjacent prairie afterwards known as bush prairie and the others on land nearby all within a radius of six miles this little colony represented the first definite breach in the britishheld line true one american john r jackson had settled in the cowlitz valley earlier that same year but whereas one man made little impression a party of thirtytwo men women and children carried real weight meantime a shift in the american position on the boundary question had been loudly trumpeted during his campaign for the presidency in james k polk had whipped up oregon emotionalism and promised if elected to demand the end of joint occupancy and to go to war with great britain if necessary to win the whole of the disputed territoryyes clear to the russian line this brash threat gained popular support and the cry fiftyfour forty or fight helped put polk in the white house though there was no new basis for this northward shift in american demands which resulted from sheer yankee bluster the development was an alarming one to the british american settlers were pouring into the willamette valley so fast as to have doubled their numbers and now that an american colony was established on puget sound it would be impossible to keep other emigrants in check south of the columbia should they surge on north of the th parallel the american government might find good grounds for its new demand for all of oregon this unhappy possibility caused the british to yield suddenly and in after thirty years of refusal they agreed to adopt the th parallel as international boundary to puget sound there to dip down to the strait of juan de fuca to give the british the whole of vancouver island the treaty which was concluded on june filled out the northwest corner of the united states as we see it on maps today historians assess in differing measures the reasons for this dramatic british capitulation but an important factor was the pressure of american immigration and fear of its northward trenda fear aggravated by dr mcloughlins failure to restrain the bush party south of the columbia river so it cannot be denied that the bush partys invasion of the forbidden field helped to tip the scales in uncle sams favor nor that this sequence of events resulted directly from george bushs worth of character had he not proved kind and neighborly in missouri and charitable and responsible during the westward trek his companions would have marched off to the rogue river valley without him even then had he not won the sympathy of dr mcloughlin the way to puget sound probably would have remained barred bush may never have been fully cognizant of the influence exerted on the outcome of the boundary dispute by his decision to go north to puget sound to find a free home if he did understand it the results must have seemed ironic with the signing of the oregon treaty the organic law of the provisional government was extended to the th parallel in this way the odious ordnance followed him north and within one year fell on him and his family in their new home but bush had staunch white friends who had seen him through before mike simmons who was appointed a justice of the peace under the provisional government traveled to oregon city where he pleaded bushs case so earnestly that he succeeded in having a special act passed removing bushs race disability but though bush could now reside in the territory legally he still endured other forms of discrimination ezra meeker pioneer washington historian has dwelt on bushs difficult position he was a true american and yet without a country he owed allegiance to the flag and yet the flag would not own him he was firmly held to obey the law and yet the law would not protect him he could not hold landed property and his oath would not be taken in a court of law not being able to hold landed property was the worst feature of this injustice for bush with his characteristic energy and intelligence had immediately set out to make his acre homestead a model farm he grew wonderful garden produce raised fat stock harvested manybushelled acres of wheat and other grains and set out an orchard he helped others with seeds and nursery stock he supplied the money to buy the mill irons for the first sawmill erected on puget sound built in by a group of settlers led by mike simmons the bush pioneer home on the prairie became a way station on the route between cowlitz landing and the sound where travelers were welcomed with unhesitating hospitality all who met bush were forced to admire him then during the winter of a time of near famine the fame of the negro pioneer spread more widely bush proved to be the only man on the sound with surplus stores of wheat and seattle speculators offered him a fortune for the supply but he refused to profit from the misfortunes of his fellow citizens he kept his wheat and apportioned it out fairly and charitably in april washington territory was divided off from oregon territory olympia only a few miles from the bush homestead became the capital within a month of the first meeting of the new territorial legislature in friends of simmons and bush among the lawmakers succeeded in having a memorial passed asking the u s congress to grant bush title to the section of land on which he had lived for nearly ten years in this memorial bushs white champions said of him his habits of life during said time have been exemplary and industrious and that by constant and laborious cultivation of said claim and by an accommodating and and charitable disposal of his produce to immigrants he had contributed much toward the settlement of this territory the suffering and needy never having applied to him in vain for succor and assistance and that at the present time the said george bush has a large portion of the said claim under a high state of cultivation and has upon it a good frame house and convenient outhouses in all amounting to several hundred dollars and in view of the premises aforesaid your memorialists are of the opinion that the case is of such meritorious nature that congress ought to pass a special law donating to him his said claim congress complied with the request granting george w bush the title to his homestead on january after that he continued to farm for eight more years and brought the first reaper and mower to the sound he died in his wife in one more boy had been born to the couple after they reached puget sound and their six sons carried on the tradition of their father they were among the most industrious and enterprising citizens in thurston county according to historian george h himes william owen bush the oldest son raised wheat which was awarded first premium at the philadelphia exposition of over all other wheat in the world and also medals at the buffalo and chicago worlds fairs descendants of george bush continued to live on the old homestead for one hundred years and the bush name has become so outstanding it will even be found in family records of washington pioneers compiled by the dar of washington statethe irony being that none of the information given reveals that bush was a negro recent newspaper articles about bush simmons and the early colony on the deschutes river also carefully omit this fact but the identity of george washington bush must not be denied he was a negro an ornament to his race who through sheer goodness won through to puget sound where the american flag followed and in the end extended its privileges to him

paradoxically fit was the french who first forced us to seek z its essence and who then showed us where it lay when they enforced their policy of assimilation and thus deepened our despair early on we had become aware within ourselves that assimilation was a failure we could assimilate mathematics or the french language but we could never strip off our black skins nor root out our black souls and so we set out on a fervent quest for the holy grail our collective soul and we came upon it it was not revealed to us by the official france of the politicians who out of self interest and political conviction defended the policy of assimilation its whereabouts was pointed out to us by that handful of freelance thinkerswriters artists ethnologists and prehistorianswho bring about cultural revolutions in france it was to be quite precise our teachers of ethnology who introduced us to the considerable body of work already achieved in the understanding of africa by the university of oxford what did we learn from all those writers artists and teachers that the early years of colonisation and especially even before colonisation the slave trade had ravaged black africa like a bush fire wiping out images and values in one vast carnage that negroid civilisation had flourished in the upper paleolithic age and that the neolithic revolution could not be explained without them that their roots retained their vigour and would one day produce new grass and green branches negritude is the whole complex of civilised valuescultural economic social and politicalwhich characterise the black peoples or more precisely the negroafrican world all these values are essentially informed by intuitive reason because this sentient reason the reason which comes to grips expresses itself emotionally through that selfsurrender that coalescence of subject and object through myths by which i mean the archetypal images of the collective soul above all through primordial rhythms synchronised with those of the cosmos in other words the sense of communion the gift of mythmaking the gift of rhythm such are the essential elements of negritude which you will find indelibly stamped on all the works and activities of the black man in opposition to european racialism of which the nazis were the symbol we set up an antiracial racialism the very excesses of naziism and the catastrophes it engendered were soon to bring us to our senses such hatred such violence above all such weeping and such shedding of blood produced a feeling of revulsionit was so foreign to our continents genius our need to love and then the anthropologists taught us that there is no such thing as a pure race scientifically speaking races do not exist they went one better and forecast that

only be by force that is its first disadvantage a more serious one is that it would not be humanistic for it would cut itself off from the complementary values of the greater part of humanity as i

offhand money makes a lot of us unhappy it causes many of the domestic upheavals in family life and sometimes seems to be the greatest single cause of all tension why should this be its a necessary commodity and we cannot escape it yet why cannot we learn to live with it harmoniously asking ourselves a few pertinent questions however we soon get an inkling as to why our money seems to manage us rather than we manage our money for instance do you eat steaks roasts and chops at the beginning of a pay period but find you have to lean heavily on starchy foods bean soups and meat substitutes at the last of the week when you really need to dress up do you discover that your hat is one color your best purse another and your one good dress will blend with neither does your family often complain of boredom and though you took the whole group out for a bangup time movies dinner and bowling right after payday theres nothing to do after that till next pay day are ordinary medical expenses always considered emergencies although as with most families they do occur regularly shots for the children dental appointments physical exams etc an answer of yes to these few questions and similar ones may give you the first hint that no one in your family is really managing your money but you are being managed admittedly money is one of the first reasons of family quarrels and disharmony so doesnt it make sense to get back into the management role as quickly as possible also since money is naturally of first importance in daily living it is certainly wisest to make it provide more living how take over make a plan for your money first take time to reckon past expenses get a general idea of how much of your money must be spent for food how much for housing and how much for clothing health recreation etc at the beginning of a pay period divide out all your available money into individual envelopes marked in these categories then plan to manage these different expenditures rather than put all your money in your purse and go on as long as it lasts food plan a weeks meals in advance according to sales items and seasonal bargains refrigerate and store things carefully to prevent any waste housing include rent or mortgage payments plus other housing essentials such as fuel water and electricity repairs insurance and furnishings clothing plan things to coordinate as to color and purpose go over your wardrobe and that of others in the family then resist impulse buying if you start out to buy a straight gray skirt dont let someone even yourself persuade you to buy that pretty lavender floral blouse that wont go with a thing you own health certain items such as vitamins health insurance etc will be easily planned for ahead but all of us should know that extras are normal so put aside something for those inevitable dental bills doctors visits and prescriptions a health fund accumulated ahead will prevent these things from wrecking the budget recreation a budget that is all business is dreary so be sure to put aside something for fun fare to give a lift to living but make the money really count by composing a fun list of things that cost little or nothing to enjoy things like picnics to state parks fishing hikes trips to the zoo or museum savings nothing makes you feel like a manager like a backlog of savings the amount saved regularly need not be large only constant earmark a certain percentage of all income and if the idea of saving money just for the sake of having money is boring to you then try saving for a purpose a new car new house childrens education vacation boat or retirement if your money manages you life can be stormy but if you manage your money theres fair weather ahead by a s doc young the past fifteen years rip f have been a golden era ii r for negro baseball players in more way than financial an astounding amount of athletic racial and economic progress has been made since branch rickey first brought j ackie robinson into the organized version of the game and jackies southembom manager inquired of rickey do you really think hes a human being but except ing the racial impact and sheer drama of jackies advent into a sport which had maintained for years an unwritten rule against negroes the next fifteen years promise to be even more golden again in more ways than financial in actuality the past predicts the future

accomplished so much in such a relatively short period of time have laid such a firm foundation on which third and fourth waves can build that this prediction cannot be easily dismissed as wishful or fanciful thinking it is almost as sure as the fact that god made little apples when rickey signed robinson this historic event occurred in the fall of robinson made his debut in organized baseball with montreal in entered the major leagues at brooklyn in he upset a pattern of racial discrimination which had existed since prior to and as early as in recorded sports history negroes had participated in integrated baseball including the major leagues of those days this spring as the major league clubs prepare for competition in the american and national divisions every team lists negroes on its parent roster or farmclub rosters the most successful or best and better teams are bulwarked by negro stars indeed if it were not for negro players the caliber of major league baseball today would hardly approach triplea negro players have been the saviors of the game as millions of fans have come to know itfor as rickey wisely discerned the ravages of world war ii and the lure of betterpaying jobs available to caucasian youngsters in other professions had seriously depleted the ranks of baseballs talent stock in this year the best allaround player in baseball is a negrowillie

chicago white sox detroit tigers st louis cardinals cannot possibly be realized without outstanding performances from such stars as maury wills hank aaron elston howard roberto clemente frank robinson willie mays a smith jake woods bill white and others the impact of jackie robinsons success as a major league baseball player transcended the initial fact that he reintegrated the game which is popularly called the national pastime negro baseball players today have escaped forever the tortuous life of their predecessors who were forced into the helterskelter existence of nomads who were grossly overplayed and underpaid who seldom obtained enough rest between games in the fleabag fleabitten segregated hotels where they were forced to live whose health and wellbeing were constantly jeopardized by the inadequate diets of the roadside greasy spoons where they not infrequently took their meals from the back door so rigorous was the life of the oldtime negro players that bunny downs bus driver for the cincinnati clowns was moved to ejaculate shuckin com hoein potatoes nothins tougher than this herewhatchacallittourist baseball negro baseball stars today are national and international heroes they travel firstclass sleep firstclass eat firstclass they play schedules which are within the limitations imposed by night games and the genius of the schedulemakers the best

will guarantee healthy fivefigure salaries one or two of them have even been allowed to shave on the television commercials baseball salaries paid to negro stars have purchased security many fine homes and cars many minks and more than a few giltedged investments andor businesses beyond this the achievements of negro players beginning with jackie robinson who is now a wellpaid vicepresident and director of a multimilliondollar new york restaurant and coffee chain have spun off human civil_rights social and economic benefits for millions of americans patently the kid or adult who cheers lustily for a negro athlete at the ball park cannot retain the depth and breadth of old racial prejudices he may not yet want to live in the same neighborhood with the negro star nor have his sister marry one but his total ideas about race and democracy undergo significant changes as he applauds the negro home run hitter or shutout pitcher today negroes are accepted in many of the nations best hotels such as the chase in st louis because integrated baseball teams broke the ice this spring several major league clubs will house their players negro and white in southern hotels or motels purchased for the expressed purpose of insuring equality of housing eating and recreational facilities in countless american cities and towns race relations are improved the negro receives a better break and everybody is happier because integrated baseball brought home the invaluable lesson that negroes and caucasians can live and work together harmoniously for the greater good of all indeed in many southern areas where integrated schooling remains controversial and white citizens councils call the political plays integrated baseball is accepted it was several years ago that a clevelandowned pitcher named dave hoskins porformed in the texas league and subsequently was publicly acclaimed as the savior of the league the owners of the little rock arkansas team spoke out for integration before eisenhower prodded by louis armstrong decided to protect negro students who courageously walked through angry lines of bigots on their way to class in what may well be adjudged historically as a most significant move the famed birmingham barons withdrew from the southern association a few weeks ago because of archaic jim crow laws in that city and alabama but the limits of achievement by negro baseball players have not yet been posted on the horizon as inspiring and rewarding as the golden era has been the end of the rainbow with its huge pot of doubloons still lies ahead the surface has been scratched but serious mining operations are just beginning negroes have not yet been employed notably in the frontoffices of organized baseball clubs louis jones exhusband of lena horne and former olympic games track star harrison dillard have held public relations jobs with the cleveland indians other negroes have held positions of varying importance with these teams but there are not

coldbloodedly dumped jackie robinson as he neared careers end for jackie as his subsequent success in business and public affairs proves possesses one of the keenest minds the sport has ever known personal resentment of jackie was the big factor behind his being traded to the thennew york giants a transaction which he canceled by making a dramatic retirement from baseball one of jackies contemporaries campanella purportedly was tabbed for an eventual managers role but his tragic automobile accident ended his career prematurely despite his physical handicaps however campy has worked for did he establish with mays a policy of paying a topflight negro star what he is worth it is reliably reported that a major factor in stonehams hiring of willies former teammate alvin dark as giant manager was darks ability to get along with mays the next fifteen years the goldengolden era for negro ball players will bring a solution to virtually all of the problems large and small endured by them today as these players move up in rank particularly as the general press public and club officials recognize their mental abilities as well as their physical attributesstartling progress will be made on all fronts such practices as negroandnegro rooming assignments or road trips placement of all negro player lockers together in one defined section of dressing rooms lower salaries for certain negro players than are being paid their lessable caucasian teammates james junior gilliam of the dodgers is an outstanding example of the underpaid negro star will disappear if as attorney general bob kennedy visualizes the potential a negro may be elected president of the united states within the next halfcentury then it is not hyperbolic dreaming to expect a major league manager general manager farm director orpossiblya club president during the goldengolden age of the soaring s and s before these startling possibilities are discounted it is well to remember that just fifteen years ago rogers hornsby was arguing that negroes would never fit into organized baseball because of the social angles such as playing cards during road trips involved a new york writer nationally famous was claimingjust fifteen years agothat negroes are always pushing themselves into jobs for which they are not qualified if no one suggested that the sky would fall because of jackie robinsons advent it was only because no one thought of it but oddly enough it was a southerner w n cox of the norfolk virginianpilot who informed the world that if negro players began to hit homers run bases and field with elan the question of their color would soon be forgotten up to date the greatest allaround negro baseball playerofficial has been the late andrew rube foster who not only starred on the mound in negro leagues but also was a colorful and successful manager he used to signal his outfielders with puffs of smoke from an old corncob pipe promoter teamowner league founder and president and baseball commissioner during the next fifteen years someone in major league baseball as we know it perhaps bill white or bill bruton or gene baker or ernie banks will put rube foster into second place its bound to happen progress is like rabbits it reproduces its kind fast open hiring you can sit and talk about it at staff meetings for hours on a high lofty plane you can tell yourself that this is the twentieth century you can ask yourself what kind of a citizen you are when you give lip service to hiring the negro yet never really do anything about it then alone you begin to entertain the small nagging doubts would he fit in with the other salesmen would your customers resent him would the negro salesman mesh into your organization maybe the experience of a national company atlantic gummed paper corp with headquarters in brooklyn would be helpful atlantic supplies strip box sealing to the packaging market it has sales offices in most of the u s it has southern customers its not a giant about million a year in sales but this firm whose building is at the foot of the brooklyn bridge has a problem and its first negro salesman a young man named john anderson has solved it but let atlantics president saul warshaw tell the story i live in the greenwich village area he said and i like to walk one evening he found himself in the center of a market his company hadnt been able to crack the garment area this is a businessasusual district buyers do business with cronies friends relatives most of the time a salesman cant even get through the door i wondered if there werent some way we could get a salesman in a salesman with the guts and tenacity to keep plugging away despite rebuffs one whod be remembered and thats when i decided to try a negro salesman if one could be found whod meet the requirements the door opened and john anderson came in tall and person able he was dressed in clothes of excellent quality and he knew how to wear them after introductions warshaw continued i worked with employment agencies they sent me eight negro salesmen and i got a surprise any of them could have done the job why anderson we asked warshaw smiled said he didnt think john had ever heard and maybe he should he has the hide of a rhinoceros but it doesnt show anderson had sold shoes before he got his first job after service in korea with the marines at a fashionable fifth avenue shoe salon he had found that of the stores customers were negroes but when he originally applied for a job he was told there were no application blanks we negroes are used to that answer i kept plugging until i got to see the vp john anderson was the first negro salesman the firm ever had and became its top salesman later at gimbels he repeated the sales performance but he was ambitious and he wanted what he calls a real sales job after hiring him warshaw gave him intensive sales training in addition to the usual training he sent anderson into the plant to learn how various stock is manufactured to arm him with every piece of factual information knowing hed have a tougher row than most to hoe as far as he knows there was no resentment the salesmen actually went out of their way to help then john was sent out on his own he was given the garment district known as the jungle he learned that when the denizen who guards the traditional barred gate a jungle hallmarkwont let him in he can often make it by the back door and he learned that his very color causes prospects to remember him in that split second i open up with the fastest sales pitch i can since i handle the new gummed tape with fiberglas interior i begin to demonstrate how it works one customera good one now but one we hadnt been able to sell beforesaid you dont know how good that dark face looks to me im jewish and i get mighty tired of seeing nothing but jewish salesmen warshaw admits to a bit of trepidation along the way when the company held a large meeting for its customers he wondered what some of his customers might have to say about anderson instead of icy blasts he got telephone calls many people wanted to know how a negro salesman had worked out they were toying with the idea of adding negroes to their sales forces i gave them one piece of advice if you hire a negro as a salesman you must integrate him into your organization by a tiein to top management clearly understood by the organization and i told them that looking at it from a purely selfish point of view the negro salesman will work harder to prove himself because the stakes are bigger john anderson who attended ucla and lives in westchester with his wife a successful designer of boys wear sums up one day people wont think twice about hiring a negro salesman one day all the sales manager will ask it whos the best man for the job a fighting wenching singing man the bigpowerful negro man stood in the middle of a circle on the sp louisiana prison farm and thrashed the twelve strings of his guitar with fingers of ebony steel the melody he played and the song he sang spoke the joy of deliverance he was getting out he grinned at the other convicts as his brawny voice took up the melody sometimes i lives in the country sometimes i lives in the town sometimes i haves a great notion to jump into the river an drown stop ramblin an stop gamblin an stayin out late at night go home to your wife and family sit down about a fireside bright it was his story and his life most of his fellowconvicts gathered there in the circle around leadbelly had heard the song before and most of them knew the words and its name good night irene by heart he had sung it for them on the long hot summer nights that came after blistering days in the cane rows when they gathered stalks to feed the pelican state factory a mill with a ton intake per day the state ran the mill as it did the rest of the selfsupporting penitentiary spread out over the tract that had once been a plantation they had heard irene before as they had heard most of leadbellys big bagful of more than songs but they had never heard it sung quite that way for this was a day of triumph for leadbelly a day he had lived all his life to celebrate this convict without knowing how or why a responsibility had fallen on his shoulders was a man with a long way to go the journey now more than twothirds run had begun more than years before on the day a son named huddie had been born to sarah and wess ledbetter on a farm near mooringsport louisiana probably in the year before it came to an end leadbelly would go halfway around the world with his own inextinguishable and apparently inexhaustible stock of music and folkways with that would go a way of living beyond the margin of comfortable society that would qualify leadbelly to stand at the same bar with o henry and gauguin villon and van gogh he was not an average man his mother was half cherokee and that explained the copper in his otherwise richly dark skin it might explain too some of the dark confusion and tragedy of leadbellys life but it would be only part explanation the ledbetters enjoyed as many negroes living in the caddo lake district of louisiana have enjoyed a degree of freedom and independence his father wess had bought vi acres of land when leadbelly was five years old and worked most of them leadbelly used to say that he was pretty happy as a child that my father would cut down trees and my mother would cut down brush and id be home sleepin they never touched me to whip me possibly this gentleness of his parents came from deep religious convictions but it was not enough as huddie grew stronger and smarter the conflict came with adolescence and the development of leadbellys giant physical prowess as long as he was a little boy the son of a generally respected and hardworking sharecropper leadbelly was secure nor did his heritage either of african or indian blood cause him any trouble as long as he stayed close to peaceful caddo lake but that couldnt last his troubles were waiting outside as soon as he could get up on a horse and stay there leadbelly rode off into the bottoms at night to play for sukey jumps caddo lake was close to cajun country besides the jumps or play parties there were breakdowns for square dancing the accordion fiddle and guitar usually supplied the music which usually kept going until dawn off in the canebrakes every saturday night at the age of or it didnt take long for leadbelly to learn to like girls drinks and music at some weathergray shanty set down in the bottomlands he could play all night get all he wanted to drink and lie out back in the pines between sets i used to be terrible wid womens terrible rough he said years later ive had trainloads of em trainloadssometimes eight or ten at a dance at fifteen leadbelly was married and the father of his first child the next year he ran away his wife willie mae was pregnant againbut not by leadbelly this time he insisted even before this leadbelly had already made his way to fannin street in shreveport he has told how he took off his short pants to go down there and how he sneaked away from his family to do it the first time out he fell in with some girls who were drinking beerand sugared it so it would taste better but when he took off at he headed for texas i couldnt sleep for thinkin bout the music is the way leadbelly described his appetite for mu sic while still a boy his uncle bob had taught him how to play the guitar then at the sukey jumps he learned about the accordion i as good as they had on a win jammer he boasted the first piece i ever learned to play was po howard from jim faginan green corn from bud coleman these were dance tunes and that was a beginning the rest of leadbellys music came from sources as varied as his wanderings and no one knows exactly what these were at after two years of rambling he banished away and went out in west texas pickin cotton he had also recalled how he went into a bar one day and found blind lemon jefferson little bit of something about blind lemon yes sir just to remember him he said in answer to a question years later cause him and i was buddies we used to play all up and around dallas texas the guitar plinked gently as he talked along fort worth we just get on the train an them time wed get on the that interurbans run from waco to dallas cross the cannon walk the hatchet from dallas an then they had interurban that run fum down to fort worth id git blind lemon bout home an wed get out two guitars an wed just ride anything wouldnt have to pay money in them

around cause when women are around that brings mens an well git money cause when you git out there the women git to drinkin an not thinkin they just fall all up on you an boy that make us feel good an we tear them guitars all to pieces never would quit playin leadbelly was learning his music the best way picking it up as he went along blind lemon who needed a lead man to guide him on his tours was a willing teacher in this way leadbelly lived out the kind of experience that has given to music and folklore so much of its vitality and lusty repertory he rolled along learning from others all the way always adding to music he already knew in dallas in leadbelly heard his first jazz band he threw in for a while with a crew that toured the streets playing alternately guitar accordion mandolin mouth harp and bass fiddle and he had more encounters with women in marshall a town near the texaslouisiana line where he at one time may have gone to college he was hauled into court by a woman who claimed he had attacked her for leadbelly this was the first real trouble he was sent up for a year on the harrison county chain gang on the third morning out the guard got nasty as leadbelly said later in his magnificent chaingang song take this hammer that hurt my pride he just couldnt take it so he cut out across the fields chain and suit with a slug from the guards winchester nicking up the ploughed ground beneath his feet that first time he was lucky enough down in the backwoods he found some negro men and women hoeing they cut his chain loose with an axe and he somehow got home to caddo lake and hid away for a while in a cotton patch the next trouble leadbelly had was more serious on may he was charged in the bowee county court house in new boston texas with murder and assault to murder in this case with two men a gun had been drawn and one of them had fallen leadbelly alias walter boyd on this slate was sentenced to thirty years he tried two breaks the first time he got clean out of jail and stayed out for three days then on june he was sent up to the shaw state prison farm to serve out his year term not long after he took to the pines once more the hounds were after him and he was trapped but he couldnt go back so he jumped into the water they fished leadbelly out of the stream half dead and for a while at least broken in spirit but it didnt take long for him to come back when he did though his spirit had changed instead of trying to run away he tried to work his way out both literally and with guile that was where his strength and his music both helped while he had been out in the blacklands belt of texas leadbelly had done some hard cottonpicking his wife at that time lethe showed him how one day he got the hang of it and before long he climbed up from lethes respectable pounds of cotton a day to an impressive pounds then to pounds a day then he heard of a man who could do a thousand a thousandpicker dont look back at it he yelled and shot for that mark so he was ready for the prison farm once he made up his mind to work he became as alan lomax has written the number one man in the numberone gang on the numberone farm in the statethe man who could carry the lead row in the field for or hours a day under the boiling july and august sun and then cut the fool for the guards all evening cutting the fool for the guards was part of leadbellys plan for his freedom one day he heard that governor pat neff occasionally came to inspect the farm by now leadbelly knew the power of his music he had seen it charm coins out of rich white folks hands in the plushy suburbs of dallas he had ridden all over west texas using his guitar as a free ticket it had got him out of scrapes and women headed for it like bears for honey one night a woman threw herself into his arms so hard she broke all but one of the strings of his guitar besides knowing what he could do with music leadbelly had added to his stock of it along fannin street in the redlight district of shreveport he had heard slow somber blues moaned out by weary prostitutes he had heard flashy ragtime pianists in the cabarets and more elegant bordellos on the state farms he had tapped the rich source of afroamerican song and lore that goes back farther than inmates can remember work songs came as naturally to him as the heave of a hammer or the heft of a steel rail fancy songs he knew from childhood down the red river valley and along the brazos bottoms he had heard cowboy songs old slave shouts field hollers and laments in tent shows that toured the south he heard minstrel music and in one tent in particular he remembered hearing black patti the negro coloratura who had a company of troubadours and who wound up an evening of cakewalks with a finale billed as the operatic kaleidoscope on the mississippi he had picked up the songs of roustabouts stevedores levee workers and boatmen as part of his own oneman performances he had added dancing to his music and could do a buckandwing ballthejack and eagle rock he knew hundreds of popular songs and had already improvised verses of his own based on their melodies his version of the titanics sinking had proved a hit wherever he went leadbelly in then was no mere singer of folk songs as they were then being sparsely studied in american universities he was a fullfledged two fisted professional entertainer a member of good standing of the raw roistering frontier life of river and valley mesa and bordello before governor pat neff came to the shaw state prison farm leadbelly had worked up a piece called governor pat neff it isnt hard to imagine leadbellys cavalier words of greeting to the titlesubject of his song when pat neff did come down leadbelly was summoned to the edge of the porch much as negroes in the old feudal south used to come up to the plantation verandah with their rattles and jawbones and cakewalking to entertain de white folks he danced he sang he played the guitar he worked all the way up through his routine then brought out the governors song as if it were the most casual interpolation the effect was shattering but it produced a result far from what leadbelly who had counted on it to immediately open the gates of the prison farm had intended neff said right off he wouldnt pardon leadbelly im gonna keep you down here to play for me when i come the governor told him but when i get outa office im gonna turn you loose if its the last thing in the world i ever do leadbelly had to wait until january for the governor to keep his promise then just five days before ma ferguson the first woman governor of texas and second woman to hold that office in the united states was inaugurated the pardon for leadbelly came through to the state prison farm huddie leadbelly was out but it was a changed world he was a marked man now with all counts against himfirst for attacking a woman second for murder and assault to murder no hundred other counts could have indicted him more a negro and a man in the deep south he found himself condemned to exist in a halfworld always living in shanties down on the other side of the tracks always performing in halflit lowcaste gin mills and dance halls he tried hard work at first and was employed in a buick agency in houston from to but trouble clung to him as persistently as music stuck in his head in the next five years he came close to being killed at least three times and was undoubtedly involved in scores of other unrecorded fights the first incident was recalled years later when xrays of leadbellys skull in a new york hospital recorded a fracture he said then that he had felt numbness in his head for many months after the night a bottle cracked his scalp open he never went to a doctor on another night he was picking out mrtom hughes town on his guitar in a dance across the lake from oil city when a man stuck a knife in his neck and drew it half around to the other side before his girl era beat off the wouldbe murderer huddie went to the police that time bleeding like a hog and was told to get out and fast then for the third time he was attacked while on the way home from work some men stopped him and asked for whisky from his dinner pail he swore he didnt have any and when he refused to give up his pail his blood began to flow again on february leadbelly was packed off to angola with a second assault with intent to murder written against his name when john alan lomax a scholar a southern gentleman and curator of the archives of american folk music of the library of congress found leadbelly at angola he pulled every wire in sight and added a few invisible ones of his own to get him out leadbelly made his contribution to the campaign by composing a new gubernatorial song this one titled governor o k allen dedicated to the louisiana incumbent a hard man who had vowed never to release any con from any state pen the new song about governor allen was duly recorded by lomax and transmitted to the governors office nothing happened more people were seen then it was finally announced that leadbelly although he had not served his term of ten years could be released on a technicality by august of huddie would have accumulated enough good time to warrant a reprieve that gave huddie leadbelly on august a little over fifteen years until his death on december in which to transmit his music to the world but the rest of the world was slow on the day of his release there were no more than a handful of persons including john a and alan lomax his son who were aware of leadbellys vast repertoire and its potential impact on american music these two men arranged tours for huddie and after he got to new york helped him with recording dates but aside from a temporary flurry caused in campuses along the eastern coast where leadbelly had lectured and sung and a spurt of publicity that ensued when his book negro folk songs as sung by leadbelly was published the rest of the country remained unmoved sales of the book slumped at the mark the march of time did a quick runthrough of leadbelly in march reenacting his release from angola but this was not enough to swing leadbelly into the position of national stardom that he felt he deserved this was a strange thing about leadbelly as long as he lived he was sure of his greatness he thrust it upon everyone and in so doing alienated many persons who might otherwise have been eager to help him almost all the time during his last years he was talking to persons who only halfbelieved him halflistened to him ise the king of twelvestring guitar players of the world he used to boast and everyone smiled indulgently tse the greatest folk singer in the world he said and titters ran through small audiences in small rooms he recorded for many recordcompany labels large and small first perfect milotone then musicraft victor asch and capitol and none of the records sold very well the song he had always said was my song good night irene he recorded for both asch and capitol neither pressing sold well he was interviewed by theatrical agents and each one had a different idea one wanted to put him on the concert stage another suggested that he grow his hair long cultivate a beard and pose himself into a big role as de lawd in a revival of green pastures the folk song people took him to their hearts but that was a limited circuitabout records sold every time he cut one he sang at the village vanguard an intellectuals bistro in greenwich village and for this he earned a week and an occasional nod from a stray critic who became lost below nd street and broadway for a time he was the nineday wonder of the leftwing world he played for rallies he played for parties he was feted and considered socially significant writers found that his songs were founded on social protest sure there was social protest in leadbellys songs they were about his life and the way he and a great many other negroes had been kicked around in the south but they didnt always read like the latest dateline from union square and after a while the tide of leftist praise receded leadbelly was broadminded he also composed songs celebrating the virtues of wendell willkie and came up with an ode on princess elizabeths wedding day the trouble seems to have been that everyone saw a little part of leadbelly but no one saw all of him tin pan alley too turned him down although irene when published after his death by a little sheet music company the first possibly the second music publication ever accorded him was plugged to a faretheewell and sold over a million copies in the decca recording alone sometimes his attempts to get in the bigtime were pitiful in without a contract without even an offer he boarded a train for hollywood sure that this was his destiny but like many another of leadbellys destinies it fell as flat as celluloid during his entire stay there the only offer he ever got was to play for partiesparties given for the stars but leadbelly although he was patted on the head by a galaxy of them was there not as a star but as a curiosity on the performers platform he had sense enough not to be fooled by that and he returned to new yorkstill pretty broke but much wiser but he accomplished two extraordinary things in those last years of his life and by these things alone huddie stands a good chance of being remembered in the first place he succeeded in making good on a boast he had sung when he first hit manhattan i was born and raised in the country man but im stayin in town by this he sang that he was turning his back on the south because he had lived there as a condemned man he was going to make good in the city and stop ramblin an stop gamblin many of his friends thought hed never make itthat exposed to the hypedup tempo of subway life booze and a whole city of new women he could never stay out of trouble but he did a great deal of the credit for that goes to martha promise a girl he had met in louisiana but married later in wilton connecticut in martha stuck with him and she gave him a fireside bright to come home to huddies other accomplishment was sweated out under a sort of desperation that must have been almost as great as the desperation he knew when he halflived a condemned man on the other side of the tracks in the south what he did during those last years was to get all of his music down with calm cheerful insistence he somehow managed to hand over most of his vast inheritance of folk music from the past blues slave songs spirituals work songs ballads popular songs everything was set down in one form or another some of it is on records now for the most part out of print some of it is on several thousand feet of tape recorded only a year before he died some of it was transcribed and published in the first book about leadbelly some of it reposes in the form of aluminum discs in the archives of the library of congress still more was recorded by moe asch of folkways records who plans to issue one longplaying record a year from this source as long as it lasts further material may come to light if and when columbia records chooses to open its archives of leadbelly recordings of all this material so far only irene had enjoyed any great public acceptance yet there is in the rest of this legacy of leadbellys enough to serve as basis for at least two more books a trio of operas a score of films and a bakers dozen of popular hits when irene burst upon leadbellys first big public a few short months before his death in late the cognoscenti of the music world discovered a resemblance to the music of stephen foster in leadbellys song they were years behind a biographer of foster who had already and quite unconsciously delineated this resemblance he has published songs and instrumental compositions john tasker howard wrote some years after fosters death wrote howard the best of the songs form the most important group of peoples songs that have ever come from the pen of any one composer they are probably the most typically american expression that any composer has yet achieved born and raised in the interior foster was little affected by the foreign immigration of musicians that enslaved the seaboard in midcentury the influences that molded foster were inherently americanthe singing of the negroes on the wharves of the ohio river and the sentimental songs that were carried through the country by the socalled singing families in concert he found a medium that was simple and sincere at its best dealing with emotions that are fundamental to all mankind and at its worst never quite so bad as the other popular songs of his own day or later why shouldnt there have been a resemblance between stephen foster and leadbelly the point is interesting and undoubtedly true but like many another approach to huddie during his lifetime it misses the essential in this singer and dancer convict and rambler we had another and possibly even more prolific and imaginative stephen foster in our midst he was quite a character this man who spent most of his life fighting wenchingand singing by antoinette s demond the summer of my six teenth year got started in the same way as any other summera lot of tennis in the morning in the washington park courts and swimming afterwards in the park pool down near fiftyfifth street i saw a lot of ben better than swimming myself i liked to watch him gliding up and down that great big pool he was like a great fish sliding through the water and i liked to watch him leaping off the high board winging upwards a mite before leaning down into the cool greenblue water cutting it with scarcely a splash and when he would climb out so tall so brownblack and glistening and come over where i was sitting and id say hi and hed say hi whats new my heart would pound violently and id know that it was a summer like no other there were to be dances in the park that summer that was different carpenters laid a wood floor for dancing in the old boathouse down by the side of the lake and at one end of it they set up a bar for soft drinks folks were talking about those dances and about the balloons and streamers and japanese lanterns that would decorate the boat house evenings i sat on my porch an old grey stoop with iron balustradesthe same as every other porch down that block of plain brick row houses i just sat there leaning again the iron balustrade watching the catalpa tree which shaded the porch shed its fading pink blossoms little girls played rock school on the stoop next door their flared pleated skirts stood out as they bounced up and down the steps little boys slid down the balustradesno handsand folks passing by complained about the heat and called hey boy to the men peddling ice cream bars one evening that summer when i was sitting on my stoopsitting there with nothing whatever to do ben came down the street i dont even remember what i was thinking about just suddenly big as life there he was and i was smoothing down my dress and smiling at him and saying hi and wondering if my eyes were as wide apart as folks said and if my bangs were lying flat against my forehead or rising upwards from the heat ben said hi to me and his teeth were gleaming in a friendly smile and his beautiful body was standing full before me close enough to reach out and touch he sat down on the steps besides v me and started talking away about this and thati couldnt tell you just whatbut suddenly he was asking me to go to the dance at the boat house and i say yes without any reservations wondering on the one hand how it was that he had decided to ask me and wondering at the same time what i could wear if i didnt know that it would be the red dress when ben left loping on down the street in an easy stride i took a mirror from my skirt pocket to look at what he had seen prominent eyebrows sleek bangs eyes wide apart and a small mouth made up red a dimple showed in my right cheek when i smiled i only had the one saturday night a tawny brown girl in an orangered dress bangs artfully arranged i crossed my legs waiting for ben elegant legs legs like your mothers my father once said i was glad to have such nice legs to go dancing with ben ben called for me around eight he wore a white suit and he smelled of shaving lotion it wasnt even dark yet but off we went to the park we walked unhurriedly past all those tennis courts on south park empty now in the fading light cabs flickered past us picking up fares but we walked enjoying the summer night at fiftyfifth street we turned into the park and followed the path leading to the boathouse that dumpy old boathouse surely looked different we could hear the music of the band as we came up and then we saw the couples dancing on the newly laid floor balloons and streamers were suspended from the rafters and orange and green japanese lanterns bobbed in the evening breeze just roof and floor and dancers in between and the girls in their summer dresses ben and i joined the dancers we changed off with other couples but mostly we danced together we took a row boat out on the lake under the summer stars and the new silvery moon i remember yet the laplap of the water the ceaseless call of the crickets the smell of flowers and fishy water that night at home in my small upstairs room i sat at my dressing table leaning on my elbows looking at myself in the mirror now at last i was sure that i was pretty at least pretty to somebody i stood up and let my clothing fall to the floor i slid into my pajamas and sat down to pin up my bangs i creamed my face and wiped it clean now it all had a purpose i took a notebook from the bookshelf ben i wrote and then sally i drew a heart around our namesa childs game and then the speculation tall brown boy are you for me i lay down on my bed to think that question over and wondering about it i fell asleep ben telephoned the next day what about swimming he asked swimming idly i touched my pinnedup bangs its going to be hot he explained we might as well go over to the pool id love to go i said id love to ben called for me at one oclock when we got to the pool it was already crowded i sat on the side of the pool and watched ben swim as i had so many times before only this time i had come with ben i was his date he swam over to where i was and grinning from ear to ear pulled me in the water ducking me until i sputtered i ducked him back and swam off to the shallower end up and down we swamfun to swimfun to float on our backs watching the fluffy clouds drift in the wide summer sky on the way home we strolled across fiftyfifth street bought some popcorn stopped in at a neighborhood show two features and a newsreel ben held my hand during the two features during the newsreel he put his arm around my shoulders sally he said soft on us close together we sat our thighs touching our shoulders touching bens arm around me we were filled with the wonder of each other filled with the wish that the night would never end come in sally father stood in the doorway in his housecoat and slippers i guess that he had tired of waiting for me to make up my own mind to come in his tone was stern and unfriendly it is very very late he said ben took away his arm and stood goodnight sally he said and started off down the street how i longed to run after him how i longed to stay with him forever i hated to turn into the house my fathers housethe house of my childhood dad stopped me before i went upstairs he said that i was seeing too much of ben that i was only sixteena lot more in that moment i could not bear my father i hated him i only wanted ben but then even then somehow i knew that i was glad to be important enough to call out dads sternest voice his deepest concern i knew it was his way of showing how much he loved me upstairs i creamed my face as usual i pinned up my bangs i hung up my red dress and climbed between the sheets of my bed i thought about my notebook but did not take it down there was nothing to add that i wanted to say i remembered too well what i had written in it not so long before tall brown boy are you for me i knew what the answer had to be and i cried i did not see much of ben after that my father was adamant ben telephoned off and on and then not at all i did not go to the pool i did not play tennis evenings i sat alone on my stoop with nothing whatever to do save watch the children race up and down with their endless games of tag and hideandseek long green seed pods formed on the catalpa and now and again a huge forked leaf loosened and fell to the earth that was the end of the summer of my sixteenth year after labor day school reopened and from time to time i saw ben seeing him brought me pain pain where my heart should be but even then i was grateful for the moments of perfection we had known together sometimes we would meet and he would smile flashing that wide grin he would even say hi whats new and the old rush of giddiness would come over me but id be ashamed to let him see the flush of color that came to my face after a while when i saw him coming i would walk another way the long green pods of the catalpa tree turned brown the children on my street put them into their mouths and pretended to smoke indian cigars they called them for the october school dances ben dated a new girl who had come to our school in the years that followed i had not ben whenever i am thinking many dates many beaux but of my youth i remember ben and most of them i have forgotten but that summer of my sixteenth year by edward james grant the negro in america nn as some right to he sensitive his black cv face is to many white americans a badge of inferiority even before his actual level of culture and accomplishment is known the prejudice which confronts him at every turn in life is sufficient to implant within his conscious mind the weeds of cynicism and discouragement but perhaps the real danger that the colored man must try to avoid is swpersensitivitythat omnipresent chip on the shoulder with its ramifications of distrust and selfpersecution though in a high percentage of cases his conclusions on race animosity may be warranted he must give the benefit of doubt to whomever he is not certain bears him malice this should be true in all areas of his activity sports housing industry public transportation social gatherings for instance he should not immediately condemn the baseball or football team as discriminatory which does not employ a negro player management on that team may be content with its roster of players at the moment of decision and would hesitate to place a negro of inferior capabilities onto the squad it might be possible that a superior colored player would find immediate acceptance on the team yet the supersensitive negro citizen would despise the team for rejecting a player which in the opinion of the mentors would add nothing to its momentum the theory that negro players regardless of their contribution to a team should be accepted on the basis of simple color balance is no more logical than its reverse of rejection because of color in fact this doctrine has certain dictatorial aspects there should be irrefutable evidence that the owner of a team would refuse to add a negro player to its lineup no matter what the situation then this particular team deserves the wrath of negroes everywhere a good example of a quick jump to false conclusions occurred among a group of negroes in the boston area who a few years ago decided that the boston red sox baseball team had slammed the door on colored players and that ted williams in particular was responsible for that policy this supersensitive group repudiated the boston team the hatred which consumed them when they discussed ted williams was far more deeprooted than the animosity of average williams dissenters but soon the sox were fielding a fair not great infielder named pumpsie green and offering a real chance to a pitcher named earl wilson sports writers who would never flatter williams were admitting that he was working with green without directives from the front office to help the rookies batting average the negroes who had vilified both the red sox and ted williams prematurely should have felt sheepish thus while there are admittedly a few cases among nationally prominent sports aggregates of discrimination the evidence would seem to favor a more tolerant attitude on the part of negroes who would ostracize a white team without knowing all the facts the mantle of supersensitivity moves into many areas we find it in restaurants where negroes are constantly on the defensive as they look for signs of displeasure among the waitresses and other help if a waitress is sullen and illtempered the negro might feel that his presence was the reason for her nasty disposition when actually she might have acted just as unpleasantly with white patrons many negroes seem ready to bristle over any action or attitude that might be tolerated from members of their own race we find it in buses and subway trains where a white person suddenly finding himself or herself seated next to a negro might rise and walk to the door this might have happened anyway but the negro will often conclude that his proximity provided the motivation there is a moment of awkwardness embarrassment or anger which may not have been necessary we find it in real estate where a homeowner cannot reject a colored family without being branded as discriminatory there is real danger to this since the homeowner may lose the privilege of selectivity let us assume that this imaginary landlord has interviewed several white families he has turned down the first apartmenthunter too many children the second flatseekers have all the qualifications but mr apartmentowner simply disliked them for reasons of personality and attitude a third prospect may have pets which he insists upon keeping and the landlord does not want animals on the premises these are valid reasons to reject white families at least no official action would be taken to attempt to force the landlord to change his mind however the homeowner would find himself in trouble if he tried to refuse negroes for the same reasons no matter what the objections the national association for the advancement of colored people would call it discrimination if this double standard is carried too far more and more of the rules which apply to white families will not apply to colored families thus while one must admit that the negro has been improperly excluded from many neighborhoods even in the supposedly relaxed northern regions of america and deserves the cooperation of state and fed eral agencies to improve his constitutional rights in matters of housing negro sensitivity should not expropriate from a landlord his privilege of personal choice in selecting that family which will occupy his private property the same objections which would apply to white families should apply to colored families and negroes should be aware of these common objections and react to them as gracefully as white hunters of apartments are forced to do the same situation exists in industry the boss who may honestly feel that a negro employee lacks the necessary equipment to ply his trade may be suspected of discrimination for discharging that worker supersensitivity more than ever will emerge in this instance since income and sustenance are on the block quite often a negro discharged will complain that the color of his skin was behind his dismissal with the result that pressure may be brought against an employer to rehire incompetent or lazy help since the matter of employment is a vital personal issue one must expect resentment at the time of forced departure from a job on the other hand the inflexible conclusion without positive proof that bias figured in any such decision shows lack of confidence and reflects defeatism it would be better to determine that a competent employee black or white will usually keep his job to some degree the spectre of supersensitivity is present in the framework of school integration but in this area the negro is on firmer ground without question the attack upon integration in education by white people in the south or anywhere else it occurs is the most shortsighted objection to arise in the race conflict what possible chance for equality exists for an ignorant minority what better place to start an upsurge of the american negro than in the schools and most certainly on an integrated level where basic respect for one another can be implanted in youth and where all of the facilities of the best educational systems and institutions can be made available to a people sorely in need of this basic freedom if we can continue to concentrate upon this dilemma in the light that negroes cannot be swept under some imaginary rug and that their explosive birthrate tends to increase the black tide too rapidly for an attitude of indifference we may then realize that extensive progress in education should be made however negroes particularly in the north might tend to be oversensitive on this subject where a section of a city is predominately colored there should not be an enraged outcry at the greater number of negro children in the schools within that area the desire to send children by bus far from their environs for the sake of integration at any cost is once again a kind of hysteria which might well be avoided what all this actually boils down to is that the slow emergence of the negro into the doorway of civil_rights could easily extend beyond the bounds of common sense unless the negro controls his sensitivities and allows himself to be judged on his merits this will not be easy for an oppressed race struggling with a builtin inferiority complex supersensitivity is the disease of people who have faced adversity and scorn to some extent it is to be expected and should be accorded reasonable sympathy only when carried to an abnormal degree does it become reprehensible the colored man who feels that a police officer would not have stopped him if he had been white or that a judge might have meted out a lighter sentence may be grievously punishing himself before he can be accepted the average negro must accept himself in other words he must feel like an equal consequently this would result in confidence and selfesteem two characteristics which would preclude supersensitivity once and for all by george puscas as most tragedies do this one began inno cently enough sl bored largely ignored at home the preachers son wandered into the streets of chicago it was johnny bratton was years old a cocky showboat kid instinctively disliked by others but johnny had something going for himfists that could win instant respect and admiration within weeks roaming the streets challenging the neighborhoods johnny found his way to a gym slipped his hands into boxing gloves there the boxing world had itself another fighterand there the pages began to turn on a sickening adventure which produced one of its final chapters here saturday morning the life of johnny bratton is one of the great wastes of the sports world the fault is not all his perhaps not even mostly his but waste it is a sad commentary on the poor boy grown rich the insignificant become important the young moving too fast living too old maturing too slowly within a year of his first wearing of the gloves johnny bratton fought and won his first amateur fight two years later he was golden gloves champion of chicago he turned pro before long he was fighting main events in chicago stadium suddenly the hero of the teeming south side his manager was howard frazier a pound giant who had spied johnny on the streets frazier was wise he moved johnny cautiously in nine fights in johnny earned big money came quickly in the first four months of he made another in pursuit of it came the first tide of moochers bootlickers hustlersthe leecheswho prey on the naive and johnny was naive he was owner of a big black cadillac a sport in expensive clothes he hired a liveried chauffeur to drive the car married fathered a daughter and divorced within a year shortly he met joanne then who later was to bear him a son ricky johnny was a big deal this was the era of big money television fights and johnny bratton was a steady star his fight career progressed though his fists were small johnny possessed a devastating twohanded attack had catlike agility and awesome courage he lived the life stylishly dressed an impassioned spender he banqueted cronies at a clip lost heavily at poker and dice borrowed constantly first sign that the world was not goldcrusted came in when johnny now and growing distrustful sought to rid himself of frazier the illinois athletic commission wanted to know why under constant questioning the manager admitted that he had bet johnnys purses on the outcome of his fights and when fights were lost was unable to make good they say most problems begin with money soon johnnys exwife hauled him into court for nonsupport within the same month march johnny fought charley fusari for the world welterweight title he won but the government took his purse of to pay delinquent income taxes johnny continued fighting he made money fast played faster he had two more title fights the second is remembered as one of the most brutal vicious fights of the last years in it the world darkened perhaps forever for johnny bratton it was the th round at chicago stadium bratton had been holding up well against boloswinging kid gavilan suddenly gavilan cornered bratton rained repeated blows to his head bratton was hurt gavilan punished him severely blows to the head bratton never hit back ringsiders recall it as the most dreadful punishment they have witnessed seeing bratton helpless gavilan paused expecting the fight to be stopped the referee made no move the blows came again and more they were to the head said one veteran fight writer i counted in alland bratton never was able to swing back perhaps because of his cockiness the fight crowds loved to see bratton beaten and probably because of that he refused now to quit the punishment continued for four more rounds it was the turning point in the life of the preachers son a champion no longer he was no more a center of attention and he began to act queerly friends tell how he went on reefer kicks indulged in a variety of excesses frantically embraced the moslem religion and suddenly started grieving inside at the age of frazier explained johnny was accidental witness to the infidelity of a loved one frazier said this troubled johnny constantly in march bratton was knocked out by del flanagan he never fought again within a few months his mind began to slip and soon johnny was taken aboard a van and carried to manteno state mental hospital outside chicago this was september in the years since the preachers son has been largely unknown and unknowing last january a young mother who once might have expected much brought a handsome son ill of infection to detroits childrens hospital in two days he slipped into coma soon passed away ricky bratton a child of tragedy was buried that saturday morning in detroits memorial cemetery the preachers son sits unknowing by will sparks reprinted by permission from the commonweal if law is an ordinance of reason directed to the common good and if american lawmakers are rational men this article will effect the immediate repeal of u s narcotics laws without great difficulty it can be shown that this countrys narcotics laws produce little good but much harm that they rest on false premises that in form and in manner of their enforcement they are destructive of orderly legal process indeed the only reason for not anticipating repeal is that the wisdom of it has been demonstrated many times yet the narcotics laws remain why this should be so is itself an interesting aspect of the controversy products of the indian hemp plant have been used as an intoxicant by millions of people from ancient india to harlem for five thousand years because they are subject to the new york penal law however residents of the latter community are sometimes sent to prison for fifteen years because someone finds them with two ounces of the hemp product they know as marihuana under provisions of the marihuana tax act passed in and now incorporated in the internal revenue code no one can import manufacture sell or buy marihuana in the united states without obtaining certain forms from the treasury department and paying the specified tax since the marihuana act like other federal narcotics legislation is in reality a law to regulate social behavior disguised as a revenue measure the secretary of the treasury invariably refuses to provide the necessary forms traffic in marihuana is perforce illegal and a proper concern of the departments bureau of narcotics behind such legislation lies the belief that use of this venerable intoxicantwhich can be grown in any window flowerboxis destructive to the character or personality of the user that the drug is habitforming that it leads to crimes of violence and in particular to crimes of a sexual nature assuming for a momentand it will be a brief momentthat there is some truth in these allegations there would still be great difficulty in explaining our marihuana legislation for to whatever extent they might be true each of the statements can also be applied to alcohol most of us know at least one individual whose personality has been affected by alcoholism which is a form of drug addiction we are aware that some people become aggressive to the point of violence under the influence of too much whiskey and the aphrodisiac qualities of alcohol are part of our folklore such arguments were in fact vociferously advanced by the advocates of prohibition yet the volstead act has been repealed and america today tolerates despite the existence of four to five million alcoholics some fifty or sixty million social drinkers these latter are sufficiently familiar with their favorite intoxicant and of sufficient number to insist that government recognize alcohol abuse as a problem pertaining to certain users and not to the drug itself marihuana prohibition however remains with us not because of what we know apparently but because of what we do not know the agency most concerned with the effects on human beings of the drug from which we are thus protected by a benevolent government is the u s public health service a film prepared by the research branch of the u s public health service hospital at lexington kentucky for circulation among medical groups shows several experienced marihuana smokers under the drugs influence and states as follows marihuana smokers generally are mildly intoxicated giggle laugh bother no one and have a good time they do not stagger or fall and ordinarily will not attempt to harm anyone it has not been proved that smoking marihuana leads to crimes of a sexual nature smoking marihuana has no unpleasant aftereffects no dependence is developed on the drug and the practice can easily be stopped at any time in fact it is probably easier to stop smoking marihuana cigarettes than tobacco cigarettes almost two decades ago in an effort to prevent use of marihuana from becoming a court martial offense in the military service the editor of the military surgeon col james m phalen md wrote an editorial to which he gave the title the marihuana bugaboo and in which he offered the following conclusions it is my considered opinion that the smoking of the leaves flowers and seeds of cannabis sativa the botanical name for marihuana is no more harmful than the smoking of tobacco it is further considered that the legislation in relation to marihuana was illadvised that it branded as a men ace and a crime a matter of trivial importance finally it is hoped that no witch hunt will be instituted in the military service over a problem that does not exist dr phalen was ignored as medical opinion on this subject is usually ignored but the subsequent continuing witch hunt has at least the advantage of furnishing a corps of imprisoned marihuana users upon whom to experiment and the results of all studies to date have been negative thus a former medical officer in charge of the public health services lexington hospital can state marihuana is not possessed of any mysterious power to force people to commit acts which they would not otherwise perform like alcohol marihuana is an intoxicating drug which releases inhibitions by direct action neither alcohol nor marihuana produces criminal activity and criminal acts may result only insofar as the inhibitions on the personality are removed we see this phenomenon regularly with the consumption of alcohol normal people even when thoroughly intoxicated usually remain affable though their behavior may be silly or even disgusting the psychopath howeverand we all have one or more among our acquaintancesoften tends toward belligerence with the first few drinks and with continued drinking moves toward complete and uncontrolled violence the dockets of police courts are crowded with these cases every morning and of course hundreds of others are kept out of court by good fortune or the handling of the drunk by friends who excuse his fighting and brawling on the grounds that he has had too much to drink in the face of such findings and the utter absence of any to the contrary our marihuana laws should be repealed or at least revised to conform to the various federal state and municipal ordinances regulating alcohol the government should cease imprisoning its citizens for trafficking in a drug which exhaustive research has shown harmless to its user and unproductive of any conduct on his part harmful to society the marihuana statutes are not reasonable are not directed to the common good and neither produce nor preserve happiness for the society they are unjust so also are the diverse statutes regulating opiateseg opium morphine heroinand these are furthermore productive of far more serious and pernicious effects upon the people in whose interest they were misguidedly enacted although hard to credit by those encountering them for the first time the indisputable facts about the opiates are these used long enough or with regularity opiate drugs create a situation in the body which causes the user to get sick when the drug is withdrawn the illness or withdrawal syndrome is however selflimiting and leaves no aftereffects moreover there are no serious toxic effects of any kind associated with the use of opiates including heroin and one may employ them for a lifetime without physical injury dr alfred r lindesmith of indiana university has written it is impossible to interpret the effects of a drug habit upon a persons social life or his character in terms of organic deterioration or alleged toxic effects there are no demonstrable major effects that necessarily follow the use of opiate drugsaddicts escape most of the alleged degenerative results of the drug if they are sufficiently welltodo and many addicts suffer serious character deterioration only after the narcotic agents catch up with them in other countries about which we have excellent information addicts do not suffer the evil effects that are forced upon american users they do not steal lie engage in prostitution or become derelicts to the extent that our addicts do it seems quite clear that american opiate addicts steal or engage in prostitution not from the effects of the drug but from the effects of laws laws which transform a cheap and common chemical into a priceless commodity able to support a vast criminal drug traffic having created the economic basis for this traffic with passage of the harrison narcotics act in our lawmakers have for fortyseven long years been unable to eradicate it in the meanwhile unnecessary human misery the civic corruption which accompanies opiate prohibition no less than alcohol prohibition remain the hallmarks of u s drug control policies there is no excuse for this the problem of heroin morphine and other opium derivatives is inherently more complicated for where marihuana is less habit forming than tobacco the opiates are very definitely addicting drugs in soberly considering the question of addiction however we must endeavor to suppress certain emotional irrelevanciesnot least of which is an inward fear of temptation many of us are disturbed by the thought of chemically sustained happiness or euphoria whether from tranquilizers the soma of brave new world or heroin this is a legitimate and real concern and one which deserves discussion but it must not be allowed to muddy our thinking about the justice of u s narcotics legislation these narcotics laws are not predicated on a reasoned objection to hedonism or some newfangled chemical eudaemonism they are based on the supposition that drugs like heroin are so harmful that we are compelled to treat them as a class apart spend millions vainly attempting to enforce prohibition and turn a deaf ear to the importunities of addicts whom we thus consign to the underworld when this supposition is shown to be unfoundedand such is the overwhelming import of forty years of researchand when the laws based upon it themselves produce undeniable and widespread evil then such legislation should in all logic be abandoned it may be suggested that the fact of a drugs being addicting is in itself sufficient justification for prohibition the difficulty is that it is impossible to write a definition of addicting which does not include alcohol to use the words of dr harris isbell of the u s public health service statistically alcohol is the most important of all addicting depressant drugs contrasting the effects of alcohol and opiate addiction dr roy p finney has written alcohol is by long odds the worst habitforming drug known to man not only is chronic alcoholism many times more common than morphinism but in point of view of viciousness bacchus excels morpheus in many important respects morphine does not intoxicate hence as a driver of a motor vehicle for example the morphine addict is quite safe while the alcoholic is a menace to society the libidinous insulting stare the fermentative halitosis the disheveled inebriate lying comatose in his own vomitsuch things have no counterpart in morphinism it was dr j d reichard who observed that the alcoholic gets high comes home and beats his wife while the morphine or heroin addict gets high comes homeand his wife beats him u s narcotics legislation beginning with the harrison act of is a product of the same mentality which produced the unfortunate and unlamented volstead act of five years later every argument against the latter law applies equally to the former our failure to so apply them results from the relative unpopularity of opiate drugs in our society and our consequent ignorance regarding them as well as from a profound revulsion of the same ethnic origin as that which causes an hashhishusing arab to abhor the whiskey dens of the decadent west america survived repeal of the volstead act and would survive repeal of the harrison law federal narcotic legislation and the local legislation inspired by it is unreasonable in the light of informed opinion concerning narcotics addiction it is productive of much social evil and personal unhappiness incorporated in the internal revenue code ostensibly as a revenue measure it exercises a control over the use of opiates which in the case of alcohol was permitted only by constitutional amendment and which the people ultimately rejected as unwise for all these reasons control of narcotics should be transferred to the food and drug administration which should see to it rigorously that narcotics are dispensed only by or on the prescription of a physician as prescribed by the federal food drug and cosmetic act the federal bureau of narcotics should be reduced to a role comparable to that of the treasurys alcohol tax unit and the government henceforth refrain from repressive measures calculated to prohibitor rather to drive into the control of criminalsthe seemingly inevitable use of such moodchanging drugs as alcohol marihuana and heroin it should do so because its present conduct is irrational ineffective socially harmful andto repeat unjust by richard rive bemies pamphlets coming up what about athlone athlones ready coming up we need three extra workers at athlone and one in claremont jims been arrested when they pick him up last night cops caught him putting up strike notices wheres he now claremont policestation mervyns trying for bail hope he gets it athlone coming up for cape town central hell thatll take some counting gotta have it ready by tonight new shift working in cape town no same five plus eight students hope all this is in aid of something think theyll come out who the workers they should but the colored workers are the problem african dependable they should be after the last time you know of course pac will come out against us i dont think thats any problem could be serious they have strong support in the cape not quite our problem at the moment we have pamphlets to count right lets get stuck into cape town central ok there is something about upper long street that is different from the lower half it is clean and dirty modern and oldfashioned plastic and enamel with just a touch of crinoline and the sedan chair it is moral and immoral its shops are respectable its lanes notorious it contains bankmanagers and clerks whores and pimps mosques and churches englishmen afrikaners coloreds moslems africans jews gentiles germans greeks italians it is south african and unsouth african the lower half is sophisticated and pretentious the upper half vulgar and unpretentious boston cloete and lennie damons turned into it from wale street we nearing the bookshop now its not far to go only two blocks further boston said i hope so do you think hell have it ready who katzen i suppose so i dont know the man apparently hes a strong sympathizer that explains why he is helping to distribute pamphlets whos supposed to drop them joel this looks like the shop boston spoke with a slightly affected accent which made people look at him a second time in conversation and wonder where he came from it offended at first until one became used to it his face was dark brown with heavy bushy eyebrows and a firm jaw his hair was black and wavy in durban he could pass for an indian only his accent gave him away he was soberly dressed except for a brown suede jacket which he hoped gave him a bohemian touch just sufficient to indicate that he wrote short stories he was in his late twenties and starting to put on weight he paused outside a dimlylit secondhand bookshop and compared the number on the door with that on the back of the envelope he took from his jacket pocket yeah lennie agreed peering over his shoulder seems like it lennie was as taciturn as boston was voluble he became cynical when aroused very dark of complexion he was often mistaken for african he didnt like being mistaken for african his face was round and the skin smooth and healthy he was an artist fairly successful but his portly shape belied the myth of a starving painter his clothes were neat somewhat loud in contrast to his cautious personality many thought him arrogant and he did nothing to counteract his reputation well lets go in boston said the bookshop was empty except for a bespectacled attendant sitting at a desk in a far comer and a university student paging through teach yourself calculus it was dark inside after the brilliant glare of long street and it took boston some time to get accustomed to the light the university student nodded to the attendant and left lennie wandered over to the africana section may i help you well yes boston hesitantly began are you mr katzen yes im cloete boston cloete im supposed to pick up a parcel left for me oh yes its at the back of the shop is that the parcel joel left thats it ill get it for you wont be a minute he disappeared into a back room so lennie asked raising his eyebrows he seems all right wonder if he knows joel he must or about the strike pamphlets possibly seems a sympathiser there are i few whites nowadays prepared to help i guess so mr katzen reappeared with a brownpaper parcel tied with string here we are thanks thanks very much mr kat zen boston said putting it into his empty satchel havent i met you before the bookdealer enquired he seemed j the talkative type boston felt he had to get away he was still suspicious and selfconscious about most whites i dont think so are you by any means a writer well yes i try to thats it i remember your name i read some of your stuff yes i cannot recollect where but i remember the name distinctly boston cloete thats it i liked your stories very much boston felt embarrassed he found compliments gratifying but was never quite sure how to accept them lennie watched patiently this is len damons oh yes the artist yes the artist lennie repeated they shook hands and an uncomfortable pause followed well thanks again mr katzen we must be off good luck and i hope everything works out all right they left the dark interior for the bustle and brilliant sunshine outside it was one of those bright saturday mornings wonder if he can be trusted boston said wonder lennie repeated vast patrols next week in peninsula police chiefs reassurance peninsula is prepared for a possible strike undeclared state of emergency begins the people demand a national convention he found his own relations hardest to convince blearyeyed from lack of sleep arguing canvassing threatening discussing but what do you want us to do stay at home during the strike its easy for you to say so but what about us we must learn to take risks yes but i have a wife and kids there are wives and kids all over south africa but this looks like every man for himself i must look after the interests of my own children i wonder if your children will agree with you one day my wifes all right mary understands i can keep the kids from school for the strike but joe and i must work and if you turn up and find all your colleagues stayed at home then i come back but you would have gone look its too big a sacrifice to expect from a family man there are plenty of family men all over south africa who are prepared to make the sacrifice that might very well be but the fact remains that if i dont report for work they might kick me out so so where does a colored man find another job where did you find the one you have now will you politicians find me another dont be silly my kids will starve so that their kids might eat one day im not thinking of one day im thinking of my children not in ten years time or next year but next month im thinking of ten years time all very well for you to speak so but i must consider my position think it over but think fast there isnt much time i dont think theres anything to think over well make an attempt at any rate long street was crowded with office workers lastminute shoppers women with babies tramps newspapervendors slick citytypes wontworks bus boston and lennie made their way towards the central area edging and dodging between people the noongun boomed from signal hill boston adjusted his wristwatch must get to castle stationers before lennie said why on earth i want to buy some drawing paper cant it wait no i have to paint over the weekend hell must you buy it now it wont take a minute we must get these pamphlets to alec by well make it there are plenty of buses theyre usually crowded at peak hour well manage they wove their way through the crowd boston stopped to buy a times what does it say the countrys jittery the whole damn south africas jittery strike fever yes what a way to welcome their new republic boston accelerated the pace you helping to distribute leaflets tonight no why the hell not boston turned on him im a painter not a pseudopolitician were all in on this are we ive not been invited thats not funny at all didnt intend it as such must you go through life as a cynic if you prefer it that way o go to hell boston always felt annoyed at lennie when the conversation reached that stage it had often happened before he knew it was useless to continue in the same strain he would start arguing and the more excited he became the more cynically lennie would react finally it would sink to the level of personalities he walked on moodily refusing to continue the conversation cigarette lennie asked peace offering come off it no thanks oh well artists of the world unite your world is so small i love it comfortable isnt it boston sneered very but it doesnt cramp my style but then your style is extremely limited isnt it terribly so confined to posterity what price arrogance they continued their silent walk long street was becoming less crowded but queues stretched along the pavements so boston began meaning to paint masterpieces over the weekend one can but try except that one might succeed that would be a pity how is your novel getting on your answer to dreiser the great south african tragedy no time for writing these days too busy helping to organize a strike how noble yes its terribly hard work not being selfish behold i take upon my shoulders all the burdens of south africa drop dead you started it did i they continued without saying a word till they reached castle stationers ill wait outside boston said alright now dont take a helluva time boston leaned against a lamppost and lit a cigarette the newspaper was full of strike news he scanned the headlines a huge gas explosion at coalbrook high heels prevent city mayors hike thousands arrested in mass police raids theyre jittery he thought damn jittery he hoped that lennie wouldnt be long there was alec to meet at cape town is ready to cope with strike every hope republic will have peaceful birth we the people are granite durban coloreds on the march transvaal coloreds up in arms two nonwhite men one a young university student dropping leaflets in letter boxes pm in district six you take the next block be careful right how many pamphlets are left quite a few still in the car ill take the first ten

just slip the leaflet under the door or in the letterbox then run not really unless its necessary ok ill tackle this row meet you in the car ill take the next block all in order v see you later boston finished his cigarette and stubbed it out impatiently against the lamppost damn it was time lennie came he tried to do the crossword puzzle twelve across discovered a stout domestic penny he gave it up he glanced at his watch and get to alec by there was no sense in standing around he might as well find lennie inside and shake him up he spotted him patiently stand ing at the crowded stationery counter while whites were being served first his face was impassive as usual like an african dan mask one never knew what lennie thought or felt unless he spoke boston tried to catch his eye but lennie stared stolidly ahead of him oh well boston walked over to the bookshelves his eyes ran over the titles plays pleasant pursuit of love the floating chinaman he removed the last named from the shelves what a giddy title this is a book one must not read emphatically not he replaced it somehow he had a strong feeling that he was being watched he looked around selfconsciously the shop was crowded and no one looked as if there was time to pay any attention to him there were so many books one must not read sex detection space fiction he would not shake off the feeling of being watched but then he always felt selfconscious about his presence in a crowd lennie still waiting to be served and alec to meet at he removed modern american short stories from the shelf hemingway katherine porter erskine caldwell he glanced at the introduction the americans have a genius for the short story may i help you he looked up selfconsciously at the rather downatheel shop assistant in a pink overall may i help you no thanks its quite all right he said somewhat confused im waiting for someone just waiting he halfsmiled at her are you sure he detected a slight suspicion in her voice yes quite sure why i only asked sorry she turned around and walked away hurriedly boston didnt like it he wished to god lennie would get done should he have come in should he have waited outside why the hell should he he walked over to the stationery counter one cant even look at books in a shop without attracting attention he wished lennie would finish so that they could get the hell out of the place meet alec at it was now close on to christ was it a crime for a colored man to read books in south africa couldnt one even remove books from a shelf excuse me was every nonwhite a potential thief pimp liar excuse me the manager stared down at him weak blue eyes peering through strong lenses in contrast to his huge size the assistant fidgeted at his side yes miss smart claims she saw you putting a book into your satchel the assistant nodded agreement of all the bloody cheek please control your language do you mind mind what opening your satchel yes i do mind i mind very much may i ask what you have in there encyclopaedia britannica and van riebeeks journals im not asking for your sarcasm and im not asking for your cheek will you please open your satchel im waiting for a friend thats not my business neither are the contents of my satchel very well if you insist on being difficult i shall have to call the police boston felt strong resentment humiliation had he been a white man they would have taken him to the privacy of the managers office a crowd collected must he be subjected to all this they could call the whole bloody police force he would not open his satchel whats

well then open your bag boston reluctantly started undoing the straps the constable grabbed the satchel from him and removed the brown paper parcel he handed it to the sergeant whats in here lady chatterleys lover which i wrapped up before i stole it from the childrens section the sergeant glared at him then commenced undoing the string he removed a pamphlet and read slowly his eyes hardened oh i see he said ill give you lady chatterley come along with me by dr benjamin spock i guess that most of us have some kind of prejudice though a prejudice may be positive we usually think of the negative kind the objection to a whole class of people on the basis of experience with a certain number or simply on hearsay some prejudices like those against divorcees artists clergymen or ivy leaguers cause disadvantage only to the people who hold them in the sense that these individuals automatically cut themselves off from contacts which might be valuable in different ways its the prejudices shared by the members of a dominant group and carried out into discrimination against others which really hurt i try to imagine sometimes how painful it must be for a parent to have to tell his young son and it has to be told by the time he is four or five that he will automatically be considered undesirable no matter how good his character and behavior that he will have to be prepared for slights and insults beginning soon if your child is being picked on by one bully its not difficult to explain that this individual is rude or all mixed up but what do you say when it is the bulk of the community it must be hard to reconcile this for him with the religious and ethical ideals you are trying to teach about gods justice the good intentions of most people the obligation to respect them we know that children and adults are influenced to behave according to the expectations of the community i think its a tribute to the good job done by the overwhelming majority of parents of scorned groups that their children have grown up not too seriously impaired by the low opinion in which they are held in the community we are less apt to think about the effect of serious prejudices on those who hold themand on their children at first glance you might think that being in the supposedly preferred position they wouldnt really be harmed but i think that from the psychological point of view there must always be at least some damage to personality the young child who is being taughtby parents or playmates to look down on or shun a group is usually being given the impression that they are somehow dangerous remarks such as they arent like us they arent nice theyre dirty have a vaguely ominous sound its left to the anxious imagination of the preschooler to picture just what the danger consists of this has the same effect on children as giving them fears about policemen or bogeymen or kidnapers which most educated parents try to avoid nowadays to the degree that the child takes the warnings seriously he feels endangered by the group this impairs his trust in people andmore seriouslyhis trust in his own ability to deal with people it also gives him as he grows older an unwholesome method for bolstering his ego when he secretly feels inadequate i think that most of us when we hear a grown man making sneering remarks about a minority immediately sense his lack of selfconfidence his readiness to seek solace through scorn and we lose some of our respect for him so it seems to me unhealthy from the point of view of the childs own welfare to start him out with readymade fears readymade selfdoubts readymade props i suppose that the readiness of human beings to believe ill of an entire group or to swell their dislike of a few individuals into a wholesale prejudice is a capacity which was built into humanity during the savage process of evolution so that men who were threatened with a genuine plot or an enemy tribe would be suspicious enough to fit little pieces of evidence together and to take alarm it is illuminating and disheartening to read for instance a description by an anthropologist of tribe a on a pacific island who are nice people but who believe that tribe b a few miles away are fiends when the anthropologist moves over to live with tribe b he finds that they too are agreeable people but they feel terribly threatened by what they consider the bloodthirsty barbarians of tribe a in a discouragingly similar way in times of hot or cold war in the twentieth century russians germans britons japanese americans have been easily convinced that the enemy were hardly human but experience in the psychiatric clinic as well as in life shows us that there is enormous variation in the amount of suspiciousness and hostility in different individuals one child grows up ready to hate almost everybody another reared in an unusually loving and peaceful family cannot be taught a deep distrust of anyone it may be helpful for our discussion if i point out some of the violently prejudiced distortions of thinking which are obvious in the mentalhospital patients whom we call paranoid this should aid our understanding of some of the deeply hidden roots of ordinary prejudice in everyday people since most of us have the capacity to think in a slightly paranoid way when we feel threatened if insecurity drives the paranoid individual into delusions he imagines that he is both a victim of persecution and at the same time a highly important personagethe head of the secret service for instance or the leader of a worldwide religious sect he keeps enlarging his estimate of the plot against himself until it involves an entire fraternal order or the hierarchy of another religion or international communism though his reaction is insanely exaggerated it reminds us of the ordinary person whose sense of inadequacy makes him feel threatened by a whole group and who tries to overcome it by thinking and talking about how superior he is to them paranoid individuals are also haunted by sexual jealousy they frequently imagine when sick that many people are carrying on successful affairs with their spouses hitler who was not insane by the usual definition but who was severely paranoid in personality rose to power in part by selling his idea that the jews were all plotting together to destroy germany and he and many of his henchmen kept themselves in a frenzy with the fantasy that the jews were successfully seducing aryan girls on a wholesale scale in the end he nearly destroyed his nation this reminds us of the preoccupation of some raceprejudiced americans from all parts of the country whose most impassioned arguments for segregation is their assumption that if white girls should go to school with negroes or work with them theyd automatically prefer to marry them these men repeat with childish belief fantastic tales about the superior virility of negroes doctors know that sexual success and doubt and failure are the monopoly of no race when the integrated use of childrens public swimming pools has been discussed in certain cities the agitated opponents have not objected so much to boys swimming with boys or girls with girls but to white girls swimming with negro boys these examples from the hospital and from the outside world give us clues to the basic importance of insecurityincluding sexual insecurityin prejudice fear of competition for jobs is another factor but this is not to say that only the sick or the very insecure are prejudiced if that were true the solution would lie entirely within the field of preventive psychiatry it would be an enormous burden for psychiatry but it would excuse the rest of the community unfortunately a degree of prejudice can be taught easily to all except those who are thoroughly trustful and loving a tragic example is the apartheid movement in south africa in which political leaders have convinced a majority of the electorate without valid evidence or provocation that they are so threatened that they must enact harshly discriminatory laws against negroes and asians this campaign of fear and hostility is creating of course the corresponding feelings in those who are attacked thus the political majority has made itself sick with suspicion and is inviting its own destruction babies and small children may be temporarily frightened by someone who appears strangein pigmentation or garb or manner or tone of voice but they sooner or later come to trust anyone who is sympathetic and affectionate by four and five they are interested in their parents ideas about the world and sensitive to their parents feelings about individual people but they are not so ready for generalizations and rationalizations that they can be said to have fixed prejudices more important in regard to their future is whether they have learned to trust their parents consistent love and through this to trust other people generally and themselves for the specific teaching of tolerance or intolerance i think that the early school years are particularly important at this age the child by his very nature is easily able to be pushed in either direction he is seriously interested in what the outside worldof contemporaries and adultsconsiders right and wrong he feels the obligation to channel his aggression within socially acceptable limits he wants to be a member of the right group and to conform to its pattern hes ready to disapprove of wrong individuals and groups if he spends these years with friends and adults who have common prejudices he takes these to be not only permissible but noble hes proud to be included as a soldier on what he assumes is the righteous side but if his parents and particularly his teacher whom he now considers a higher authority than parents take advantage of the occasions provided by books the news the neighborhood the classroom itself they can teach tolerance instead they can agree with him that everyone has personal likes and dislikes most of which hes entitled to they can show him that every racial religious and nationality group has produced benefactors scoundrels and everything in between they can point out that the very same groups which are looked down on in one country are well accepted in another they should explain with regret that prejudices are held in all parts of the country and that much of the undesirable behavior of certain members of groups for which the whole group is blamed are fostered by the discrimination they suffer they can demonstrate by all kinds of examples that acceptance brings out the best in everyone when children are taught tolerance they do not merely accept it grudgingly they respond to it and practice it with enthusiasm because it appeals to their straightforward sense of right i know because ive seen it happen in families and in good schools by robert d twiggs it is like searching for the one woman with j whom jesus christ had an illicit love affair i thought as i gazed dejectively at the hundreds of pages of worn wrinkled documents and manuscripts on the table before me it just isnt there and yet what i was looking for had to be there there was so much hidden in between those pages during the previous two years of agonizing days and sleepless nights i had read the words in those documents ten thousand times over i had long since come to the conclusion that it was what those words did not say that i had to find it was what no written documents revealed that i had to discover thirteen of us sat around the long mahogany table in the lobby of the theater at the university of iowa that warm day in late spring ten years ago we were the members of the playwrighting seminar analyzing and discussing each others plays hoping that through such discourse each member would derive some particle of constructive criticism to aide him in the writing of his respective play my play was on the agenda for that particular discussion i had selected to write about the wellknown and very eccentric scientist george washington carver the peanut wizard of tuskegee institute in alabama it is a matter of record that george washington carver was a great scientist and discovered hundreds of useful products what is not yet known is the scope and significance of dr carvers chief discovery that is what it took me ten years to find that one hidden discovery out of the hundreds that was his most important most useful contribution to humanity evidence of its existence was well known my job was to isolate it and bring it out of its hiding place into the open where it could be used and applied by the civilization to which it had been given as indiscriminately as every other thing that carver discovered what has not yet been revealed to the american public and to the world at large is that scientist carver spent many years over the test tube and in the fields to discover a cure for one of the worst and most insidious diseases that ever plagued mankind the more i searched into the life and works of this great man this freak of society by analogy to our present day expectations who made his services available to anyone for the mere asking and gave over sixty billion dollars in talent to the world for free the more difficult it became to isolate that one discovery that accounted for his greatness i pondered the facts as they presented themselves to me there has to be some contribution to society that affects the life of every single human to one degree or another after all isnt that the only means of determining true and lasting greatness it is easy to locate in a pasteur or a curie it is far more difficult to point out in a carver since contrary to the usual pattern carvers greatness preceded the knowledge of his most important discovery it was that very factor however that gave me to know in the beginning that the discovery was existent but hidden i knew too that until it was found that everything that george washington carver ever did would be in terms of historical achievement and lasting greatness limited to the realm of mediocrity this would indeed have been an error in history for if there is anything that george washington carver was not it is average the two hours that i had spent in seminar that evening had been as fruitless and trying as the many others in which carver was the subject of discussion we had analyzed his life and works but could not find a single discovery that was universally outstanding to the extent that it affected the life of each person individually we all agreed that there were hundreds of products of merit that had served a specific need during a particularly grave period in a given situation his discovery of a substitute for quinine from the hulls of peanuts to save the lives of the people around him who were dying of malaria because of the lack of quinine is a typical example but the one discovery that could unmistakably make life better and more tolerable for all humanity seemed to have been missing there were outstanding developments from soybeans milk that was as good as cows milk developed from peanuts to feed the starving young patented discoveries of new species of useful plants that had eluded the searching eyes and trained minds of scientists since the beginning of time there had been notable experiments conducted at the ford laboratory to add to the advancement of the automobile industry new methods of agriculture de veloped to give life back to the dying soil new shades of dyes and colors from sweet potatoes peanuts and worthless clay to enhance the beauty of gods universe and hundreds of others that were given to meet a specific need but that were never recorded but which was the greater trying to find that was like running headon into a stone wall and my head throbbed from each one of those sessions he carefully guarded each experiment in this discovery with total and reverent secrecy only he and his god were permitted that secret knowledge during his lifetime at the end of that discussion excepting the late e c mabie head of the drama and speech department at iowa i stood alone in believing that such a discovery existed the incredibility of carvers ventures of his life as he lived it and of his faith as a scientist in the supernatural was one of the more difficult obstacles that i had to overcome in my search i asked myself how could a man of science have had such faith in god to the extent that he claimed divine communication and supernatural guidance in making his scientific discoveries what did he mean when said god tells me what to do is the secret to be found there incredible sitting there in the theater lobby that day at the university of iowa i had no way of knowing then that before morning of the following day that i too would have had an experience so incredible that it would defy all reason as mans limited senses know reason upon leaving the theater seminar i had the horrible feeling of emptiness that one sometimes experiences when face to face with defeat i felt a strong need for complete relaxation some means of escape whereby i could forget the culminating failures of the past two years that had suddenly landed with one big blow several of us walked from the theater past the art building and along the bank of the iowa river which ran through the campus gently tossing its pale blue waters against the gray stone embankment the sunset hovered over the brink of the distant horizon of the west like a giant disc of dying embers the whole campus was alive with spring and the cool breeze off the waters felt good to my lungs we crossed the north bridge that spanned the river to the east campus and stopped at the iowa union for the usual cup of coffee with the club a heterogeneous group of males and females who discussed everything from einstein to burlesque it so happened that einstein had the floor right off and since too much carver in one day had already given me a momentarily strong aversion to science or scientists i enticed one of the fairer sex of the group to accompany me to the dance floor we understood each other at once she was intelligent beautiful and uninhibited and a little lonely two hours later we had found our own place of privacy on the grass under the stars the presence of her warmth in my arms relaxed me completely our lips met in a tremendous release of passions and i forgot all about carver and his great discovery i was glad to be alive at eleven oclock that night i was walking home alone i took the long walkway that ran up the gently sloping grade on the north side of the quadrangle dormitories a grove of trees stood tall and green on each side of the broad stone walkway near the top of the grade stood one giant tree that towered above the rest as if in guardianship over them there was nothing strange or eerie about the night i had no reason to suspect the unusual would happen it was certainly not the kind of night on which one would expect to see a ghost or in any way encounter the forces of the supernatural it was in fact a bright starlit night with not a cloud to be seen and the wind blew so mildly that it would scarcely have swayed a falling feather from its course as i walked slowly up the grade thinking about the wonderful time i had had with my date that evening i had a feeling of peaceful exhilaration she had been good for me being with her had cleared the confusion from my mind now i could think clearly again i mused there was only one thing to be done now and i would do that yes i would give up this preposterous search that was the only sensible thing to do this carver fellow didnt make any sense anyway talking to plants and getting answers from them and all of that god speaking to him and telling him what to do no it just could not have happened for the first time in two years i had actually thought out my real reason for failure without realizing it i was to learn ten years later that the real failure was in my not being able to believe and accept the facts that i had already found i had rationalized carver clear out of my mind i thought again on the pleasantries of the evening as i walked along in the night i had come to near the top of the grade and was walking under the huge branches of the giant tree when a very strange thing happened suddenly for no apparent reason at all i had a very strong impulse to run quickly it is a ridiculous thing to do without reason but without question or thought i ran as fast as i could the only sound to be heard in the stillness of the night was the sound of my running feet against the stone walk soon i stopped running and started walking at a slow pace again while laughing at myself for being so silly then as suddenly as the impulse had struck me came the fierce cracking sound from the sky above my head fol lowed by a thunderous crashing of the giant tree to the stone pavement i had run just far enough to escape by inches the path of its sprawling branches it had split almost in half the next morning i returned to the scene of that incredible experience to examine that tree i was even more amazed to discover that there were no old cracks or lacerations in the wood the place where the tree had split was fresh and green this indicated that the tree had split instantaneously that nightafter i had run clear of the place where it was to land it was then that i began to understand the credibility of the methods and objectives of george washington carver which had until then seemed absolutely incredible i still was not able to isolate his most important discovery at that time but my experience of having received an inner revelation of an impending danger through a sense about which science has no knowledge consequently a sense to which science gives no credit gave me to know that carver had in fact received messages from plant life that god had told him what to do through some sense other than the five known senses of man these unknown senses which science is now beginning to believe that we all possess but may not recognize must have been very highly developed in carver after leaving the university of iowa with a masters degree in speech and drama i continued my search for carvers most important discovery ten years of searching the written records a visit to tuskegee institute and the carver museum and the interviewing of scores of persons who knew him during his lifetime has led me to the conclusion that the many individual discoveries that george washington carver made and gave unselfishly to the world were actually only sequential experiments in an objective progression to his one great discovery which because of its seemingly incredibility could not be revealed during his lifetime likewise because of its very nature it demanded his life in order to be successful beyond doubt his death marked the completion and success of his great discovery of a cure for one of the worst and most insidious diseases of mankindgreed he had made himself a lifelong guinea pig to discover a cure for mans greed it had been an incredible undertaking which demanded the existence of an incredible life not even the most skeptical can deny that george washington carvers great discovery has been successfully tested and proved at least once by george washington carver himself how long it will take humanity to reach the critical stages of the disease of greed when at such time it will have no alternative for its own salvation but to make use of carvers cure is open to speculation is it not possible to start making application of carvers cure to some degree on a domestic and world level now would it not be of national and human interest for parents and schools to provide their children with the knowledge of the existence of carvers cure would this not provide the world with the needed incentive to obtain the peace and harmony that heretofore only the immortal gods have claimed possible is not the very fact that carver was a mortal in our own time the key to the value of his cure or must we wait until the united states and russia land side by side in another world to make use of the cure or will it be after those incredible unknown senses reach full maturity in man only time can tell the one thing that is now certain however is that whenever the world becomes receptive to carvers cure it will be a much better world in which to live the time for first application is now the world should have one holiday in common as a first step in applying carvers cure i prescribe that the world set aside and observe a george washington carver day this would be one holiday that both communists and capitalists alike could celebrate together some may prefer calling my strange experience precognition but i agree with george washington carver in calling it god a blueprint for real freedom we are at war today the battle lines ww j are clearly drawn laos south africa iran east germany the american hemispherewherever communism and those powers representing western civilization meet there the lines exist the worlds battle lines run right through the heart of cleveland and you and i are involved our sector is a small one but its issues are the fundamental ones people are deciding on everywhere the issues of mans worth and dignity the system of government under which he can best realize this dignity the kind of society which will give him the opportunity to grow lets examine one of these issues in detail racial discrimination its battle line circles the globe from clevelands hough to new yorks harlem from london to johannesburg to bombay to singapore the line runs and on opposing sides communism and the western world face each other in the struggle for mens allegiance you and i are in this struggle whether we choose to be or not we must win it not halfway around the world but here in our small sector of cleveland what is the situation in cold blunt facts were failing our responsibilities to the negro in cleveland or to put it more directly we as americans are failing other americans simply because of racial bias they have been segregated in ghettos and told in effect stay where you are dont move into white neighborhoods they have not been provided with adequate educational opportunities they have been guaranteed an inferior standard of living through discriminatory employment practicespractices in which management and labor unions share equal blame it is not a pretty picture and it has been going on for a long time world war i marked the beginning of the problem war plants needed workers so industrial agents were sent into the south to hire negroes they came to cleveland in carloads many of them with only the clothes they were wearing bound for what agents had painted as a promised land what they found was a city with substandard housing facilities for them a city with little understanding of their problems and little disposition to care a city whose limited social agencies were unable to handle their problems families began doubling up crowding in on each other the slums began by within a year period clevelands negro population had risen to and with the beginning of world war ii the process started all over again war plants needing labor negro labor migrating up from the south inadequate provision to care for them and the spread of slum areas in the heart of the city in years later the nonwhite population in cuyahoga county was in an increase of per cent the negro today represents per cent of the total county population about per cent of the city population by as a conservative estimate it will reach around per cent this in brief is the story of how the negro came here and why what has he found lets examine this from three standpoints environment education and employment from the standpoint of environ ment the negro has found a ghetto not the walled ghetto that existed in poland during the war but the american kind the ghetto bounded by invisible walls of race prejudice he is segregated here as surely as if he lived in memphis or macon or little rock under law of course he is not segregated he is as free as his white neighbor to move about and settle where he pleases but he doesnt the walls of prejudice are high when a negro moves into a white neighborhood he usually pays higher rent and buys his home at a higher price he lives quite often within a silent enemy encampment the price of acceptance comes high so high in fact that the majority of negroes prefer to live within the invisible walls of their ghettos the kinsman area mt pleasant glenville hough and central these areas all look the same dwellings that range from frame houses to suite apartments small lots narrow alleys occasional junkfilled vacant lots most of the dwellings are old and substandard as to facilities many are pestholes and firetraps privacy is the exception overcrowding the rule we in cleveland have done as much if not more than any other city in the nation in our approach to slum clearance relocation and urban renewal we have a right to be proud but the slum is still with us so is the big question what are we going to do about it from the standpoint of environment the negro has found a slum from the standpoint of education he has found a school system which as yet has been unable to meet his problems a cleveland newspaperman put his finger on it a few years ago eleventh grade dixie style he said is eighth grade or lower here this means that when a negro student from the south enters our public school system we have two alternatives we can put him among students of the same educational level or we can place him among students of his own age if we go by educational standards we force a or yearold negro to fit into the highly immature social pattern of and yearolds if we put the student in his own age and classroom group where he is the slowest member the entire class is slowed to his pace the answer to this of course is special remedial classes for the migrant negrobut we have failed to provide them instead we forced an added burden of teaching upon the schools and a cruel burden of learning upon students trying to keep up but unable to do so as a result the number of negro dropouts from high schoolor grade school for that matteris dispro portionately higher than that of whites and because of overcrowded school conditions little effort is made to encourage them to return the result a growing army of unemployed youth ages no job to work at no school to attend one strike against them because of their color another because they lack a high school diploma as for college education despite the fac hat we have many fine higher educational plants here in cuyahoga county one percent of the students are negro although negroes account for per cent of the countys population our churches have failed the negro too and by our i mean both negro and white churches in cleveland as a protestant im sorry to say that protestant denominations are most to blame unlike the roman catholic church which took care of its own the great wave of catholic european immigrants to cleveland the protestant churches have largely ignored the southern negro as the white parishioners move to the suburbs the church moves with them and the methodist and baptist successors from the south are left on their own the result churches in abandoned store fronts an inadequately trained ministry an unfinanced church organization and a shallow religious life which fails to meet the deeply spiritual needs of the negro there are of course a few magnificent exceptions from the third major standpoint that of employment the negro has been the victim of discrimination in a peculiarly subtle form he has not been denied work he has simply been denied the opportunity to work at jobs for which he is qualified both by skill and education i think we may as well face a few hard facts about this in our job market today the negro is still the last to be hired and the first to be fired despite qualifications for higherlevel jobs he is for the most part accepted only for unskilled and semiskilled jobs a negro competing with a white man for a professional managerial technical or responsible clerical job hasnt a chanceunless he is dealing with a company which makes a point of nondiscrimination in employment procedures thus the negro is doomed by prejudice and by lack of educational opportunities to accept the lowerskilled jobs the kind hardest hit in a recession the result inequalities of earning power and widespread unemployment average annual income of a negro family for example is that of an average white family and when unemployment strikes economic hardship follows a similar pattern in for example percent of the white labor force was unemployed at the same time negro unemployment was up to percent as with housing and education however the employment picture is not entirely dark we have made slow but steady progress over the past quartercentury in providing more negroes with job opportunities in industry weve whittled away at the barriers of discriminatory practices but management and labor alike have a long way to go before racial democracy exists in their ranks this is the negro situation today in cleveland what are the effects of such a situation you can sum it up in one word waste waste of people waste of dollars waste of a way of life waste of people look at the situation a moment today america needs to use every available resource it has in its tremendous struggle against worldwide communism yet were neglecting the negro were failing to qualify onetenth of our total population to join fully in this competitive effort even to support himself and this is waste waste of people we definitely need all of us are very prone to speak of what were doing for the negro weve reached a point where wed better start thinking what can the negro do for us translate this waste of people into economics and the cost becomes impressive nationally our economy produces around billion a year ten per cent of the people engaged in that production are operating at about halflevel in terms of annual income because negro annual income is about half that of white butif that per cent could be brought up to full operating level it would mean a billion increase in our gross national product in years from now a billion increase examined from the marketing angle waste also exists the negro race today has a purchasing power of billion if that could be doubled another billion would be added to the nations purchasing power and this is a home market were spending millions abroad cultivating foreign markets yet here at home is a market of million negroes more people than there are in canada more than in norway sweden and denmark combined almost as many as in belgium and the netherlands combined indeed if we should merely reduce negro unemployment to the same level as white unemployment negro purchasing power could be increased two or three billion dollars annually on the local level the cost of prejudice is also high were wasting human skills and services that could contribute to the economic health of the area were wasting a large segment of potential purchasing power and were paying for this wasteout of our pockets in tax dollars the reason is the slum it devours health and welfare dollars in for example cuyahoga county paid out over million in health and welfare costs the negro race constituting only per cent of the population received per cent to per cent of that money the slum breeds crime it can do nothing else for overcrowding creates antagonisms deprivation leads to theft it is not surprising therefore that between per cent and per cent of major crimes are committed by negroes but this has nothing to do with race according to a statement made by a high cleveland police official some years ago if the same number of whites were crowded into the negro areas crime results might be the same environment is the villain here and because it exists we pay thousands of dollars annually for increased police protection and related costs the slum moreover is a drain on the citys entire economic life according to a study made by the american bar association slum sections of city yield only about per cent of its total tax receipts but they absorb about per cent of the total cost of services so racial discrimination results in waste of people waste of tax dollars waste of a potential market waste of a citys economic health it results also in disillusionment with a way of life look at the world for a moment through the negros eyes around him a slum beyond that the intangible walls of racial prejudice he knows what is happening in the south he looks beyond the oceans and he sees on all continents the same churning racial problem called by different names and he wonders about words like freedom and democracy which promise one thing but deliver another the negro looks out across the world and says under years of free enterprise government i have made little progress colored peoples elsewhere in the world have made as much progress and perhaps more under strong centralized government in a far shorter period of time is democracy worth it and sometimes in his heart the answer is no this is waste of another kind for loss of faith and inability to believe in the american dream mean a wasted capacity for responsible citizenship this disillusionment has had two important results first the negro is becoming biggovernment oriented since most of his social gains have come through the federal government instead of through local agencies and governments he turns naturally to the federal government for help this is understandable but it is also a dangerous factor in what is already a pronounced drift toward socialismor big statism the second result of the negros disillusionment is that he realizes in order to gain the equality denied him he must fight for it and his most powerful weapons are the economic boycott and bloc voting if a company is unwilling to give equal opportunities to negroes says the negro it must pay the price of losing its negro customers this is the economic boycott when issues arise which affect his own interests the negro has learned to vote in an organized manner this is bloc voting both bloc and blockade are powerful weapons both are legitimate and if we had met our responsibilities to the negro as we should have done in the past there would be no need to use them now they are forces to be reckoned with the logical question now i think is what can we do about the negro situation what can you and i do as individuals to alleviate and correct these problems there are three things we must do we must first take the trouble to understand the problems we must then evolve workable solutions and finally we must bend all our efforts toward achieving these solutions reprinted by permission from the cleveland plain dealer by marie snow igger nigger this scornful expression followed the blueeyed blonde child down the street from the allwhite school she was of english irish descent caucasian in appear ance but the child was not socially acceptable to the white families of this small town in central mississippi her parents had expressed sympathy with the unfortunate plight of the negro racethe poverty the humiliation the utter hopelessness of their lives this white family had spoken out had dared to be counted with the few who felt this oppression should end they had paid dearly for their courage their schoolage child had steadily lost friends had been dropped by the better families of this old old town had been called names in school since it was learned that her parents were niggerlovers this was a timeless expression a term attached to any who showed sympathy for the colored race another white man welleducated a tenyear resident in the community felt he could no longer be silent he spoke up against racial discrimination the man was in business for himself his world suddenly turned upside down his employees were called names by former friends they were asked do you work for that soandso niggerlover you must be hard up for a living this businessman who spoke just once for right and freedom was harrassed by phone calls night and day by radical racehaters who called him names who shouted obscene words to his wife and daughter if they answered the phone the phone calls reached his brother who was listed under a dif ferent number they reached his mother who lived at another address under a different name this harrassment went on for three days then it quit the man was defeated subdued he had learned too well the price to be paid for freedom of speech in another small community two neighbors lived sidebyside for three years they had had doorstep discussions of religion economics politics then the newspapers printed the shocking news that a grade school in another state had been integrated one man mentioned this to his neighbor he was obviously agitated deeply disturbed almost obsessed with the problems that this could bring to his own state the other man tried to calm him by saying soothingly well it has to come some day it may not be so bad the same people who try to suppress the colored man would suppress the white man too if given the right opportunities the disturbed man bounced to his feet his face reddened with fury he puffed for breath struck his neighbor and knocked the startled man to his knees with one fanatical blow as the astonished man stood to his feet the erratic neighbor ran into his own house shouting you get off my property if youre here when i come back with my gun ill blow your head off the sensible man although stunned at the turn of events left the yard because he knew that most white southerners kept a loaded gun in the house to protect my family lack of personal freedom has been a source of annoyance to one liberalminded man this white retired minister sometimes assisted the sketchilyeducated negro pastors in organizing childrens services townspeople in the small community felt this assistance could develop into trouble and kept close watch on the minister the license numbers of white friends who parked their cars in his driveway were written down and checked against files in the county records to identify the owners of the cars then a selfappointed watchdog of the state would visit the car owners in their own homes warn them that the minister was there to cause strife accuse him of being communistic and warn the car owners that it would be wise if they no longer associated with such a person one individual became angry but later joined the many who succumbed to disapproval and avoided the minister in the future certain churchmen and women are concerned with the ignorance between the two races they realize that the southerner doesnt really know the black man the caucasian may know the janitor in his place of business the storekeeper knows his stock boy during working hours but he knows nothing of the boys attitudes and opinions of the white race that he accumulates in the process of growing up the white housewife may know very little of the personal life of her domestic servant by comparison the colored domestic servant knows everything about the white family from overhearing conversations she knows something of their economic standing in the community the maid may be a sounding board for the frustrated housewife the servant may sooth give cautious advice sympathize but she is never to mention her own personal problems it is untidy of her to do so not the best etiquette and it is rarely ever done because the white race has only a stereotyped picture of the negro race and because the average negro is afforded an even more limited view of the white race certain uplifting individuals may seek to form an interracial nonaction group to meet regularly to discuss the problems the differences the likenesses and goals of both races if this group is discovered by the public as one group recently was it produces unfavorable publicity social and economic hazards to many one such group met in a church although not sponsored by the church itself and brought embarrassment to the pastor dissension among church members and criticism from other sources for this reason only a courageous pastor can be broad minded toward racial issues many white pastors and their churches are cool toward anyone who is liberal in his thinking concerning racial issues to be other than cool or even polite to such a person may create a real problem for the pastor because of this situation the pastors feel they cannot preach the entire truth in this socalled bible belt to preach that love of god results in love of ones fellow man to preach brotherhood of man is an anathema all too feared and consequently avoided by the white clergy on the other hand some ministers are sold out to a racist religion they proclaim it is against gods will that the negro be treated as a member of the human race a generation ago some white ministers preached that the black man had no soul was akin to the lower animals therefore could not respond to a spiritual ministry now in this present generation it is more popular to preach that god made the black man a servant to the remainder of the human race they seek to prove their theories from the bible because this is the bible belt this belt is noted for its many churches its much churchgoing its insistence on having the bible read in the public schools this state votes a dry ticket insists on prohibition at the encouragement of the many outspoken pastors its ministers preach long and often on the evils of liquor but say nothing about the evils of hatred and the sin of violence against ones fellow man that would be meddling in affairs that do not concern the church often the pastors of this state are leaders in community affairs they spark drives for this and that things that better the community but if they teach brotherly love it is a vague reference to some brother far away preferably overseas it is uncomfortable to speak of brotherly loveunfashionable unpopularin this day of racial conflict it could cause the honored pastor to lose his church in this community and prevent him from getting a church in any other community in the entire state there are many minor evils that a pastor can speak out against and still remain a popular fellow consequently he speaks on them pastors feel that they should not interfere with things outside the church they just want to serve their congregations and watch them prosper yet somehow a certain percentage of pastors belong to the white citizens council a radical pressure group that believes in white supremacy more than it believes in religion the pastor can attend the hate campaigns can even be a leader in the local chapter without searing his conscience in this famous bible belt white pressure groups find it easy to recruit new members and hold old members they create fear in the heart of the white man if he does not keep the colored man in his place he is taught to fear amalgamation of the races social mixing and intermarriage are readily connected with the term integration integration is a hated word it is used as a whip over ordinarily logical citizens of the state of mississippi if a politician wants to be elected he becomes a segregationist he cannot be a moderate the ordinary segregationist wont be elected the segregationist must speak often of protecting our families against the present crisisthe threat of the negro who wants to marry a white woman and rear children of mixed bloodchildren who will eventually cause an amalgamated race of people the implication of mixing the pure blood of the lovely blueeyed blonde southern woman with that of an african causes the most stoic southerner to shiver to point out that few negroes are seemingly attracted to white women that a vast percentage prefer negro women is not logical to the fearful white man why shouldnt the negro want to cross the color line when he the white man has often crossed the color line to seek sexual satisfaction if negro women are desired by certain ignorant immoral white men it is logical to this same depraved person that white women are desired by the colored man knowing his own heart is the thing that causes this terrible fear in the white man when socrates the ancient greek philosopher said know thyself he might have added for mississippi posterity to thine own self be true who pays for the immorality of the white man when he crosses the color line for sexual satisfaction does it bring reproach on him and where is the proof that the white man is crossing the line the proof is in the illegitimate babies born to young colored girls girls with dark skinfrom families of blackskinned peoplewho produce lightskinned babies fifty percent white blood can produce a light baby that is a misfit in a family of dark children the following is a classic example in one rural community a farmer saw a couple meeting secretly in the woods days after day he noticed them particularly since the man was white and the young girl was colored integration between the races is against the state law integration in any form is strictly opposedexcept in the boudoir the colored girl who was orphaned and lived only with two brothers and a sister in their late teens or early twenties became obviously pregnant this girl had no prenatal care it was offered free at the local health centermonthly examinations and vitaminsbut the girl was fearful of the white nurses and ashamed of her condition there was the terrible fear that white women would somehow suspect that a white man had been involved in this and she knew that she would be considered the guilty party she couldnt obtain work for these same reasons and the brothers and sister in the home had scarcely enough to feed everyone there was no money for a layette the baby was bom delivered by a partiallytrained colored midwife who offered no sedation she performed this service on credit for to be paid in small amounts whenever possible there was not one garment in the house to clothe the skinny squealing infant with the strangely light skin no layette had been prepared not one diaper had been purchased during the lengthy time of confinement the midwife did the expedient thing she removed the pillow from the head of the exhausted young mother ripped off the frayed pillow case and made two diapers then the baby was tucked under a corner of the single quilt that covered the bed he was ready to face a harsh new world what of the white neighbors when they realized this reproach against their community had been delivered ugly rumors began to fly each white wife looked at her own comfortable home her pretty mannerly children and fearing for them fought back she told her husband that she would personally go down there and get one good look at that baby im going to see who he looks like no one is sure how the various white husbands in the community reacted but word somehow reached the young colored mother in terrible fear for her own safety and that of her child she lifted herself from her bed wrapped the infant in a borrowed crib blanket and fled the state by bus chicago is a big city and the orphaned girl had a distant relative there no one has stated who gave her money to buy a bus ticket but everyone knows that her own brothers and sister were too poor to even purchase a dozen diapers for the baby there are other social problems in this state perhaps not as shocking but real problems nevertheless to those involved a white college professor who is a single woman on the faculty of a negro college with an integrated teaching staff recently complained i have no place to entertain my friends i work with other professors often they too are single women like myself with one exception they are colored where can two or three of us go offcampus to eat in a nice restaurant how can we attend the theater and be seated together these other ladies are cultured refined sensitive to embarrassment where can we go in this state without facing the humiliation of prejudice and discrimination it is just too limiting recently this same college professor received correspondence from a local bank where she had just opened an account the letter was addressed to her without the usual title of miss ann smith it simply read ann smith upon opening the letter she discovered that the salutation read the same not dear miss smith but simply the casual greeting dear ann baffled and angered with this familiarity she began to think through this strange circumstance finally it occurred to her that since she taught in a segregated college and lived oncampus the bank had assumed that she was a colored person in the state of mississippi negroes are never given the dignity of such titles as miss mr or mrs whether in correspondence or in newsprint regardless of age marital status standing in the community or education the colored person is referred to simply by first and last name this college professor decided on a course of action she wrote to the bank and inquired of their policy in addressing her fellowteachers who were negroes pointing out that it was distasteful to her to learn she might have been afforded a courtesy that was denied her colleagues if this were their usual policy she asked that they close her account the bank without any reference to her unusual statements followed her instructions common courtesies are daily denied the negro on the street the young man or woman may be addressed as boy or girl and the older person with grey hair may be called uncle or auntie by members of the white race but they are never called mr or mrs when two white men meet an elderly colored man and inquired directions of him calling him uncle he spunkily replied smiling i didnt know we was kin the deep south and particularly the state of mississippi lives behind a blackandwhite curtain if it creates certain problems for the moderate white southernerwhat does it do for the negro who must live with it day after day year in and year out generation after generation how does it affect his personality shape his ideals limit his hopes and dreams it produces a new form of slavery when actual slavery was abolished even the southern gentleman admitted that he had found a more profitable method of farming it was share cropping under this system today the landlord gets onethird of the crop and pays onethird of the expenses the tenant usually a negro agrees to raise the crop receives twothirds of the profit and pays twothirds of the expenses he also is given the use of a house usually a badly deteriorated threeroom shack that has never known a coat of paint during certain seasons of the year the landlord loans per month toward living expenses for a family of or persons this money is loaned at per cent interest and it is deducted from the profit when the crop is sold late in the fall there is no source of income in the winter when no work is is being done in the fields if an emergency arises during the year such as a serious illness the landlord may loan extra money at the same interest in a bad crop year the tenant may find he not only made nothing but that he owes money to the landlord this means he is forced to stay on the property whether or not the relationship has been satisfactory because the negro family lives on his property the white landlord often feels that he owns the negroes body and soul if they attend a colored church where the pastor holds some radical views or is a member of the national association for the advancement of colored people the white landlords in that vicinity may warn their people to get rid of that troublemaker or if that fails they may warn the individual tenants to quit attending that church they may be frightened into obeying if all else fails and the indignation of the white landlords is sufficiently aroused the local sheriff may lend assistance a recent case involved a negro pastor who spoke out against popular opinion in a public school for negro children what he said was not too unusual in itself the negro community wanted something for their schoola gymnasium that seemed unnecessary to the surrounding white community to quiet the unrest some colored person had to be made the scapegoat the negro pastor was the victim he was arrested for whitecapping according to websters dictionary whitecapping means a member of a selfappointed vigilance committee attempting by lynchlaw methods to drive away or coerce persons obnoxious to it the white community found this a very effective method in settling the negro communityon the surface at least after the pastor had paid a heavy fine he was released and nothing more was said on the matter one landlord knew that his colored tenants wife worked in white homes the year round to supplement the family income he had no objections until he realized one family that employed her was very liberal in their views concerning the racial situation upon learning this he demanded that she no longer work for this family although she needed the extra money to feed her large family of fourteen members often a tenant farmer will suspect the landlord of cheating him on the crop but he dares not mention it the landlord keeps the books the tenant is considered too poorly educated to handle the task or perhaps not sufficiently honest to accept the joint responsibility so it is the landlord alone who keeps books at the years end after the harvest the negro is simply told the amount that he owes the landlord it would be presumptious of the tenant to ask to see the books thus he is obliged to stay on the property for another year and work off the debt in good crop years when it is obvious that everyone is making money the tenant may be told that he has earned profit for the years workwork which involved the tenant his wife and a number of children who worked in the fields month after month for the loans given widowed women may find life hard at the end of the year if one is told that she made no money but that she owes the landlord she may feel cheated this was the plight of one widow but she was afraid to move finally she managed to move her few belongings and halfgrown children at night under the cover of darkness with the assistance of a relative and his battered pickup truck her landlord resented losing a hardworking gullible family he located their new residence accused her of stealing the electric wiring from the old shack and asked her to pay to cover this theft the woman denied the theft and further pointed out that the wiring in the house could scarcely have been valued at and was not worth the risk to her the angry landlord finally brought a constable who had no legal papers he warned that she would have to pay the debt or go to jail finally in fear she consulted a lawyer who only advised her to pay he told her that a court battle was useless loaned her the money and suggested that her son work for him at low wages after school hours to repay the debt another widow found it necessary to harvest the crop with the help of her very young family the and yearold girl and boy worked beside her in the field and the sevenyearold boy was nursemaid at home for four younger children this family of children enrolled in school in the middle of november when the crop was finished because of overcrowded conditions and the late enrollment the oldest boy attended the fifth grade for the remainder of the year without any textbooks the colored school simply had no books to give him in their separate but equal schools across town the white school had books to sparenew books as well as secondhand books for fifth graders in a county in central mississippi where the colored children far outnumber the whites only secondhand school busses are used by the colored schools if new busses are purchased they are given to the white schools because the white man is carrying the heaviest burden of taxation the negro schools accept the secondhand busses and try to keep them in repair it is difficult because they are overloaded busses designed to carry to children are sometimes packed with to children daily some busses run two routes which means that very young children must necessarily arise early be dressed and ready to catch the bus by am because too of the double route or the long route these same children may arrive home as late as pm if the bus breaks down which often happens there is a further delay one mother of a firstgrade child said when bonnie gets home from school shes too sleepy to eat supper she naps then gets up and eats i dont see how she can wait when she aint had no lunch in mississippi the oftennew modem negro schools offer a hot lunch at cents per child town parents who are employed may pay for this and the welfare helps some families with lunches many rural families who are share cropping and sending five or six children to school can illafford to buy hot lunches some send a cold biscuit and homemade butterrarely ever meatbut the great majority of the young children and rapidlygrowing teenagers must skip lunch the negro school teachers are paid less than the white teachers though the negro teacher may have a better education it is common for both husband and wife to teach in order to have better housing music lessons for their children and the other things that are important to those who are lifting themselves by their bootstraps because the teachers have had education and its accompanying taste of culture it is impossible for them to live under slum conditions such as their pupils may have to do a negro school teacher may discover a colored family in desperate need where the children are unable to attend school this family may be referred to the welfare but action is often slow if a white man recommends a colored family they will be eligible for assistance often a white storekeeper will recommend a widow and her large family with the understanding that they are to buy at his little store if the family fails to shop with him even though the goods may be overpriced or the credit books carelessly kept the negroes dare not complain in several cases storekeepers have shortchanged a family in cashing welfare checks one such merchant covered up by presenting the widow who protested with several bills one of which was obviously a duplicate of the other one elderly negro woman whose husband was an invalid applied for assistance through the local welfare office the welfare worker arrived at her home studied the needs of the couple and agreed that they could have welfare assistance on one condition that condition was that they would agree to pay a month for the first five months upon receiving the aid the total of was to be paid to the welfare worker who recommended aid another needy family reported this same knotty problem to a white friend this colored family had also been asked by the welfare worker to pay per month for six months in this case to the welfare worker when the family was urged by friends to report the welfare worker to the local authorities the colored family shrank back in fear a negro in mississippi rarely ever takes a case to court because he understands he will receive no justice regardless of circumstances he feels that he will pay his hardearned money to a lawyer for nothing this is particularly true if a negro goes to court against a white person the white lawyers meet together out of court decide how they can best keep the nigger in his place and still collect a fee then the court goes through the motions of a trial once a white judge remarked to a crowded courtroom while the court was in session and a negro was on the witness stand i wouldnt believe any niggers testimony even if the niggers were lined up four deep for miles down the road in this area there is no equal justice under the law if a crime is committed against a white man or woman by a colored person the police go into action the case is promptly solved action brought in court and the harshest penalty possible under the law is imposed if circumstances are such that a white man has erred against a colored person justice moves very slowly if at all if the case is properly solved finally brought to court with a white jury the white man may be acquitted or given the lightest sentence possible since there are few colored voters in the state the jurors are inevitably white on the other hand if a black man commits a crime against his black brother the case may never get to court its just another dead negro you know how they are always drinking and fighting with razors what can you do with them is the attitude of the authorities in an area where illegitimacy is common due to poverty and overcrowding some conscientious mothers with herculean efforts strive to rear daughters with high moral standards the mothers feel that they work singlehanded without even the cooperation of the law officers if a young girl is frightened by the forced attentions of an immoral man the girls parents have no assurance of getting action by the police in fact rumors whether founded or unfounded run rife through the colored section of town the parents fear the police the negroes believe the police try to entice young girls into police cars at night and drive them to isolated areas there are rumors that it has happened but no one has the courageor the factsto bear out the cases the problem seems to be that the two races have no common grounds of understanding no means of communicating with each other no opportunity to air grievances and clear up misunderstandings in an atmosphere of common trust when a colored man breaks a law he fears capture by the police although suspected of a minor robbery he fears that he will be beaten and there are reports that it has happened he fears rumors that are spread of a hotbox where a closemouthed prisoner is put in solitary confinement until he is ready to confess to a crime he may or may not have committed this hotbox is a very narrow dark cell with no ventilation equipped with radiators that send the room temperature up up up although he may plead for water it is given only three times a day with a single piece of corn bread there the prisoner is kept for days until he is ready to confess the constant high temperature has caused dehydration and permanent impairment of vision according to medical doctors too many prisoners after being arrested frisked for weapons and handcuffed are later shot trying to escape the newspapers often either do not report the incident at all or give very few details whatever the circumstances the policeman involved is not investigated he is made a hero and the victims family is left to support itself with only bad memories of police officers who used abusive language with the woman and young girls in the home during the arrest after hearing of such incidents from friends it is not surprising that colored southerners fear all law officers there are other complaints one hardworking thrifty colored man objected to the white persons attitude concerning welfare assistance the whites put my people on welfare then complain about it my people dont want charity they want work they were born for work they were taught to work they love work finding work is not always easy for the colored man jobs that pay a living wage are difficult to find only jobs requiring unskilled labor are available and there are more applicants than jobs the heaviest work the dirtiest work with the longest working hours are the only kinds available still there are more workers than jobs if the job is made easier or the hours shorter or the pay better there are a number of whites waiting to take the job from the negro in some small towns in mississippi the mailmen delivered the mail on foot these jobs were held by colored men who did not object to the many miles walked over burning pavement in the hot sun they liked the pay then the government provided the mailmen with motor scooters or trucks and white men applied for and received these jobs discrimination takes on other forms vengeance raised its ugly head when a colored man tried to improve his lot in life one white man had two sources of income he was a city policeman and he owned a small farm outside the town he hired a colored man to drive a tractor and till the land the colored driver was underpaid although experienced for this type of work a construction company needed a tractor driver and the colored man was hired his former white employer was furious at losing a good driver he found a method of revenge when the colored man drove back to the smaller town to visit relatives his car was often stopped by the policemanthe very man who lost him as a tractor driver on the farm the negro was ticketed and fined for speeding not just once but on several occasions many city officials of the larger communities want the world to believe there is racial harmony between the two groups they speak in glowing terms for radio television and newspapers of the good feelings and understanding between the two races this causes resentment to flame in the hearts of the usually oppressed downtrodden meek negroes and a few of themin retaliationtry to use white facilities recently several teenage negroes sat on the benches at the jackson zoo and watched the monkeys at play police appeared and arrested them for disturbing the peace negroes in small groups are allowed to walk quietly through the zoo but the benches and water fountains are reserved for the use of the whites since that incident occurred the benches have been completely removed from the zoo to prevent further such occurrences if anything more bold than this is attempted the white authorities place the blame for such unrest on outsiders we southern folks know how to handle our niggers this serves as a warning to local negroes that they should not try to change the status quo most are afraid to try clyde kenard a yearold negro tried to register as a student in an allwhite college mississippi southern it was necessary for him to make an appointment with the president when kenard arrived to keep the appointment he discovered that police officers were there waiting to arrest him they found illegal whiskey under the seat of his car according to the officers and arrested him on that charge kenards friends stated that the young man never drank whiskey beer or anything stronger than soft drinks still later kenard was arrested and convicted for planning a theft he declared himself innocent the negro who actually stole the worth of chicken feed and who implicated kenard was given a fiveyear suspended sentence kenard was sentenced to seven years and this attemptedintegrationist is now serving his sentence there is a similar case of punishing the nonconformist jess brown a negro lawyer who handled the kenard case has since been arrested on a bad check charge in this state of small incomes and small bank accounts citizens often overdraw their accounts if a merchant is given a check that bounces he usually gives the person an opportunity to write another after depositing more money in the bank mr brown had traded with this merchant for years with a satisfactory relationship what caused the change of attitude was the merchant influenced by some other element intimidation is a common method of preventing outbreaks of violence several towns in mississippi have trained police dogs these dogs are used in the colored section of town police may hold a dog on the leash and walk through a crowded cafe on saturday night negroes have a natural fear of the white mans dog and the police are aware of this on one occasion police dogs were used to break up a peaceful demonstration the white crowd stood in one group and the colored in another the dogs were held on leashes in such a position that they could only reach the negro group and inflict injury on them on another occasion after a series of small night robberies a police dog was used in an attempt to track a thief when the dog followed the scent to a white mans house and walked up on the porch the police pulled the dog away and urged him to move on down the street a few doors to the colored section of town during the tension concerning the freedom riders police used the dogs to meet incoming busses in at least two cities in central mississippi there are very few colored registered voters because they must pass a complex literacy test each person must be able to understand and explain the constitution of mississippi the test is given by the circuit court clerk in several instances when white people registered and could not answer a ques tion concerning some article in the constitution the clerk either explained the answer cheerfully or gave them a simpler question when the person answering is colored he is not given any help if the clerk has been instructed to discourage colored voters thus pressured he may turn down intelligent people with highschool educations in one case the clerk refused to register a colored woman then observing that she was welldressed asked her means of income on learning that she was a public school teacher with a bachelors degree he replied curtly all right girl sign the register some negro ministers have attempted to register a few have succeeded but others have been discouraged they have been told that it was too late to register regardless of date or that the clerk had other duties and the negro should come back another day the ministers interpreted this as a form of intimidation and were defeated most negroes do not earn a living wage in mississippi the few professional middleclass negroes who do find they have escaped the problem of physical hunger and added a multitude of new problems vacations now possible present new humiliations the businessman whose family wants to take a trip while he is working feels uncertain about travel accommodations one successful insurance salesman told of having to wait in line to buy bus tickets for his wife and children there were segregated waiting lines the white line had to be completely eliminated before the tickets could be sold to the colored line it was a timeless custom the ticket agent held to the custom although the impatient bus driver urged and pleaded and finally swore at him to sell the colored man a ticket the welldressed colored woman and her two neat children waited in humiliation while the crowd stared after they were on the bus they had to find seats in the rear if they had traveled by car they would have bought food at the back doors of many restaurants if they had required motel accommodations these would have been few and far between colored families with two drivers present would have tried to drive straight through to their destination even though they could easily afford a motel and would prefer to stop for the night even vacations are no vacation for themno vacation from embarrassment and humiliation in many areas because of acute poverty the government offered surplus food called commodities to be distributed in destitute areas in the winter months after a bad crop failure this provided staple items such as flour corn meal powdered milk cheese butter and shortening this food was distributed each winter for a year or two in mississippi then suddenly a county stopped the practice when residents of this particular county inquired they were told that it depended on the elected supervisor of each beat or ward if the man felt voters in his ward did not want the needy families to have commodities he did not vote for it why wouldnt the predominantly white voters who elected him want this there were two answers given businessmen or farmers who wanted to hire cheap labor during the winter complained that the colored men wouldnt work for low wages when their bellies were full of commodities grocers complained that the giving of commodities to destitute families cut down on the profit of the local merchant therefore the hungry became hungrier colored mothers remarked often its hard to listen to a hungry baby cry hisself to sleep skinny toddlers learned to walk on crooked legs due to malnutrition school childrens lean frames entered newly erected modern buildings smelled the hot lunch cooking in the cafeteria knowing that they would not eat until they returned home six or eight hours later they were expected to learn under such circumstances to fill their minds with knowledge in appreciation for the nice buildings that the white taxpayers had given them physical oppression brings with it brutality intimidation a thwarting of understanding and interaction between the races by enslaving the negro the white man has enslaved himself he is himself in intellectual bondage even the idealistic college students who may be willing to change the old ways are not permitted that luxury and challenge of youth the white sovereignty commission is a pressure group similar to hitlers gestapo it is truly the watchdog of the state students have said that the commission hires a student in white colleges within the state to observe what is taught in the classroom for per month the student is expected to spy on professors students and school authorities and report on their attitudes and interests certain pressure can be brought to bear on a college that is nonconformist with the ideals of the old south recently statewide newspaper publicity was used against a student who was seeking a college office newspapers considered him too broadminded unfavorable newspaper publicity has frightened away speakers on planned programs also that might have set young people to thinking for themselves they are to be taught as their dads were taught and thus be good disciples of dear old mississippi standing for white supremacy there are some white people nativeborn mississippians cultured educated humanitarian who see the injustices within the state they would change them if they couldif they believed there were others who felt as they do and who would stand firm how is one good man to recognize an ally in a state that has no freedom of speech a terrible fear of reprisal if he opposes longheld customs and beliefs perhaps it is time for the humanitarian men and women of mississippi to stand up and be counted to risk loss of social prestige loss of income loss of popularity in order to change the circumstances before the hated outsiders force the issue great lady of opera leontyne price hapl gt pens to be an ameri can negro born in mississippi and this circumstance has added non musical elements of interest to her career these need not concern us the singers of the past for the most part also had modest origins think of caruso or emmy destinn for example what does concern us is her voice and what she does with it in that mysterious composite called an opera performance i heard price for the first time at the metropolitan in trovatore in the midst of the greablizzard of saturday afternoon february struggling through the polar wastes of the empty streets i reflected that i was likely to have the whole theater to myself not many would undergo this ordeal to get there but on arrival i found a seething mob a good part of which had no hope of getting into the soldout house from her first entrance price was mistress of the stage both vocally and dramatically and by the end of the afternoon i found myself wishing that poor old verdi who never could get a singer to do anything right had been alive to hear her performance she did not come to the metropolitan unprepared or unknown she had been singing in the leading opera theaters of the world but it was at the metropolitan that i heard her first thousands apparently felt as i did that what we were hearing and seeing verged on the impossible in view of her origins we could hardly believe that this ultraitalian and supremely verdian creation could be what she was i found myself being reminded of singers who had not been heard for decadesrosa raisa claudia muzio artists of my youthand then wondered as we all must whether memory plays tricks in such matters but then was not rosa raisa by birth a russian jewess and was she not also the most italian of artists on the operatic stage this kind of bewilderment befalls those who hear price for the first time and as i have suggested it comes from mundane considerations which properly speaking ought to make no difference in the five operas of her first engagement trovatore aida madame butterfly don giovanni and turandot price showed a versatility which is not in itself too unusual today there are other celebrated artists notably maria callas who range even more widely still from the ethereal floating high notes of the slave girl liu to the dramatic urgency of aida is quite a distance and the florid passages of leonora are not a bit like the classic ornamentation of donna anna vocally each of the five parts is utterly distinct from the others with price not only style but the very color of her voice seemed to change with the character as butterfly for example she achieved a childlike sound in some passages which made the character seem indeed less than sixteen years old particularly when butterfly speaks of her happiness each of the five personages was thus characterized by the voice alone in a manner which if we were speaking of painting we might describe as the brushwork of a master dramatic outbursts strong high notes and the like are not subject to this sort of characterpainting a high c is a high c and it would be difficult to guess at a character by the sound of it but the passages which hold the drama together the crucial passages which build characterare rarely written to reach extremes of vocal display nor can they easily be played upon as price plays upon them to build up in our aural imagination the personage the composer had in mind too often what the composer had in mind during his long solitary labor is not at all what we see and hear on the opera stage and almost every composer has said so price seems to compose each character from the inside out so that a living being comes into existence through the music she sings what is written in the score and she is uncannily accurate about it her versatility is qualitative not quantitative and depends not so much on the number of different things she does as on how she does them it is that rare thing actingthroughthevoice and it is essential to an opera singer of real grandeur price also has the other kind of acting talent which is the ability to express dramatic situations or emotions by means of the body however valuable this seems to me a secondary attribute for a great opera singer most of our opera theatres are too big for subtlety or suggestion thirty years ago we were told that mme lotte lehmann exaggerated in the first act of die walkure when she pointed out with a majestically extended arm the magic sword which siegmund was to draw forth from the tree in orthodox wagnerism she should have indicated it by a look how many persons in the metropolitan opera house would have known what she was doing if she had indicated the sword by a look nothing less than a broad gesture enables the whole audience to understand what is going on at that point this is the problem of all acting in opera it must be broad strong and obvious or most of the audience cannot see it miss price had theater experience before she sang opera notably in the revival of porgy and bess which traveled all over the world something of the technique of smaller theaters has remained in her consciousness she is capable of very effective details of look and gesture which may not be altogether visible from the gallery her butterfly is full of these small touches even her aida although on the grand scale has them she thanks radames with her eyes for having demanded the freedom of the captives her friends and relatives even if each detail is not perceived by everyone these small effects accumulated give a consistent impression of the character she builds her art penetrates the vastness of the metropolitan mainly by its coherence in the larger lines in the main intention thus it is precisely in the absence of movement the classic stillnessthat her donna anna makes its most profound visual effect except in the struggle with don giovanni at the very beginning price hardly moves during the opera she walks a little at the festa and uses her arms when she is demanding that don ottavio avenge her fathers murder otherwise she seems generally still still still she is always intent she is singleminded not a finger moves she does not frown or smile above all she does not grimace she is living for one thing only revenge yet there is a hope at least of joy but it shows only in the voice the metropolitan has seldom been privileged to offer its stage to a performance of such austerity and beauty on a quite different scale her butterfly is as revealing as her donna anna she condenses her body into a small space her movements into the pervasive ballet of the geisha her feet and hands and arms into a style that almost suggests a person confined in a straitjacket her very head into a different physical and therefore psychological relationship to the world she becomes a japanese child bride of about with a candid willingness even eagerness for the act of love the high dflat at the end of the first act is rapture in anticipation here if anywhere the vocalism and the acting are the same thing on the night i heard it i was oblivious of the tenor even though i suppose he must have been singing that same note in aida there are lines in the text which take on new poignancy and depth when she delivers them those about slavery and freedom for instance if she had an amneris of her own rank at the met such as giulietta simionato their clashes on that subject would be a revelation one vital and littlenoticed asset she has for characterization is a feeling for the italian language most of our american singers and many other nonitalians learn italian parts by rote hardly any of them can order a meal in a restaurant when they get to milan no matter how many teachers and coaches they may have no matter how carefully they may enunciate on the stage and no matter how letterperfect they are on dictionary translations such singers thinking in english cannot feel all the meanings in italian poetry true the poetry in opera is seldom subtle or even good but it contains all the echoes associations and subliminal suggestions of a great language price can put the full meaning into her words because she has absorbed them and to put it plainly because she can order a meal in milan and read the newspapers and get around the town and understand what people are saying to her and because she likes italy and the italians this constitutes to a sense of italy and i never have understood how opera singers have to go on the stage in italian repertoire without it generally acting is hardly a word that applies literally to opera where the conditions of work are so different from those of the speaking stage at the metropolitan singers must be forever watching the conductors batonand not only his but that of the cue conductor in the second prompters boxas well as listening to the vociferous word prompter himself it is seldom that they can afford musically to turn toward the person they are supposed to be addressing to look away from the conductor and the prompters on the opera stage requires a confidence in ones knowledge of words music and tempo which few have price can sing with her back to the conductor and never get off the beat bv a fraction so can callas there is another part of ooeratic acting which is radically disjointed from anything we know in the speaking theater everything done on the stage in an opera must be to some appreciable degree akin to the music slow statelv strides like isoldes or the hop skip and jump of don giovanni are determined not only by the character but by the music itself this fact cannot be circumvented in an opera house all the broadway stage directors rudolf bing has been able to entice into the metropolitan have not overcome this fundamental rule that is so ingrained in the singers instinct what they have to do is almost insuperably difficult all those words all those notes all those stage directions if they were to try acting in countertempo to the music they would probably collapse so the singers trap themselves into doing everything in time to the music this is fatal because within a very few minutes it will move any audience to ridicule it tempts singers because it is easy and it arises naturally from the task thus it was that amalie materna fifty or sixty years ago began to wave her scarf to the exact beat of the music in act ii of tristan and isolde unfortunately it became a tradition that has long been honored without question only in recent years has the sequence been broken down into something less than calisthenics price acts neither against the music nor in time to it she acts in relation to it she has that natural adaptability which is instinctive you never see her flapping her elbows or nodding her head in puppet fashion in act iii of aida she throws herself into the duet with the tenor the ugly cabaletta verdi called it the only thing in the opera he seems to have disliked afterward with an abandon that is only frustrated by the woodenness of the tenors she faces her entrance in act ii scene i when she is abject and despondent in the presence of the imperial egyptian princess is wonderfully in the mood of the music without being based on its metrical count but acting even in all the special senses the word assumes in opera can never be the main achievement of a great operatic artist that must always be the fusion of the elements the interweaving of many strands of effort and achievement voice ever first but never to the exclusion of the others this fusion includes all sorts of things makeup and costume among them an awareness of lighting and an absorption in the music to the point at high moments of forgetting the audience price is not yet fully aware of lighting and its powers not many opera singers are callas has a genius for it when she does not have or cannot get the kind of lighting she requires she adjusts her stage movements to get the closest possible approximation if the light is wrong and cannot be changed she simply moves out of it under her ideal conditions of performance the light does not follow her she follows the light the grecoitalian production of medea which she took to london athens and dallas was a high example of the technique with at moments stupendous effects this was prices first season here and she may not yet realize the perils of the metropolitan stage in her final scene of don giovanni she was placed far upstage on a platform from which she could not really have heard the orchestra she could have seen mr boehms beat especially since he kept it high and she has good eyesight she did not deviate an atom from pitch or time conveyed all the meaning of her aria and vocalized with unequaled virtuosity all without descending from her classic stillness yet the lighting was wrong for her having been spanish all evening she suddenly became caribbean because they had thrown a yellowish light on the remote perch where she was obliged to sing it was not a thing an older singer would have welcomed nor is she likely to take to it a second time a great operatic artist not singer alone not actress but operatic artist excels by intertwining all the elements some internal and some external into the whole which is the creative performance there are few such artists at any time when the phenomenon occurs as it does with price we try to dissect analyze and specify but the fact is that there is something baffling in it something beyond and above what we can label there is a hard core of sheer genius in every such performer the mysterious something which differentiates which sets each apart from all others talent and hard work however necessary to the singer are not enough to explain the awe and wonder that fill us when price sings ii trovatore or butterfly or aida or the others in everything she does we have a weird sense of discovery no matter how often we have heard the music before she makes it seem new and again as has been true of other exceptionally gifted beings of the past we are hearing absolutely for the first time something we thought we had known for most of our lives price being the artist she is will never allow her american success to separate her permanently from milan and vienna she gets a higher quality of cooperation there better casts in generalthan american theaters can afford she is devoted to herbert von karajan as a conductor and since he too is enamored of italian style they are said to produce remarkable results she has exceptionally long breath and he likes her to use it for sustained cantilena even when it is not called for in the score thus giving a seemingly endless vocal line her first triumphs in vienna and milan were achieved with great artists as her colleagues and she acknowledges their help with gratitude simionato was her first amneris at la scala for instance she has had no such luck at the metropolitan or at other american opera houses where as a rule one star or at most two is considered enough for one evening this weighs heavily on an opera like aida which demands four or five singers of the first rank what with illnesses from manhattan weather the present wellpublicized unionmanagement hassles and the continuing financial problems such casting is not possible in new york at this time leontyne price is only thirtyfour and it is possible for us to look forward to a series of new creations in the years ahead there is much for her to do in the italian repertoire she has just begun on the inexhaustible treasures of verdi for instance the time will come no doubt when she will be claimed by some german works too this season she is also singing the girl of the golden west for the opening and tosca at the metropolitan and although some of us have only a limited enthusiasm for puccini it will be difficult to stay away from the house when she brings those old war horses to life for such an artist anything is possible starred with errol flynn whenever one of the later mr errol flynns pictures crops up on tv my husband gives me a nasty grin starts his lights camera action routine as he plays with our now elderly poodle yerrol flynn yerrol flynn is the name on the dogs pedigree because the dashing mr flynnalthough he never saw me in lifewas responsible for my buying the dog also unknowingly the handsome mr flynn ruined a summer friendship for me with a woman named anna in another negro woman sue and i were traveling by bus to the cote dazure wed spent a wonderful july in europe sue was a teacher while i was merely a housewife slightly tired of hearing about my husbands tour of europe via the army on the bus we met anna a white woman in her plump middle years who was most happy to see fellow americans from manhattan anna was one of those friendly but aggressive types the dominating kind so certain they can do all things right and often do fairly rich she immediately whispered about the technique of carrying american money in the shoulder padding of her summer coatproof of how welltraveled she was anna talked far too much and sue didnt like her sue didnt like most whites anyway but i didnt mind annas chattering she had been to nice before promised to show us the town innocently we arrived at the height of the season minus hotel reservations and after tramping from one filled smallhotel to anotherover sues protest i phoned anna she told us to rush over yes rush to her hotel that she would get us a room the hotel turned out to be an imposing palace on the promenade des anglais looking far too expensive and ritzy for us sue was against even going in she sometimes forgot she wasnt in the states but we did step inside anna had a nice double room reserved for us at the simply impossible rate of a day i immediately decided i didnt at all mind annas taking over i dont know whether she was lonely or what but anna really took us in hand she knew a number of nicoise and had our money safely exchanged at the unofficial rate then went out of her way to introduce us to her friends even sue had to admit anna was pretty okay i guess anna really made the next few days a dream literally a living dream mornings she took us to visit the homes of her friends or their shops then after a stop at the american express to see if we had any mail we would lunch in the various nontourist the most valued label to a tourist restaurants then spend the afternoons on the rocky beach we seemed to be the only colored women about and caused more neckturning and camerasnapping in our modest swim suits than did some of the startling bikini chicks evenings were also delightfully fullaperitifs on the terrace of the hotel then to some marvelous and cheap restaurant anna always knew about or even dinner in the home of a friend of tiers followed by drinks in some promenade cafe as we listened to the music we fell into bed exhausted every night and i felt i was seeing the real europe one afternoon about a week before we were due to return to paris we were busy mailing cards at the old post office when a thin blonde in her late twentiesabout the only woman in the post office not wearing a bathing suit or shorts came over to sue and i asked in good french pardon me but can you understand what im saying what i asked what is it you speak english the blonde said with a clipped british accent how splendid i took you for africans or were americans sue told her coldly of course tell me would you care to be in pictures were practically in every tourists album now i began so no no i mean motion pictures with errol flynn you see were making a picture outside nice and looking for some colored women i was too surprised to speak sue managed to gasp but were not actresses these are extra parts dressed in creole costumes youll merely walk in and out of scenes it will be quite simple the blonde assured us are you interested at this point anna stepped forward of course theyre interested provided the pay is right how about transportation we can only use theseyou two the blonde said seeing anna for the first time they will be paid of course and i imagine we can arrange for a car to take them to and from the set she turned directly to me where are you staying i eagerly gave her our names and the hotel she said we would hear from her within a day or two and started to leave one minute anna said how long will the job last if they miss out on any paris hotel reservations we expect your company to reimburse them for that the shooting will only take two or three days at most and really as to money and other such details i cant give you any exact figures thats not my department but i assure you the pay will be standard and dont worry about it i must go but ill be in touch when she left sue and i immediately sent more cards to the states proudly announcing we were going to be in an errol flynn movie anna a bit envious i thought said now ive heard everything this should about pay for your stay in nice think i once read where hollywood extras earn per day wow sue said slapping her thin face and if the sun isnt right or something it means retakes and more days anna went on i cant remember perhaps they pay per hour after all youre the only colored women here you should be above extra pay just let me talk to them when they call sue and anna excitedly talked money all the way back to the beach having fallen in love with a poodle pup in paris which id found out would cost to send home all i said was if i can get my poodle out of the deal ill be happy two days at per would about do it and i hope madame simone hasnt sold him already forget ill get you more than that anna said old law of supply and demand you know listen you wire this madame simone youre taking the dog youre bound to get more than enough out of this to pay for him i dont know i said almost to myself even if i should be paid theres still another and im on a tight budget havent the nerve to wire my husband for any moneywe strained like hell for me to make the trip but i really want the pup i turned to sue look in case i dont make enough to pay for the dog can you lend me part of your movie money until we return to the states certainly sue said this isnt money i counted on within minutes id cashed nearly all my travelers checks and wired mme simone the money telling her to send the pup to my husband then i quickly wrote a jumbled air mail home explaining things as best i could we spent the rest of the day at a plage in a state of high excitement talking about cutting room floors stills closeups and what not as if we really were actresses that night we went to bed early to look our best for tomorrow the following day we hung around the hotel finally when the day grew too warm we went to the plage across the promenade one of us rushing back to the desk every half hourbut there wasnt any phone call i had a wire from paris saying the dog would be on a plane the following week what did i wish on the pedigree in all french poodles had to be registered under y so i wired back yerrol flynn there wasnt any call the next day either when sue suggested we try locating the film company anna said that would be the worst thing you could do seem overanxious remember they want you just wait the blonde said she would phone in a day or two but we leave saturday for paris sue said no point in playing it too cool all the better anna said for when they do call and hear youre about to leave theyll pay more this could even prolong your trip for another few weeks we cant do that i said we have our boat reservations anna chuckled dont be simple errol flynn can always get you new reservations wednesday and thursday passed without a call friday we tried to find the movie company although all nice knew mr flynn was on the riviera no one knew exactly where early saturday we boarded the paris bus anna who was staying another month told me to be sure to look her up when she returned to new york and did i want to borrow any money i said no rather abruptly im afraid we had a sad week in paris before our boat sailed sue was a little brusque with me as i was now flat broke and had to borrow all of her gift money to eat but mostly sue raged against anna claiming she had frightened the movie woman off with her talk about big wages i often found myself agreeing with sue although in fairness to anna the blonde could have been a pure crackpot sue and i returned to the states with a lot of explaining to dofirst about why we didnt bring any souvenirs back for friends and then the questions about our nonexistent movie careers whenever a new flynn picture turned up even years later some clown would phone and ask this the one youre in i never called anna in new york and after i paid sue the money id borrowed we sort of fell apart for a time each morning when the unhousebroken pup got us upusually before dawnmy husband would shove me out of bed mumble take him out lights camera action and then turn over to sleep again but whenever i did see mr flynn on the screen in the past nine years i still liked him for he had if all unknowingly added a bit more glamour to the famed riviera for me by woodie king jr after waiting half the evening in the hot summer sun i got high and loafed up hasting street hot sweaty memories of the first block i can hardly remember but i can remember thats more than i can say for some bums i know like winos in doorways dying from hunger and overexposure their pants wet from the knee up the hot sun having its secret ways of making the urine smell like hell they have no memories the first block with its bars filled with already drunks or fags dressed in sisters or mothers clothes winking their false eyelashes at me me too high to spit on them above the bars were open windows with black nasty looking people spitting down to the street on a garbage man and his cart the garbage man sending up words the devil doesnt allow in hell above the open windows the sun hot was smiling down on noisy dark naked babies some running in the street some crying from a homemade buggy for their mother who left them to take her pickup for the usual threegeorges listened to a whore giving me some bull finally asking her how much she would pay me then telling her to go to hell i watched her put the bite on a white kid who drove up in a soupedup ford both he and the car trying to look hip waiting until he went upstairs for his action then went through his car and found nothing but beer bottles took them and deposited them for thirtysix cents and stole a candy bar i too high to remember what block from the first on just walked talked and loafed somewhere on hasting i stopped and played basketball with some wanttobe hipsters i got tired and sat in the evening shade and watched the game the homemade basket probably from a stolen vegetable basket listened to them argue watched them fight and one did get cut finally everyone ran leaving the bleeding kid in the lot it was funny i guess because i was high and didnt give a damn two cops came about a half hour later threw the kid in the car and all three split the scene the other guys came back and continued to play and argue and talk about the cut boys mother the sun finally settled behind the projects and i got tired of watching basketball somewhere on hastings i tried to sneak into the castle theatre where four pictures were playing for a dime but i got caught i loafed in front of the place with some other potheads i know we talked about the pimp life how we would be if always if we had a woman who loved us you got to use somebody a pimp has to use somebody he got to know like hes got to be more than hip like hes gotta be super hip under the theater lights which blinked on off on as if winking its knowing eye we yarded or talked if thats what you call yarding we tried to generalize tried to set a pimps life off from the hustlers the boosters and the pushers we tried to understand just how he obtained the prostitutes love in the beginning some guy with his pants high said a pimps gotta have a long tongue and somebody said something but nobody knew i was high and talking all out of my head and somehow got on another subject while i was talking i mean yarding about i dont know what the tickettaker turned his head and everyone ran in but me the inner brat all they could do was talk and pray to get on the welfare or aid to dependent children because the man was not around the women that were not pregnant were hustlers and somewhere in the night making out no use talking broads no use talking black conked heads shining in the black night of lights each head a representative of hipdom the evil happy dust man always near always in there helping to hold his people back helping to hold any people back skintight dresses on female animals luring the late night rapist to murder her for her body her body crying come come and get it shiny white teeth in the dark night on laughing faces and crying faces all enjoying the filth they live in with the rodents and the stench each face hating and enjoying the blues of the cornfield music swinging with yardbird parker and reliving his life mistaking ray charless soul everyone out now everyone night people representing hipdoom we went up to hell we went up to the j trjrr mountain to eat we vv went up to hell there c fi were ten of us a episcopal priests we were fr john morris executive director of the episcopal society for cultural and racial unity from atlanta georgia fr robert fortna graduate student at union theological seminary new york and one of the chaplains to columbia university fr layton zimmer of pennsylvania fr malcolm boyd episcopal chaplain to wayne university detroit fr robert pierson assistant to the executive director of the american church union with offices in new york fr robert taylor prison chaplain in chicagothese priests are white and there was fr james breeden of massachusetss fr quinlan gordon of washington d c fr robert hunter of chattanooga and the writer fr robert chapman executive secretary of the new york branch of the naacpthese priests are negro at the top of the mountain stands the vaunted university of the south it encompasses acres of beautiful campus grounds educational institutions dormitories and studentfaculty homes a magnificent chapel and a restaurant the university of the south at sewanee tennessee is owned by twentytwo southern dioceses of the episcopal church the restaurant on campus the claramount inn is owned by the university and is leased by it to one mrs clara shoemate a local mountain girl who made good mrs shoemate has never served a negro at the claramount she has denied entrance to the then only negro bishop of the episcopal church bishop harris of liberia who was a campus guest she has denied entrance to negro priests who have been summertime students at the episcopal theological seminary on campus she had denied some of us in september of last yearand it was her intention to deny us entrance on wednesday of last week we had to arrive unannounced and take her by surprise before she could lock the doors at approximately pm that day we pulled up in two cars got out swiftly and made for the entrance fathers pierson gordon and taylor were the first to enter they were met by a waitress who greeted them and told them that they dont serve colored here while she talked i outflanked her passed behind her and made it to the main dining room followed by the others we quickly sat at three tables waiting to be served the dining room lights were immediately turned off and a rope was hung across the entrance to the room indicating that the room was not to be used for serving we sat then from pm until am without so much as a glass of water we were ignored except for the occasional visits from college and seminary students these young men came in for one of two reasons to tell us that we were destroying all chances for a solution with our coercive action or to tell us that we had no business at sewanee and ought to leave there were two other visitors around pm bishop juhan retired bishop of florida now living at sewanee and until that night only suspected of being the segregationist power behindthethrone there came into the dining room it is a custom within the episcopal church that priests rise in respect when a bishop enters a room in which they happen to be we each stood bishop juhan began to address fr taylor who happened to be at the table nearest to where the bishop had entered he said to fr taylor my advice to youall is that you leave fr taylor asked why bishop juhans reply was so as not to increase the contention here fr taylor said thank you for your advice bish op i was at the next table and the bishop was between taylors table and mine i said to him what did you say bishop his answer was my advice to you is that you leave i asked him why and his answer was because they wont serve you here again i asked why his response was ask the management shell be in later i pressed the point to ask well do you know why bishop the bishop did not answer i broke the silence with the question is it because of my color bishop juhan did not hesitate as he said slowly and clearly yes i believe so in my own church i asked the answer was decisive yes there was nothing further to ask i said thank you for your advice bishop with that i removed my coat from the chair and sat down at the table all of us sat once more later one of the students who came in to talk with us was refused service in the smaller dining room which was kept open to them during our sitin he came back to tell us that bishop juhan had instructed the help not to serve any students who came into the large dining room to talk with us the bishop incidentally remained on vigil in the lobby and small dining room until the hour of our departure the second most significant visitor was miss clara as she is lovingly called by all who dwell on the mountain she came in at about pm saying she understood that someone wanted to talk to her we invited her to sit i asked her if it would not be well to have the lights turned on so that we could see each other she said no this is alrightthe darkness was very dark indeed we asked for a meal she said she has a plan for desegregation which involves feeding a negro student in june and a guest in september she said that she had to overcome resistance from many quarters and that with her plan she would be able to overcome the last obstacle the mountain people the poor white folk who dwell on the mountains side she said that she had thus far been successful in overcoming the resistance of the board of regents the faculties and the student bodies but that the mountainfolk had to be assured that this thing would happen slowly we asked her if any possible harm could come if there just happened to be food in front of us herself included at that moment and if we each just happened to be eating while we talked she said the mountainpeople would blow her place up by morning she said she would be glad however to take us to her home right then and give us the best meal we had ever had we told her we would be overjoyed to accept that invitation for breakfast if she would serve us supper at the claramount now she refused we asked her if the mountain people would not blow her home up if she fed us there she said that they would not at this point there was a sound something like poofthe darkness was made light we looked outside the huge glass windows at the rear of the dining room and beheld a huge cross blazing on the lawn perhaps fifty feet from the room itself we asked miss clara again if we might be served this time she said that the help would refuse pointing out that thev probably needed their jobs we bid her call them into the dining room and ask them in our presence she arose and without saying another word disappeared into the kitchen by now the students were getting somewhat beeredup they would come to the rope which divided us from them and we would be greeted with remarks such as these i like niggers i think everybody ought to own one im gonna buy me one for christmas or look at the zoo or im gonna take a nigger home with me in my trunksome of these men are studying for holy orders in the episcopal church all are college or seminary students of the university of the south eleven oclock is the normal closing hour of the claramount inn soon we heard a voice from among the beeredup students in the lobbyeight more minutes you all and theyll be coming out thentheyll be coming out in six minutes there was a crowd mostly students with some mountainpeople gathering outside in the parking lot we could see the lights from their cars and we could hear their voices they waited and so did we in a quick teteatete we decided that we were not going to leave unless miss clara informed us that she was closing and that it was time to go at am miss clara appeared in the dining room announced that she was closing and we arose we walked swiftly to our cars hearing and not hearing the shouts and the catcalls seeing and not seeing the blackjacks and beer cans we sped down the mountainside one car pursued us followed us to chattanooga and the driver took note of the motel at which we checked in we felt compelled to return on thursday lest students faculty mountaineers and everybody else on that unholy mountain mistakenly gloat over having chased us and lest they be misguided into thinking that our real purpose had been to have our pictures taken as some of them had taunted thursday noon when we drove up the door was locked before we could get out of the cars there were some patrons in the dining room these were allowed by the management to finish eating and to leave by a side door we priests embarked on a standin at the locked entrance throughout the day tension mounted as students faculty and even a few mountainpeople approached us to tell us why we were wrong and why we should go and how much harm we were doing to the progress mrs shoemates plan which had been accomplished no more guests were served that afternoon the kitchen help was sent home earlyand we decided not to be caught there by dark that afternoon breeden pierson zimmer and taylor were obliged to return to their respective homes because of the pressure of their work we felt that if we returned to sewanee on friday it should be only to try the door and finding it locked to leave the mountain with a statement that we had come to sewanee in an attempt to awaken the moral fibre of all there to the unchristian essence of segregation on church ground that we had failed and were going home i for one tried to get a flight out of nashville that night for we did not return to chattanooga on thursday night we went to nashville it was impossible to get a flight and it is only because the morning flight was also delayed for from six to eight hours that this frightened priest was among the number of the six frightened priests who returned to try the door on friday when we arrived at the parking lot of the claramount inn at about pm we at once took note of several cars which bore licenses from georgia and alabama we saw one of the waitresses leap from a table and run to lock the door it was locked when we reached it we each walked up to it tried it found it locked and returned to the car father fortna and father morris had on thursday made an appointment to talk with some students of the seminary at friday night at the campus home of one of the students for this reason we drove both cars outside of the gates to put the proper luggage in the proper cars and parted company fortna and morris were going to have lunch at the rebel inn which is a desegregated bus terminal on the mountain while there they were going to and did send our message to the wire service they would rest a bit down in chattanooga and at night would return to sewanee and their appointment with father hunter driving boyd gordon and i took off down the mountain our destination was the chattanooga airport and our respective homes the road leading down from the mountain is winding but good we took advantage of its goodness and moved off at about fifty miles per hour we had barely moved a mile the trip to chattanooga is about sixty miles when a black and red chevrolet station wagon coming from behind us shot by as though we were standing still it quickly overtook and passed the one car in front of us and disappeared around a turn just ahead when we rounded the bend we were confronted with a sight horrible beyond belief part of that station wagon was lying upside down in the middle of the road some fifty feet in front of that lay the driver half of the engine rested twenty feet up the side of the mountain on the left part of the left front fender and door were stuck in a crack made in the rock on the left which had been the point of impactthe driver had never come out of his lefthand turn on that mountain curve over to the right beyond the road and in a field lay half an axle with a twisted wheel attached metal everywhere was still steaming from the heat of the impact and the disintegration of the car our car screeched to a halt perhaps fifteen or twenty feet short of the broken distorted man on the road i covered him with my coat hunter found a pulsebeat boyd covered him with his coat it was windy so boyd knelt to hold the coats in place gordon asked the other drivers to get the police and ambulance i knelt at the victims head placed my stole about my neck opened my priests manual and began to administer last rites gordon knelt beside me while i prayed a few mountain people gathered a few students who had fol lowed us gathered i prayed for his forgiveness when the ambulance took him away we headed toward our car father hunter gave a patrolman a brief description of the victims recent recklessness he told him of our prayers two students asked me if he was dead i said no we prayed for his forgiveness and healing and if this is not gods will for his reception into heaven we drove away i think it was father boyd who gave my coat back to me saturday morning father fortna called me at my home he told me the man had died he said that a reporter had found out that the dead man was one of miss claras kitchen helpers and that miss clara was reported to have said that he was chasing us but he had passed us some of the kitchen help is reported to have said that he had a shotgun did he plan to get sufficiently down the mountain to park and blow our heads off from ambush as we reached him we probably will never know we do not know if anyone even found a shotgun we do know that he was at work when we arrived at the claramount that we had not closed his place of business that friday the thirteenth and that for some reason he was in the devils own hurry to get away from work ifand god grant that it be not sobut if he was intent upon killing one or all of us four priests god stopped him dead in his tracks sunday afternoon father fortna called me to tell me that before he left for home on saturday the mountain was bewailing not so much the fact that those unwanted priests had administered the rites but was angered over the insult that a black priest had actually laid his hands on their boys head in a final blessing their interpretationa curse we went up to the mountain to eatwe went up to hell may god draw near to that mountain may he shake it to its spiritual depths and place lord jesus in command there over his church as indeed he will some day be capitalism s show place in africa during ivory coast jj v president felix hou jff phouetboignys recent official visits to he united states and britain he was being seen as a spokesman for a particular approach in africa it is an approach which his ambassador in london referred to as a policy of realism and hard work today half way through her second year of independence the ivory coast is a showpiece for that particular approach although houphouetboignys own party the reassemblement democratique africain rda was among the most radical and outspoken of preindependence movements the country today remains the last haven of comparatively unfettered french private enterprise in africa the minister of finance is still frenchborn pioneer industry leg islation is of the most tempting and liberal the approach in terms of economic progress appears to be paying off a survey made by the industrial union of the ivory coast gives the total industrial turnover in as m francs cfa in as m and in as m the countrys capital abidjan is a showpiece of what a modern europeanstyle town can look like in africa industries of all kinds mushroom a giant bakery textile works tobacco factories coffee plants vehicle assembly plants new industries now in process of establishment include a chocolate factory four instant coffee plants two aluminum works one of which will produce some aluminum sheets annually from laminated strip imported from the cameroons federation and an oil refinery despite the fall in the price of the materials she exports the ivory coast has managed to maintain a favourable balance of trade in both her independent years her exports were worth m francs cfa which is some m francs in excess of imports in that year the country which has a population of m exported tons of coffee tons of hardwood tons of cocoa and tons of bananas radical observers find it easy to criticise the regime of m houphouetboigny for its apparent lack of enthusiasm for a deep break with the economic past and they are quick to label his country a haven of economic neocolonialism others however are convinced the old man knows what he is doingthat he is merely using the foreign capitalists to build up his country for him as fast as possible and saving up the application of radicalism for a later date when he will be in a stronger economic position certainly the present policy is vigorously justified in theory asked on one occasion why the ivory coast last year a new ecothe ghanaian and nigerian marketing boards of produce the senegalese too have now introduced themm houphouetboigny replied simply we have a liberal economy we dont believe in that sort of thing however there are already signs that this economic laissez faire is coming to an endeven in the ivory coast last year a new economic and social council was appointed to supervise economic planning it is true that the chair man of this council m jean delafosse seemed when this correspondent met him determined to go slow and avoid radical change he was against increased state participation in industry because he said in my personal view an industry without a private boss tends to be inefficient but the appointment was a straw in the wind this year in his budget message president houphouetboigny outlined some changes which will bring his country more into line with the general trend he promised a bill which will acknowledge the state as the sole proprietor of all uncultivated land and henceforth it is the state that shall share out to all citizens all available land to ensure better production what this measure exactly means and how much uncultivated land exists is not clear nor is it certain that the proposal will be welcomed if government tries to implement it but if radicalism is what houphouetboignys detractors want here they have it the budget also demands sacrifices from both natives and foreigners at a time when further effort will be required from all farmers tho president said it is only fair that those of us who have been a rather privileged class in comparison with the peasantry should also make sacrifices the latter will include a national contribution or special levy of per cent on all salaries and wages above francs cfa a month abolition of free houses for civil servants abolition from of most ministers and civil servants free cars and the introduction of controls on the repatriation of trading companies profits the minister of information m mathieu ekra recently announced that while there was a capital inflow of m last year m in profits was also repatriated to stop this financial hemorrhage all business will be required to pay an additional per cent of their profits to government but these levies will be restored to the taxpayers when they show that they have reinvested twice this sum in industries approved by government this means that business houses must accept some sort of government control over investment in addition to these economies and controls however government has now reviewed its national accounting proceduresdividing the budget into current and capital accountsand from now on it is emphasised expenditure shall under no circumstances exceed the estimates as a further emphasis on the move towards planification the government is now preparing the first systematic plana tenyear plan in the meantime the budget has included a special budget for investment accounting for m francs cfa which is quite distinct from the general and administration budgets an interim plan for has also been approved involving m francs cfa this apportions per cent of total investment towards general development towards increasing production towards equipment for the administration research work receives per cent cultural development per cent and social development per cent politically the presidents doctrine and methods appear to work well he is evidently popular in the country and the affair of the sanwi refugees who went over into ghana has been an exception his showmanship is today concentrated in abidjan with its superb new hotels its unique collection of palaces its elegant modernity and bustling prosperity photographs of all the brilliant goingson there are pinned weekly to the doors of sousprefets throughout the land two reforms since independence have had nationwide effect a major administrative reform aimed at decentralising local government divided the country into four departments and sousprefetures this setup replaces the subdivisions the other reform has been the introduction of national service consisting of six months military training and six months in civil works the french ambassador has handed over to the president the th naval infantry battalion which will become the first battalion of the new ivory coast army as well as the men the ivory coast also receives the battalions armament and vehicles the army now amounts to well over men including the youths called up for national civilian service in the mobile gendarmerie and in the republican guard just after m houphouetboigny laid the foundation stone of the french embassy the ambassador handed over a patrol boat p which under the name of patience is the first vessel of the ivory coast national navy it would be wrong to dwell on the policy differences which have so far seemed to separate so spectacularly the ivory coast from such neighbours as mali and guinea these policy differences are now narrowing as are one hopes the political quarrels between the groups what really characterises the ivory coast is the beauty of its wellwooded naturally prosperous countryside the somewhat phlegmatic good nature of its peoples and obviously deeply held conviction of its government that it is set on the right path in defense of negro intellectuals hum an progress as generally conceived in america is like a horse race it always becomes most complicated and suspenseprovoking when it approaches the home stretch the challenges the confusions the need for timing the need for decision as to when to make the allout break for the tape the suspense of whether or not once the break is madethe horse has the stamina to sustain the drive to the end or the jockey has the skill and wisdom to make the right moves in the right lane all these are part of the drama of that moment of entry into the stretch what compounds the emotion of the present american drive for human progress is the fact that everyone knows that one horse may leave the post and even enter the stretch well ahead and still wind up out of the money it is this single principle which is giving rise to so much study and scrutiny of negro peoples and negro leadership at this juncture in our nations history we find after three hundred years of being on this continent together and building this nation together that white intellectuals are seriously confessing to themselves that they havent really known the american negro and they must now painfully learn what kind of horse he is really like negroes on the other hand are impatiently concerned about their leadership and the timing of the final break for the tape of freedom and dignity this horserace symbolism will first appear to be an inept metaphor but close examination will reveal thatalthough we talk very much about equalityamerican social and economic mentality does not permit egalitarian realities to prevail very long it does not countenance dead heats so the egalitarian thinker like the horse must either gird himself for ascendancy or resign himself to decline the challenge this is the anxiety context which has provoked the increasingly vocal complaints from the white citizens councils and the conservative politicians that the naacp and core are pushing too fast in too many directionsand causing too much confusion while on the other hand negroes are complaining that their leadership is too slow too quiet and too willing to choose the slow outside lane of judicial political and assimilation gravel both extremes expectone wishfully the other fearfullythat the race will be lost but perhaps the most penetrating form of scrutiny of the negro in contemporary america comes from serious negro scholars themselves who are examining their own leadership like to stretch the metaphorhorses examining jockeys and jockeys examining trainers among the plethora of articles now appearing in many national magazines on the general topic of the negro in america one in particular addressed itself to the negro intellectual the significance of this article by the late professor e franklin frazier which appeared in the february issue of negro digest is that the american negro intellectual has always conceived himself and his unique role in american culture in a mixture of practical and philosophical terms and he has made his great contribution to american culture only when this combination has been right he has constantly addressed himself and this nation to the basic meaning of the christian religion the declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights as philosophical and social constructions transcending the vagaries and ironies of legislative law but he has always had to make his address through the machinery of law and social protest it is for this reason that his presence and his protestations have always served as a conscience to the nation and his modus operandi have sharply delineated between local law and constitutional jurisprudence this delineation has redounded to the ultimate benefit of this nation and yielded a clearer understanding of the particular meaning possible destiny and potential leadership role of this nation as the archetype of constitutional democratic government the pressing concern of professor frazier in this article which was titled the failure of the negro intellectual is that the present day intellectual unlike the historic negro intellectual who has always been the charismatic symbol for negro status and social mobility seems somehow now to be frittering away his time quoting and reciting great ideas enjoying the tinsel of middle class identification but abdicating his responsibility to produce leadership in these crucial times there is some validity to his point and indeed some cause to share and communicate his concern however to conceive the negro intellectual leadership role against the image of the traditional abstract philosopher is quite inadequate unless the analogy is highly selective and unless it alludes by comparison to men who related themselves to philosophical functions in the way of moses of socrates of jesus christ and more recently of mohandas k gandhi almost all contemporary professional philosophers generally have abdicated their responsibility to profound moral and ethical issues in their theoretical pursuit of the image of the physical sciences and the emulation of the technological model of mathematics the negro philosopher by contrast who begins as philosopher or theologian like dr martin_luther_king or rev fred shuttlesworth finds that he must release his creative genius as a socratic gadfly to pepper the conscience of the nation with practical demonstrations of how this nation must grow in the difficult learning of abstract and absolute truth but in this role he is neither conceived to be nor accorded the title philosophereven as socrates was not acclaimed philosopher by his contemporaries among academic scholars professor frazier did not intend to assert that men like dr howard thurman dr benjamin mays or dr martin_luther_king are not among the great philosophical minds of our nation he and we are disturbed by that species which comprise the large number of intellectuals for whom so many sacrifices have been made but who are so busy assimilatingnot integratingthat they spend their maximum energy trying to escape the responsibility to address themselves to their past and to their sacrificing forebears that they use the instrumentalities of education and knowledge to become jockeys and trainers in the race to produce a completely free nation and a better future for the generations which are to follow the fairer truth lies somewhere in between the scholar as a person and certain of these expectations the important philosophical contributions by negro scholars of this day are to be found in their address to the meaning of human dignity this address has none of the quality of abstractness which is generally characteristic of philosophical posture because the interpretations are bathed in practical problems and social action programs many negro scholars have awakened to the realization that mohandas k gandhi is no less a philosopher because his theory of human values was made explicit in a social action program they know that moses and jesus christ made their great spiritual gifts to the world through deeds and demonstrations from which succeeding generations inherited the great spiritual treasures of biblical literature and philosophy now unfortunately abused many college students and faculty members alike are demonstrating that relevance to life is a valid philosophical posture and a worthy objective for contemporary philosophical direction they intendin spite of the fritterersto achieve philosophical stature as doers of the word the serious negro intellectual as professor frazier was himself is a softsell moralist he is not temperamentally suited to the bombastics of hardsell moralism and righteous recrimination of the sort which does retributive violence to the offenders against dignity and decency and indeed this posture is frequently misinterpreted both by the conservative wishfulthinkers who hope that negroes will lose the race to freedom and by the anxietysyndromed liberals who want to collect quick bets so that they can luxuriate dont let either be fooled the negros apparent meekness and assimilationism is not to be confused with either weakness or abdication the negro intellectual has a program and he conceives his first responsibility to be to achieve freedom and dignity for this nation without vengeance or malice towards the present offenders against decency and underlying that surface assimilation is a hard core of pride and determination grounded in the realization that they are in the home stretch and thatafter three hundred degrading yearsthe tape of dignity and freedom is in sight three friends there is a saying a v a a friend is a person who knows all about you and still likes you three such persons have come into my life at different times and left a mark that can never be erased one saved my pride one saved my faith in human nature and the third saved my life they were all negro women i belong to the socalled white race far away and long ago in a suburb of boston i was trying my best to graduate from high school my marks in mathematics were very poor i just do not have the type of mentality that can fully grasp the science dealing with numbers one way or another i had managed to get by and graduate each year with my class but this time i knew i wouldnt graduate unless a miracle happened and the miracle happened in the person of dorothy a classmate dorothy was a whizbang when it came to numbers she could add subtract and multiply like nobodys business instead of going directly home that warm may afternoon i had gone to the basement of the school and thinking myself alone was indulging in a good cry suddenly i realized i was not alone and turning around saw dorothy a few feet away looking at me with great concern whats the matter rosie she asked and that was all i needed to make me cry louder between sobs i told her my life was ruined i wasnt going to graduate i had flunked in math i couldnt add two and two dorothy was silent for a few minutes but she seemed to have arrived at some conclusion lets walk home she said i have an idea ill tell you while were walking dorothy and i generally rode the street cars home as we lived quite a distance from the school but the threemile walk didnt seem long this time and this was dorothys plan she would tutor me every day for a couple of hours until the time came for exams that is if i didnt object object who would object to manna from heaven for three weeks i went to her home after school and studied like mad she quickly detected my weak spots and hammered away at them when class was over her mother used to bring in a glass of milk and something to eat generally homemade cakes or cookies when the time came for exams dorothy sat two rows away i could just see the top of her head when i couldnt get the answer right away i would look across to her and as silly as it sounds id get the answer by just concentrating on her big blue hair ribbon i passed of course and my mother went with me to dorothys home while i thanked her and gave her a small gift of gratitude dorothys mother served milk all around and the cakes were extra special with brightly colored frosting time passed as time will do and it was thanksgiving in boston just after the world war ii my husband had died overseas my parents had also died as had a daughter and a sister i had a good job in a large hospital but the thought of being thankful about anything never occurred to me i despised the human race then along came betty betty was a nurses aide in the hospital where i worked she was the only fellow employe whom i bothered to speak to unless forced to do so in the line of duty betty and i went to lunch at the same time but not always together sometimes she would get to the dining room ahead of me and would turn up a chair next to her so that we could sit together i would do the same if i arrived first the day before thanksgiving she saw i was down in the dumps and did her best to cheer me up would i cheer not on your life i sulked all the more and finally told her in words of one syllable what i thought of thanksgiving it was for the birds she made no reply but walked away and left me that night the telephone rang as i sat alone in my little apartment on the ninth floor of a hotel overlooking the charles river it was betty my husband and i would like you to come to dinner tomorrow she said i hesitated perhaps too long for she was back on the line saying of course if you dont want to its perfectly all right if i dont want to if i dont want to i repeated why betty id love to and its wonderful of you to invite me that thanksgiving dinner and that thanksgiving day is one i will always remember i have never known such love from anyone as betty and her family showed me that day besides her husband there was a teenage son bettys mother bettys widowed sister and her two small children and a boston policeman a friend of the husband the policeman had recently lost his wife and they thought he would be lonesome eating alone when the time came to leave i kissed betty and her mother and her sister and they kissed me that little moment of love and understanding will last through eternity and then there was that horrible year of a believer in astrology would say the stars were against me well something was i was jobless in ill health and scared to death my home if it could be called that was on the third floor back of a thirdrate hotel in a thirdrate western city the only bright spot in my life was vannie the elevator operator who was always good for a laugh no matter how depressing the circumstances she would say something to make her passengers laugh and how we needed that laugh i remember one night when it was raining hard and the wind was shrieking as if to say all hope was lost forever i rang for the elevator and vannie responded smiling as usual well she said as she opened the door to let me on this is a fine night to go up on a mountain and howl i who hadnt laughed for days broke out laughing and a sad face man who was already a passenger when i entered took off his hat in respect for something i hope it was vannies gallantry of soul but the time came when even vannie couldnt make me smile i was behind in the rent and was told to pay up by pm the next day or else i started for the telegraph office to send a collect wire to a friend for helpa friend whom i felt sure could not respondwhen i suddenly burst out crying no bells were ringing for the car so vannie took it to the top floor stopped it then turned to me as dorothy long ago had asked me what was the matter so did vannie i told her i was going to be evicted and why aint you got no one you can go to for help she wanted to know the question and its obvious answer brought with it a decision on my part i knew then what i was going to do the cowards way out was it only a coward would continue to live under such circumstances take me down i said abruptly and when the car leveled off at my floor i left without saying good night i would say good morning in another world once in my room i sat down at the shabby inkstained cigaretteburned desk and started writing a letter to a loved one i wanted them to understand that what i was about to do wasnt because i was a coward no it was because there was a knock on the door and right away i knew it was the manager he was going to put me out then he wasnt going to wait until morning i looked towards the window through which i had planned to jump and froze in my seat then the knock came again and i heard vannies voice let us in mis kelly she said in her thick southern voice weall want to talk to you oh well what did it matter i got up and opened the door there was vannie and the housekeeper a redfaced irishwoman generally known as maime who sized me up at a glance and smiled encouragingly vannie here tells me youre kinda broke she said like we all are at times i can remember when i didnt have a nickel for a cuppa coffee but what i was going to say is i need a maid on the third floor doris the one i had quit yesterday said her boy friend doesnt want her working no more what i mean is if youd like the job i know the manager will let you stay until you get square he aint a bad sort he aint ill have a word with him whatdoyuh say i worked there six weeks when a job in my own line came along and i left for the far west maime and vannie walked to the bus terminal with me helping me with my baggage as the hound pulled out for l a they waved frantically from the loading platform dorothy betty vannie and dear old maime how i would like to see them all again i thank the good lord i was worthy of their friendship another country press deadlines being what they are these lines are being written long before they will appear in the magazine to date not a single review of james baldwins new novel another country dial has appeared by the time this is published most reviews will have been out for at least several days and james baldwin and a nother country and the themes and subthemes of the novel and the characters who people it will all be the talk in literary circles in city rooms on college campuses at writers conferences at greenwich village bars and at cocktail parties from cape cod to carmelbythesea another country is that much of an event james baldwin is just possibly the most gifted of all negro writers and certainly one of the finest writers of any race or color of this generation his first novel go tell it on the mountain published a decade ago told those who read it that a major literary talent was at hand the promise of excellence was fulfilled with notes of a native son his second book a collection of excruciatingly bright and lovely essays the growth and mellowness of the young new yorkers talent was there in giovannis room baldwins second novel and third book but the novels central theme a homosexual relationship undoubtedly compromised its credits it was with baldwins fourth book last seasons nobody knows my name that the critics broke through their wall of caution or indifference or fear to hail him the little black boy from harlem had made it and it no longer could be denied there remained of course some doubters as there always must be this young man with his audacious probing lilting prose his needlesharp intelligence his extraordinary insight and his savage groping beyond images had to be slapped down put in his place but greatness is his place he proves it beyond all reasonable question with another country this is a novel about the many faces of love it is centered on the lives of nine people over a period of a year only two of these people are negroes they are rufus and ida brother and sister leona is tied to rufus with terrible bonds forged by that madness which is so uniquely american there is vivaldo the handsome young italoirish writer buddy of rufus and lover of ida there are richard and cass vivaldos friends who find their marriage deteriorating as richard becomes successful as a novelist and there are eric and yves about to resume in another country the unorthodox liaison that had rooted in france all these people are joined in subtle and painful and dangerous ways but it is rufus angry ineffectual and doomed who is central to the novel his despair in life and finally his death shadow the lives of all the others and oddly it is with rufus that james baldwin the writer flirts with failure with rufus and ida the two negro characters emerge as the least sympathetic the least well realized of the crop of course this could have been intentional just possibly bitterness can bind thwart development distort perhaps baldwins portraits of rufus and ida are deliberately onesided perhaps he is saying this is a fruit of denial however many readersof all raceswill wish that rufus and ida were as complete and believable as cass and richard and eric and vivaldo their being so would have brought a truly outstanding literary achievement closer to a great one as it is a nother country is a novel most americans ought to read corinna back door slid open j np slowly cautiously jl quietly the little face kcscf p eered round wide eyed there was no one in the dirty littered kitchen that meant that mama and the man were still asleep the little girl eased into the kitchen pushing the door shut with both hands clasped tightly about the knob the child was dressed in a ragged uneven faded gingham skirt and a soiled blue sweater her pigtailed kinky hair was a ratsnest from her nights sleep and she wore runover oxfords on her skinny feet she wore also like a protective capelet a shrinking conciliatory man ner that people found quite irritating because it made them feel so guilty for she made them remember the many crimes they had committed against love harassed mothers seeing her idling timidly among their children would call her to them and comb her hair and give her slices of bread and peanutbutter then the little girl corinna her name was became whiny and clinging and the mothers would brusquely reject her for while it was a shame she wasnt really their problem and she did have a mother such as she was and they hardly had enough time for their own kids what with washing and cooking and ironing and gossiping it was a roundrobin kind of thing on this saturday morning mrs della somers a rather new neighbor had kindly told corinna to go along home and get herself cleaned up and if it was all right with corinnas mommy they could walk up to town together mrs della somers had only lived in the rancid neighborhood for a few weeks and she had taken a fancy to corinna being a childless elderly widow and the pattern was emerging once more but mrs della somers was not yet tired of corinnas perpetual hanging about with her big eyes beseeching with her incessant demands to go to the store for you or get you a glass of water sweep your floor help you wash mrs somers did what she could for the little girl mrs della somers was a thwarted romantic not a realist poverty had not ever made her cynical and rendered her judgment harsh so corinna slid into the cold empty dirty kitchen and hesitantly crossed to her mothers closed bedroom door she knocked silence she knocked silence she knocked and said mamma timidly and gaining courage mamma she knocked her little knuckles making a little noise mamma faint stirrings and the rumble of a male voice corinna heartened called mamma what her mothers voice was slurred and morningfoggy miz somers want take me to town well go on she gonna get you

to distinguish words the door was wrenched open and corinnas mother entered the kitchen she ignored her daughter and went over to the dirty table pushing dishes aside and picking up a crumpled package of cigarettes she greedily lighted one and let the burnt match flutter to the floor boy have i gotta clean house today how cum you diden warsh up these dishes i doan know corinna whined but her mother did not pursue the subject what she taken you to town fer i doan know she jus ask me like she did last week corinna stared at her mother her mother was handsome she had an earthy strong quality that looked good even in the early morning light she was clad in a mans striped robe and her heavy ropy hair was undone about her moody face she looked straight ahead smoking hard at the cigarette she want me to come on mamma dam ol biddyshe ask things bout me well find the comb waitits in my purseyou got any clean sockswait a minnit corinnas mother disappeared into the bedroom there was the sound of voices indistinct at first then clearly waitll i get her dressed corinna waited impassively listening picking at her fingers her stance pigeontoed her belly pouched an awkward unlovely child with great eyes and a profile that would someday have been very pure and lovely her mother reentered the room get you cloes off girl you coulda been undress aincha got a clean dress there in the wardrobe corinnas mother cleaned out the comb and dropped the hair on the floor corinna removed her skirt and sweater and stepped out of her shoes her mother went to the tall old wardrobe that stood in one kitchen comer and opened the doors and peered inside she pulled out a plaid cotton dress that had remnants of lace clinging to a white collar and she bent foraging for socks and found a pair of only slightly soiled white ones here wear these i aint warshed yet guess i better do it today an clean this nasty pigpen how cum you caint warsh out your socks and underpants i gotta work like a dog all week in other folks houses an work like a dog on satday in my own cmon lemme comb your hair corinna went obediently to stand before her mother the woman pulled the starched faded little dress over corinnas head and deftly buttoned up the buttons she kept up a continuous monologue as her hands transformed corinnas hair into beautiful shining plaits there she said go warsh your face and put lotion on your laigs corinna went timidly into her mothers bedroom she passed the big rumpled bed with averted eyes but the man hailed her hello there sweetcakes goin byby hereheres a dime get you somethin to drink on me gettin to be a big ol gal aint you how old are you now corinnas reply was inaudible but the man laughed meaninglessly and leaning in the bed on one elbow he held out to corinna a shining silver coin she took it not looking at him and said thank you with a nod of her head and she fled from his mockery corinnas mother laid her daughters coat across a kitchen chair cmonthat lady aint gonna wait all day there was a gentle knock upon the back door corinnas mother ran the comb through her own hair pulled the bedroom door shut and cinched her bathrobe all in one fluid movement she flung a libelous look around the kitchen and opened the door mrs della somers stood there smiling her gentle wide aging face expectant hello mrs wales corinna ask if we could go to town together we wont be gone long im just going to pay some bills and get a little meat she smiled at corinna who was shrugging into her coat why shure missis somers she enjoys goin with you so much excuse this kitchenive worked every day this week and jes havent had time to clean up my own dirt ha ha its a ratrace aint it but she all cleaned up and ready corinna you all ready honey yes mamma

up and held it out to her mother i wont need it mamma i got a nickel and a quarter from babysitting while janeys mamma went off to the shoe store you put it up fo me corinna meant no harm she simply did not want the strange mans silver but her mother stared at her while mrs della somers stood in the doorway looking neat and sober in her cloth coat and her sensible cloche hat smiling at them both corinna put the money on the tables edge ready dear mrs della somers asked holding out her shabbily gloved hand pick up that dime corinna an get youself a coke like joe say fer you t do i doan want it

ill take it see here i got it and corinna reached for the coin but her mothers sure hand snaked forth and scooped up the thin shining dime and she pushed it into her daughters palm you stay here an hep me clean up this filthy house since you too fool good to accep a gift oh mamma ill keep it i jes wanted you to have it please mamma corinna dryeyed flung herself against mrs della somers and that lady felt her heart turn over with grief corinna held the woman tightly burrowing her face into her plump body holding the gentle woman tightly tightly in a grip of love and longing and fear holding the clean smell and the warmth within her skinny arms and she was quiet now silent and terrified of she knew not what only wishing to cling to this steady rock her childish reason overwhelmed mrs della somers horribly embarrassed by the show of naked emotion attempted to break the childish hold and she laughed foolishly and helplessly saying now now corinnas mother rushed n forward yanking at her daughters arms and there began a brazen fearful terrible waltz around the unsightly kitchen damn brat turn her loose turn that woman loose doin everybody jus the same holdin to em wantin to be wherever you aint wanted i hear em talk evbody jus the same hatin to see you cornin an glad to see you leavin let her be she began to slap viciously at the girl chopping at the frail hugging arms wait wait mrs wales please wait mrs della somers put her gloved hands protectively around corinnas head standing still and facing the angry mother feeling corinna feeling the trembling feeling the seeking and she said quietly let me talk to her she lost to herselfcorinna honey turn me loose and look at me she rubbed her hands across the childs head gently talking to her gentling her soothing her maybe mammall let you go with me another time you got to be a good girl and mind your ma you know honey now stand back an let me see your little face now look look up at me back off and let me see your eyes and ill hold your hands tight in mine corinna responded to the kindly voice and looked up deeply into mrs della somers face and mrs della somers felt her heart shred in half they ignored corinnas mother and the man who now stood peeping around the cracked bedroom door now mrs somers said smiling listen honey ill go on to town and get my shopping done and ill buy you a nice surprise if mama dont care maybe some cookies or a nice dolly even at the tencent store but mama says you got to stay home cause you dont want to do as she says and we must always mind our mamas honey she looked at corinnas mother im sorry bout this mrs wales i didnt mean but to take her down for a little treat and bring her right on back just like last week if i had my way id take her a thousand miles away from you and youd never see her again on this earth but she yours and not mine and that mean that you got the law with you though you aint fit to raise up a dog even much less a little shy girlchile she bent and kissed corinna on the cheek and dropped the small hands and she turned and went swiftly out not shutting the door behind her what was all that about the man asked staring he needed a shave get that coat off corinnas mother said evenly she went toward the bedroom without answering the man and the door was shut behind her the little girl was left standing in the middle of the room she stood there shadowy wispy quiet her hands clasped together upon her flat breast she opened her hands a little and the dime fell to the floor and rolled about until it came to rest under the black oldfashioned stove corinnas mother found it there that afternoon when she swept the kitchen and she held it in her hand looking at it and suddenly she began to weep chitterlings for breakfast marge wheeled her shopping cart slowly along the aisles of the eknunuka air base commissary it was her first time there and she had no idea where to find the items she wanted but having to move slowly and look carefully worked no hardship on marge she rather enjoyed it because it gave her a sense of adventure not knowing exactly what she would see next she loved the excitement of discovering something new whether it was just groceries in an unfamiliar store or new people or even new places however this yen for excitement and surprises did not show on marges face she was a rather tall slender reservedlooking brown skinned woman who looked her age which was she wasnt pretty by a long shot but neither was she unpleasant to look at marge was just average and knew it and never let it bother her she had been in alaska for only about two months having gone there with her soldier husband and their year old twin boys actually her husband was in the army and they usually shopped at the army commissary but the apartment they rented was much closer to eknunuka air base and they had decided to try the air base commissary for a change frankie her husband a tall dark excitinglooking gi was busy talking to an airman he knew and marge hoped that they would talk for a long time so she could shop in peace when frankie went shopping with her he was always throwing things into the shopping cart that wrecked her food budget he believed in the large economy size he bought things like kingsize boxes of frozen crabs gallon cans of concentrated grape juice and pound turkeys last week they had consumed so much grape juice until it seemed it was running out of their ears she shopped leisurely but finally she had everything she needed except meat this she always shopped for last no special reason it was just a habit she went to the meat section and picked up a five pound roast and put it in her cart it was pretty reasonable only cents a pound as her eyes roved further over the meat counter she suddenly stiffened and ex claimed under her breath well ill be darned for there in front of her in the frozen meat section was a container that plainly said chitterlings she was completely flabbergasted for a moment because chitterlings was the last thing she had expected to see in alaska they seemed like such a backhome type of food seeing the container brought to her a rush of pleasant and unpleasant memories she thought first of her maternal grandmother one summer when marge was years old her mother and father who lived in racine wisconsin but originally came from birmingham alabama had decided to send her there to visit her grandmother for two weeks marge had fallen in love with the gentle softspoken old lady at first sight grandma lewis as she was called lived in a beautiful but weatherbeaten old twostory frame house in the best colored section of town her own mother had migrated from a plantation in camp hill alabama when the slaves were freed during the civil war grandma lewis had been born in birmingham reared there married and had children there all of whom had migrated up north she kept marge fascinated by the hour telling her stories out of her own past and tales her mother had passed down to her of happenings during slavery times but best of all she was a superb cook and marge gained pounds in the two weeks she was there grandma lewis filled her up on corn bread collard greens blackeyed peas and blackberry cobbler grandma lewis also introduced marge to chitterlings one day marge had gone to visit a girl she had met there and when she returned to her grandmothers house a highly obnoxious odor met her at the door it was chitterlings cooking but after they were done marge tasted them to please her grandmother and to her surprise found that like limburger cheese they tasted a whole lot better than they smelled as a matter of fact she liked them so well that her grandmother had to fix them for her three times before she left when marge returned to wisconsin she told her mother about the wonderful southern dishes she had tasted and especially about the chitterlings she asked her mother why didnt they ever have chitterlings sometimes her mother smiled grimly and said listen sweetie eating chitterlings is just as bad as if i were to sit out on our front porch with a big slice of bright red watermelon and eat it all the white folks passing by would see me and snicker about it they all think we cant afford to eat anything else but chitterlings collard greens and watermelons ill have to admit they taste pretty good but your father and i have been trying to get away from being stereotyped ever since we left alabama were determined to live dress and eat exactly like everyone else by everyone else you mean white folks dont you mother said marge dont be difficult marge said her mother testily after that marge didnt mention chitterlings again but when she went away to camp winnepeg the next summer and they served watermelon she found herself taking furtive glances at the white girls to see if they might be watching her in any peculiar way and the second time it was served she refused her portion saying she didnt care for it since that time in the circles in which she moved and the places her husband was stationed chitterlings were seldom seen or mentioned although they had bought watermelon several times but now seeing them sitting there in of all places alaska she smiled to herself and on the spur of the moment picked up a twopound container and thrust it into her shopping cart after all it was only cents when she and frankie returned to the apartment and were unpacking the groceries he saw the container of chitterlings he stared at it with his mouth hanging open and finally said well where on earth did you pick that up us members sure will find our own wont we marge laughed and explained that she was surprised to see them herself then frankie looked at her and a little frown appeared on his forehead and marge knew right away that he wasnt amused he said now listen marge personally i like chitterlings although i havent eaten any since i was a little boy but dont you think theres a time and place to eat and cook them after all were the only colored family living in this apartment building right now and we have to sorta set the right example uh we dont want to give these people anything to criticize us about they already think that all we colored folks eat is chitterlingstype food and you must know that chitterlings smell like hell cookin we want them to smell the aroma of roast beef ham and roast pork and so forth cornin from this apartment not this mess marge felt guilty right away because she didnt know why she had bought the chitterlingsshe never had beforedidnt actually know how to cook themand it was true that she and frankie had to be on their best behavior especially since they were the only colored in the buildingbut gosh it was downright stupid to stop eating something just because somebody else looked down on it she asked frankie well what about the italians and their garlicky spaghetti and meat balls are they ashamed huh i dont see why we cant eat roast beef ham and chitterlings too there is no reason frankie exploded except its better to eat chitterlings in a chitterlings neighborhood furthermore i dont even want to smell them cooking myself so youd better find some way of cooking them when im not here or else throw them to hell out then he stalked out of the door marge stuck the chitterlings in the refrigerator and put the other groceries away and sat down and wondered just how shed gotten involved in that silly hassle over chitterlings besides the other tenants in the building werent very friendly anywaythey probably didnt care whether she had chitterlings or didnt have chitterlings she had met most of the women downstairs in the washroom at one time or another when she went down to use the machines but aside from saying hello and asking her in an offhand way how she liked alaska and was she army or air force all of them were rather standoffish the woman across the hall who was obviously a real southerner judging from her accent spoke to her whenever they passed in the hall but she hadnt come over to welcome marge into the building she probably couldnt stand colored people anyway truthfully marge was so lonely sometimes until she could just bawl her loneliest moments were just after the twins left for school then the apartment seemed deadly quiet she muttered to herself now what am i going to do with those darn chitterlings gosh now that ive paid for them id hate like the dickens to throw them away then suddenly she had a bright idea i know what ill do thought marge ill wait until thursday night when frankie goes out to play poker with his friends and late when everybody is either asleep or out ill cook the chitterlings that way the smell wont interfere with anyone now if i remember right i think grandma just boiled them but come to think of it hers werent frozen maybe id better look in my cookbook and see if i can find anything about them marge got her cookbook and rapidly turned to the section on meat but couldnt find a thing on the preparation of chitterlings but she decided that boiling was the only way and thats exactly how she would fix them frankie said nothing more to her about the chitterlings and thursday night he went happily off to his poker game probably wondering why she didnt blow a fuse as usual the twins kept up a constant yakityyak until when marge shooed them off to bed around she looked in the hallcloset and took out the can of chlorophyll room deodorant and then cursed because it was empty she had forgotten that the twins were using it the other day when she went out of course the little monsters had used up the entire container well no matter she was going to use the fan in the kitchen anyway maybe it would suffice m at she began her selfappointed task and when she finally had the chitterlings boiling on the stove she was ready to admit that they were highly perfumed to say the least after sticking a fork in them for the umpteenth time she was finally satisfied that they were cooked but for some reason she didnt have any desire to eat them she turned off the fire and pushed them to the back of the stove and went to bed but not before opening all the windows in the kitchen and living room to make sure the smell would all go out although with the fan going it wasnt as bad as she had expected when frankie finally arrived home and found all the windows open in the middle of december in alaska he thought marge had finally flipped her wig until he found out the purpose of it all at first he was pretty angry but then he finally saw the light or so he said to marge he told her honey i guess we can eat roast beef ham and chitterlings too but for gods sake make sure you have plenty of room deodorant next time marge knew that he probably said that only because he had arrived home so late and was fending off any kind of argument but when he left for work the next morning the chitterlings were still sitting on the back of the stove untouched marge gave the twins their breakfast and they went off to school after the twins left marge decided she would just have toast and jam for her own breakfast and was just clearing away the soiled dishes of the twins when the doorbell rang oh cripes said marge i wonder who that isand me in my housecoat who is it she said its lola the girl across the hall said a voice in a slow drawl oh god marge thought ill bet she was up late last night and smelled those chitterlings cooking and has come to complain she opened the door and there stood lola in her hat and coata tall slender pretty girl with a round face sparkling eyes and an unmistakable southern accent she looked to be about not far from marges own age may ah come in foah a minute ah jus drove mah

big pot of chitterlings sitting on the back of my stove why dont you take off your coat and lets dive right in where is the church goin on the sunday follow ing the brutal mob ac tions at the bus depots in anniston and birmingham alabama a dispirited episcopal communicant of the latter city wrote there is no condemnation of the riots from our pulpit today there was no moral guidance in a time when the eyes of the world were focused on our state and nation our churches really have become gymnasiums where we exercise with the reading of the book of common prayer neither sweating nor breathing hard in the stuffy air of sanctity in an eastern city last summer i had a pleasant visit with an able young newspaperman a negro and an episcopal communicant it developed that later in the afternoon he was meeting his son who was coming home from camp via bus you might be interested to know i said that the diocese of atlanta has just had its first integrated camp one negro boy aged applied and promptly was accepted he proved to be a popular camper and had no difficulty at all his personality was such that he did not feel alone or an outsider and of course this personality was precisely why the other boys did not think of him in such terms the young newspapermans eyes widened you did that in georgia i nodded affirmatively we couldnt do that here he said i am grieved to say that here we do not have a very happy relationship between the white and negro episcopal churches there is little communication between us some feel there is a drawing apart there is a need for some positive action how did the atlanta diocese manage the camp it was explained that when the youngster applied for camp and was accepted the clergy and laymen on the camp committee informed by letter all parents of other boys who had been accepted they were told they could withdraw their son or sons if they wished but earnest hope was expressed they would not none did officials in the small city near the camp mikel quietly were informed the teenage counselors were briefed on their practical and christian duties all went well it was a happy rewarding experience each of us recognized the jarring contradictions in the drama of race in alabama brutal mobs were for some time unchecked by police in that time there were inflicted severe injuries to many for the crime of having ridden on a bus to which they had been sold a ticket in mississippi the jails were being filled with white and colored travelers young and middleaged who were testing what is an incredible denial in this last half of the twentieth centurythe right of a citizen of the united states freely to travel on common carriers and to use the public services in the depots it is a sad commentary that the episcopal churches in these states were largely sunday gymnasiums insofar as any leadership in the tremendous moral problem of our time was concerned nor were they alone the silence of all the churches was inescapable later there was a mild protest by some ministers against the inactivity of police but still there is no action only silence in georgia one small boy makes episcopal camping history by being accepted at the camp maintained by the diocese for the summer recreation and instruction of its young people in an eastern state a young negro doubted this could have been done in his diocese there is a third illustrationand a more damning one there came to atlanta university two brilliant young negro students graduates of mission schools in their native country maintained by one of the larger protestant southern denominations neither was ever called upon by members or officers of that denomination a distinguished member of nigerias high court who had been educated in elementary and secondary schools and colleges all maintained by one of the largest of us denominations visited four southern cities and four in the north and was never approached by any representative of the church which had given him all but his graduate education still another african visitor whose youth had been spent in schools supported by american missions had a similar experience i am glad i was ignored he said i have heard your joke about the african visitor who was finally admitted to a restaurant with the apology of the manageryou see i thought you were one of these american negroes i am afraid i would not have been happy talking with a pastor who would not admit american negroes to worship in his churcheven though the same church educated me there is more than one reason why christianity is not more of a force in the newly emergedand emergingcountries of africa but one of them is this inescapable gulf which the african intellectual quickly sees even though he has never been out of africa a visitor here of course experiences the harsh irony of it the episcopal church in america suffers equally with the others all are afflicted by those callous persons of christian affiliation who insist that the negro is an inferior person and that segregation is decreed by god nor may we episcopalians play the pharisee and pass on the other side from these the ugly distorted even vicious publications of the more fanatic white citizens councils and the hateorganization pamphlets delight in printing sermons and statements from the three or four episcopal rectors in the southern states who lend their names and positions to the prejudices and passions of the extremists certain questions are posed is there any thoughtful person who does not understand why communism which also claims it can redeem and change the world is able to attract so much dedicated service especially though not exclusively in so many depressed areas of the world one must ask what sort of examples or alternatives are offered them missionaries all over the world have sent urgent pleas to their churches in america to put christianity to work in americas problem of race some churches clergymen and laymen have acted with vigor and courage but it still is true that am on sunday is the most segregated hour of all the week that christianity in america cannot go on with this without disastrous results must be plain to all save the most stubbornly obtuse it is not easyand yet in fact it is if there is a will to act that we think in terms of images has become almost a trite truth but truth it is when confronted with something which radically alters the status quo we invent mental images to help us rationalize resistance to change in southern school cases the extremiststoo often assisted by the daily press members of the clergy the bar and the politiciansinvariably conjured up two false ones they first rubberstamped every negro as dirty illiterate criminal or dishonest that this reflected one of the worst evils of segregationa separation from truth and fact and acquaintance with the great body of educated cultured negroesnever occurred to these makers of false images they then pictured the children of such persons as overrunning the schools and then paradoxically they expressed unreasoned fear about intermarriage and the loss of racial purity that the us supreme court decisions plainly had said this overrunning was not the intent of the rulings and had declared placement laws to be constitutional when not used to discriminate was blithely ignored in a campaign to deceive people and create resistance defiance and mobs that most of the nations population had for a long time been operating without laws requiring segregation and without signs of the much feared raceruin also was bypassed the extremists were in fact insulting their own people by implying that only they of all americans were in need of such laws this obsession with false images can be as harmful to christianity as false gods common sense somehow becomes paralyzed it is utterly preposterous that in this period of history millions of americans should be most concerned with where a colored child shall sit in school and whether colored persons shall be welcomed to worship christianity cannot afford to be made to appear ridiculousand yet it is even christians must agree that the long history of foreign missions and the opposition of christians to acceptance of colored persons in their churches would be the subject of loud coarse laughter were it not for the byproduct of it a number of christian and judaic leaders in individual sermons in the past several months seriously have suggested that fewer and fewer persons are using religion as a yardstick for determining values all the evidence tends to sustain them the episcopal church which sensibly avoided any rupture at the time of the american civil war should be better able to act with common sense and christian conviction than those denominations which divided in acrimony and prejudice a decision to accept negro worshipers which results in years of budgets being unmet and building programs bankrupted is perhaps valid in a temporary and superficial manner it is unlikely that any diocese which planned prayed and educated its communicants would suffer any real losses but it may be that the christian churchnot merely the episcopalis at the point where it must face up to losing those persons who cannot entertain the idea of being in the same sanctuary or at the same communion rail with a colored person to compromise almost surely means a slow death as communicants with a prodding sense of conscience and morality drop out this would certainly be true of the young communicants the problem of race is not of course the only one facing christianity today there is the complex problem of growing urban populations the shifts to suburbs the abandonment of many city churches and the urgent need for christian leadership in the socalled asphalt jungles of the large cities but that of race is the most pressing of all many voices ask where is the church going only the church can answer how to tell your child about hildren observe many things for themselves they hear talk among other children and are aware of much more than we realize the parent with the attitude what my child doesnt know wont hurt him is burying her head in the sand children are naturally curious about sex matters and if they cant get the answers at home they get them elsewhere resulting in a welter of guiltladen fact and fallacy how do you handle your childs interest in sex matters here are some of the questions parents ask about the subject and some sugges tions for guidance remember its not merely the words you use in explaining sex to your child that matter but how you say them your expression and gestures your attitude toward sex in general the mother who snatches a childs hand away when he touches his genitals who acts disgusted when he displays interest in his bowel movements who is horrified when he shows curiosity concerning his body is teaching him that the body is dirty and that everything about it including sex is bad many children taught to feel this way grow up abnormal sexually or else they are unable to enjoy sex relations at what age should a child he told there is no right age questions should be answered when asked the younger the children the more wholesome and unashamed is their interest in sex some children begin asking at the age of three or four some at six or seven perhaps at the tender age of two a little girl may point to the genitals of a baby brother and ask whats that she should not be made ashamed of having asked an honest question and should receive an honest answer little boys and men all have that you might say its called a penis thats how they do weewee girls and women have a little opening for weewee its called a vagina you never know when a child will pop a question about sex at you and so you have to be prepared dont put your children off with ill tell you when youre older or you shouldnt bother about such things theyll get the feeling that their questions are bad they wont stop wondering but they may stop asking their parents and go underground for their answers some of which will be unwholesome some parents have the idea that the sex training of the child need not begin until adolescence but by that time his behavior patterns sexual and otherwise will be pretty much fixed for life at this point all you can do is try to correct faulty ideas acquired in childhood and relieve anxieties arising from sexual maturation correcting faulty ideas isnt easy the sex superstitions picked up from other children and carried over into adulthood are difficult to eradicate that is why it is important to give your child the fundamentals early wont knowing the details make children over conscious of sex regardless sexual interests are bound to come to children anyway secrecy rather than honesty is likely to make them over sexconscious the more you surround the subject of sex with mystery and secrecy the more concerned children become with finding out what the secret is your child will discover the facts of life eventually what parents do when they talk to their children is to help them understand students of child development find that if children learn about sex simply and naturally and can ask questions freely they are less likely to go in for sex practices than children who have been made to feel that it is wrong to even think of such matters unsatisfied curiosity coupled with feelings of guilt and rejection account for most of the objectionable sex behavior in children of any age isnt it possible to tell children too much about sex yes when your child asks a specific question answer simply and briefly and then stop dont go into elaborate details when a child first asks where babies come from the simplest answers will satisfy himan elaborate explanation will only serve to confuse him mommie where did i come from in a special place inside mommy right here see at first you were just a tiny seed and then you grew into a beautiful baby was i happy to have you for my own where does the baby come out through the opening in the mothers body called the vagina it is between her thighs does it hurt to have a baby yes but the doctor knows how to make it easier for the mother and once she has her baby she is so happy she forgets all about the pain what about children who never ask questions should they be told anyway children are always curious about the body even if they dont appear to be perhaps theyre afraid to ask questions of their parents because they sense an embarrassment or perhaps they have the idea these things are bad or it may be theyve been told to wait till theyre older such children may have secret sex worries that could cause fear and nervousness its better to get them out in the open so for the child who never comments or asks questions a mother may divulge information in a casual way during toileting for example she may say you know boys and girls urinate differently the boy has a penis so he stands up for a girl because her body is different its easier to sit down or isnt it nice aunt loretta is going to have a baby its growing inside her right now thats why shes fatter than she used to be it is better for healthy sex development and adjustment if children feel free to wonder and ask questions what to do when a child shares the sex information youve given him with the neighborhood you might tell him these matters are a private family affair and its a matter of custom not to discuss them outside the home if your child expresses the urge to tell his friend jimmy how babies get born explain that its better for jimmys mother to tell him since she may want to explain it in her own way or may not want to tell him at all until hes old enough to understand this will give your child the good feeling of being pretty grownup for his age make all this a suggestion not a command since forbidden topics are always intriguing should we teach our children the correct names of the parts of the body and bodily functons even while theyre still young it is well for children to know that there are correct words for the parts of the body and its functions and that these words are not silly or dirty it makes it easier to answer their sex questions over a long period of time if you dont have to use baby substitute words by becoming accustomed to the correct words children take them so for granted that they never seem funny or personal but rather just plain natural another thing if your child knows the correct scientific terms for the anatomy hell be less likely to pick up the inevitable vocabulary of the streets should we allow our children to see us nude or let them undress in front of each other if very small children are allowed to wander naturally in and out of the bathroom when either parent is bathing or dressing bodily differences are noted gradually and accepted matteroffactly questions can be answered casually and information acquired so gradually that a child is hardly aware of having been told anything children need to know that there is a difference in sexes let two three and fouryearolds bathe and shower together without selfconsciousness and they will know and accept sex differences the youngster who has never seen a child of the opposite sex undressed is the one who will be most curious about the matter you might think that such early freedom will persist into the school years it doesnt gradually the child himself desires some privacy and acquires reserve is it a good idea to let a child watch his dog or cat give birth if it happens when the child is present it will be a natural lesson on birth for him from then on hell know how babies are bom he wont have to wonder should we punish our children for using bad language dont act shocked or horrified let your child know youre familiar with the words and their meanings then explain that it is bad manners to use them like nosepicking in public and therefore offensive make it clear there are certain standards of politeness and decency which everyone should respect shouldnt a child be stopped from handling his genitals this is a normal thing for youngsters to do all babies explore their bodies and so discover the sensitivity of the genital organs dont punish the child or tell him hes bad or that it will make him sick especially dont tell him he will lose his penis or that someone will cut it off this results in fear and worry that could be injurious draw his attention away from his genitals by putting a toy or game into his hands by playing with him by giving him something to do most children outgrow such handling if it persists it may be that your child is seeking satisfactions that normally would result from warm human relationships with you or other children be more affectionate with him read to him spend time with him if the problem still persists consult your family doctor shouldnt sex play among children be stopped this is a more common occurrence than most people think youngsters will go with each other into the bathroom and discuss naughty words or giggle about toilet functions they ask to see each others genitals even touch and stimulate each other or they may play veiled sex games such as doctor or mother and father parents should see that children dont have too much opportunity for sex play it isnt wise to let children share a bed constantly or for brothers and sisters to share a room to prevent sex play tell your child that playing sexually is not a good thing to do answer any questions he may ask see that he has interesting work and play to keep him busy dont shame threaten or punish him keep your attitude friendly stress social custom rather than sin the following books are recommended a baby is born the story of how life begins by milton i levine and jean h seligmann simon and schuster for children seven to ten the wonder of life by same authors and publisher as above for children ten or older the wonderful story of how you were born by sidonie matsner gruenberg doubleday and company for children eight or older and may also be read to younger children african legacy the girl on the bed j writhed suddenly and ii ii sweat gleamed in her contorted face in the guttering light from the coal oil lamp pinkpalmed hands clawed at her distended abdomen and she

woman soothed she bent and slid the knife under the bed knife cuts the pain you is havin honey just like it done when you grandma hepped me have you such scenes are a thing of the past now on beaufort countys sea islands but years ago they were common enough in the little whitewashed homes of the gullah negroes when the slave ships brought them here to work the indigo and cotton the wretched men and women who debarked had few if any of their personal possessions but they did bring their tribal superstitions and the medical lore of their native africa handing them down by wordofmouth to the generations that have tilled these fertile islands the old timers remember those remedies today although they go now to their family physician or to the county health dept on beauforts boundary street when sickness strikes the simple folk remedies are no longer needed now that bridges and modem roads link the sea islands and a car stands beside almost every gullah home it was a different story when the only way to get from island to island was by boat doctors were few here then and hospitals nonexistent in those days the old mother mightand probably didresort to several home remedies to ease her daughters childbirth pains she might have had the girl blow into a bottle and she probably rubbed her well with a mixture of sulphur and lard possibly she forced her to drink a tea made by boiling a dirtdaubers nest in water if the labor pains were slow in starting the dirtdaubers tea might have been made with tanay to speed things up once the baby arrived the old woman probably slipped a thimbleful of salt under the mattress to relieve the pains of afterbirth those were timetested measures known to every gullah mother in the days when she was not only the housewife but the family doctor too with the child safely born there were other things that could be done for it and for the new mother to make teething easier a black beetle was sewn into a bag and hung around the infants neck if the child became feverish a large green leaf was placed on his head when the young mother returned to her work in the fields she tied a string around her babys wrist so she would know if he cried while she was away if the infant died everyone knew that needles threaded on a string and worn around the mothers neck would dry up her milk by no means all of the gullah remedies were intended for babies and their mothers people who make their living with hoe and ax sometimes get cut and there were special measures for such wounds cobwebs were spread on a cut to stop bleeding and it was common knowledge that soot was good for cuts ashes and salt rubbed in well were a fine healing mixture if those measures failed and the wound became infected they cut open a fowl or an animal took out the heart and pressed it to the wound when the heart turned green they knew it had drawn out the poison fever was a dread scourge of the sea islands but the gullahs were ready when it came they drank a tea brewed from horehound and water or from the long silver wisps of a plant known as life everlasting or rabbit tobacco this latter was good not only for fever but for many other diseases old people then as now had aches and pains for rheumatism and arthritis they drilled a hole in a copper penny and tied it to an ankle with a bit of string salt and sweat caused some of the copper to be absorbed by electrolysis and gave them some relief a salve of axle grease was another favorite remedy and the more desperate sufferers from rheumatism allowed a bee to sting them if all else failed they got a live bullfrog cooked it in boiling lard and rubbed the painful joints with the resulting mixture with no dentists handy they took a drop of lye and placed it in the cavity when a hollow tooth began to ache if a horse or mule had lampas the thing to do was slit the gums and rub salt into the cuts headaches must have been as common then as now for the gullahs had a long list of remedies that antedated the aspirin tablet one cure was to tie a string around the head others soaked a piece of brown paper in vinegar and salt and placed it on the sufferers forehead or they made a poultice of vinegar salt and pounded garlic and spread it on the back of the neck for a real kingsize skull buster the remedy was to bathe the entire head in a tea brewed from mullen and of course everyone knew that a red flannel strap worn around the wrist would stop almost any type of pain for the sick the best painkiller was a smoothing iron slipped under the bed without the patient seeing it boils were a common affliction one heroic cure was a salve made from cow dung and vinegar heated together a poultice made from cactus roots was just the ticket to drain an abscess mumps would leave no serious after effects if the neck had been rubbed with sardine grease and smallpox was much less painful if one drank brown pea liquor or a mixture of lard and cassena a tallow plaster on the chest warded off pneumonia and garlic in whisky prevented influenza if you caught a cold a mixture of ashes and lemon juice would put you right as rain in no time dont think the old hands neglected other phases of preventive medicine to ward off disease in general they wore a bag of asafetida around the neck this might also ward off a few friends but good health was cheap at half the price there was also a way to stop bedwetting although how many were brave enough to try it history says not the bedwetter had to drink a tea made by brewing a rat in water some ills came from the spirit not the flesh therefore when the root doctor had conjured you about the only thing you could do to nullify the voodoo spell was to sip a tea of ground garlic and vinegar every morning when you arose how effective were these folk remedies not very probably although you have to concede that these and similar cures were the genesis of modem medicine with all its gadgets and wonder drugs possibly the sheer faith people had in the old remedies hastened many a cure scientists are still trying to determine the extent to which the mind rules the body the chances are that there was more than one hard kernel of scientific truth tucked away in the old african tribal lore one man who suspects this is somers pringle administrator of the beaufort county health dept he remembers a trip to isolated coosaw island years ago to see how many of the natives were suffering from fever about three out of four admitted recent chills aches and high temperatures but not one of them was in need of treatment that day they had made tea from tabbit tobacco and a few of them had gone by bateau to a store and brought back a bottle or two of tonic mr pringle recalls something worked we couldnt find a single active case of fever at least one timehonored folk remedy works mr pringle insists although possibly not the way the oldsters thought its the old practices of dosing children each spring with sulphur and molasses mosquitoes will not bite a person who has sulphur in his blood the health official said whether they knew it or not mothers who gave their children that mixture were making them immune to feverbearing mosquitoes in the summer months but the old remedies are being discarded and forgotten the gullahs have shifted their allegiance to the pill and the needle you goes to the doctor and he stick you one time with that needle an island housewife said the next day you just as good as you ever was modern medicine has won its battle in the sea islands maybe ill pitch forever the rest of that winter they filled up those sports pages all over the country with stories about how i was still good enough to be in the majors but nothing happened when it didnt i went back to the kansas city monarchs only just mr baird was my boss there now mr wilkinsond decided to kind of retire but mr wilkinson being gone wasnt the biggest thing that was different that season what was different was that i was making a lot less money after jackie robinsond gotten into the major leagues folksd started forgetting all about negro baseball all those old fans were only watching the major league teams and jackie it kept getting worse every time the major league teams signed up another colored boy the worse it got the less i got since i usually was paid a percentage of the gate on top of my regular salary even with me going on fortytwo the way i was throwing i still felt i was too young to take any cut in pay you dont want to settle for less until you know for sure you just cant get that big money anymore and it began to look like the only way i could stay in that big money was to get in the majors i looked and looked but i couldnt see any doors open for me the longer that old door stayed shut the more worried i got then it happened when the biggest thing in your life happens you aint got words big enough to say it so i guess you just say it happens id been barnstorming out of town id done a lot of that after mr wilkinson left the monarchs when i got back to town there was this letter from abe saperstein the guy who ran the harlem globetrotters bill veeck who headed up the cleveland indians had asked abe to scout around for some pitching help his ball club was trying for the pennant and they needed somebody to help out on the mound abe scouted around a lot and i guess he figured the negro leagues was the best place to find some quick help and as old as i was there still anybody in the negro that could throw better than me abe knew that he recommended me to the indians and mr veeck wanted me kept telling me to come up for a tryout abes letter asked me to call him and let him know when i could be there i called quick after twentytwo years of throwing i was going to get a crack at the major leagues lahoma and me danced all over the house youll do it satchel lahoma you know you can i got to cleveland on july that was my fortysecond birthday and i was about to get me the best birthday present id ever had mr veeck told me to go in the locker room and get on a uniform while he was getting lou boudreau the indians manager i didnt feel anything i was just numb i guess when i got out on the field lou boudreau was there in his uniform mr veeck and abe saperstein were there too can you still throw like you used to mr lou asked me i got as fast a ball as anybody pitchin now but i got to admit its not half as fast as it used to be but i can still pitch it where i want to can you do that against major leaguers mr lou asked dont you worry about that the plates the same size up here mr lou just grinned why dont you catch satch for about ten minutes and then bat against him mr veeck told mr lou mr lou nodded maybe you want to warm up first satch mr lou asked me yeah id like that why dont you take a lap around the gravel track maybe run about fifty paces and then walk fifty like my boys do i looked around that big ball park but if that was what mr lou wanted me to do id try it i ran about seventyfive yards and that ball park looked bigger than ever i stopped and went back you know mr lou this is an awful big ball park i said i guess i just wont run after all you think youre warmed up enough he asked me i sure am mr lou got him a catchers mitt and went behind the plate i just tossed a couple real easy and then i started firing i wasnt thinking i wasnt trying to get in the majors i wasnt doing anything except just pitching like id always done that was the one thing i really knew how to do finally mr lou told me id thrown enough and i walked up to home plate thats some control satch he told me you didnt miss the strike zone moren four times out of fifty those that missed were only an inch or two off the plate too lets see if you can do that good when i try hitting against you now you want me to shag the balls lou mr veeck said if you want to mr lou answered get over in right field after seeing satchs stuff i dont think im going to pull many balls to left he didnt either after we were done he told me to go in the clubhouse when i walked away mr lou and mr veeck were up close real close jawing away like everything a few minutes later mr veeck came in the locker room lou thinks you can help the club he told me lets go down to the office and sign a contract it was just like that just that easy as easy as itd been for me to pitch all those years i was in the major leagues the old mand made it i signed that contract real quick i was going to get a years salary for only a halfyear of ball after id signed up mr veeck grinned satch he told me im just sorry you didnt come up in your prime youd have been one of the greatest righthanders baseball has ever known if you had not everybody was happy that id gotten into the major leagues most were but there were some who said it was just a cheap publicity stunt maybe mr veeck did want some publicity but he wanted a pitcher too there was only one guy around who could fill both orders that was ol satch some people wrote some mighty nice things after i signed like the story tom meany of new york wrote he said as far as im concerned the signing of satchel paige to a cleveland contract is far more interesting than was the news when branch rickey broke the baseball color line by signing jackie robinson to a montreal contract it was inevitable that the bigotry which kept negroes out of organized ball would be beaten back but id never heard of robinson at that time with paige its different the satchmo has been a baseball legend for a long time a paul bunyan in technicolor more fabulous tales have been told of satchels pitching ability than of any pitcher in organized baseball about a day after i signed mr veeck called a press conference we signed satchel in accordance with our policy of getting the best available material no matter the cost he said we are convinced he is the best available player who has a chance to help us win the pennant when mr veeck said he didnt care about the cost i guess he meant it i didnt get no bonus but i got that good contract and i think abe saperstein got fifteen thousand for finding me when i heard that i couldnt help thinking that mr wilkinson and mr baird ought to get something theyd sponsored me ever since my armd gone dead and i figured they ought to get something for that i told mr veeck how i felt and he agreed he was a mighty fair man he gave mr wilkinson and mr baird five thousand to split that was five thousand more than branch rickey gave them for jackie robinson when he took him from the monarchs it wasnt until the day after i signed that i started feeling things i knew the indians werent the monarchs but id still be out there with a ball in my hand and the fellow at the plated have a bat in his hand maybe theyd knock me all over the place but i was going to have to see them do it i was starting my major league career with one thing in my favor anyway i wasnt afraid of anybody id see in that batters box id been around too long for that i wasnt as fast as i used to be but i was a better pitcher if i couldnt overpower them id outcute them i didnt feel bad about not having all my speed anymore i was happy over still being able to throw why guys i used to pitch against guys like waite hoyt lefty grove lonnie warneke dizzy dean and carl hubbell werent even around anymore but ol satch was i was just starting starting years after those guys hung up their gloves id waited a long time to pitch in the major leagues but i couldnt have asked for a better setting when i got my first chance it was on july and the cleveland indians were playing the st louis browns in clevelands municipal stadium there were about thirtyfive thousand in those stands and lots of them were there just hoping theyd get to see me i didnt let them down bob lemon started for us and he didnt have it he got behind four to one after three and a half innings and they pinchhit for him in the last of the fourth a couple of the other boys and med been warming up out in the bullpen in the last half of the fourth and when we were ready to start the fifth lou boudreau signaled for me it seemed like a mighty long walk from the bullpen to the pitchers mound i didnt go fast no reason wearing myself out just walking i just shuffled along and every time i shuffled the stands busted loose like they never was so happy to see anyone in their life id pitched before a lot more than that a lot of times and id heard more noise but there still were a pretty good bunch of cheerers out there for just an old friday night game when i got to the infield out came all these photographers there must have been ten of them popping flashbulbs in my face they tried crawling over one another to get pictures of me it was such a mess i just dropped my mouth opep and stopped and stood there for a minute the chief um pire bill mcgowan didnt chase those photographers off the field like he was supposed to he must of thought history was being made so he just let them shoot away i guess maybe history was being made i was only about ten feet away from being the first negro ever to plant a spike on an american league pitching mound lou boudreau was on the mound waiting for me he handed me the ball and said something i dont know what it was i wasnt hearing too good i dont even think i heard those fans any more but folks tell me they were making even more noise now that id gotten to the mound i threw my first warmup pitch and all those flashbulbs popped again youd have thought i was the new president or something the photographer finally cleared out of the way and chuck stevens the browns first baseman stepped up to the plate to open the fifth this was it i felt those nerves they were jumping every which way i didnt feel loose at all i guess i wasnt i threw and stevens singled then the nerves were all gone i was pitching and id been doing that too long to be nervous in a game gerry priddy came up and i fired my hard one he bunted and stevens went to second while we were getting priddy out at first there was one out but the browns had a runner in scoring position whitey platt was up i gave him my overhand pitch and my sidearmer and my underhander ana my hesitation he struck out when zack taylor the browns manager saw what i could do with that hesitation pitch he protested but mr mcgowan said it was legal a zarilla came up with two out and stevens still on second i just fired like id always been firing and got him to fly out to right field for the third out we didnt score in the last of the fifth in the top of the sixth dick kokos singled off me and went to second when one of my boys fumbled around with the ball roy partee was up next and cracked the ball good but right into a linedrive double play eddie pellagrini flied out to end the inning mr lou pinchhit for me in the last of the sixth i was through for the night i hadnt set no records but id done what the indians was paying me for id gotten the side out without giving up any runs in the fifth and sixth innings it wasnt much after that game that will harridge president of the american league banned my hesitation pitch he said hed never seen a pitch like that he said i was tricking the batters and umpireshaving the batters swinging at balls when all the time i had the ball in my hand having the umpires calling strikes when the catcher thumped his glove making them lie the first time mr harridge saw that pitch of mine he must have grabbed a rule book and thumbed all through it but couldnt find anything in those rules against it but he didnt like those batters falling all over the plate swinging at nothing and he didnt like me making liars out of the umpires so he decided i couldnt use that hesitation any more man i almost got worried i was afraid if i showed any of my other tricks he might ban them too i figured id better not throw any of that trick stuff just throw that plain stuff like bobby feller and ewell blackwell and those other boys i guess mr harridge didnt want me to show up those boys who were young enough to be my sons i didnt mind though it was pretty tough on those boys having to play against somebody like me they hadnt had to get by like id had to theyd had expensive coaches and guys like that to teach them how to throw they didnt have to figure things out for themselves they had those trainers to rub them down all the time and theyd gotten plenty of rest between games they hadnt had to come up with those trick pitches just to rest their arms and work out the tiredness they never had to pitch every day for a month at a time or play the whole year round i guess that makes a difference and will harridge must have known i was a little too smart for those kids in the major leagues and he didnt want to see me fool them too much so even if it wasnt in the rule book he called my hesitation illegal he didnt want to cause none of them kids who came up against me any hardships i figured id just have to get out there and confuse those kids with ordinary stuff it was about a week before they banned my hesitation pitch that i got a chance to pitch in my second game it wasnt a regular game but an exhibition game against the brooklyn dodgers on july and there were almost sixtyfive thousand in municipal stadium to see it i went in after the dodgers and we were all tied up three and three after six innings i needed only twelve pitches to get that side out i used my old corkscrew windup and it really floored them i whiffed gil hodges on four tosses fanned erv palica on three curves and struck out tom brown on five tosses i retired the side in order in the eighth too and we finally won the game in the eleventh four to three after that i knew i was in i only wished lahomad been there to see it but the baby was keeping her busy and she wasnt going to be able to get up and see me until the end of the month that next day after the exhibition game mr lou sent me in to pitch again if mr lou thought i was too old he sure didnt show it calling on me only a day after id pitched that exhibition game we were playing a doubleheader in philadelphia against the athletics and we won the first game six to one if we won the second game wed have us a league lead of two and a half games and we could use a little breathing room we pushed ahead four to two after five and a half innings in that second game but we couldnt stand that good living philadelphia started getting to bob lemon in the last of the sixth they got a run in and then mr lou decided it was time for ol satch i got us out of trouble quick and we went into the seventh still ahead four to three we got us another run in the top of the seventh and i was ready to just ride home and protect that win for bob lemon but you dont just ride in the majors not even if youre a walter johnson or a dizzy dean or a bob feller or a satchel paige ferris fain doubled off me in the last of the seventh and then hank majeski smashed my trouble ball on the left field roof that tied the score i just shook my head those things happen but they werent going to happen to me any more in that game i was going to make sure of that my boys got me a lead back right off the bat in the eighth ken keltner belted out a home run and i was ahead six to five going into the last of the eighth i put down the as real fast then and in the ninth we got two more runs with that eight to five lead i just whipped right by the as in the last of the ninth id gotten my first major league win eight to five and id given up only one more hit after that home run the as had only three hits for those three and a third innings id pitched i was one and zero in the majors one and zero against guys who were in knee pants or werent even born when id started pitching i kept rolling too about a week later i got the call again we were playing before a capacity crowd of better than sixtyeight thousand in yankee stadium in new york we were still leading the league but that didnt scare the yankees going into the last of the sixth we were behind six to five thats when they sent me in to keep the yankees from getting farther ahead i didnt let them in the two innings i pitched i put them down with only one hit in the sixth and seventh innings and in the seventh i struck out joe dimaggio too joed belted a grand slam home run off bobby feller in the fifth but he only got air off me it wasnt enough though we didnt score anymore and the yankees won by that six to five score but id run my string to seven and a third innings against the major leaguers while giving up only two earned runs with those two innings of shutout balland lahoma saw it shed just gotten there that afternoon by plane she was going to spend the night visiting and then fly back to take care of our baby after the game we went out celebrating like we hadnt since the baby came it was our first chance to celebrate over me being in the majors the next morning lahoma and me got up early so we could have more time together before she had to leave when i looked out the window and saw all those clouds in the sky i knew wed have more time together than id figured i know about weather and those clouds say no game i told lahoma then you can stay with me until i have to leave she said thats just what i did we just sat around talking and watching that rain come down it came down so hard they called off the ball game i heard it on the radio thats just what i told you i said to lahoma then it was time for lahoma to leave and i had to say goodbye to her again thats the way it is when youre a traveling man after i left her i headed for the train station the indians were leaving new york and heading for boston that rainedout game was the last one we were supposed to play in new york on that trip i guess i got kind of mixed up without my teammates with me anyway i went to the wrong station by the time i found that out and got over to the right one the indians traind left id just missed the old train but i caught me a bird over to boston and headed up to see mr lou its very nice of you to decide to join us was all hed say to me thats when i found out how they did things in the majors those boys just dont have heads of their own i guess even if its raining like everything they got to go out to the ball park and wait until somebody tells them to go home mr lou fined me for not coming out to the park and missing that train i didnt mind the fine thats the way they did it in the majors what made me kind of sore was they wouldnt pay me back for that ticket id bought for the airplane over to boston it wasnt much after id missed that train that mr lou came up to me and asked me if i could start sure i can start i told him are you sure he asked me sure im sure i always started before i know that satch but all these boys are topnotchers up here thats what i always played against then old bill mckechnie one of our coaches came in on my side and that seemed to satisfy mr lou you want me to give you any advice on how to pace yourself mr lou asked me no ill just pitch it my way i always have you can lose it like you want to he told me and walked off i guess id upset him but he didnt change his mind about starting me on august he told the papers id pitch the next day against the washington senators in municipal stadium going into that game id been used eight times in relief winning one and losing one id pitched eighteen innings against those major leaguers andd given up only four earned runs nine more innings against them wasnt anything to fret about everybody seemed to forget all about the pennant race when mr lou announced i was going to start but i didnt a win for us in our game with the senators and a loss for philadelphia in its game with chicago would move us into a firstplace tie in the league with the as boston and new york could tie too if they won their games we all were one game behind philadelphia it was a big game getting late in the season like it was every game was a big one you dont play around in the major leagues and i wasnt about to start the first time i got a chance to go all the way that first chance was something to see all right with everybody knowing i was going to pitch better than seventytwo thousand came out to the ball park that was the biggest night crowd in cleveland baseball history and it stood until i beat it myself a couple of weeks later for a few minutes out there it looked like i was going to let all these people down i got one out in the first inning but then my control left me flat i walked two batters and ed stewart slammed a triple off me and gave washington a two to nothing lead before wed even got to bat dont worry none i told mr lou after i got the side out that ol control aint gonna be missing anymore you just leave me in there thats just what mr lou did even if hed wanted to take me out i dont think hed have done it that earlynot with all those folks out there to see me i settled down pretty good after that we got back one run in the last of the fourth but washington squeezed across a run in the top of the fifth my boys tied it up three and three with two runs in the last of the fifth then in the last of the sixth we scored again and i was ahead four to three we got a rally going in the last of the seventh and mr lou sent in a pinchhitter for me that pinchhitter didnt do anything but we still got another run and were ahead five to three ed klieman relieved me and held the senators scoreless in the eighth and ninth and i had me my second win of the year five to three even if i hadnt gone all nine id given up seven hits and after walking those two in the first inning i walked only two more and got me six strikeouts and when i heard that philadelphiad lost to chicago i got a grin on me that didnt quit for a week id pitched us into first place in the american league even if we had to share it with philadelphia boston and new york that day bostond beat st louis and new yorkd beat detroit that pennant race was really getting tough and we all felt it mr lou wasnt playing any of the amateurs because of the way it was going but he was playing ol satch plenty five days after i got that first start he called me in to relieve in the first game of a doubleheader against the new york yankees i went in to pitch the top of the eighth with the score tied six and six and held the yanks while we were getting two runs and got credit for my third win against one loss eight to six when we won the second game of that doubleheader that kept us in first place by six percentage points you dont have to be no pencil whiz to see how much every one of those games meant but op satch wasnt letting the pressure buckle him i was pushing pushing to show good my first chance in the major leagues but pitching that way wasnt any vacation my stomach troubles were getting to me real often sometimes it got so i thought i couldnt throw that ball i remember once we were playing washington and i was out on the mound my catcher jim hegan signaled for a fast ball and i shook him off i had to those pains was hurting so i couldnt throw the ball then jim signaled for a curve ball i still had to shake him off he signaled for my letup and i shook him off again i just had to wait until things quieted down inside me jim came stomping out from the batters box satch he said ive given you everything and you dont want them whats the matter man i got the miseries in my stomach and lefty weisman aint here to help me lefty was the cleveland trainer and he was out sick himself that day but jim called into the dugout and bob lemon came running out with leftys little black bag what does lefty usually give you satch bob asked me somethin white bob fished around in that bag and finally came up with one of those white pills for me i swallowed it down and it wasnt no time before my stomach got real peaceable and i was ready to pitch again course jim hegan called me a hypochondriac and told me that for all he knew that white pill could have been a cure for dandruff but i knew better that pill was white just like the ones lefty gave me and it quieted them pains didnt it after that first start of mine it seemed like it was forever before they ever got around to starting me again but that was the way it was in the majors you just didnt pitch every day the year round like id done before that took a lot of getting used to for a long time just sitting around like that wore me out id get so tired just sitting id have to sneak into the locker room and take a little snooze i was in there one day stretched out on the rubbing table kind of dozing when my old buddy dizzy dean came in he shook me awake whats the matter boy you tired from overwork he asked me diz im tired from underwork this is the first time in twenty years ive gone four or five days without pitching but that didnt last too long with the pennant race tightening up like it did mr lou started using me more and more wed dropped out of first place again and mr lou gave me the job of getting us back in there on august we were playing a night game in chicago at comiskey park that park held a lot of old memories for me and a lot of folksd seen me pitch there a big chunk of those same folk people whod seen me throw my best against negro leaguers came out to see how i threw against major leaguers they busted down a big gate trying to get in there to see me we had a crowd of about fiftyone thousand the largest ever to see a night game in chicago nobody could have given me any better news than that in my first start in the majors id drawn the largest night crowd ever in cleveland now for my second start id done the same thing in chicago ol satch could draw the fans and youd better believe it now all i had to do was show them i still could throw throw for nine innings but nine innings in this league was a long way id found that out against washington i went easy real easy not trying to burn that fast ball by the batters i just tried to put it where i figured itd do the most good the first four innings went by without us or chicago scoring that ball was flowing out of my hand just like it was some water and i wasnt wasting any pitches i hadnt walked a man in those first four innings i was bearing down i wanted that win just as bad as anybody itd put us back in first place larry doby our center fielder gave me a hand in the top of the fifth inning he tripled and scored a couple of minutes later when jim hegan my catcher hit a fly i had me a onetonothing lead i nursed that through the last of the fifth the sixth and the seventh we werent scoring anymore and i just kept praying my arm wouldnt tire out on me in the top of the eighth i got some breathing room ken keltner our third baseman singled and got sacrificed to second then dale mitchell our left fielder singled him home that gave me two runs to work on that mob watching went wild even though we were playing in the chicago ball park they were there for me that was for sure i didnt let them down in the eighth i set down those white sox again real quick id given up only three hits in the first eight innings dont worry boys we got them now i said when we got to the bench for the top of the ninth they werent worrying my boys picked up three more runs in the top of the ninth and i had me a five to nothing lead i figured i was as good as home i got the first man up real easy i had one out but i wasnt home luke appling singled and pat seerey singled there were men on first and third and only one out i wasnt real worried about losing but i didnt want to get taken out of there i wanted that complete game i walked back to the resin bag and dusted my hands i rubbed the ball i wasnt nervous id been in holes like this before i just wanted to get those next two batters to fidgeting i must have i got aaron robinson and ralph hodgin out real easy i had my first complete game and it was a shutouta shutout in only my second start wed won five to nothing and id given up only five hits i hadnt walked a man that put us back into the american league lead it looks like when they need that stopper need that big game to get back into first place youre the one satch a reporter told me after the game it sure was funny how serious that reporter was when he said that like nobodyd ever known it before what he didnt know was that for about twenty years reportersd been saying that but that reporter didnt bother me what bothered me was those guys who were saying that i was just lucky to get that shutout thats why my next startwhen i shut out those white sox again and gave cleveland a tie for the american league team record of four shutouts in a rowwas the game i thought was the biggest in my career and that covers a lot of ground that second shutout even convinced the umpires bill summers and art passarella hopped in my corner and stayed there how can you rate him bill told one reporter there are few better pitchers in baseball today maybe there arent any and there are few with more stuff he has a slider that cracks like a whip and a curve that explodes and he is plenty fast is there anything else and art told those writers theres a rocking chair if ever there was one that old boys around the plate all the time and calling balls and strikes for hims a breeze i was behind the plate in that shutout he worked in chicago and i never had an easier game in my life you could feel that pennant tension every time you went into our locker room those last few days in august itd been twentyeight years since clevelandd gotten in a world series when i first heard itd been twentyeight years i couldnt hardly believe it why that was even before i started playing professionally and the way most peopled always talked it didnt seem to me like baseballd even been invented before i began tossing my trouble ball i tried to help those boys out when the pressure was deep like it was but they were all so tied up they couldnt hear anybody i figured maybe my pitchingd snap them out of it and i got a chance on august wed dropped two games behind the boston red sox and we were in third place when mr lou sent me in there to straighten out the team thats just what i did i stopped the washington senators on seven hits and we won ten to one i had me a twohitter going into the eighth and gave up only one extrabase hit for my sixth win against one loss boston didnt play that night and we were only one and a half games out of first place that pennant race kept going like that right up to the wire then it endedended with us and boston tied for first place they set a playoff game and gene bearden went out to pitch it for us i was ready in the bullpen just in case gene got into any trouble against boston but gene didnt need my help that day we won the playoff and that gave us the american league pennant we were in the world series against the boston braves it was clevelands first pennant in twentyeight years and they hadnt done it until op satch came around and won them six games while losing only one down the stretch drive thats why they were saying id gotten more fame in three months than most pitchers do in ten years in the major leagues i got it because i won and because the fans wanted to see me when bill veeck signed me he knew what he was doing i showed he knew the habit of mediocrity a student at one of a our better known colf leges submitted a term paper in american history several days before it was due the research content of the essay was reasonably thorough but the paper itself was hastily written and it contained a number of very obvious errors the professor suggested to the student that since the deadline for submitting the theme had not passed perhaps the student might want to do the paper over if the errors resulting from carelessness were corrected and a few minor points of information were clarified and expanded the paper might possibly merit an a otherwise c would be the highest grade the student could expect the student settled for the c he later explained that since c was an average grade he would see no reason why he should trouble himself with extra effort in trying to earn an a after all he concluded c is passing a young couple i know has a teenaged son who at a very early age showed a high degree of talent be pigs in the house and anarchy in the streets is mediocrity good enough are we really satisfied with just getting by do we really appreciate the boorishness of our friends and do we really accept ourselves in the role of casual indifference in which we find ourselves so often cast we explain our shortcomings by reminding our critics that we are i only human and this handy little phrase has been used to excuse more gross ineptness and general lazinessmoral and otherwise than we are likely to admit one is never merely human for if being i human means anything at all it means that everyone is heir to possibilities which are in a very real sense unlimited you can be better than you are you can excel being human is not a license to be mediocre life has a way of rewarding those who meet it squarely and who are willing to work for its treasures life is selfenriching mediocrity can only beget mediocrity but the real treasures of living the worthwhileness of living may only be discovered and enjoyed if one is in search of something the scale of values you hold and the standards of excellence to which you subscribe determine in large measure whether your life will be rewarded with depth and meaning or whether it will be but a series of shallow episodes colorless and inane yes you can be better than you are but first you must kick the habit of mediocrity there never was a deadlier and more destructive drug elizabeth keckley the rash of memoirs t by white house servants recently in public print reminds us of a very unusual negro woman of almost a century ago who wrote a sensational book at the time entitled behind the scenes or thirty years a slave and four years in the white house this book was published in and was authored by elizabeth hobbs keckley the book was suppressed by robert lincoln son of the martyred president but it was later reissued many of the facts that are known about mary todd lincoln are garnered from this modest literary endeavor of a former slave who rose to a position of trust and love in the first family of the tragic civil war period elizabeth keckley lived a life filled with romance and striking incidents her book invited criticism she portrayed the dark side of slavery and also its lighter moments she had kindhearted true friends in the south as well as in the north many charged that she wrote too freely in reference to mrs lincoln mrs lincoln by her acts forced herself into an unfavorable light she invited public criticismalthough she may have been judged too harshly at times people did not know of the secret history of her transactions mrs keckley stated if i have betrayed confidence in any thing i have published it has been to place mrs lincoln in a better light before the world a breach of trust of this kind is always excusable mrs keckleys life was an eventful one she was born a slave in dinwiddie county virginia in the s she was the chattel of colonel a burwell who was an unstable master and moved with his slaves several times during the childhood of elizabeth at the age of four she was given the care of the infant daughter of the burwells she felt the cruel lash at this tender age for inadvertently dropping her charge on the floor this was not the last time she was to be whipped at the age of eight elizabeths father was separated from his family and was sold to a man going out west she never saw her father again however he wrote to his family in virginia at the age of elizabeth went to live with her masters eldest son a presbyterian minister the minister was burdened with an invalid wife elizabeth did the work of three servants and yet was scolded and held in great distrust at she moved to north carolina with the young couple in north carolina the burwells befriended the local schoolmaster a mr bingham mr bingham was a cruel hard man and a frequent visitor to the parsonage mrs burwell had always mistrusted the young slave and mr bingham became her ready tool of wreaking vengeance one evening as elizabeth was watching the baby mr bingham commanded her to follow him to the study he told her that he was going to flog her and demanded that she take down her dress the thunderstruck slave demanded to know the reason for the flogging she refused to do as the schoolmaster wished but she was overpowered this was the first of many whippings she received at his hands to break her proud spirit these revolting scenes created a great sensation and were the talk of the town when informed of the events the rev mr burwell promised that elizabeth would receive no further floggings savage efforts to subdue elizabeth were not the only difficulties she encountered she was regarded as a fairlooking woman and for four years a white man pursued her elizabeth considered this period frought with pain and she does not dwell too long on the events which led to her giving birth to a baby boyher only child she wrote if my poor boy ever suffered any humiliating pangs on account of birth he could not blame his mother for god knows that she did not wish to give him life he must blame the edicts of that society which deemed it no crime to undermine the virtue of girls in my then position elizabeth returned to the burwell family seat in virginia and was attached to the family of one of the daughters who moved to st louis in st louis elizabeth acquired something of a reputation as a seamstress and dressmaker the best ladies in st louis were her patrons and she never lacked for orders through her nimble thimble she was able to support her white owners however the strain undermined her health about this time a negro from virginia a mr keckley sought her hand in marriage she could not think of marriage as long as she was enslaved and sought to purchase her freedom and that of her son but her owners at first refused to consider it later however her owners reconsidered and set the price at for elizabeth and her son she then consented to marriage assuming she could buy her freedom piecemeal mr keckley proved to be dissipated and a burden further elizabeth discovered that he was a slave rather than a freeman as he had represented himself to be after eight years of marriage mrs keckley preferred that charity draw around him the mantle of silence many years passed and mrs keckley was unable to buy her freedom in the meantime her masters died and she was allowed to make further efforts to gain freedom six responsible men were persuaded to guarantee her return from new york city where she planned to journey to seek donations for purchasing her freedom several of her wealthy patrons learned of her planned trip to seek funds and raised the sum for her and the trip to the east was cancelled on august proceedings began which culminated in the emancipation of elizabeth and george keckley five days later elizabeth considered the purchase money a loan and in a short while repaid her generous friends in mrs keckley left st louis en route to baltimore maryland she tried to operate a school to teach her method of dressmaking to a group of young colored women but this venture was unsuccessful she left baltimore for the nations capital rooms were obtained in washington and she soon had a good business operating senator and mrs jefferson davis later to become president of the illfated con federate states of america arrived in washington at about the same time as elizabeth keckley elizabeth learned that mrs davis was seeking a modiste and elizabeth sought and won the position in this post elizabeth was close to the southern family and their cause secret meetings and discussions of war were held in her presence when the daviss prepared to move out of washington they sought to persuade mrs keckley to go with them but she preferred to cast her lot among the people of the north it is coincidental that in refusing to accompany the confederate first family to alabama mrs keckley remained in washington to become entangled in the affairs of the family of abraham lincoln several of mrs keckleys customers knew of her dream to work for the first lady in the white house one of mrs keckleys customers promised to recommend elizabeths services to mrs abraham lincoln who was a good friend of the customer the customer kept her word and elizabeth keckley was summoned to the white house with a nervous step she entered the presence of mrs lincoln a lady of about years and inclined to stoutness she was interviewed and given the position over three other dressmakers who had also been recommended by other friends of mrs lincoln terms were satisfactorily arranged and thus began a relationship which would last throughout the lifetime of elizabeth keckley and mary todd lincoln mary todd lincoln was bom in in lexington kentucky of distinguished ancestry and was reared amid genteel surroundings of the six surviving brothers and sisters four are said to have had abnormal personalities mary was carefully educated and in she visited springfield illinois and two years later she made the illinois capital her home living with her sister favored by the prominence of her sisters family and aided by her own accomplishments she became a belle of the fashionable society and her acquaintance among people of political importance was extensive there are a number of stories surrounding the courtship of abraham lincoln and mary todd but on november the pair was married after hasty preparations despite lincolns awkwardness they moved in the best of local society but in their home there was limited hospitality unfavorable things were said of their domestic life and even friends admitted that marys temperament was difficult her background and outlook differed markedly from those of her husband toward whose family she was unsympathetic within limitations of her temperament however she was a devoted wife and mother her reputation has suffered much from the ann rutledge legend and from the writings of herndon a law partner of lincolnwho wrote extensively on the lincolns but it is hard to believe that the lincoln home was as thoroughly as unhappy as herndon pictured it lincolns letters show an affectionate regard for his wife and a playful delight in their four sons during the presidency of her husband mrs lincoln gave special attention to levees and other social affairs for which mrs keckley was employed making suitable gowns a southern lady in the white house she was subjected to criticism much of which was gossip and malicious slander certainly the imputations of disloyalty were unfounded even the touches of social gayety with which she relieved the strain of wartime anxiety were criticized as inappropriate a short plump brunette mary lincoln had a certain formal beauty and was described as vivacious and apt in conversation accounts of her extravagance combined with penuriousness her interference in politics her irritable temper and her concealment of expenditures from her husband are too numerous and authoritative to be ignored but on the other side of the picture she was considered by some to be an agreeable mistress in the white house and a ministering friend to soldiers in washington hospitals no presidential family evoked so much curiosity and as soon as it was known that elizabeth was the modiste to mrs lincoln part ies crowded around and affected friendship hoping to induce the seamstress to betray the secrets of the domestic circle lizabeth as mrs lincoln called her became a close friend and confidante of the first family and her advice and suggestions were often sought as a trusted servant and friend mrs keckley described the tragic death of young willie lincoln who died in the white house she assisted mrs lincoln in caring for the youngster and she was exhausted when the end came but she was sent for immediately mrs keckley assisted in bathing and dressing the corpse she was a silent witness to the grief of abraham lincoln and she was a great comfort to the inconsolable grief of mrs lincoln who was so overwhelmed that she did not attend the funeral mrs keckley lost her own son about the same time leaving wilberforce university in ohio he had joined the army and gone to the battlefield and he was killed in missouri it was a sad blow to her and the kind letter of condolence that mrs lincoln wrote when she heard of the bereavement was full of golden words of comfort in the summer of mrs keckley organized negroes of the capital into a group to raise funds for the relief of suffering soldiers the idea proved popular and in two weeks the contraband relief association numbered workers armed with credentials elizabeth visited new york with mrs lincoln in the city she circulated among the colored people and got them interested in the idea she also started a group in boston while accompanying mrs lincoln to harvard to visit robert lincoln frederick douglass contributed funds and lectured for the groups foreign contributions were received and mrs keckley served as a national president for many years elizabeth joined in the turbulent period of the election leading up to abraham lincolns reelection and when many doubted his reelection she stood firm in her belief that he would succeed she was one of the first to congratulate him on his reelection elizabeth was given as a memento one of the gloves worn by lincoln at the inaugural reception many colored citizens wished to attend the reception but orders were issued not to admit them a member of congress enroute to the reception recognized frederick douglass on the outskirts of the crowd when the congressman was told of the restrictions on negro guests he received permission from lincoln to allow the admission of the famed orator and abolitionist when richmond fell in the spring of elizabeth keckley was a member of the presidential party which traveled by boat to the once proud city in the senate chamber she sat in the seat sometimes occupied by jefferson davis she also had the chance to visit scenes of her childhood she described this trip as one of the most delightful of her life the fateful evening in april when lincoln was assassinated comprises an interesting chapter in mrs keckleys life she had been to the white house earlier to assist with mrs lincolns toilette at eleven oclock that evening she was awakened from her sleep to receive the information that the entire cabinet and lincoln had been murdered the news stunned her however she gathered her wits and went to the white house she learned that the dying president was not at the mansion and she could not learn where mrs lincoln was located the next morning a saddened nation learned of the death of lincoln and mrs lincoln sent for elizabeth to come immediately to the white house mrs lincoln scolded elizabeth for not coming sooner and it was learned that mrs lincoln had sent for her immediately after the shooting of her husband three messengers were unable to locate her home mrs lincoln was very exhausted from grief elizabeth was the only person who seemed able to comfort the widow she was also a tender consoling friend to the young sons of the lincolns for five weeks mrs lincoln was confined to her room and only allowed her loyal friend elizabeth to be with her they started to pack to leave the white house and this activity afforded some relief for the two sorrowing women in packing mrs lincoln gave away everything intimately connected with the president the articles were given to those who were regarded as the warmest of lincolns admirers the cloak of mrs lincolns stained with the presidents blood was given to elizabeth later she was to receive the comb and brush of the martyred lincoln at still a later date she donated these precious items in addition to the inaugural glove to wilberforce university in ohio which coincidentally was destroyed by fire on the same night as the assassination of the president mrs lincoln moved to chicago and faithful elizabeth accompanied her there after the family had been settled in illinois elizabeth returned to her occupation in washington she was offered the custom of the andrew johnson family now occupying the white house however she had no desire to continue to work for the first family mrs keckley continued to prosper in her profession meanwhile she entered into a correspondence with mrs lincoln which would last the rest of their lives in mrs lincoln experienced financial troubles and she sought the advice of mrs keckley she wished to sell a portion of her extensive wardrobe for she had not received much assistance from the nation the women met in new york and sought to sell the clothing anonymously the newspapers soon learned of the plans and the impoverished widow fled new york leaving elizabeth to salvage what she could the clothes were placed on exhibition and did not bring in much revenue attempts to sell the clothing also failed the venture proved so disastrous that mrs lincoln was unable to assist elizabeth with her expenses of staying in new york and elizabeth was compelled to take in sewing to pay her own way little is known about the later years of elizabeth keckley she continued to work at her chosen profession sometime after the publication of her book she served as director of domestic art at wilberforce university although mrs lincoln had promised to assist her financially these promises were never fulfilled as mrs lincoln was not able to do so as for mrs lincoln the death of tad in left only one son a certain mental instability now became more pronounced and she was adjudged insane and spent some months in a private sanitarium at batavia illinois in congress tardily granted her an annual pension of this later was increased to at which time an additional gift of was voted after some years of foreign travel she spent her last clouded days in the home of a sister in springfield where she died of paralysis in sweet charlie vaughn when iron horse harry gallatin took over reins of the faltering st louis hawks professional basketball team one of his first moves was to sign up sweet charlie vaughn a hot shot who had broken virtually every school record while playing for gallatin at southern illinois university many think sweet charlie is the answer to the hawks problems hes not only a top shooter his fadeaway jump shot is almost impossible to guard against but he has been rated one of the finest ball handlers and natural defensive men to come along in collegiate basketball ranks in many a moon a twotime small college allamerica choice vaughn among other things while at siu scored points in games for a average chalked up accuracy marks of from the field for free throws copped rebounds a game though a backcourt player as a sophomore in with southerns salukis who have been nationally ranked for several years and playing some of the nations toughest teams vaughn dunked in points for a average last season hit for a game before falling to his personal bugaboo grades he poured in points against tennessee a i in was named to the united press international second small college allamerica squad and the next season moved up to the first team gallatin says of his former collegiate star vaughn is a typical product of the modern era he has all the assetstremendous speed excellent mobility good outside shot and deep dedication hes going to be a great pro player his specialty is his fadeaway jump shot and the way he handles himself there is absolutely no defense to stop him to see him work is a positive thing of beauty gallatin smiles and the giant pound coach adds he has something else going for him hes a negro negroes are the most dedicated kids in athletics today all the colored kids are dedicated by the time a white boy reaches the college varsity level hes dedicated of course but the average young white boy has two problemsautomobiles and a social life girls the average negro kid cant afford a car and he has a limited social life it all adds up to the negro concentrating on excelling in athletics vaughns only trouble at southern was scholastic when he left the squad for good last season after taking a low grade in a fivehour psychology course there might have been some who questioned his scholarly ability but none who denied he had been one of southerns greatest players and the hawks dont give grades for attending classes as merle jones sports editor of the southern illinoisan at carbondale where siu is located said there have been many many fine basketball players at siu through the years but probably none could ever match charlie vaughn in the realm of being an exciting player to watch the team averaged points a game in the first six contests he missed last year for the next games the scoring average was better than points a game vaughn first attracted attention as a schoolboy at little tamms illinois high school where he took a career total of pointsa figure never topped by any prep player as far as could be determined he began playing regularly in his freshman year in high school at southern he was a spectacular player who took to gallatins fast break style of basketball like a fish to water he developed one of the most unorthodox long shots in the gameseemingly most accurate when he was jumping and falling away from the basket on the shots holding the ball behind his head and firing off his right ear with uncanny precision even in his freshman year at southern vaughn launched into a war with the record books he set an alltime scoring record season with points attempted the most field goals in a single game scored the most field goals in a single game was credited with most rebounds in a single game attempted the most field goals for one season and scored the most field goals for one season by the end of that sophomore year vaughn lacked only total rebounds for a season and career scoring record to have all the individual marksbut vaughn quickly took over the scoring record gallatin switched vaughn from forward to guard in the season when the team captain injured an ankle in his new spot during the first games sweet charlie had a averagecompared to a as forward it really didnt make much difference where i played charlie gallatin said he could find the range from any spot on the floor charlie also copped other honors at southern and elsewhere allconference teams allnaia district team upi allamerican alltourney quincy ill holiday team and alltourney cape girardeau mo invitational sportsmanship award allamerican city tourney owensboro ky and as sius most valuable player whether vaughn can help the ailing hawks remains to be seen but if gallatins hopes come true he could be set for a long profitable and enviable record in professional ranks and he could give the hawks some of the defensive and offensivepunch theyve missed by edward james grant what the american new gro may need at this time as a status symbol is a continuous fictional hero there is a tendency among white citizens to take a longer look at black slum areas and at negro degradation than at the fine record of cultural and educational progress within this much maligned race it would seem timely therefore to introduce a negro hero of great character and poise who might fire the imaginations of black and white alike who would gently influence national opinion regarding the emergence of the negro masses from the aura of second class citizenship in the world of fiction all heroes are white cowboys soldiers detectives doctors lawyers scientists spacemen patriots rarely if ever sport a handsome black face rather the trend is to confront the reading or viewing public with a veritable giant of white male beauty with all the virtues one would expect in a god possibly without intention this tends to promote the image of white supremacy and what is more disturbing there would appear to be no plan at the present time to create noble and intelligent negro heroes in book or television play to balance this concept negroes continue to accept unimportant or derogatory roles as servants or straight men for the white heroes who win all the battles and display all the wisdom through it all the black man reflects brawn and quick reflex rather than brain and quick wit certainly the time has come to write a black superman into the literary scene of course we have a few negro actors and a number of negro characters in story form who have reached such prominence that one might question the need of a super hero sydney poitier has gained real stature on the screen while the inimitable sammy davis jr has appeared in a number of television plays as the lead figure and in a few movies in starring roles other negroes have been featured in novel or screenplay so that one cannot say unequivocally that impressive negro representation in fiction is nonexistent but the symbol characterization is still missing the roles enacted by the present cluster of colored stars are so varied that contact is lost by the public as soon as the vehicle in which each has starred has ended unlike the image of a perry mason a cheyenne a marshal dillon a doctor ben casey or a dr kildare the negro hero flashes like a meteor on the horizon brilliant but brief with the darkness of nonrecognition closing in at once behind his sparkling performance this does not mean nonrecognition in the sense of rejection but rather nonidentification with the negro upsurge into respectability and accomplishment the occasional drama such as sydney poitiers ramble in raisin in the sun can do little to erase from the minds of too many white persons the subconscious image of the black man as jungle creature with his bare feet churning the dust in a violent dance ritual unfortunately a number of young american negroes help to advance this association by their penchant for loud or brazen adornment and wearing apparel to counteract this reflection the negro needs a constant hero in story form or in a television series since television is a complicated business in the matter of programming perhaps the story form makes more sense at first a writer preferably negro but not necessarily should introduce a black fictional character in serial form who would carry the banner for his race so admirably that his impact upon the american public could not help but inspire respect and consideration the detective character would seem to hold greatest promise although there might be some arguments in favor of a great dusky doctor who would join the ranks of kildare and casey in serving mankind the detective choice however is strongest in this initial quest for recognition for the express reason that the detective story along with the western retains highest reader preference in america the dated western seems destined to remain in white hands since few negroes wore guns in anger during those roaring times but the detective is timeless furthermore few heroes enjoy the esteem of the sleuth who time and again will move through a maze of perplexing clues and dangerous situations to expose the villainous murderer we have instinctively learned to love the image of a philo vance a sherlock holmes the thin man ellery queen and lawyerdetective perry mason to name a few now is the time for a negro detective alert smart brave clean strong to become a household word he must be so successful in crime detection that fictional white clients will clamor for his services without thought of skin pigmentation the black face of this new hero will not be a badge of inferiority it will become a symbol of honor and achievement he will never use dirty tactics nor will he be vulgar violent compromising his adventures must be the ultimate in plot and characterization so that his public will await each new episode with eagerness and impatience thus we have our status symbol can anyone doubt the influence which the great deeds of mr moto and charlie chan have had upon oriental respectability here is a minority race within this nation which has enjoyed virtual acceptance for many years one would be foolish to suggest that the oriental heroes of fiction were alone responsible for this agreeable development however the favorable light which glows from the brilliant derringdo of the likes of moto and chan cannot be refuted this amounts to a power of suggestion in which many readers bathing in deeds of courage and integrity find themselves cleansed to some degree of race prejudice thus in the negro world the advent of a colored fictional hero couid perceptibly plant the seeds of respect in a previously barren ground this would not mean a sudden and miraculous end to problems of discrimination there would be many hardcore individuals who would not be impressed by a fictional hero but by and large the subtle penetration into subconscious minds of favorable reaction to an idol might cause a number of persons to realize more vividly that the colored race in america is not a total abyss of ignorance squalor immorality and indolence of course there is frequent reference in magazines and newspapers to the large percentage of negroes who have risen above poverty to higher levels of accomplishment and refinement than have a surprising number of white citizens however this direct method of dispensing truth may not be as effective as the revelation by suggestion which would result from adoption by the public of a dashing hero there is nothing furtive in this approach the use of the word brainwashing which has acquired a scurrilous connotation within our society does not apply in this case we have here a simple desire to reflect truth to a public which has closed its eyes long enough to the struggle of a people to be acceptable and accepted in their own country and what exactly is the truth it is the realization by conscientious negro leaders that the black belts of population both north and south teem with a discouraging percentage of ignorant impoverished and unclean people who would not blend in even a middleclass white neighborhood the negro authorities are also aware of extensive white slum areas with their streams of human degradation though a much greater percentage of white population has reached superior cultural and intellectual levels those negroes who qualify under the standards of morality dignity intelligence and achievement should have equal billing there is no logical reason why the sudden appearance of an enlightened negro family in an all whiteupperclass area should cause pandemonium yet real estate values will drop legal battles will rage ostracism for the intrepid family is assured and in many instances broken windows or worse will reflect the angry mood of selfrighteous citizensthis in spite of the fact that the family which can afford to live in a pretentious settlement will have reached cultural and educational heights worthy of the neighborhood thus the only objection is black skin the standard by which all negroes continue to be judged that is why our fictional black detective or doctor or whatever should have his day with this recalcitrant public should he win no friends change no minds soften no attitudes blunt no windmills nothing will change for the worse if on the other hand the clouds of prejudice were to open just enough to admit one thin beam of the light of tolerance our negro fictional hero will have served mankind to the utmost the urban ordeal of negroes a discussion of the condition of negroes in american cities is concerned essentially with the problem of negroes in american civilization since more than seventenths of the negroes in the united states are city dwellers today until world war ii much of the thinking concerning the conditions of negroes in the united states was dominated by the mistaken assumption that the major problems of negroes were those growing out of their position in the rural south while it is true that until world war i ninetenths of the negroes lived in the south and fourfifths of those in the south were in rural areas the majority of the negroes in the north have always lived in the cities in when the first federal census was taken negroes constituted for example per cent of the population of new york city and per cent of the population of philadelphia since the proportion of negroes in the north who live in cities has increased from per cent to nearly per cent at the same time negroes in the south have been migrating to cities with the result that somewhat more than half of the negroes in the south are in cities i before the civil war in the south as well as in the north where there were relatively few slaves free negroes were concentrated in cities in for example there were free negroes in new york city in philadelphia in baltimore in richmond virginia in charleston south carolina and in new orleans louisiana after emancipation negroes migrated in large numbers to the cities of the north as well as of the south between and the negro population in fourteen southern cities increased per cent as compared with an increase of per cent in the white population of these same cities during this same period the negro population of eight northern cities increased per cent during the next two decades to the movement of negroes to cities slowed down and as late as nearly seventenths per cent of urban negroes were in southern cities ii the urbanization of negroes during the twentieth century has followed a similar trend in the white population in the south the urbanization of the negro population closely paralleled that of the white increasing from less than per cent in to over per cent in between and a million negroes moved from rural areas to southern cities with a population of and over and into towns and cities with populations ranging from to the movement of negroes to southern cities was inconspicuous and occurred at the same time as the mass migrations to the north which were replete with dramatic incidents and were directed principally to a few citiesnew york chicago philadelphia and detroit the mass migrations to northern cities which began during world war i and have continued to the present time have resulted in a shift in the negro population which has changed fundamentally the relation of negroes to american civilization there has been a change both in the numerical distribution and in the proportion of negroes in the population of the north and of the south at the opening of the present century per cent of the negroes were in the south whereas today only per cent are in the south in they constituted a third whereas at the present time they comprise only a fifth of the population of the south for years negroes did not constitute more than per cent of the population of the north and only one per cent of the population of the west at the present time the more than negroes in the northern cities comprise about per cent of the population of the north in new york city chicago philadelphia and detroit there is a total of negroes in the citiessix in the south seven in the north three border cities and one western citywith negro communities numbering or more there are to be found today about or a third of the negroes in the united states ill the pattern of settlement of negroes in american cities has always provided an index to their economic and social condition in urban areas from earliest times negroes have been concentrated in the slum areas of american cities this has been primarily the result of their poverty at the same time those who were economically betteroff and educated were able to escape to some extent from the slums in philadelphia it was noted as early as that the more successful negroes tended to move to the periphery of the negro area or to escape from it altogether but on the whole the negro population has been concentrated in the slum areas especially in northern cities where the processes of ecological segregation in the expanding cities are most manifest therefore in considering the pattern of settlement of negroes in american cities it is necessary to recognize the differences between not only southern and northern but border cities as well in the older cities of the south the location of negroes was due largely to historical circumstances the location of the widelyscattered negro population in the older cities like charleston south caro lina and new orleans louisiana was the result of small negro settlements comprised mainly of servants which grew up close to the house of the whites in which the negroes served these patterns of settlement took root before the spatial pattern of the cities was affected by the economic forces which have shaped the pattern of modern american industrial and commercial cities therefore another pattern of settlement has appeared in the newer cities of the south where industry and commerce have determined their spatial pattern in these cities there are several large concentrations of negroes and the remainder of the negro population is scattered over a large area nevertheless in these larger cities of the south the majority of negroes are concentrated in the slums and blighted areas on the other hand in the larger northern cities negroes have always been more segregated within a small area than in the larger southern cities this has been due mainly to the operation of impersonal economic and social forces which has resulted in the segregation of other ethnic groups as well in slum areas the concentration of negroes in certain areas of border cities has been somewhat similar to their concentration in the larger southern cities with one important difference neither historical circumstances nor impersonal ecological processes have been decisive in determining their location with the result that it was in the border cities that the more important battles over residential segregation of negroes have been waged in view of the fact that negroes have been concentrated in the slums of american cities it would be expected that they would be housed in the worst dwellings as negroes moved into northern cities the ghettoes grew in size and became more crowded just before the united states entered world war ii the housing situation of the negro is indicated by the fact that about half of the negroes in northern cities lived in houses which needed major repairs or had serious plumbing deficiencies in the increased earnings of negroes during the war years enabled them to demand better housing but private housing schemes even with government assistance did little to improve housing facilities for negroes in amer cities klose negroes improvement in the housing of negroes appeared only when the federal government began to build lowcost housing projects and negro workers began to occupy these projects nevertheless these lowcost housing projects have been wholly inadequate to meet the housing needs of negroes in american cities then the problem of racial segregation in governmentsupported housing has been inevitable since racial segregation is inseparable from the negro ghettoes from all indications it is probably as true today as it was years ago that a half of the negro population in american cities live in substandard dwelling quarters when negroes began to migrate to cities in large numbers it was believed that their high death rate in urban areas would soon eliminate them from the american scene but in the s with the declining death rates and an increase in the birth rate of urban negroes it appeared that they were improving their ability to survive in the city the improvement in the vitality of negroes in northern cities was much better than in southern cities of course the increase in the birth rate of negroes in cities was due to the movement of large numbers of negroes of childbearing age to cities on the other hand the greater improvement in the vitality of negroes in northern cities than in southern cities has been due to better welfare and health provisions professor hauser has made a significant contribution to the study of the differentials in the mortality of negroes and whites in cities in a study of chicago it was revealed that economic status was an important factor in survival of both whites and negroes however among negroes of the lowest economic stratum per cent of males as compared with per cent of white males of the same economic stratum would die before years of age while per cent of the white females and per cent of negro females of the same economic stratum would die before the most recent materials on the fertility of negroes in cities indicate that the vitality of the urban negro population has improved during the past or years though it is still below that of whites this improvement is associated with the decline in infant mortality and in the proportion of childless couples who are the victims of venereal diseases and a decrease in various forms of family disorganization iv the migration of negroes to cities especially the cities of the north has accelerated the occupational differentiation of the negro population negroes have ceased to gain their living primarily from agriculture and have become an important element among industrial workers likewise they have become an important element in organized labor especially in the cioafl unions the most rapid and important changes in the occupational status of negroes have occurred in northern cities while in the cities of the south negro workers are still largely excluded from skilled and white collar occupations as the south has become industrialized white workers from rural areas are absorbed into the new industries while negroes must live at a starvation wage in domestic service and in unskilled labor or are forced to migrate to northern cities this is due partly to the fact that in southern cities negroes have no political power while in northern cities they are able to exercise considerable political power and the color line in industry and commerce does not exist as in the south in many northern cities negroes have entered practically the same occupations as whites and in recent years their entrance into clerical and other white collar occupations has been especially significant moreover many negroes are employed in white collar and professional occupations and other public services by the municipalities then it should be added that many negroes are elected to public offices in northern cities on the other hand in the south practically all negroes in white collar occupations are restricted to the institutions of the negro community this has resulted in an important difference between the incomes of negroes in northern and southern cities according to the federal census figures for for all cities in the united states the median income of a white family was and a negro family and for unrelated white individuals and unrelated negro individuals but the difference between white and negro families and individuals was much greater in the south than in the north in southern cities the median income of white families and unrelated individuals was while the median income of negro families and unrelated individuals was in northern cities on the other hand the median income of white families and unrelated individuals was about and that of negro families and unrelated individuals was between and the greater occupational differentiation of the negro population of northern cities and their higher incomes have made possible the emergence of a sizeable middle class in northern and western cities a conservative estimate indicates that per cent of the negroes are able to maintain a middle class way of life while in southern cities only about per cent of the negroes have incomes and education to maintain middle class standards in this connection it should be emphasized that in northern cities negroes have access to a standard american education to a larger extent than in southern cities and that there is more illiteracy among negroes in southern cities than in northern cities it has been mainly through education that negroes have achieved and continue to achieve social mobility the negro middle class which has emerged in recent years is composed mainly of salaried professional and white collar workers with a goodly number of the higher skilled workers the socalled negro business enterprises are insignificant both from the standpoint of employment of negroes and incomes moreover negroes are only beginning to secure employment as salaried professionals and white collar workers in industry and commerce yet the emergence of a negro middle class has created an important cleavage in negro communities in cities nowhere is this more evident than in the middle class negro neighborhoods that are emerging especially in the larger southern cities the movement of negroes to cities especially northern cities has been regarded as the second emancipation of the negro in a sense this has been true it has enabled them to escape to a large extent from the race prejudice and caste restrictions of the agricultural south it has enabled them to escape from domestic service and unskilled occupations and enter most of the same occupations as whites it has meant an increase in incomes and created a sizeable middle class all of these changes have been in response to changes in the economic and social organization of american life and as a consequence negroes have been faced with new problems in the competition of city life the majority of negroes have been confined to slums and forced to live in dwellings unfit for human habitation because of the lack of education and skills which are required by modern industry in which automation is becoming important large numbers of negroes are not only unemployed but unemployable therefore it is in the city that the masses of negroes with the added burden of racial discrimination are confronted with the frustrations of an industrial civilization many seek an escape from these frustrations in alcohol and in narcotics while others seek an escape in the numerous religious cults which range from spiritualism to a militant black nationalism thus it is in the cities that negroes are being subjected to the rigorous ordeal of american civilization the outcome of which no one can predict with certainty stronghold of yoruba culture the majority of the population of bahia state in brazil comprise people of african descent among whom traces of a longstanding yoruba influence are still clearly noticeable at salvador the capital city of the state of bahia vivid reminders of the african particularly the yoruba way of life are constantly met in every sphere of human activity for example in the field of the culinary arts one meets the inviting sight and appetising flavor of akara known here as acaraje as it is being fried in sizzling palm oil by bahian ladies on the pavements or in street corners all over the city other names of bahian foods which suggest african connections include arroz haussa mocoto which corresponds to the yoruba word mokoto that is stewed calves or pigs feet acaca which is also used in dahomey there are also various kinds of dishes which come under the classname muqueca a word used in lagos in the form of mukeke for referring to delicious savory dishes and the words feijao farofa mingau arroz doce canjica which travelled back to lagos with the return of the brazilians towards the end of the last century and with little or no orthographic change have become household words among the aguda of popo aguda that is the brazilians of catholic mission street igbosere road campos square and the environment sometimes referred to as the brazilian quarters these gentle but constant reminders of the african way of life are not confined to the culinary art they are visible in the religious observances of people of african descent in the placenames and other descriptive names of bahia in the womens hairdos and in the contributions already made by bahians themselves towards the production of a written literature in yoruba in the sphere of religion we have under general examples the different candombles that is the religious ceremonies of african origin held in various casas or centres scattered all over bahia where the gods of africa especially the yoruba gods sango oya obatala ogun osun ososi and others are worshipped by bahian men and women who sing yoruba songs and dance to yoruba drumrhythms the principal candombles include that of the senhora at sao goncalo in the retiro district of the city where the yalorixa yoruba iyalorisa bears the yoruba name osunmuyiwa after the great river osun which flows between oshogbo and ilesha in nigeria at the candomble at rua luiz anselmo in the matatu district the yalorixa is olga alaketo named after alaketu the king of ketu in dahomey whose ancestor was the first alaketu one of the seven grandsons of oduduwa and at avenida vasco da gama there is the candomble oxumare a name which recalls osumare the yoruba name for the rainbow in addition the egungun cult is very much alive in bahia on the island of itaparica on the other side of the bay the egungun rites are regularly performed they even have an alagba the title held by the head of the egungun cult in every yoruba town examples of contributions already made by bahians to the production of a written literature in yoruba include introducao ao estudo gramatical da lingua yoruba by professor edson nunes da silva who has himself recently visited nigeria and yoruba tal qual se fala by sr deoscroedes maximiliano dos santos son of senhora osunmuyiwa from this brief description of yoruba associations in bahia it is not difficult to understand why yoruba was chosen as the first african language to be taught at the university of bahias centre de estudosafroorientais on the invitation of the director of the centre i came to bahia in august to open the first course the foundation class which is held in the evenings is attended mainly by men and women of african descent who are working as teachers doctors businessmen and clerks the first anniversary of nigerias independence coincided with the completion of the first year of the yoruba course as the students had been practising a play oduduwa ati awon omo re oduduwa and his children i encouraged them to stage the play as a contribution towards our celebrations of the anniversary the support that i received from the director and the entire staff of the centre was superb the school theatre was placed at our disposal and the centres photographer designer and stage manager as well as the university choir all rallied round to give every ounce of the assistance needed working far into the night during rehearsals everybody seemed bent on making our show the best of its kind the afternoons performance opened with a brief summary of nigerias centurylong progress under british rule from the status of a crown colony to that of a sovereign state this was followed by my own personal anniversary greetings struck on the talking drum while the drum beats were translated into yoruba sentences by sr luiz sergio barbosa a member of the yoruba class and the yoruba sentences translated into portuguese by dr olga lydia da conceicao a lady member of the class then there was a short speech of welcome in portuguese and yoruba by professor taurino eduardio topazio sauze another member of the class the audience then heard a selection of nigerian music and accompanied by a commentary oduduwa ati awon omo re finally came a rendering in a magnificent style of nigerias national anthem the highlight of the days show was the play oduduwa ati awon omo re the reason is not difficult to find for this was probably the first time in history that an african play had been staged in bahia by bahians wearing african costumes and speaking an african language the colored yoruba robes i had carried from nigeria to london and from london to bahia but all the white robes were sewn here with local materials by brazilian tailors who borrowed my own white robes and used them as models i was particularly intrigued with the embroidery on the agbadas because while the nigerian tailors who made my own agbada kept strictly to convention using silk thread of only one color for each agbada the brazilian tailors sometimes boldly departed from this convention using threads of two or three different colors the colors blended so beautifully that i came to like the braziliansewn agbadas better than my own i was there for six months and saw practically all of africa i did not of course go to south africa i felt i would not have been welcome there but from nigeria i went to senegal the ivory coast to liberia ghana sierra leone uganda tanganyika kenya southern rhodesia tell us about some of the universities you visited i spent most of my time in contact with university people students and members of the faculty of course i also had associations with nonuniversity people a few politicians a good many professional writers and others the university system in africa differs considerably from ours the secondary school course is five years and the university course three years upon completion of this a baccalaureate degree is awarded is this applicable only to the english speaking countries no this is true also in the french speaking universities dakar for instance and the university college of the ivory coast you were in africa fortuitously at the time of the writers conference held at makerere university college in kampala uganda tell us about that from where i sat at this conference it was very successful it was surprisingly successful the one african writer of some reputation in this part of the world who was not there was amos tutuola the author of the palm wine drinkard he is not a young man and the eight hours flight from lagos to kampala would have been pretty hard on him but all the others were there chinua achebe the nigerian novelist wole soyinka the nigerian poet and playwright john pepper clark also from nigeria arthur drayton from trinidad yemi lijadu from nigeriathey were all thereand a brighter group a more intense and exciting group ive never seen langston hughes was there too and did a very representative job in presenting the problems which american writers face the problems which in some instances were similar to the problems being faced by the african writers several problems peculiar to themselves seemed to exercise the african writers first of all the problem of a second language a problem which american negro writersamerican writers in generalcertainly do not have they worried as to whether as africans they would express in english what they call the african personality after a stimulating discussion on this subject the tentative conclusion reached by the conferees was that whether they wrote in their native tongue or in the english language depended on the audience they wished to reach were there any french speaking writers present yes and those who write in the french language did not seem to have the same problems at least they didnt acknowledge having the same problems i think this is so simply because french colonial policy differed radically from that of the english the french said we will assimilate these people and although this was probably only a saying it had its effect on the africans who write in the french language they seem to feel that french is their language it is not a second language with them at all as you know for instance president leopold senghor of senegal who is a poet and philosopher as well as a statesmanwrites only in the french language would it then be your impression that far from regarding this as an impediment they regard the use of the french language as being an asset in creative expression oh yes they are very proud of the french language senghor believes and rightly i suppose from his point of view that the french language is the only language and so far as i am concerned he has expressed in the french language the african personality what about your own participation in the conference i must tell you that african publications have mentioned you as a prominent participant i was asked to keynote the conference and i spoke on the writer communication and response this was on saturday on the following wednesday langston hughes and i shared the platform and talked to the writers about those problems which american writersparticularly american negro writersface in the belief that the problems which americans face are in some instances similar to the problems they were facing for the most part we talked about problems of practical concern what does one do about finding a publisher does one employ an agent what does one do about publicity i hope the discussion we carried on was helpfulsome of the participants indicated it waswell i hope it was to what particularly were you addressing yourself in your keynote speech to the writers commitment i indicated that the writer to be a really serious writer had to be sincerely committed to something i tried to indicate that it did not matter very much what the nature of his commitment was some writers for instance have been committed to nihilism which is from my point of view completely untenable but their commitment has been sincere and they have certainly lighted up for some of us an aspect of life and living and the world which has been helpful another point that i tried to make was that writing after all in addition to being an art is a craft and that one has to learn his craft there is no such thing as being a primitive if you are a writer primitivism is in fact a negation of craft i got some argument on this point particularly in regard to the work of amos tutuola who is probably a much better craftsman than his work seems to establish did you find in the dialogue among african writers the pursuit of the same question that american negro writers often probe shall the african writer write about colonialism independence ie protest works or shall he just write as any other writer this came up in the conference and there was a very definite division must point out that the discussion of what the new african writers material should be was definitely tied up with the business of the second language there were those who said that the african writer in addressing himself to a nonafrican audience must engage in protest there were others who felt that the african writer should forget the nonafrican audience and write for his own people in which case his effort should be spent on building on the very great and rich oral tradition in african literature and some writers are doing the latter some of the most successful writers and some of the most talented writers like wole soyinka and john pepper clark are examples some of the other writers also talented like achebe and cyprian ekwensi are doing the other thing but in neither of the latter is protest so apparent that one feels as one reads oh this guy is just protesting their works impress me as being delineations of what is happening to them and explanations of why it is happening to them what about the african writers evaluation of their own work at the conference they were pretty tough on one another tough in the hope of promoting competence skill tough because they did not want the world to say that this that or the other piece of writing is a good job for africans so they tended to tear each other apart not in any spirit of nastiness but in the spirit of help i was particularly struck by this because some of the more established writers like ezekiel mphahlele like bloke modisanewhich leads me to say something about south african writers in a moment caught the devil and they took it in very good spirit as a matter of fact on about the fifth day the conference converted itself into a critical workshop this was very good hat was said about the south african writers the south african writers are i think in the deepest of quandaries most of them who were there are exiles living principally in england they want to appeal to the african audience in south africa hut they have trouble with censorship some of them are afraid that if they say what is in their hearts reprisals will he made against their families in south africa it is a serious problem which they face a problem with which it was my impression the other writers there could not possibly deal because theyre not in the same situation and do not really comprehendwho does comprehend whats going on in south africa these days regarding your remark about the writers being extraordinarily selfcritical what did they think was their present status in the literary world some of the writers at the conference are people whose reputations are more or less made in the rest of the world they felt nevertheless that such appeal as they have had may be an appeal based on the wrong reasons they are afraid of the probability that they are read in europe and the united states simply because they are new voices and not because they have anything important to say and they wish to avoid this they want to he read because they have something important to say in these new times was there an opinion expressed about doing works particularly dramatic works in african languages so that local groups might more easily perform them no there was not a discussion touching upon this did come up the drama group at the university college ibadan did an adaptation of shakespeares the taming of the shrew in pidgin english this disturbed some of the delegates to the conference for reasons which i can perfectly well understand before i knew anything about this performance i had made the remark at ibadan that pidgin english was to the british idiom what negro dialect was to the american idiom i went on to explain that dialect speech represented an early effort on the part of negro slaves to master the english language and was therefore legitimate and good since those days however it has become an element in the denigration of the american negro his capacity his ability to master a difficult language it has meant his assumption of ideas and expressions which are disingenuously his it seemed to me that this definition was applicable to pidgin english but at my lecture at ibadan during the question and answer period i was severely challenged by certain british members of the faculty so when the discussion of the adaptation of the taming of the shrew in pidgin english came up at the conference i was par ticularly interested to hear what was said by and large members of the conference were very disturbed that the british director of dramatics at ibadan had done this sort of thing was there any criticism of literature in terms of form and style on the one hand and subject matter on the other was selfevaluation based more on one than the other the mbari group of writers and artists from ibadan hold that the african writer will create new forms at the same time that he will probably create a new idiom or idioms this everybody seemed to accept in spite of the fact that it was pointed out that the creation of new formsforms which are amenable to the african personalitywill not be an easy thing to do genre have been established and only a real genius will be able to overcome the tradition that now exists after six months of this association brief though it was with african writers and their works what is your feeling about the prospect for literature and the theatre in africa my own feeling is that the african writer that african art expression in the theatre in poetry in the novel is now at the point where american negro art and expression was in the renaissance of the s and early s there is an exciting yeasting going on theyre finding their themes their idiom they are experimenting and considering that in many places they are being encouragedalthough not directedby government it would seem to me that the prospects for a great future are very good could you tell us what feeling you had in regard to your receptivity as an american negro writer and an american negro professor of english speaking to other africans my reception was fine i had naturally in the beginning a feeling of intrusion i certainly wanted nobody in africa to feel that i was pontificating i wanted them to know that i was there to learn i was received not only with great courtesy but great warmth i think i made some friends i certainly hope they realize that i consider them friends of mine in your talks to university students were there any particular questions which predominated the question i got most often was why dont more american negroes come out to africa the feeling seemed to be that the american negro had a great deal to offer them but of course they are proud people and they dont want anyone bringing gifts in a condescending way they asked why dont we have more american negroes teaching in our universities what about physicians what about technicians cant these people give us a year or two of their lives and their skills and their knowledge i think this was the most persistent question and i got it not only from university students and members of the faculty i got it from people in the street that seems to indicate at least a latent affinity between the african and the american negro oh yes they know for instance even in east africa of the american negro dentist who has been practicing in ghana for seven years they know of the small group of american negroes who have established an insurance company they know of the american negro who set up in ghana the first school for the deaf and dumb and who recently has been invited by the nigerian government to do the same thing and after that hes going to tanganyika they know these things it makes them happy the only complaint is that theres just not enough of us what did you gather was the reason that africans were interested specifically in having american negro teachers etc their feeling was that the american negro being of the same racial strain would be more sympathetic to the problems which they face that they could get closer to the american negro than to the european to the white man in general they made no bones about this africans will tell youand i heard this time and time againthat by and large the european in africa hears only what the african thinks will please the european but the african tells another african the truth i dont want to leave you with the impression however that just any negro will do you dont make it in africa simply because youre another africannor do you fail just because youre white you are accepted because you are a negro who has something to offer did you feel there was any marked yearning for knowledge about american negroes and american negro writing oh yes they know by and large all that is happening here in the statesin all forms of expression they can name american negro writers american writers in general they can name actors and singers and they know what these people are doing what they have done they also know of the sporadic movements that have been started from time to time linking the american negro to his african heritage they know about marcus garvey for instance they know that dubois called the first panafrican congress they admire these people tremendously and they feel although they recognize that the american negro is first of all an american that he needs to know a great deal more about his heritage than apparently he does who are the american writers with whom africans seemed most familiar they were certainly familiar with langston hughes they knew some of the work of arna bontemps particularly in east and central africa because arna had been out to the university college in kampala for a period of months helping the college organize its library they knew william faulkner a group of us one night had a session on faulkner they knew the older american writers whitman and emerson they knew strangely enough maybe not so strangelyjohn steinbeck and they seemed to know him better than ernest hemingway although theyd all read hemingway one of the interesting things about their knowledge of american literature is that it has been acquired on their own none of the universities have courses in american literature i pointed out to british members of some faculties that this was provincial of them especially in light of the fact that except for boris pasternak americans have in the last seven eight years taken the nobel prize for literature in the states we have a great and important body of literature i told them and you completely neglect it they didnt like the accusation but it was the truth one can assume then that if there are no courses on american literature there are none on american negro literature this is right and it is why african members of the faculty and african students were very happy to get the shelf of ten books including the works of richard wright langston hughes and james baldwinwhich i presented for amsac to various universities during my tour there were in fact many places many institutions i was unable to visit which heard about the hooks and have written to the lagos office asking if they could have them on the subject of another american negro writeryourselfi had spoken with a great deal of admiration to wole soyinka about your book the lonesome road when i was in lagos for a brief stay and was pleased to see that he reviewed the book a couple of months ago in one of the lagos papers did you see it yes a very flattering review im quite proud of it vm certainly thankful to you for giving us this time to talk about your trip may i say that in a little better than five years of amsacs existence your tour on our behalf has been one of the most telling things in the relationship between america and africa that amsac has sponsored the laudatory letters that have come in from universities and individuals about your visit testify to this we hope we will be able to undertake similar projects in the future mr breman and miss pool paul breman and rosey e pool both are dutchborn and live within walking distance of each other in london and have beenin mr bremans own wordson very friendly terms for the last years because of our mutual interests their mutual interests of course include the poetry of north american negroes although they are not associated at all in their current ventures mr breman confesses that his heritage project is not at all a moneymaking endeavor but he believes that it will be in timeproviding american negroes and englishspeaking africans become adequately interested in negro poetry following a ballad of remembrance mr breman published it already is available an anthology of some new names under the title sixes and sevens this volume is dedicated to the late harold jackman of new york the heritage imprint was chosen by mr breman because the poet is both the traditional keeper of cultural heritage and one of the more important leavers of cultural legaciesa position which especially in the case of the american negro could well become a key position the heritage series of four volumes of poetry may be ordered directly from mr breman in london or through booksellers an extra cents or according to the editions selected should be added to the check or money order for conversion fee incidentally mr breman is anxious to have it known that none of the volumes published by heritage will be subsidized by the authors rosey e pool has lived a rich and varied life she is paul breman is she was a teacher of anne frank a german prisoner during world war ii and later a resistance fighter her interest in american negro poetry extends back to when she discovered countee cullen she has been responsible for some eight books plus numerous translations a year ago she addressed the inaugural gathering at the lagos nigeria center of the american society of african culture on the subject new trends poetry by margaret burroughs it was the beginning of the christmas sea son and someone had plopped a prepaid ticket of on my desk for a party to be held over in hyde park it seemed from reading the copy that it was to be an interracial benefit for some good cause or other since it was saturday night and my steady date had begged off for the evening and i did not like to face the prospects of sitting at home on that special night looking at tv i decided to make use of the ticket and attend the party i do not know how white folks feel about saturday night but i do know that colored folks work hard all week and look forward to having a natural ball at least that one night besides it had been some time since i had been inside of one of those exclusive hyde park apartments and i felt like seeing how the other half lived again for a change when i had finished dressing in one of my exotic numbers which i feel play up my negritudehair eyes full lips and alli called for a livery to deliver me to the door i do not feel safe going into a white neighborhood unescorted and especially before christmas when people need money and dont care who they get it from as i was riding along i wondered if i would have any trouble with some white landlord getting upset because he saw colored visiting in his building i certainly didnt feel like fighting that kind of battle right then these landlords do not seem to understand that some white people have guts enough to have colored friends and that the neighborhood is not being invaded every time a colored person visits in a white building i decided that the christmas spirit must have taken hold for i had no trouble getting into the building i was received at the door very cordially by the host and hostess after chatting with them for awhile i found that she is a writer and that he is in the advertising business and further that they are prominent in a lot of dogood organizations which have to do with colored and white people getting along better together i liked their ideas right off for i too am for people getting along better together and i would like to see a lot more white people and colored people too like this couple not just talking about brotherhood but trying to live it i was pleased with what i saw everything was decorated real christmaslike with holly wreaths and bells and the people that i was introduced to both colored and white were all very nice i sat down in the living room and just enjoyed being surrounded by all of that fine modern furniture and having my feet buried in the soft persian rug i love nice things like that though i have not been able to afford them i just reared back and closed my eyes for a few moments listening to the christmas music playing on the fine bleached walnut hifi it sounded so good that i could hardly tell where the sound was coming from not wanting to sit in one place too long i got up and began to look at the original paintings hanging on the walls if you sit in one place too long at one of these interracial parties and you are colored pretty soon some white person will come over and insist on talking to you not wanting you to feel lonely or left out or to think that they are prejudiced they never seem to think that you just might be enjoying yourself being left alone these were all modern and abstract paintings real originals by artists like picasso bracque rothko and pollack i tried my best but i couldnt make much sense out of all those blobs lines and curlicues of paint the color was nice though some of the white guests came up and looked at them too they acted as if they could read those paintings like reading a book but not me even when i studied the history of art in school i couldnt make sense out of the nonobjectives i like representative art even if that does make me sound like a square i continued to look around the apartment and i must say that it was wellappointed or swelegant as a lady columnist in the colored weekly would say if she was writing it up it was just like the pictures that you see in the home magazines that people decorate their cocktail tables with i liked that place and couldnt help comparing it with my little old kitchenette i wondered how much rent they paid for it i went into the powder room which was right off the bathroom and locked myself in this was so fine that it could have been used for a living room someone rattled the door and i came out and walked down the hall to the dining room which was set up like a bar i could hear the christmas music back there from a speaker built into the wall it was very pleasant and i was feeling glad i came i ordered a drink and i was just sitting there at a corner of the bar sipping it and thinking of nothing in particular not even the race problem when i heard my name called hello there madge i looked around and coming straight toward me was a white woman with wavy dark hair at first i didnt quite recognize her because except for the color of the hair most white people look alike to me but a closer look told me who she was even though i had not seen this woman in over ten years oh sylvia goodrich i extended my hand its a small world isnt it how have you been now i had it her husbands name was bob and we all used to work together on the artist project in the good old days of wpa we used to visit back and forth because in those days people were not suspicious of you if you had colored or white friends they and a number of other white artists used to live down at thirtyfifth and cottage grove in a section called the arcade which isnt there any more then the project folded and i seldom saw any of those people any more only once in a great while and now here was sylvia i did remember though that she could talk up a blue streak but then it was nice to see someone at the party that i knew even if it was from a long time ago is bob with you i looked around no bob had some work to get out hes in map making now sylvia sat down sort of traoping me into the corner i was mighty glad to see her but i wished she hadnt squeezed me in like that i do not like being crowded by either white or colored people holiday greetings madge she said youre looking fine you look good yourself too sylvia after all of these years you are being kind said sylvia she peered at me closely and i felt as if she was counting every single gray hair and wrinkle that i had but you have not aged a bit trim figure smooth skin not a sign of gray how do you do it i dont have time to get old i laughed too much to do just trying to make ends meet inwardly i was thankful for my african and indian blood it seemed that with that blood you just didnt break as fast as the white people well there was one advantage then we went off into a lot of talk about the good old days and as i said before sylvia could really talk she was feeling pretty good and it seemed to me that she had had a couple before she got to this party i hoped that she knew how to hold her liquor for i certainly did not want her to embarrass me by acting up i do not like that from anybody either colored or white say madge said sylvia i just got back from the west indies you ever been there not that i know of i said ive heard its great down there though nice climate and all ive been going down for a few weeks every winter for the past several years said sylvia i love it simply love it especially haiti i compared my arm with hers you sure got a fine tan this time i said a little bit more and you could pass for colored sylvia took a hurried gulp from her drink and i wished i hadnt said what i did i thought id better change the subject for i do know that white people are very sensitive about being mistaken for colored even though they do bum themselves to a crisp in the summer trying to get a tan and the colored people who already have a tan put bleach cream on themselves trying to get rid of theirs also the white people get permanent waves trying to make their hair curly and the colored people use hot combs to try and get the curl out of their hair its crazy i think since i am quite satisfied with myself the way that i am the travel posters sure make it look good down there i said its indescribably beautiful said sylvia and especially the people they are colored all shades from blueblack to honeyyellow uh huh i bristled inwardly theres just about the same range here in south side chicago i hoped she wasnt going to start all that colorstuff talk i was sure that those west indians didnt get all mixed up like that by themselves i decided to let that one pass the music and dancing sylvia went on is just out of this world the rhythm of the drums simply possess me every time i hear them she began to tap on the bar with her fingers i began to consider how i could get out of that comer i was not going to have sylvia goodrich or anyone else bringing me down i supposed now that she would come up with some of that stuff about how colored people just naturally have rhythm if she did i wasnt going to stand for it i didnt care how many years i had known her i was getting ready to put her down right then and there i guess thats where katherine dunham picked up all that afrocuban dancing i said of all the islands madge she said seeming not to hear me i love haiti the best um hum i lit a cigarette and tried to blow the smoke out in rings like you said it must be very colorful i was losing interest in the subject fast you see madge sylvia was close up to my face now i maneuvered back and saved my drink from being toppled over the woman must have been halflit or something i thought she continued you see madge the reason why i love haiti so and the colored people is is because im part colored myself you i stared at her maybe i was the one who had had one too many yes like you madge im colored too she spoke louder this time and the person serving the drinks glanced toward us oh yes oh yes i said but dont be so loud about it i know how to humor people when they have had one or two drinks too many i patted her shoulder youll be alright in a little while sylvia her voice was steady and even and she looked straight at me youre wrong madge im not drunk or even high this is something that i have been trying to say for a long time now ive said it and it doesnt sound bad at all im colored she repeated im colored just like you there seemed to be a note of pride in her voice even i wondered if sylvia was trying to pull my leg or something in case she didnt know it i did not play these kind of games with white people did she think i was a fool or something if you stood her up beside lena horne lena would look quite colored and you know lena looks whiter than a whole lot of white people well i thought if a couple of drinks could make this white woman declare that she was colored then that was her own business but she really ought to know what she was letting herself in for before she went shooting off her mouth i sure was the one to tell her too because i have been colored for a long time and it is no bed of roses she must have known about all of that jim crow stuff that you had to go through but it was alright with me she was free white and over twentyone and she sure had a right to decide to be colored if she wanted to besides i had read about how so many lightskinned colored people passed over to the white side each year i guessed there was nothing wrong with some white people coming on this side and declaring themselves to be colored i am not prejudiced so it is alright with me you dont have to talk so loud i said no use letting everybody know your business sylvia seemed more relaxed now as if she had just put down a heavy load which no doubt she had do you mean to tell me that you didnt know or suspect something back in the old days she asked a few of our close friends knew i took sylvias hand well that christmas spirit has a way of sneaking up on you no sylvia i never had the slightest idea you see i have always just taken people as they come if theyre white theyre white if theyre colored theyre colored it never bothered me i spoke nonchalantly i was not going to let sylvia know that her little confession had shaken me in the least my grandmother sylvia confided further was a mulatto halfwhite halfhaitian negro welcome on over to our side honey i quipped but you sure could have fooled me i guess you did but youve been white so long whats the use of doing anything about it now its just that so many times i have wondered whether i made the right decision or not i have relatives in haiti and some in chicago too it is lonely being cut away madge i knew my cousins when i was younger and they knew me but when i entered college we moved and went over on the white side completely i see i shook my head understandingly dad was scotchirish he knew about mother and didnt care but mother sylvia was thoughtful i really shouldnt hold it against mother she wanted me to grow up having all the advantages she didnt want me to suffer all of the things that are just a way of life with colored people you really cant blame her for that it isnt easy but i sighed somehow or other we live prosper and overcome sylvias words rushed out like an unstopped fountain well bob knew and he didnt mind but he got a good job and i thought well that was when we moved out of the interracial colony on thirtyfifth and stopped inviting our colored friends over even someone might find out you know how hard good jobs were to find then she took out a cigarette and paused while i lit it for her she inhaled deeply i know it sounds like crying over spilt milk i guess it is i remember how hurt bob was when i had the operation bob loves children hes always playing with them on the street the colored ones too but i was afraid you know what people say about throwbacks i have heard i said but science has knocked that theory into a cocked hat a child of mixed blood is never darker than the darkest parent i guess my fears were based on an old wives tale she said well its too late to think about that now here bob and i are approaching middle age or as they say early maturity and materially we havent done too badly she laughed bitterly why we have everything she banged the glass down on the bar yes everything including misery yes yes i know i said trying to understand how anyone could be miserable having everything even if it did include a smidgin of colored blood madge im tired of running moving into new all lilywhite suburbs acting the way i think a white woman should staying away from my own blood relatives im sick and tired of it if youre tired then stop it i advised you said your husband didnt mind stop running and moving and pretending and just be what you want to be but i dont know where to start how to start finding my own identity sylvia said what do you do where do you go you could start by looking up some of your kin people i said nothing wrong in that its fashionable nowadays for white people to have colored friends and vice versa thats called brotherhood and being christmas this is just the season for it i could try to find them sylvia said bob has often urged me to look them up but after i had rejected them i was afraid i would not be well received her eyes lit up ill take the chance she said ill look them up i hear there are a lot of little cousins i know bob will enjoy playing santa claus for them with me thats the spirit sylvia i told her i think youll be able to work it out from here on in i gathered up my purse hear the caroling up front lets join them lets do said sylvia i hope i havent spoiled the party for you by burdening you with a recital of my problems not in the least i said we started down the hall toward the living room i was laughing sylvia took my arm and i didnt mind it at all whats so funny madge you see syl my great grandfather was white and in our family were not too proud of the fact but since you have confided in me i guess i can reveal the family secret to you that he was white asked sylvia oh no i said not that well what was it she asked we heard he was a horsethief i said merry christmas someone shouted as we emerged into the living room merry christmas sylvia and i answered and we were both laughing fit to kill lennie pain never worried lennie much but this time it was bad lying on the canvas under the glaring ring lights his mouth and throat were choked with blood his nose was swollen and hotly clogged making it hard to breathe but still he wasnt worried he ignored pain and was only angry with himself for the blood pain was a way of life with him ever since he was old enough to remember he had known pain in one form or other anguish frustration and hurt were common everyday things to a black man in a white world pain was black and all the hardship that went with it it was his mothers working and sweating in a hot laundry trying to feed and raise her child who ran wild in the streets it was his mother sick and out of work it was the white lady from the welfare department with her fine clothes and arrogant charity without which he would have been even hungrier than he was it was being born illegitimate and black too it was leaving school to find a job watching his mother shrivel up and die too soon it was being a good young fighter who never got his chance until he was old and his reflexes had slowed it was working as a stevedore by day and training by night and never being at his best physically it was seven children a harlem flat and the need to fight it was a lovely colored girl who deserved a better husband and the thought of her pain when he would not quit it was one hundred and fortyseven pounds of tired human fighting equipment that couldnt quit pain was lennie johnson he pushed himself to one knee and wondered what round it was then he stood up the referee was brushing off his gloves asking him if he were all right lennie muttered something about being okay okay was normal normal was pain lennie felt normal he looked across the ring at the hot eager white face of dave holly his opponent the welterweight champion of the world the referee left him and holly was at him again tough young and anxious the pain became more intense lennie shuffled forward meeting those furious well trained fists doggedly ignoring the beating the blood and pain he had to win he felt it he must he told himself stay with him baby dont let this white boy lick you stay with him you have been hurt before dave holly met him up on his toes beautifully balanced and coordinated as he dealt out pain with cold sure precision the bell rang back in his corner his handlers worked him over frantically trying to stop the bleeding wading through blood and scar tissue in an effort to stop what they knew they could only prolong how do you feel lennie he answered okay they knew how he felt but they wanted to be sure how bad it was where are we lennie the garden man whore we fighting lennie stretched his swollen bloody face in a painful grin im fighting the meanest man in the world they all smiled a little then he was okay get him in close where you can hit him with the right lennie baby hit him with that good right hand im tryin man im tryin they gave him some mouth wash he spit the blood and water out in the bucket the warning buzzer went off he stood up and someone shoved in his mouthpiece the bell rang he went out to meet dave holly and the pain the champion began where he had left off he came and went like the wind delivering beautifully executed combinations with tremendous speed and timing lennie tried everything he knew bobbing weaving feinting and always coming forward he used all his experience but he still couldnt get close holly fought like a thief never getting in trouble never off balance lennie felt an odd grudging admiration for the champion the kind an experienced craftsman always feels when he meets a man who really knows his trade dave holly knew his he fought from afar staying away from lennies only real weapon a lethal right hand lennie couldnt figure a plan of attack he couldnt get close to deliver that one good clean shot holly was there then he was gone he hit lennie with swift hard punching devastation then in the ninth it happened lennie got hit with a hook that tipped him over backwards it was an awesome blow delivered with terrific force and precise timing lennie fell on his back his head snapped back violently against the canvas the roar of the crowd rang in his already pounding ears through bloodied eyes he looked up at the glaring blue and white haze of ring lights over head he felt nausea he wanted to throw up his head was on fire with a throbbing aching pain he was cold above him everything swirled crazily in a putrid mixture of blurred blinding yellow and blue whiteness that clashed sickeningly with the crimson smear of his own blood his mind screamed at him get up lennie get up dont just lie there please lennie please get up baby he fought with his protesting tired body he had to get up his heart told him to get up when life knocks you down you have to get up even though the white man beats you to your knees you have to get up and hit back to hell with pain fight back suddenly his head was clear it was though he were young again he felt sharp and invincible he stood up fast the referee was there then the champion was on him again he drove lennie back punching furiously hitting mauling as he tried to end it dave holly became cocky and a little too anxious lennie played possum he let himself be beaten and driven back holly threw caution to the winds he had lennie in a corner he thought he had him pinned down for the kill and then discovered with sudden awakening panic that it was he who was pinned down lennie had finally succeeded in leading him to close quarters lennie threw the works smashing through hollys frantic unsure defense he hit the champion with two clean wicked hooks and the prettiest right hand he ever threw holly went down hard bringing the crowd to its feet screaming in disbelief the smoke filled arena was bedlam people bellowed delighted and angry obscenities they pounded each other on the back this was lennies biggest moment never before had he felt like this even as the referee pushed him away toward a neutral corner lennie knew he would never again know this feeling standing across the ring lennie watched dave holly struggle to his feet lennie got set to end it his chest and spirits heaved violently with pain and joy he knew he had his man he knew it he saw holly wavering unsteadily as the referee wiped off his gloves the end was near never had lennie felt as much like fighting as right now his body and mind tingled with sharp clear thinking readiness it was just a matter of time lennie knew it holly knew it and so did this roaring maniacal fight crowd as it stood waving hats and coats grinning laughing shouting and letting itself go crazy lennie shuffled out to end it holly retreated desperately he stalled he hit lennie with several light jabs to the head then all of a sudden lennie johnson stopped sh fighting the champion kept retreating wary of another possum trick lennies eyes went glassy and his hands fell uselessly and heavily to his sides his knees buckled pitifully then he pitched forward and fell face down with his hands still at his sides when his face smashed into the canvas he was already dead the pain was gone the wedding and the wonder first i saw him on the airwaves sitting by y a blonde young woman ii l thought there goes another good man all the bright rich or brilliant ones get captured by some blonde even my own son young as he is recognizes the special something sparkling from a golden gal dismayed i musedif they dont get them the first time they take them on the second goround walter thurgood and adam i recalled when mboya spoke on tv i could tell he was annoyed the interviewer a mike wallacetype sought to draw him out on subjects which it was plain to see the interviewer knew nothing about atiently yet like a coiled spring mboya answered eager to be free and out of there a quiet word or two to acknowledge the presence of his companion and perhaps make her feel at ease do you envy this woman to myself i queried yes i envy her by what right does she cling so comfortably to him why does he not confide in one of us one like me bore him did she not wiped his nose and spanked his hiney when he was bad where was this english lady when they mistook him for a mau mau would she have stood beside him then yet where was i would i have stood beside him then this blonde has just as much right to sit beside him as you have said to me and think would you not like to have a blonde beside you reflecting i answered yes tonight i would be happy to have anyone beside me blonde or black i am so lonely i felt ashamed when i saw pictures of his wedding there she stoodthe brideall of ten years his junior black and slender as a reed i was still dissatisfied hes brilliant i sputtered to myself hes handsome stalwart noble in carriage why could he not have found a beauty perhaps shes beautiful inside i thought consolingly but he deserves a beauty one can see in disgust i cried to me o hypocrite let this dear man lay he is a stranger to you this mboya what if he knew about this foolish game you play and then i saw the closeup the lovelight oer her face it did enthrall to me i said perhaps this fellow found a beauty after all the revolt of louis e lomax the negro revolt bring himself to abandon it when he found so little genuine evidence of honesttogoodness revolt as most of us understand the term instead he searched until he found in the britannica world language dictionary a definition that was bound to fit ie an extensive or drastic change in a condition method or idea a definition of revolt broad and vague enough to apply equally well to abstract painting the bessemer converter the invention of printing the social security system and the medieval guilds is surely broad enough to include louis lomax for what seems to have happened is that lomax has updated and adapted to modern communications an ancient and sometimes indispensable negro art fooling white people if in the process a few colored people are also fooled this is only to be expected his success in fooling his publishers appears to be total their conviction of his expertise in racial matters is such that they apparently felt it unnecessary to exercise even routine editorial diligence in processing the manuscript otherwise how account for such unnecessary if minor errata as seven naacp regions on page and six on page placing the freedom rides in p dating the civil_rights act in p misspelling the name of lomaxs friend otto mcclarrin in his acknowledgments lomax calls him mclaurin and references to the negro american labor council as the american negro labor council p to cite a few it is barely possible of course that harper and brothers did not much care in their and the authors anxiety to get something out in a hurry that might profitably tap the current popular interest in negro affairs the niceties of accuracy and thoroughness may have seemed only bothersome hindrances to a fast market and speedy royalties it is distressing of course that matters of the greatest moment in which so many dedicated people are heavily and sacrificially engaged should be made the plaything of this kind of cynicism but there is an unhappily long tradition behind it in this country as well as in others aside from the moral distress there is reason for distress on practical grounds greshams law prevails in the world of letters as well as in monetary circles and every meretricious work on an important subject makes it harder for serious and competent treatment to get a proper hearing and finally there is the sadness of knowing that the author of the negro revolt might if he would write an analysis of real significance and of genuine value in the cause which he espouses with such apparent sincerity in his preface to the crucial decadeand after eric goldman describes a procedure he followed one which ought to be an inviolable text for the conscientious commentator naturally in writing of events so recent and controversial i have been especially concerned about the danger of factual inaccuracy beyond the usual scholarly checks i tried to ward off error through a direct appeal to the participant in the story whenever it seemed to me feasible or sensible i sent a copy of the appropriate manuscript pages to the man or woman i had written about and asked for a check on my facts and i did this without regard to whether the person was a waiter or a world statesman and without regard to whether i had written about him favorably or unfavorably goldman of course retained his own responsibility for his work and did not necessarily accept the responses at face value but he reports that many genuine errors were caught lomax repeatedly seeks to give the impression that he consulted frequently and at length with the persons of whom he wrote and that if any misinterpretations have crept in the fault is not in any lack of diligence on his part but rather in the deviousness or confusion of his sources since he seldom departs from a tone of assured finality generally representing himself as privy to vast inside knowledge hidden from ordinary mortals this pose will undoubtedly convey extreme plausibility to many of his readers many of these also will be strongly persuaded by his veiled warnings that the objects of his criticism will of course deny everythingafter all what would you expect if a personal reference may be forgiven there is a perfect example on page of the kind of error which eric goldmans procedure would have avoided laboring at his untenable thesis that the naacp national leadership is antithetic or at best indifferent to the worth of direct action techniques lomax asserts that i regard sitins and freedom rides as incompatible with the fundamental philosophy of the association the basis for this is a somewhat garbled version of a statement in which i said that the naacp can hardly advocate a policy of mass civil disobedience under contemporary ie nonrevolutionary conditions the latter is indeed my view but all that lomaxs misuse of it shows is that he does not know what mass civil disobedience is it certainly does not encompass sitins or freedom rides which are efforts to make the law applicable not to defy it that they violate local and state law is simply an interim corollary of our federal system and a simple telephone call could have cleared up lomaxs confusion in a few minutes the foregoing is a single one of the scores of errors halftruths distortions and outright fabrications with which the lomax discussions of the naacp are loaded i do not apologize for my preoccupation here with his treatment of the association it is obviously his chief target and the stated object of his synthetic revolt by negroes against the established leadership moreover those portions of the book in which he momentarily dwells on other matters for example the rehashed capsule history of the negros struggle that takes up the first fiftyodd pages the two final chapters and the halfdozen appendix tables culled from government sources as an afterthought add nothing to his primary argument and bear all the earmarks of being there as padding it would require half as many pages as lomaxs book contains to correct all the perversions of fact to be found in the negro revolt there is a problem also in selecting certain of them to refute should the criterion be the enormity of the distortion or the inherent importance of the item being misrepresented the futility of hoping in any case to catch up with all the readers who will have been misled is equally apparent nevertheless conscience demands that attempt be made to set the record straight in at least a few instances and these follow chosen more or less at random lomax the precise legalism of the naacp while gaining spectacular courtroom results had made relatively little practical headway p this is a monumentally silly statement especially when taken together with the observation in the same paragraph that direct mass action had paid off handsomely for negroes at montgomery for on page lomax notes that it was the naacps lawsuit which ended bus segregation in montgomery a year of mass action there tremendous though its broader significance was never succeeded in doing this the precise legalism was what turned the trick lomax the sitins and freedom rides have relieved more common indignities for more common people in two years than legalism has accomplished in a quarter of a century p a quarter of a century goes back to in that time the white primary decision of relieved over a million southern negroes from the indignity of not being able to vote legalistic pressures brought freedom from jimcrow military units to hundreds of thousands of negro servicemen legislative pressures brought statewide prohibitions of racial exclusion from restaurants hotels and recreational facilities to millions of negroes in the north and west the supreme court decision outlawing school segregation despite the intransigeance of the deep south has nevertheless removed enforced segregation from the backs of several hundred thousand negro pupils in such states as maryland missouri west virginia and the border states to say nothing of course of the negroes of montgomery who were relieved at one stroke of the humiliation of segregated buses by the aforementioned naacp lawsuit the list could be extended but so preposterous an assertion should not require even this lomax he james farmer was the author of the naacps nationally voiced suggestion that negroes withhold their patronage from certain chain stores p it does not detract from james farmers contributions to the fight to state unequivocally that this was not so roy wilkins directive of february was exclusively a wilkins product conceived and drafted before anyone on his staff had any inkling of it lomax the major issue of the naacp convention was whether the naacp would as a matter of official policy employ direct action to storm further the bastions of segregation p on the contrary there was no such issue at that convention aside from the fact that the naacp has used direct action for years as a matter of official policy the convention devoted an entire evening to eulogizing naacp youth units in wichita oklahoma city and st louis for successful sitin activity during and early there was a seriously contended issue at the convention however the robert williams case and lomax typically twists it to fit his thesis according to lomax williams was dismissed as president of the branch in monroe n c for having advocated that negroes defend themselves by arms if necessary the national office claims lomax affirmed the right of selfdefense but did not feel that branches should state this as a general policy p but the issue in the williams case was never selfdefense and lomax knows this very well williams had called on negroes to meet lynching with lynching and had urged them when justice miscarried to declare and execute judgment themselves on white offenders he resorted to the selfdefense pretext only when it seemed that it might help him get out from under what he had actually said lomax in a desperation move when faced by prowilliams forces on the convention floor the naacp leadership called in mrs daisy bates then riding high as the heroine of little rock p no one called in daisy bates who is nobodys trained seal her impassioned and effective plea for the leaderships position was her own idea and it owed a great deal to the revulsion she had felt two nights earlier while listening to williams speaking on a harlem street corner lomax only in the last decade have negro contributions to the naacp matched those of white people p for at least the past thirty years the great bulk of naacp income each year has come from membership payments and branch fundraising and relatively little of this money has been of white origin lomax as evidence that the naacp is on the downgrade its membership was several thousand less than in and for the first time in years the national office is running a deficit and must draw on its reserves p the net membership loss for turned out to be around a drop of about three per cent increases in southern membership largely offset losses in some recessionhit northern cities as for the deficit one would hardly boast about it but it was by no means the first in years marked the fourth or fifth year in which the operating deficit exceeded and it was a smaller one than in either or these deficits be it noted occurred in years of successive income peaks the association has consistently taken in more money in each of the last six or seven years the explanation of the deficits is simple every year the naacp has expanded its activity to meet the expanding needs of the civil_rights struggle and it has had to cope with the multiple rising costs of engaging in such activity one could go on and on but a halt must be called somewhere though strongly tempted to deal with lomaxs fanciful conception of naacp organizational politics i shall confine myself to a final item lomaxs considered estimate of what the naacps program consists of stripped he asserts of the prestige heritage and lore the program consists of an excellent lobby in washington a good research department an ability to lodge protests in high places some modest efforts toward school desegregation in the south and lending a helping hand to negroes with racial troubles this is all that lomax selfassertedly an active member of the jamaica n y branch one of our best can find after scrupulous search and inquiry so be it but lets examine a bit of this superfluous prestige heritage and lore for example the naacps voter registration work employing two fulltime southern field workers since and costing by the end of over with fullfledged campaigns conducted at least once in each of more than cities and towns resulting in a carefully estimated additions to the voting rolls but for lomax to mention this would of course spoil much of his chapter in which he alleges that the kennedy administration had to bludgeon the naacp into doing something about voter registration for example the endless daytoday job of keeping this organization viable so that the unquestionably excellent lobby in washington can have a punch behind it a score of state and regional field secretaries maintain constant vigilance over the state of civil_rights in their areas they stimulate and guide branches in the carrying out of action programs and they are always on the scene when trouble breaks for example the extensive program of school desegregation in northern communities active school integration programs in cities with lawsuits under way in fifteen more for example the hundreds of job discrimination complaints investigated and filed with government agencies and the ceaseless pressure maintained by the naacp labor department on scores of employers unions and the presidents committee on equal job opportunity for example the career guidance work of the naacp youth department to say nothing of the work of its youth units in breaking down job bias by direct action in durham jacksonville savannah kansas city and a dozen other places to say nothing of the fact that the major portion of all the sitin activity was carried on by naacp youth councils and college chapters for example the painstaking work of instructing and guiding local branches in the intricate business of combatting discriminatory practices in housing and urban renewal in the most effective manner requiring the full time of a special assistant for housing for example a public relations program which bears a large part of the responsibility for public enlightenment on the true state of negrowhite relations through its press and wire service and its dayin dayout counselling of those whose words must carry the message out via this and all other media of mass communication may heaven continue to increase such prestige heritage and lore for without them the common struggle would be increasingly desperate in all truth the negro has been in revolt against the physical shackles that bound him and the legal and social shackles that have hampered him ever since the first slave arrived on these shores there is no new revolt against secondclass citizenship although there is clearly in sight the massive involvement in the struggle which has been a cardinal objective and an endless hope of the naacp since its founding nor is there anything new about the negros questioning of his leadership this too has characterized his upward way from the beginning and god willing it will be so as long as the battle lasts to those who doubt i would say only that the naacp will let neither just pride in its monumental achievements nor momentary dismay at the carping of illinformed or malicious critics deter it in the slightest from going on with its job with speed and vigor until the job is done the ole miss epic here ive been saying all these rather unkind things about senator eastland of mississippi ancj turns out hes a champion of civil_rights in fact as chairman of the senate judiciary committee hes dispatched investigators to ole miss to see whether anybodys civil_rights have been violated by the federal marshals the investigators are experts as they happen to be mississippians themselves so it sounds like a grand investigation i figure the investigators will produce a great documentary film entitled operation abolitionist the villain of course is this great hulking pound negro named mr james meredith played by mr sonny liston the hero is a governor barnett played by mr tab hunter with grayed hair the federal marshals will all be played by that german actor who usually plays general rommel as the movie opens mr meredith a mafia member on the lam is trying to bully his way into ole miss because he has secret orders from the kremlin to ravish every one of the young ladies in the alpha omega sorority played by miss ann rutherford along with their alumnae advisers miss greer garson and thereby convert all southern womanhood into black muslims who are really agents of the international jewish conspiracy in blackface at first mr meredith is on the verge of success by torturing and stomping on seven frail aged crippled registrars he seems about to storm his way into undefiled ole miss the students while loyal americans at heart are apathetic and do not exercise their inalienable civil right of lynching mr meredith but at the last moment in charges the governor on a white horse tadah he is a wearing a rebel cap and a confederate flag cowed by the sight alone mr meredith starts to slink away intending to return to his usual work of slipping heroin into the milk bottles of hospital nurseries when disaster in stomp goosestepping federal marshals wearing hobnailed boots nazi field jackets and spiked helmets they have been dispatched by the mafiacommunistblack muslimjewishnazi conspiracy which secretly controls the white house unloading their portable forge and collapsible steel ring they forge a steel ring around ole miss then in the dark of night a tiny pinkcheeked curlyhaired southern boy looking for his mommy toddles up to the federal commander played by genghis khan the federals immediately open fire with dumdum bullets wiping out the little lad and the entire alpha omega sorority closeups the documentary closes with a moving peroration by general walker played by general walker who says this is not the way to cuba he h not only will this be very believable in mississippi but it shows what a champion senator eastland is of civil_rights you know the whites get the rights and the negroes get to be civil or else by sekou toure objective interpre ck tations are at the root h of one of the prow e found misconceptions that prevent a true understanding of africas problems and the concerns and activities of her peoples for the interpretations made by foreign specialists in african affairs are as a rule based on the conditions of their own social milieu and thus take little account of the specific conditions of the various african societies if the problems of africa are to be understood analyzed and solved we must take into consideration the historical economic social moral and cultural conditions which shape africas particular identity in the worldelements of the african evolution in which total emancipation of the african peoples remains the main objective an attempt to solve specific african problems out of context according to some halfunderstood universal concept neglects the especially important social factors such an approach assumes that science has reached its limits that mankinds present knowledge is absolute and immutable and that in these matters there is nothing further to be expected attempted or desired it implies that human society having reached maturity begins to decline on the contrary everything indicates that it is still full of contradictions and imperfections and that these are the causes of its difficulties its crises and its disequilibrium thus the course of progress far from being limited is infinite in time and space it is absurd to suppose that an american laborer can think and act in the same manner as the president of a great new york bank it is just as absurd to conceive of the african or the african nations acting in terms that are supposed to be universal but actually are only relative depending on particular historical or social conditions there are no simple solutions to human problems nor will there be while vast differences in living conditions keep peoples apart while agricultural and industrial overproduction constitutes a permanent problem in the most highly developed nations and while a tragic lack of consumer goods and equipment remains a serious peril for the peoples of the underdeveloped or undeveloped nations poor peoples underdeveloped nations have needs and demands which are essential to the fulfillment of their hopes and which have nothing in common with those of the highly developed nations and their rich populations it is not strange that all peoples want security and seek to improve their standards of life t for mans universal aspiration is for progress social justice freedom prosperity and peace but each of these aspirations has a particular order of urgency for each people and draws on infinitely varied potentialities and capacities because of their historical past and their present state of underdevelopment asians and africans obviously have more in common with one another than with europeans however it is not from this point of view and with these given facts that we must study the problems posed by the relationships between peoples if we wish to avoid emphasizing the rift in the world and increasing the imbalance which already exists in society these problems it need hardly be emphasized concern all peoples nations and individuals powerful or weak rich or poor hence it is pointless to expect the african farmer with his rudimentary tools his pathetically inadequate productive capacity and his miserable living conditions all of which may be interesting from an exotic point of view but in human terms are tragic to think and act like a factory owner and it is pointless to expect the guinean wageearner whether whitecollar or factory worker to think and act like a general motors employee or like a worker in a metallurgical combine in a socialist country in different social conditions the same words refer to different realities and these differences sometimes are very great but to infer thereby that nations cannot understand each other does not advance the solution of the problem one inch the fact that african crows are black with a white collar does not keep them from being crows any more than the green plumage of africas pigeons keeps them from being pigeons to understand both the language of africa and its true content we must seek to find in its words expressions formulations not the abstract character of a dialectic but the substance and reality of the life they express this life is made up of human imperatives social demands and vital material needs and these become increasingly explicit and urgent as the awareness of the african peoples develops and is able to measure the social injustice that characterizes their human condition the extent of the movement for national liberation which has suddenly brought rebirth to a whole continent and made it part of international life bears witness to the volume and strength of this collective awareness it is not by putting angolan heads on bamboo stakes that the portuguese colonistsor for that matter colonialism in generalwill stem the tide of this growing awareness there would be too many heads to cut off for that actually an important evolution in history is taking place and its consequences direct and indirect will increasingly influence the evolution of world society as a whole indeed the liberation movement will modify the international structure more profoundly than did the two terrible world wars the colonial and semicolonial countries although containing the majority of the worlds population had only geographical existence they appeared on the map of course but their straitjacketed peoples were regarded as unimportant because they were dominated and enslaved by others in appearance they remained mute and motionless but in fact the conviction that a struggle for freedom was necessary was stirring within them today most of these peoples have won back their right to a free and worthy existence the shameful racial segregation rampant in south africa will change nothing on the contrary it sharpens the awareness of the african peoples and strengthens their character it will harden them still more when the inevitable showdown with the afrikaaners with their racist and reactionary views forces the african peoples to face up to this problem steel is tempered by heat will not the same prove true of peoples the more they are restrained and oppressed the more able they become to fulfill their historic destiny the more they are threatened in their liberty their personality their dignity their hopesin their very livesthe more powerfully they arm themselves for the battle to regain and keep their freedom and use their sovereignty in order to satisfy their needs and assure their survival and development thus the struggle for independence whatever the form whatever the means had just one meaning for the african peoples to acquire the first tool to open the way for them to solve their problems as human beings fully conscious of their responsibilities for anyone to imagine that everything is accomplished and that efforts can cease with independence which in any case can still remains to be consolidated in most of the african countries is to close ones eyes to the human evidence to contradict the evolution of history and ignore the existence of poor nations which realize what injustices they have suffered and burn to exploit their hidden potentialities the equilibrium to be thus attained is not one between antagonistic forces so much as a harmonization of the worldwide levels of development for us the element of need prevails over more philosophical and even ideological factors for the human needs of which man is consciously aware and which are part of his very being constitutes the true motive force of history the intensity of this force is a function of the forces which hamper and combat it it is vain then to hope that africa will evolve according to any specific form which might be im posed upon her contrary to her own wishes or understanding she will evolve within her own authentic framework and in accordance with her own personality until her economic conditions lose their particular characteristics and become normal it is futile to talk of protecting africa or to give her alms which will salve the conscience of some blunt temporarily the awareness of others and perpetuate inequalities between peoples by maintaining differences in their living conditions and it is futile to try to trace any one path that africa must follow africa must be left free to follow her own historical path starting from the imperatives of her destiny and taking into account the requirements of a fraternal and united world in other words it is a question of affirming our africanity that is to say our personality without attempting to dress it up in western or eastern costume what must be constructed harmoniously and rapidly is an africa that is authentically african africa has her own needs concepts and customs she does not seek to deck herself out in borrowed clothing that does not fit this destiny while presupposing the total disappearance of colonialism the liquidation of imperialism and the establishment of a society free from privileges also opens new and inspiring perspectives of justice progress and universal peace need we recall that by hold ing onto their present privileges and technical superiority the highly developed nations are depriving themselves of the creative talent and productive capacities of hundreds of millions of people in the underdeveloped nations already the modem worlds scientific capacities can no longer be measured country by country more and more the utilization of recently discovered scientific methods calls for the cooperation of several countries indeed of all countries together in view of this it seems bitterly ironical that progress upon which mankinds greater happiness depends is hampered less by lack of knowledge than by the sealing off by certain selfish peoples of information about their scientific discoveries experiments and achievements as a result of their substituting the will to power for the will to progress human happiness and the interests of nations are deliberately and irrevocably sacrificed paradoxically it is in the name of safeguarding human happiness and the interests of peoples that men choose the perilous path of military power leading perhaps to the end of humanity so far as africa is concerned this situation leads to something that is tangible and easily grasped compared to other continents africa is relatively retarded but to what is this backwardness attributable to some natural inequality between black man and white no for there are black men who by their culture have an intrinsic value superior to that of certain white men hence in so far as individual capacities are concerned there is no such thing as intellectual inequality among men whatever their color or race inequality exists solely in living conditions in the accidents of history that is to say in the political economic and social conditions that have dictated and still dictate the levels of development in different parts of the world this is true of the political situation within a nation in which political considerations have hampered national development as in european countries like spain portugal and greece it is true of the economic and social situation where foreign intervention has resulted in exploitation and social oppression as in any country subjected to direct or indirect foreign rule but does the inequality exist in the realm of intelligence we say categorically no does it exist then in the ethics or social theory of the two groups facing each other again we say no africa is not backward in the moral and spiritual domain in truth the african is keenly aware of the difference between good and evil of justice of liberty of solidarity of the virtues of work and human charity as well as universal peace he has the same sense of his responsibilities as do the inhabitants of europe america asia or oceania he has with some slight variations the same scale of values hence we cannot consider that he is even provisionally backward either morally or spiritually if there is inequality then it can result only from economic conditions far from being an inherent defect it is the consequence of the low level of scientific technological and financial development of our countries and although in these respects africa is backward compared to other continents she must not on that account underestimate her human personality her economic moral and cultural values her spiritual force or the contribution she can make to world civilization in the past decade africa has become well aware of her lag in material things and is eagerly seeking to attain the level of development of the highly industrialized countries when we analyze the ills that have beset the african indeed the whole black race we are obliged to admit at once that economic factors are what have favored slavery the deportation of our populations racial discrimination colonization and today neocolonialism africa has been exploited and oppressed for economic motives her legitimate desire for rehabilitationsocial moral culturalmust be fulfilled by her economic development we of course know that the world today is interdependent and africa which cannot live in isolation does not intend to remain at the margin of this modern world she thinks she is entitled to benefit from the experience of other nations as well as from the fruits of her own efforts in turn she must contribute actively to the creation of a world society in which each nation while retaining its own personality will be considered on an equal footing with the others and will like them take on its proper share of international responsibilities africa has been carved up and divided the evil of colonialism has not consisted just of exploitation and discrimination but of loss of liberty and seizure of sovereignty only when a people proclaims its independence therefore and exercises its sovereignty can it put an end to every form of exploitation by establishing democratic institutions freeing creative initiatives and assuring individual freedom by social progress colonialisms greatest misdeed was to have tried to strip us of our responsibility in conducting our own affairs and convince us that our civilization was nothing less than savagery thus giving us complexes which led to our being branded as irresponsible and lacking in selfconfidence our greatest victory then will not be the one we are winning over colonialism by securing independence but the victory over ourselves by freeing ourselves from the complexes of colonialism proudly expressing africas authentic values and thoroughly identifying ourselves with them thus the african peoples will become fully conscious of their equality with other peoples the colonial powers had assimilated each of their colonies into their own economy the french colonies were an economic branch of the french economy the british colonies were an extension of the economy of great britain between guinea and sierra leone between french guinea and portuguese guinea there exist common traditional bonds of custom history and economy yet no economic relations existed between them for each was a tributary of the colonial powers market exclusively we know that we must rebuild africa to win and proclaim a nations independence but keep its old structures is to plow field but not sow it with grain for a harvest africas political independence is a means which must be used to create and develop the new african economy our continent possesses tremendous reserves of raw materials and they together with its potential sources of power give it excellent conditions for industrialization this is why though it would be unrealistic and irrational to think of associating the african nations with the european common market or any other form of economic monopoly it is to be hoped that an african common market will be organized which eventually can cooperate on a basis of equality and solidarity with other economic zones african unity is no more a goal in itself than was independence it simply is a means of development a force of interafrican cooperation it is indispensable because of the unjust nature of the relationship between the underdeveloped african nations and the economically strong nations the equality of this relationship must be improved in order to overcome the social inequalities and differentiations in the present levels of development throughout the world the highly developed nations have economic relations among themselves either of cooperation or of competition but their relations with the undeveloped nations are those of exploitation of economic domination the direct colonial exploitation of former days is being succeeded by exploitation by international monopolies and this has a tendency to become permanent paradoxically it is the underdeveloped nations exporting raw materials and crude products which contribute an important share of the costs and the social improvements from which workers in the fully developed countries benefit the nature of our economic relations on the world market can be easily illustrated in the matter of customs tariffs for instance let us glance at a few figures in the period to the exchange value of raw materials and crude products in relation to industrial products fell percent although from to this rate had already fallen percent in relation to the market the extent of the decline on the international market is shown by the following statistics immediately after the war the average per capita income in the usa was dollars per annum while in the underdeveloped countries of asia africa and latin america it was dollars fifteen years later the average annual per capita income in the united states was dollars and in the underdeveloped countries barely dollars thus while in the most developed part of the world the average income was ten times larger than that of the underdeveloped countries which represent the vast majority of the world territory and population this difference has now risen to seventeen times since the war the world average per capita production of food has increased by percent but in africa the production per capita has fallen by percent in latin america it has increased by percent in asia by percent and in developed western europe by percent immediately after the second world war the underdeveloped countries participation in world trade exchange was percent however by its share was reduced to percent in to percent and in to percent in the course of the last ten years alone the prices of industrial goods in international trade have increased by percent while the prices of raw materials have fallen by percent in other words the underdeveloped countries exporting raw materials were towards the end of the fifties purchasing one third less industrial goods for a determined quantity of raw materials as compared with ten years earlier in the light of these circumstances it is easy to understand that the economic unity and monetary independence of africa do not signify as has been naively suggested that guinea will be permitted to sell its coffee to the ivory coast its palmkernel to dahomey and its bauxite to ghana it signifies that as africa enters the international market as a producer all steps must be taken to establish a fair relationship in the active forces which dominate international trade replacing the position of dependence to which the underdeveloped nations are subjected now the mere fact that there are cries of alarm about the production of coffee cacao or peanuts while there is silence about the products for which the demand is increasingly active but whose prices remain stable such as diamonds gold oil radioactive ores zinc and copper illustrates the mercantile nature of the economic relations between the highly developed nations and the nations producing raw materials in the total tax on coffee imported into france was per cent of its import value it was per cent in germany and per cent in italy was it really a question of protectionist measures in the case of coffee or of discriminatory taxation it is a fact that in this same period the price of gold was lower on the french market than it was for instance at siguiri in guinea as a result of surtaxes designed to prevent its sale locally actually the difficulties appearing within the european common market with regard to the renewal of association agreements made by certain african nations prove that it is not the form of the economic relations that must be changed but their very nature here as in other realms the interests of the african peoples are one and the awareness of this unity is rapidly becoming more and more explicit the african nations are realizing that in order to solve their urgent social problems they must speed up the transformation of their trade economy and if this is to be done through industrialization it cannot be done within the limits of our national microeconomies but unconditional integration into a multinational market consisting of highly developed and underdeveloped nations negates the possibility of industrial development in advance it could only be the association of horse and rider if they are to complement each other economically the development of all associated nations must be carried out according to their united needs and common interests any concept which imposes implicitly and a priori a particular orientation and framework on the development of the various nations cannot work for it does not bring a radical solution to the nature of the economic relationships involved or to the general problems facing integrated human communities the leaders of the european economic community seem not to be aware of all this at least as far as africa is concerned and make no secret of their desire to achieve a political community of europe which cannot be reconciled with africas desire for political independence africa remains as grimly hostile as ever to the division of africa which began with the congress of berlin in the unity so much desired by all africans will not be achieved around any one man or any one nation but around a concrete program however minimal the rules of the union must favor and reinforce generally accepted concepts equality of all nations large or small fraternal solidarity in their relationships the common use of certain resources and respect for the character and institutions of each state not only must there be no interference in the internal affairs of any state by another but each must help to solve the others problems if we do not rapidly achieve such a framework of solidarity permitting the peaceful evolution of our countries we risk seeing the cold war enter africa and divide the african states into antagonistic forces and blocs jeopardizing their whole future in common the evolution of our countries in peace and harmony requires a high degree of cooperation we have always thought that africa should be considered like the human body when a finger is cut off the whole body suffers the growing awareness that we all share the same future must make us increase our efforts for this cooperation for solidarity and active and conscious african participation in world progress when we speak furthermore of rehabilitating the african man we do not indulge in a racist doctrine but act in accord with a historical and moral imperative we have suffered too much from the malice and scorn of others we must act so that they will respect us in the future and this we shall do by respecting ourselves and honestly and competently exercising our responsibilities it is a problem of human dignity and of conscience some have claimed to see political antagonisms in the formation of various african groupings actu ally these were the first concrete manifestations of unity and were inspired by human and historical necessity skepticism notwithstanding this tendency toward unity will increase political choices which do not correspond to the needs and aspirations of our peoplesand it is important that this be understoodwill inevitably fail as for what face a united africa will wear whatever the choices she makes in her orientation it will not be turned either against the east or against the west it will be above all and essentially directed toward the emancipation and progress of africa and her peoples in our struggle for freedom there is no room for negative choices but only for positive thought and constructive action what will be destroyed or defeated in this struggle are those things that historical necessities human needs and the forces of progress consign to destruction and oblivion to attempt to interpret africas behavior in capitalist or communist terms is to neglect the fundamental fact that africas present condition corresponds neither to the given facts of capitalism nor to those in the building of communism africas way is the way of peaceful revolution in which the morality of an action counts much more than its form and conditions that some believe socialism corresponds best to the aims of the african revolution while others suppose it is preferable despite the lack of national capital to espouse capitalist principlesthese considerations will not in the last analysis prevent our peoples from deciding their own fate it is they who are called on to make the sacrifices and the creative efforts necessary to ensure africas development their awareness is sufficiently keen to enable them to choose the way they want to go in deciding these matters our peoples will take account of the realities of the twentieth century the tremendous possibilities of future human achievement as well as the knowledge experience and discoveries accumulated in the course of past centuries their commitment will correspond to their hope of future benefits it will be one which makes a real contribution to general progress in peace and human happiness african neutralism then is not shameful indifference a sort of political demobilization on the contrary it is the expression of a lively faith in a happy future for mankind it is something active a participating force an active agent in the struggle for the achievement of a world societyemancipated fraternal and united let us hope that the highly developed nations and peoples can understand this historical movement in its universal significance and that they will take full part in it in the conscious desire to help build a free and prosperous africa in a world of peace and brotherhood the south dissents from me some say that i dissent from the south i p but as strange as it sounds i am hardly conscious of dissenting from the south at all it dissents from me im reminded of the old marching song theyre all out of step but jim apparently i march to a drummer they dont hear or hear but fitfully and dimly if i thought they didnt hear him at all i wouldnt be trying to indicate his drumming i think they do hear him however because hes a southern drummer though with universal reverberations at least he seems so to me the music i march to is as southern as the scene beyond my window this late august morning a scene observed first more than sixty years ago the shadows among the pines the sunlight touched with a haze that betokens autumn the deep woods beyond and the steady high singing of cicadas in the trees so southern that it rises from the earth itself and from my heart on my fathers side i belong to the fifth generation of south carolinians on my mothers the sixth my fathers people were from the s i think small farmers my mothers from about plantation owners historically this was the south farm and plantation balanced each other it was this uncertain and changing balance that helped to give the south its character with the marriage of my parents these two forces joined this might not have been significant if they hadnt been typical of their economic and cultural backgrounds w my father was the yeoman farmer on the make aggressive hottempered democratic impatient of the complacent plantation people around him in true jacksonian spirit he used to say every man is as good as every other man and maybe a dern sight better my mother was quiet assured with a warm paternalism appropriate to the plantation too richly endowed to be complacent but from a complacent background too vital to dream of the past but with the past clinging like an aura about her it was her brother who once remarked to an aunt ideals are a sin alice we should love god now it also happened that i inherited almost equally from each of my parents the acquiescence of my mother the aggressiveness of my father these two opposing attitudes have so fused in me that there is no conflict though there is perhaps a tension i am interested in the old and the new in continuity and change i do not expect the form of the future to copy the form of the past this would leave no room for creation i search the past for creative hints my mother and my mothers plantation gave me the sense of order attainment rest and though my fathers driving ambition never let me think that the plantation might be carried into the future unchanged it never blinded me to the kind of thing i sought order attainment rest i move into the future therefore unhampered by the forms of the past but guided by the spirit the past has revealed to me whenever my fathers urgency carries me forward too fast i hear my mothers quiet words now jamieshe was a mcbride and whenever the complacency of her people slows me down i hear my fathers voice all right son lets get on with the job but theres even more than this though my father and mother were of opposing temperaments and backgrounds and the air was sometimes tense between them i never doubted that they loved each other devotedly it was this enveloping love that fused within me the two so opposing parts of my nature creating thus a harmony from what might have been a fatal struggle i have therefore moved through the world seeking primarily the form of love i sought it first in individuals i seek it now more largely in the south and perhaps even in the world the main problem in the south is what is the form of love here what is to be loved here that there is something indeed much i have no doubt for i look backward through my father and my mother and see through and in them the south in spite of all its absurdities the balanced south and it is nonsense to think there is little to be loved here this is one of our great weaknesses we do not love the south enough i know were passionate about it we feel were devoted to it well fight for it at the drop of a hatand drop the hat ourselves but its a defensive love a love expressed too often as distrust and fear of outsiders a love that does not know its object a misdirected ignorant love what is loves true form in the south if we had more to cherish we should have less to attack as for my defending the south im too busy in the spirit of my father trying to bring it nearer to what in the spirit of my mother i feel it is im not trying to reform it i have little interest in such a moral problem im trying to form it to help it find its form for it can be argued that the south has never come into its own never reached maturity never become the great region the devotion of its people should have made it its problem is the aesthetic one to imagine and become what essentially it is this problem the south should be able to face for she was always rather long on mannersand aesthetic interest and short on morals as for the souths failure to attain maturity this is related to the fact that the region began to become conscious of itself in about at the time of the missouri compromise this political event made it clear to the south that it differed from the rest of the country but the awareness came chiefly from a sense of outside hostility a hostility shortly to become tense and vociferous under the leadership of william lloyd garrison the south had no quiet time in which to become selfconscious it really became so only at the moment of its destruction and as the lost cause it is impossible therefore for contemporary southerners to look backward and say that at such and such a time we were what we would like to be of course this is a foolish wish anyhow no individual or people can go back to an earlier day but our contemporary southerner cannot gain from the past even the image of what he once was for he never really was he was always under great pressure becoming until in his adolescence he was destroyed we are still in our adolescence of course from the european point of view all americans are here the south has the great advantage over other american regions she has a history of such tragic depth and varied nature that she stands now upon the very brink of maturity she could grow up overnight she could come to herself and then her deep and swirling emotions would take form then she would know who she is and where she is going she would distrust and hate the world less and love herself more she would find a form conducive to love her true form wherein perhaps would be combined as we shall see the urgency of my father and the peace of my mother i should like to help her do this my mothers people looked backward my fathers forward within twenty feet of where i now sit on the piazza here at rip raps i heard my mothers mother say shortly before she died in that she had never been reconstructed and didnt intend to be one of her sisters a maiden lady was an early teacher of mine there was no u s flag above the schoolhouse but the inner walls of the tiny building were plastered with the various confederate flags and every friday after lunch we sang confederate songs for the most part however the lost cause aroused in me only a faint nostalgia which i still feel back at home however was my father his mother and her brother a graybearded confederate veteran and their eyes were on the present and the future my fathers mother wa still sitting on the piazza at ninetyfour watching the buggies pass along the public road at the far edge of the field waiting for ten oclock and the morning paper my granduncle the old confederate attending the charleston exposition in was so enthralled by all the possible inventions sketched there that he wanted to live twentyfive fifty even a hundred years longerindeed he said hed like to live to see the whole thing wound up what was i to do balanced thus between the past and the future i did what the south more or less has always done i lived in the present of course every child does but i never got over it because of this emersons aphorism when i came upon it hit home life only avails not the having lived because of this at twentyeight i was examining the poetic experience under john erskine and at thirtyeight lecturing to a college group on the poetry of life though i did not know it then this was a basic southern interest the south has had few poets why partly because she was always trying to be poetic life itself living the present moment always appealed w j cash calls this our hedonism time which moved slowly anyhow through the hot summers and the mild winters moved more slowly because men enjoyed looking at what they saw and passing the time together if the south still possesses even for strangers some indefinable magic it is because southerners have cared for it observed it and however inadequately and foolishly loved it in brief have created it it is their poem when therefore i began to study the poetry of life trying to understand how certain moments take form and imprint themselves upon our mind i was only holding up for examination the moments the south had always cherished meanwhile i had been led beyond the poetry of life into its tragedy led again by john erskine who introduced me to unamunos the tragic sense of life led by unamuno who told me what was happening to me but led i am sure not simply as an individual but also as a southerner a romantic desiring the impossible a stoic awaiting the inevitable i remember my fathers saying to me approvingly in the spring of when i was first in love son you make me feel young again youre as big a fool as i was but i also remember him sitting on the front piazza in a may of my boyhood watching the storm beating down the yellow oats and never saying a word still silent he got up and walked indoors but even before this when i was a little boy i had stumbled upon a strange sense of the sadness of life my parents spoke occasionally of someones having lost a child i didnt know what they meant but since if children were to be lost the dark endless woods back of the house would be the place for losing i imagined them there and not frightened but each of them alone the woods starred with lost wandering children was this image some faint premonition against the time when i myself should be lost in the dark woods of the world was i inoculating myself against sadness long before its coming more important than this was i entering life with the pathos of an old defeat enshrined in my grandmother and in the still unfurled confederate banners hanging like a mist about my boyish head however i came to realize the tragedy of life whether simply as an individual or also as a southerner conditioned by southern history i came to realize it and finally to pass in some measure beyond it when my loss accentuated perhaps by my boundless romantic desire became great enough i put off the heavy armor of stoicism i had seen my father wearing admitted at least to myself my own defenselessness and chose to walk naked in the world with this came a kind of compassion both for myself and for every man poor devils all perhaps i became a christian at least as good a christian as i had been a stoic several years before this i had been called by the minister of our presbyterian church a good pagan this was after he had read an essay of mine the religion of a countryman i think he was right for the religion i described there as my own was the religion of a paganus a countryman who was deeply aware of the more than human forces that hung silent or clamorous in the sunlight or the storm but practically unaware of the compassion that according to jesus lies beyond all human expression even in the heart of god but now in my new sense of compassion for myself and for all men i came to feel that compassion was a universal quality now for the first time human hopes hung like bright veils in the air qualifying the sunlight now for the first time i understood a faint premonitory experience i had had as a boy of twelve it was a coldish morning in september the first day of school my brother my mother and i stood on the back piazza looking across the yard through the pines to the barn and the rosy dawn we had drunk a cup of coffee together mother having brewed it for us and she was now sending us out to do the milking as a little boy i had called her mother lady in this september moment there was something oh so faint of the lady in the dawn something of the dawn in the lady now twentysix years later i was sure of it one spirit pervaded them both the god of the fields and the god of the fireside were one therefore when some years later i came back to live in my boyhood community it was now not simply the site of the home wherein i had learned from my father urgency from my mother peace it was also mortised in the granite of the globe with a window looking out upon the universe it was the place where i had first seen and therefore most deeply felt though for a long time not understood the lady in the dawn and the dawn in the lady how could i dissent from all this that would be insanity i should be dissenting from myself my parents the south as i understood it even the universe itself but i do dissent from the south at least from much of the contemporary white southon the race issue perhaps it is clear now since i have listed the things i assent to why i am not disturbed by my dissent from so many white southerners on this issue the trouble is of course that dissent on this issue is for them dissent from the south itself i think they are mistaken though the race issue is related to practically everything in the south it is not the south nor is segregation that tentative solution of the issue our way of life as it has been called i think i have said enough implicitly or explicitly about the south to indicate why i cannot believe this though i am opposed to segregation i did not myself raise the issue im not enough of an idealist for forty years i went along with the custom of the country only occasionally aware of its existence and then with little concern but when timeto be exact the sraised the issue i faced it and decided against segregation why i had decided against it without knowing it a half dozen years before in that tragic moment when having lost as i thought all i became aware that in this tragic situation i was a human being and found myself moved with compassion both for myself and for all other men in that moment only people mattered there was no hint of race when therefore race became an issue for my fellowsoutherners it was not an issue for me i had learned that i was a man a destiny heavy enough without burdening it with the issue of race so far as i was concerned to be rid of segregation which emphasized race would be good riddance why does it not seem good riddance to so many southerners partly because they do not see the south as i see it to them segregation is the core of the south to me its an excrescence which is it regardless of the number of white southerners who believe or think they believethat segregation is the core of the south time and not too much of that will prove it an excrescence for this is the predominant will of the negroes of the nation in a sense of the world its the civil war situation all over again even after every confederate had killed his accepted quota of ten yankees the yankees still came so today the forces against the standpat south are too strong so far as the passing of segregation is concerned it doesnt make much difference whether i assent or dissent but so far as the success of the south is concerned it does make a difference we are going into a future vastly different from our past even if we have to be forced into it but this is little comfort to one who loves the south i should like for us to go with heads up even with banners flying though not the dear confederate banners of my boyish days but in order to do this we must understand ourselves what we are and can become what part therefore we can play in the modern world we must shape ourselves in the form we desire i said earlier that the south with all its passionate regional devotion had never understood itself here are energies not only going to waste but also being used to shackle us to a frozen past we think we believe that segregation is the core of our life i do not think we really believe it we are using words if we could see the south for what it is a region where men have striven greatly endured greatly and yet have managed through it all to keep a sense of human values a sense of personal relationships so lacking in the modern world a sense even of manners in a world gone mad for material gain a sense of humor sometimes playful sometimes wryif we could see our tragic history whites and negroes involved together in more than two centuries of defeat partly selfinflicted partly inflicted by the world then we should come to realize that we have resources here valuable to both the nation and the world and that segregation is not one of them i dissent from this narrow limited view of the south i assent with all my heart to the south that my life here has revealed to me the incomparably rich south i have just suggested we have been haunted by a past lost beyond recalling but lingering still on the far hills of memory when we turn to the present especially if it be summer romantic sentimentalists still we fill the landscape with beauty queens a dime a dozen without ever realizing what were doing a womans beauty is a stormtossed banner it was yeats who said itand under it wisdom stands there is wisdom in the broad slumberous landscape of the south wisdom in the feeling we have for manners the way you do things the way you hold your mouthwisdom in the appearance and the carriage of men and women there was a touch of splendor in the old south though we paid too much for it perhaps some of it remains we are moving now into a world where we could have it without penalizing anybody have we forgotten the quality these are random suggestions poured out pellmell the point of it all is my belief that most of us even though intending the best are false to ourselves false to our history false to the great possibilities that lie around us defending segregation as our way of our life we sell the south short have we lived here three hundred years to accomplish only this i dont believe it can the south be persuaded to accept such an integration i dont know would i have come to it myself if life hadnt pulled me up and made me consider however much i was prepared both individually and by my upbringing as a southerner to receive this interpretation i came to it out of my own tragic experience through that experience i learned the power that lies in failure understood and accepted but by that experience i was prepared to recognize the enormous resources that have accumulated in the south through centuries of frustration and defeat can we understand the potential power that lies at hand for a defeated people unless we ourselves have been defeated again i dont know but then we have all been defeated in greater or less degree and we still face the sunrise this is one of faulkners themes endurance this the south has the white south and the colored south the south theres a classic story about one of jacksons famous footcavalrymen in which endurance and wry humor are incomparably mixed the general riding back along the column came upon a soldier too old to fight nearly gone but still slogging well soldier said the general i hope youll make out yes general yes ill make it but generali hopes to god i never loves another country committed to a cause ruined in its service he could still smile at his own devotion i am not ready to believe that the region that produced a soldier like thatand he was one of many cannot produce the men to lead us proudly into the modern world by isabelle rivierez with louis e lomax i am the child of a mixed marriage and i will never forget it even if i tried the peoples of the worldboth white and negro would not let me my father hector rivierez is a lightskinned negro from french guiana in south america my mother born violette barbaut is a blueeyed blonde from france the contour of my face and the texture of my olive skin show that i am a negro and the child of a mixed marriage hardly a day passes that somebody doesnt ask me what its like being halfwhite and halfblack quite candidly it is no picnic in paris where i grew up fathers brown skin and mothers blue eyes seemed as natural to me as the sun and the moon like the eiffel tower where i played the champ de mars park where mother and i strolled they were fixtures of my childhood world it never occurred to me that our family was odd i knew that i was darker than mother lighter than father and not exactly the same color as the other children on my block i knew i was different but if your father is negro your mother white and you are three years old being different is the most natural thing in the world little do you suspect that one day this difference will cause you pain i was born on december six months after the germans occupied paris but our home along the avenue de la bourdonnais was a warm and secure place fathers law office was located in our sevenroom apartment thus he and mother were always home and their presence sheltered me i saw no difference between the blacks and the whites jews and gentiles who were fathers clients then one day one of fathers clients a jew came to our home crying his entire family had been wiped out in a nazi concentration camp only he had escaped as i listened to his tragic story i realized for the first time that being different could mean trouble even so the coals of racism had not seared me that was to come later we spent our summers at our country home about miles from paris all of the villagers were white but we had no problems i remember joining with the children of the village as they lined the road to welcome the american troops negro and white en route to liberate paris from the nazis we felt all was well with the world needless to say we were wrong at least i was two years later at the age of six i realized how wrong i was it happened during my first days in school the children gathered around me nigger some of them shouted gypsy others taunted i did not know what either word meant i only knew that i was being called something bad i got mad i fought with my tormentors they fought back when they realized that namecalling angered me the incidents increased when i asked my father what these names meant and why my fellow students attacked me he explained as clearly as he could still trying to shield me from the raw side of life you must not fight father told me you must learn to be proud that you are colored but mother is not colored she is white should she be proud also yes father said you and i should be proud that we are colored mother should be proud that she is white that is the way god made us some roses are red others white but they are all roses and they all smell sweet the same is true of men the color of their skins has nothing to do with the quality of their hearts minds and souls i was colored and i was colored in a world where color may not basically matter but where men make it matter this is the first shock a child of mixed parentage experiences despite the fact that she is halfwhite and halfcolored she can never be white some children of mixed marriages pass for white hiding their negro heritage in order to escape the pain of discrimination this i could never do i am not ashamed of my color and while still at my fathers knee resolved never to hide it i learned to ignore my fellow students when they called me names once they realized they could no longer hurt me the namecalling stopped yet despite my outward calm the race question had become a vital part of my inner life i wanted to know more about my father and mother i realized that theirs was not just another marriage mother felt my concern and through a se ries of long talks i came to know the story of their love and marriage father had come to paris to study law mother was also a student there they met and fell in love it was not easy for them mother explained to me their parents objected to the marriage each family wanted its child to marry within his own race they were warned that society would ostracize them even their friends reminded them that their children would be born into the no mans land of being neither black nor white nevertheless they were married love knows no barriers mother told me i would not let the prejudices of others rob me of lifes sweetest experience there were other negroes in paris but they were not torn by the conflicts that wracked me they were as aware of being negro as i was but they had come by that awareness via a different perhaps more natural route i felt i was a negro by force not by birth that i had been made negro by an arbitrary ruling that only children of two white parents can be white i soon became bitter and difficult to get along with by the time i reached secondary school i had become a problem student i was not the only colored student in the school but i was the only nonwhite in my class one afternoon i could bear it no longer i was sitting along the back row in my sewing class i hated the teacher and i resented the gulf between her and me shattering the silence of the room i sang at the top of my voice this place is full of filth only i didnt say filth it is boring and i want to go home the teacher almost fainted then her shrill voice rang out isabelle and silence returned to the room as i was sent to the principals office and expelled from school that was not an easy day for my father who by then had been named to a high french government post in ubanguishari now the central african republic we talked alone perhaps more alone than we had ever talked before it was more than a father talking to his daughter it was a negro father talking to his negro daughter isabelle he said part of being negro is that you cannot afford the luxury of misbehavior people expect you to misbehave you start out with the odds against you you are constantly in the process of proving yourself following this incident my parnegro i had been to africa i had seen black men i sympathized with and fought for their cause i felt colored yet i had not found a sense of true identity there like nonwhites everywhere i was thrilled by the african freedom explosion which has given a deep feeling of pride to the colored race myself included yet i could not think of myself as african somehow there is a cultural gap between the africans and me i needed to find people of my own color who read the books i read love the music i love and who generally accept the same spiritual values that i accept if i could not find such a feeling of brotherhood with the africans where would i find it in the summer of my parents and i visited fathers home in french guiana there i felt the chilly correctness with which many people of this negro country received my mother and for the first time i realized too that the sword of racism has at least two edges now that i look back upon it i am glad that i saw racism in reverse it saved me from more bitterness perhaps even hatred for the nonblacks of the world after father returned to paris mother and i went to america in miami beach florida we lived in the best hotelswithout incident then we went to new orleans that did it patrons dropped their food on the floor as we walked into the hotel restaurant fortunately we had not made reservations there we were simply passing through and had arranged to check our bags while we went sightseeing we traveled from louisiana to new york overland partly by bus at long last i saw the raw segregation and discrimination i had read about on one occasion i sat in a seat directly behind the bus driver he eyed me cautiously sizing up my light olive skin and long silk black hair finally he mustered enough courage to ask are you white or colored his manner and speech were polite obviously he wanted me to laugh it off by saying i had a deep suntan i am a french citizen i replied but i am a negro then i remained in my seat i have never ridden with a more confused and shaken bus driver but i saw more than segregation i saw the american negro i began to read every negro newspaper and magazine i could find a detailed account of the sitin demonstrations filled me with more selfpride and race pride than i had ever felt before i heard jazz not for the first time but in its native setting and i felt a response that could never express itself in france these are my people in spirit mind and purpose i have found a sense of identity when mother flew back to paris i remained in new york as secretary to one of the african delegations to the united nations strangely it was not until i began to move among american negroes that i fully realized what it means to be the child of an interracial marriage being the child of a mixed marriage is more than just being negro luckily i am now a grown woman i can make my own way and the fear of rejection by negroes as well as whites does not haunt me i know many children of american mixed marriagesand their experiences have not been pleasant would i marry a white man yes if i fell in love with one if i married a white man however i would not live in the united states not that the race problem would concern me but i honestly feel it would cripple my child forever american negroes are on the rise their own desegregation victories and the african revolutions make them increasingly proud of being negro for the most part however they are not yet ready to accept interracial marriage needless to say the masses of american whites are not ready to accept it either i have dated both negro and white men in new york i look upon them as individuals rather than as racial types yet when i think of marriage i think of children i know children of mixed marriages will have a difficult time regardless of where their parents live yet interracial marriage will not only continue it will increase mother was right love knows no boundaries and from the union of these brave lovers will come a generation of children that may well cure the racial pains that so contort our era wrestling rings down the color curtain what jackie robinson vottydid for racial integraa vv jftion baseball a big vs dyearold negro wrestj er namecj bearcat wright has done for wrestling bearcat who lives in new yorks harlem and has become the hottest negro wrestler in the past year had to pull a spectacular stunt in the middle of before the authorities of wrestling in gary in diana recognized that he meant what he said he was tired of being allowed to only wrestle with other negroes in segregated cities one night they had a sellout because they had previously announced that i was to wrestle a topflight opponent he recalls i was scheduled to be against a white man but when i arrived i found they had another negro for me i won the match but i felt let down i was back there the following week again once more supposed to wrestle a top contender again they gave me a negro thats when i decided something had to be done i made a little speech to the crowd in the arena i told them i would not appear anywhere again that i was not allowed to have mixed matches mainly because there was only a handful of negro wrestlers bearcat also feltjustlythat since until that time the negroes in wrestling consisted mainly of his own buddies it would not be an honest match as far as he was concerned as he could certainly not try very hard to knock the block off one of his own pals after my speech i got a letter saying i was suspended from wrestling in that area at the same time the naacp informed me that a committee had been formed asking that area to open up mixed matches surprisingly enough there was no real problem my suspension was lifted and slowly mixed wrestling has been opening up everywhere that it wasnt permitted before and negro audiences have been increasing too bearcat doesnt say it but it is known that he might not have had as easy a time convincing promoters of his stand if it had not been for the groundwork that another wrestlerwhitehad done in delighting negro audiences the great antonino rocca uncrowned leader of all wrestlers has long proven that negro audiences will pay money to see someone they like and after the many recordsmashing gates they have helped to swell for rocca since a number of spanishspeaking afficionados of wrestling in the east are negroes it was easy for them to include bearcat in their attention as well rocca has insisted for a long while that good wrestlers like bearcat and his tagteam partner sweet daddy siki are an added attraction to wrestling in mixed matches just before this article was written a longtime dream of bearcats came true he was signed up for a title match with international wrestling champion buddy nature boy rogers whereas rocca sticks strictly to the rules never starting a match before the bell rings rogers is a villain in every sense of the word knowing this wright has long had a chip on his fists from seeing rogers dirty tricks knowing that the socalled champ goes all out to hurt anyone and everyone who stands in his way in the ring whether it might mean breaking legs arms necks hearts or rules on the occasion of this title match while the two opponents were waiting for the event to start a roar of the crowd warned wright that rogers was creeping illegally up on him with mayhem intent not waiting for his own wrath to subside bearcat grabbed rogers arm twisted it and rammed the elbow into a metal part of the ring the elbows ligaments nerves and tendons were so badly injured that even after an operation it was not known how long it would be before rogers could get into action again one thing is certain the fans all raceswill demand a return meeting of the two and the promoters will be assured of the usual full house for this grudge match the name bearcat is not manufactured at least not by its wearer he was born in omaha nebraska the son and grandson of a prizefighter bearcats father also named bearcat as was his father before himfought five champions primo camera jack dempsey jack johnson max baer and mickey walker the mickey walker bout was to decide a dispute as to whether a good little fighter could beat a good big one walker proved he could although the younger wright was christened and he hates admitting this edward michael wright he now pays his income tax as bearcat so we guess thats his official moniker young bearcat had professional boxing matches undefeated he was when he started and the promoter arranged to give him a week training expenses whenever he did have a fight they would deduct the with the result that he would wind up still in the red after a while he found himself in great condition always a winner but a wreck financially one day the promoter asked if he knew anything about wrestling he admitted that he had wrestled some in school and was thereupon invited to work out in the gym with some wrestlers finally the promoter got him a few bookings in the hope that he would make enough money to be satisfied with his boxing matches but the hope boomeranged the first wrestling match i had i got for myself bearcat remembers nobody to cut in no one to pay no training expenses do you blame me for ditching boxing for fulltime wrestling although he has done well as a single the fans like to see what are called tagteam matches in which two men on one side alternate when tagged by each other with wrestling one of two men on the other side for the past two years bearcat has been partnered with sweet daddy siki who rates nearly as highly with the fans as bearcat does he is even on the big wrestling calendar for that is sold by the capitol wrestling arena which is top rating in any wrestlers language i got my ring name in an odd way sweet daddy remembers in i was in montreal canada the second time i was there a girl in the audience kept shouting sweet daddy sweet daddy the next week i found she had spotted her friends throughout the audience shouting the same thing a few nights later i got into the ring and was turned around looking at the crowd when i heard the announcer say in this corner weighing pounds sweet daddy siki he was stunned but he liked it and has used it ever since his real first name now dont scream is reggie since bearcat and sweet daddy teamed up even when theyre singles promoters try to have them on the same card youll find this happening very frequently that the same two wrestlers will travel together and appear on the same card usually one is the wrestler responsible for making travel and hotel arrangements and getting both of them to the arena on time a kind of buddy arrangement that pays off in fewer disappointments and nonappearances for the promoter bearcat and sweet daddy are unique in their styles of wrestling both of them like to butt their opponents on the head with their own heads in addition to which bearcat has a shouldershuffling and musclelimbering routine that is comic to watch but effective as a stumper for an opponent trying to grab him bearcat says he is a member of a group of people descended from africans who are built much like himself they are all very lean very tall he is weighs and quite agile one sports writer put it that bearcat has the strength of a bear and the agility of a cat which certainly fits in with his name when asked if wrestling is phony bearcat and sweet daddy have different answers to prove it isnt if its so phony how come professional football playerswho only make tops a year and certainly have the build how come they dont give up that pennyante stuff and join us asks sweet daddy because they know darned well its a rough tough business wrestling is and no holds pulled i get sick and tired of having people say wrestlings a fake bearcat growls youve certainly seen plenty of football games did you ever call them fake just because a halfdozen of those big linemen who weigh nearly pounds each jump on a small guy carrying the ball and a few minutes later he gets up seldom the worse for wear and makes a touchdown nobody ever calls that suspicious so why do they say anything is wrong with wrestling we get hurtas you know but we dont publicize it we do that so the public wont be afraid to come to our matches so they wont be afraid of the gore seldom are we damaged to the point of bleeding since we are supposed to use only the flat of the palm to strike the face but the twistings the dropkicks the backbreakers the stepovertoeholds all of these can inflict bad damage and often do if you get a wrestler who just wants to win and doesnt care how he does it people forget when they say we pull punches that wrestlers perspire did you ever try to hold on to a slimy wet smooth surface a blow can slide off that way too but the occasional ringsider who is looking to find something wrong will say phonyfake they should be as honest as we are thats all i can say although bearcat and sweet daddy are still comparatively new to the big money they arent complaining in wrestling you start in the small time hitting the small circuits with the smaller arenas and you receive only a percentage of the gate the more your following grows the bigger the gate the bigger your cut when bearcat had his first match with buddy rogers at comiskey park chicago in it was a gatethe first one at that price for rogers either to date however nobody has beaten antonino roccas many gateswelling matches but theyre all trying so far has been bearcats best year financially when he made about for he expects it to be about less because he couldnt refuse the demand for him to return to some of the smaller arenas where he made his start sweet daddys take in was and this year he expects it to be about the same bearcat and sweet daddy wrestle five and six nights a week and travel so much they might be on the west coast one night in chicago another night or canada or florida what they really like is music but what a difference in tastes bearcat likes jazz and classics sweet daddy goes for rock and roll calypso pops and some jazz in fact he has a record of his own out that he sings rock and roll shimmy shimmy partner bearcat is quite a food addict too he has a set of gourmet cook books and loves to fuss around the stove as well as to eat but he refuses to eat anything fattening he likes good lean meat but fancies vegetables so much that at this writing he is seriously thinking of becoming a vegetarian he also studies yoga they no longer have time for gymnastics sweet daddy eats anything as long as it is food he admits they never eat after two in the afternoon on the day of a match and they never eat before going to sleep saying its the worst thing in the world to do for a hobby other than music bearcat has some pacing horses race horses in a sulky he owns some in batavia new york with a little farm there and hopes eventually to take off wrestling during a racing season so he can race his own horses sweet daddy goes in for fancy cars he had a sl mercedes benz grey but bearcat made him get rid of it because it only seats two one night they had a friend along and no place to put her so bearcat had to ride in the trunk that was that now sweet daddy has a caddie convertible so bearcats head doesnt hit the roof sweet daddy also has a runabout an isetta with the opening in the front in bearcat picked up a new hobby all his life he had wanted to fly an airplane when he left the new york area a year ago he decided here is my chance and bought himself a place singleengine cessna and learned to fly it afterwards he occasionally takes it for a short hop to another town but refuses to solo at night sweet daddy just refuses to fly anything but a jet or wont even go jet if he can go on train within a reasonable time bearcat and sweet daddy think a wrestlers life is the only life for them they point out that all matches end in the ring as they dont believe in wasting their energies fighting without pay anywhere else bearcat also asks people to consider the difference between boxers and wrestlers have you ever wondered about the fact that boxers go around having a high old time for weeks or months between bouts then take a scant five or six weeks to get in trim while wrestlers have so many matches so many nights a week that theyre forced to keep in condition all the time does that sound like trickery if its the kind of sport where youre told what to do why bother keeping in condition bearcats other favorite subject is prejudice talking about that understand there is prejudice everywhere in the world i am not speaking as a minority member i am speaking as a world viewer i see one race hating another one religion talking against another i dont see any reasonoutside the ringfor hating anyone in fact they opened up a new way of living for my people when they opened credit myself if theres anything im not its prejudiced when i see people i dont see colors or denominationsi only see humans wrestling has become a new way of life to many negroes who are also becoming stars in the field tagging behind bearcat and sweet daddy in the listings of top negro wrestlers and the areas they work out of are bobo brazil who works out of indianapolis and is one of the best sailor art thomas who has become quite popular in the east luther lenzie who usually stays around oregon and california dory dixon who is from jamaica but works out of texas shag thomas also out of texas and rick waldo who usually stays in the foreign areas such as australia japan new zealand and sao paulo sweet daddy originally came from jamaica too but lived so long in los angeles that hes practically forgotten his beginnings one thing that no negro in wrestling can overlook when people forget the color of their skins the only other color they can see is the greenbacks that come in the gates of the arenas where they appear the bugle blows for good jelly the other day the local hr ce raided a negro arbecue and beer joint nd arrested nine peo wiirwpje raj j anj arrests came as something of a shock to the owner i dont know lt why theyre bothering me said henry good jelly jones restaurateur bootlegger and politician it aint election time but bother him they did and because good jelly or just jelly to his friends is something of a local celebrity these days there was a sizable press section on hand for his trial the reporters were not disappointed good jellys wife when asked whether a gallon jug was the same jug found during the raid answered i dont know jugs dont have no names later the white prosecuting attorney asked her why she found it so easy to answer defense questions and so hard to understand his mr city attorney said robert lilliard her negro attorney shes a little confused by all your highclass words you just talk like we talk down at good jellys and well be all right highclass words snorted the city attorney whats so highclass about the words white corn the case came out as everyone knew it would the charges against good jelly and his friends were dismissed for if good jelly has a striking ability to get into trouble he has an even more remarkable ability to get out of it fifteen times he has been called before the bar of justice in recent years fourteen times he has been set free the explanation of this enviable batting average lies deep in the structure of southern politics the negros role in it and the specific power structure of nashville henry jones with his golfers cap big flashing smile and long police record is a power he is among the last of the ward heelers very simply he controls the votes of a large number of unbelievably poor people and for a minimum of service protection and financial reward he delivers these same votes without the slightest concern for ideology in nashville he is the negro whom many negroes like least to think about he is the negro whom many whites like most to think about in his own blunt word he is a nigger what is worse that is all he wants to be respectable negro society shuns him yet to some of the negro poor he is perhaps the only truly big man in their lives good jelly first became interested in politics at an early age because he was an uneducated negro there were distinct limitations to the ambitions he might reasonably entertain and yet many people who govern his city and who dedicate schools and other buildings in the highest of ideals are perfectly willing to deal with him call him a backdoor negro said one white leader they wont have their picture taken with him and they wont pose with him even at negro functions but they know how to get hold of him when a white man once complained about jellys police record and about his bootlegging and the fact that he has many friends among politicians a negro answered thats the way you people really want him it is hardly surprising then that the complexities of playing the system at both ends have produced two jellies they are separate but equal jellies there is a jelly for whites and a jelly for negroes the whites jelly is an ingratiating uncle tom laughing smiling hiding from any slightly serious question or threat behind the big smile and a joke in which old jelly is always the butt the negroes jelly is something different he is kind he has clothed many of his people housed more and fed them all if he calls one and gives him the key to the big black cadillac and says its time to move the caddy the man is honored by the assignment if he calls eight of them together and says that the newspaper wants their picture and that he jelly approves of the idea then a picture of eight smiling faces is taken if he tells them to vote this way or that they vote this way or that i carry a lot of weight around here jelly admits bout half the people in this precinct i control two hundred three hundred people theyre my people good jelly is a dark stocky man of about fifty whose use of minstrelshow techniques in front of whites is a legitimate heritage as a young man he left his nashville home and joined the cast of the mandy green from new orleans minstrel show the poor mans version of the famous silas green show for mandy green he traveled the south as what he calls one of those blackface comedians and i was pretty good then he returned to nashville where he became associated with the then ruling negro ward heeler pie hardison i was pies chauffeur he thought i was a pretty good fellow and i was a good driver and a good talker and so he got me into politics one time pie said i ought to be in there pitching for the mayor and i said if you want the mayor then im pitching one hundred per cent and so i got him the votes pie hardison is gone now and his heir does his pitching from a small hut off a dark alley deep in the negro slums in a small halfmasonry halfwooden cafe he cooks bootlegs and politicks there is one small sign over the doorit is upside downand it says best jelly says this is not the name of the cafe that the name is jones barbecue it is a small cafe and there are no menus only signs on the walls at one end of the cafe white beans cost twentyfive cents at the other they cost twentyone cents there with regular violations of local whiskey laws we have some whiskey but we dont have no beer we have to send out for the beer he operates his machine the restaurant is essential to his success as a politician for good jellys machine has been described by one reporter as the lame the sick the poor and a few of the penniless good jelly himself says down in this part folks dont have but a little money and so they come over here when they have a little and we feed them and they come over here when they dont have any money and we still feed them i dont turn them down i always feed them and i get them a place to sleep most times right here and get them to a hospital and even a job sometimes they get what i got these folks and they dont forget if the voters dont forget neither does good jelly he keeps a thorough file on each of his debtors name favors granted addressor frequently the address of someone who will know where to find the debtor before election day good jelly will make sure all his friends are registered he will also send out cards reminding them of their civic responsibility come election day and good jelly takes out his big cadillac and herds his people to the polls he likes to start early it gives him more time later in the day for rounding up slackers ill tell you why good jelly has got so many friends said robert lilliard the negro attorney who is also a city councilman a lot of these politicians just like him you can really count on jelly if hes for you why you can check his precinct the next day and his votes will be there if you treated him right good jelly himself says that he asks little for his interest in politics im for any man thats a good man he is fond of saying how does he tell whos a good man i read about this man see and i can tell if hes for me i want to know all the issues is that all what issues a lot of these men they want to be politicians and so they come and see jelly and i see how friendly they are and theyre pretty friendly theyre good men we talk about these issues all of these issues he repeated emphatically im for any man thats a good man other interpretations of good jellys political motivations have been offered from time to time id say he gets an average of about for an election one white politician told me it depends on a close local election with a lot at stake i expect hes gotten or more maybe a thousand how much money did you get for the sheriffs race i asked him pointblank money money i wouldnt do none of that he said the man he come down here and he was a good man and he said how he wanted to do right it is not without a touch of regret that many white politicians worried by the new power of the sitin leaders and the young negro ministers foresee the demise of good jelly and his kind you make the deal with jelly one politician said and thats it you dont have to worry about him coming downtown with a bunch of his damn people and sitting down at some nice restaurant or calling the damn newspapers and announcing hes going to picket some company for better jobs jellys all right take care of him on the drunk and disorderly and that kind of thing and thats it he comes through i asked we take care of him and he takes care of us the man answered it was of course inevitable given a oneparty electorate in which factions outweigh issues in local elections that more than one faction would sooner or later make demands on good jellys talents thus for the past two years he has been caught right in the middle of the factional fight between the forces of the mayor and the forces of the city judge who might one day like to run for mayor in the past good jelly usually swung with the judge but as a student of local politics you never know who will be your next ally and similarly your next enemy he steadfastly refuses to burn his bridges i been a deeply strong supporter of the mayor im not mad at him he knows ol good jelly similarly as a student of the science of local law enforcement good jelly is hesitant about turning on the police the police he says they see im a pretty good fella and like im trying to do the right thing and theyre all right i like the police a showdown between the two factions came during last years election for sheriff the mayors forces favored the incumbent the other forces including the city judge favored his opponent police and sheriffs deputies swarmed over good jellys cafe all week long several times jelly was threatened with arrest he placed signs for the incumbent in his cafe but the policemen couldnt watch everywhere while they sat and talked with good jelly in the front of the cafe mrs good jelly slipped out the back and voted the jelly machine for the opponent who carried that precinct five to one jellys lack of concern about civil_rights galls many young negroes in nashville if john kasper were running against thurgood marshall and it was a local race and the right people went to see jelly for kasper thats all it would take said one negro bitterly jelly himself has said my folks theyre not the integration type theyre not interested in all that all they want is a little food attorney robert lilliard has explained jellys continuing popularity in just about the same terms those folks they arent going to eat at woolworths or grants or anything like that but they got to eat jellys the only thing those people have and he looks mighty good to them but even lilliard concedes that sooner or later other political leaders will supplant good jelly jones and his kind among the negroes you take this city growing all the time and the city limits going out and the negro making a little more money all the timea thing like jelly got its getting to be less and less important all the time five ten years from now there probably wont be any good jelly pretty soon both sides too busy worrying about this middleclass vote to pay for jelly thats where the next battle will be a girl with guts ive told noisy night club patrons to shut the heck up nina simone readily admits and there have been times when i walked off the stage in the middle of a concert because the audience was discourteous the sensational songstress who is a bundle of talentand of temper and temperament say her criticshas long conducted a personal vendetta against boisterous night club and concert customers this earned her the dubious honor of being the bad girl of show business but ninas unorthodox crusade ultimately paid off today she can look back on the days when my conduct wasnt too hot with a wry sense of humor it got to the point she smiles where people would come out just to see what id do next then early last spring something occurred that forced her detractors to revamp their uncomplimentary estimates of her onstage conduct two performers one a young pop singer the other an opera starwere involved in widely separated incidents that made headlines and proved to nina that she was not fighting a lonely battle the historic event was headlined in variety the bible of show business patronperformer tensions anew as mathis nina simone walk out the article noted that performers are demanding more respect from audiences and will take active steps to get it on march th backed by a trio of musicians nina opened at the roundtable a club on manhattans swanky east side when the group appeared on stage the patrons were busy dining as the first number was announced the clatter of dishes the clink of glasses the laughter and chatter barely halted then the noise continued unabated nina gave the downbeat and began to play but she did not sing for the second number she again played an instrumental and for the third and fourth between numbers nina resorted to her own personal method of heckling the hecklers she tossed acid comments at the audience she sang snatches of her hit song porgy changing the lyrics to chide the noisy audience for two more nights this continued then by mutual agreement between nina and the club management the twoweek engagement was cut short looking back on the incident nina feels she handled that particular audience with kid gloves there was a time she says when i would have walked out without saying a word what made this incident memorable was the fact that on the very same night down in san juan puerto rico johnny mathis stalked off the stage of the club tropicoro rattled by uncalled for remarks from the audience johnny performed for a scant fifteen minutes before turning his back on the hecklers and cancelling his twoweek engagement it so happened that a few days later in hopkinsville ky opera star rise stevens was forced to interrupt her concert to shush a couple of giggling schoolgirls there were also a number of persons in the audience who were listening to a local basketball game over transistor radios to some show business veterans these events were proof positive that todays entertainers are no respecters of the timehonored tradition the show must go on but to nina they were vindication of the long lonely and so often unappreciated fight she was conducting but she disclaims credit for being the originator of this technique for squelching hecklers i dont know who should get credit for being first to insist that performers are not just court jesters but are due some respect for years charlie mingus was called all sorts of names was accused of being hateful and of always pitching one but all he wanted was to be heard miles davis thelonious monk and several others have reputations for not hesitating to make clear their contempt for unruly audiences nina simones deepfelt desire to be heard with the respect due an artist goes back to her childhood in tryon n c where she was born eunice waymon some years ago her mother was an ordained methodist minister and it was at the local church where she conducted services that ninas musical genius first received public acclaim at the age of four the tiny prodigy was picking out tunes on the piano and at seven she became organist of her mothers church as well as a member of the choir i studied classical music for fourteen years nina explains and i was taught at an early age to respect an artist in any field when someone is rehearsing there must be no interruption at a concert hall one must be neatly dressed and observe proper decorum i grew up assuming that anyone acquainted with the social graces would be aware of these basic elements of good conduct thats why i could never get over the shock of coming face to face with badly behaved audiences my idols were marian anderson alexander boleslawski and horowitz one would never think of being rude when one of these artists is performing and while all entertainers may not be considered artists they should be accorded the same respect this insists nina simone is the reason behind her oftcriticized onstage conduct thats all i ever wantedrespect i would actually feel degraded each time i had to scold an audience i didnt get a kick out of it no matter what people say with a rueful smile nina admits sometimes i got results other than what i wanted but gradually audiences began to catch on once at roberts show lounge in chicago i told off a noisy couple in the audience then the next time they created a disturbance i did only threetnumbersbut in such a way that the rest of the audience got the message i was angry i walked off without saying a word well utter confusion followed then i heard applause and people calling for me to come back when i did i didnt say a word just picked up where id left off even more graphic proof that her unique method of handling hecklers had the backing of a growing number of persons came last summer at the huge jazz festival at madison square garden sponsored by the new york daily news by this time nina recalls i had a reputation for being too demanding too outstanding hard to get along with when i went on stage and began someone yelled down from the balcony it was a smart remark something about not being able to hear me oddly i didnt get angry or upset i just said into the microphone you up there in the darkcome out in the light and repeat that well that broke the audience up they were immediately on my side for once i got more positive than negative reaction to what i was trying to do the next day in the daily news there was an article praising me nina admits that although conditions are better now and the public has rallied to her cause she previously was put on the carpet by club owners columnists even close associates but as she shrewdly observes everybody loves a winner nina is accustomed to fighting against odds she has had only one hit in the popular sense recordi loves you porgy for colpixbecause she refuses to compromise her art and go commercial ive lost money because of my stand but i cant help it interestingly enough nina simones earning potential has skyrocketed although her work schedule is greatly curtailed a polio scare early in brought the sharp realization that there was more to life than making money fortunately ninas ailment was later diagnosed as something other than polio but during her brief hospitalization she had time to think to reexamine her values even though she can command fees of a week for as often and as long as she cares to work nina decided to work only two weeks out of a month appearing only in night clubs of her choosing making records and filling concert engagements she lives a comfortable relaxed existence in her large apartment floors above central park west overlooking central park and at this point in her career is very pleased with the way i feel inside she has her eye on a future career in films and with good reason currently featured in columbia pictures notorious landlady starring kim novak and jack lemmon nina was highly impressed by the fact that for three minutes work in the picture she was paid as much as she would earn in a week in some other medium although she insists that her recently won battle against night club hecklers was on behalf of all performers and had nothing to do with the race question nina has some very definite ideas about the stirrings of national pride in africa asia and in this country as well my only regret she says is that there arent more negro artists more negroes in all fieldswho have the courage to stand up and speak out on this race issuethe things they dont like the things they do like we need more such as those kids in the south thank god for them the failure of the negro intellectual during the past forty years the relations of negroes to american society have undermsrvrvsm gone funj amental changes the tempo of these changes has been accelerated during the past two decades the changes in the relationships of negroes to american society have been the result of changes in the economic and social organization of american life which have in turn had their repercussions upon the negro community and its institutions as a result of the changes in the character of the negro community all the platitudes and cliches about negroes and race relations have lost their meaning and relevance the changes in the negro community and american society have reached a stage where we are beginning to see in rather clear outlines the real problem of negroes in american society there can be no question at the present time that the negro must be integrated into the american community but the integration of the negro into the economic and social organization of american life is only an initial stage in the solution of some of the problems of the negro there still remains the problem of the assimilation of the negro which is a more important and more fundamental problem it is with this second problem that i am primarily concerned but in order to clarify the issue it will be necessary to make clear the distinction between integration and assimilation it is relevant at this point to say something concerning integration and the negro community in the generally accepted meaning of the term integration involves the acceptance of negroes as individuals into the economic and social organization of american life this would imply the gradual dissolution of the negro community that is the decline and eventual disappearance of the associations institutions and other forms of associated life in what constitutes the negro community we do not expect anything approaching this to occur in our life time moreover any discerning person will be aware of the fact that certain aspects of the organized aspects of negro community life will be affected sooner and more fundamentally than other aspects for example negroes have always been forced to depend upon the ecomonic institutions in the american community for employment and a living despite the vain hopes that negroes have had concerning negro business as a means to economic salvation and independence the integration of negroes into the industry and as white collar workers into the manufacturing and commercial institutions of the country has increased the economic welfare of negroes and provided them with more business experience than all the socalled negro business enterprises in the country on the other hand there are certain cultural institutions such as the church and the fraternal organizations that will not dissolve or disappear however it has already appeared that in those sections of the country where newspapers carry news about negroes as normal human beings and negro reporters are employed the circulation of negro newspapers is declining i mention these facts concerning the negro community because it is necessary to emphasize the fact that integration involves more than individuals but the organized life of the negro community visavis the organized white community how does integration differ from assimilation assimilation involves of course integration for it is difficult to see how any people or group can become assimilated without being integrated into the economic and social organization of a country but assimilation involves integration into the most intimate phases of the organized social life of a country as a consequence assimilation leads to complete identification with the people and culture of the community in which the social heritages of different people become merged or fused in charles francis adams stated in a lecture in richmond that the theory of the complete assimilation and absorption of all peoples because of the absence of fundamental racial differences had broken down in the case of the negro the negro according to adams could only be partially assimilated or in our language integrated but not assimilated when he spoke of absorption he was evidently referring to amalgamation in recent years there has been much talk about the integration of the negro but hardly any attention has been given to his assimilation there have been some wild guesses about the amalgamation or absorption of the negro and his disappearance in to years it is to the question of the assimilation of the negro that i want to devote the remainder of this talk it may seem strange if i tell you that the question of integration and assimilation of the american negro has not been considered or raised by american negroes but by african intellectuals only recently at a luncheon in washington an african intellectual spoke on the subject and afterwards asked me to write an article on the subject but the contrast between the attitude and orientation of american negro intellectuals and african intellectuals was revealed most sharply at the congresses of negro writers held in paris in and in rome in at these congresses the african and i might add the west indian intellectuals were deeply concerned with the question of human culture and personality and the impact of western civilization on the traditional culture of negro peoples it was to be expected that african intellectuals would be concerned with such questions but the amazing thing was that american negro intellectuals who were imbued with an integrationist point of view were not only unconcerned with this question but seemingly were unconscious of the implications of the important question of the relation of culture and personality and human destiny i insist that these are the fundamental questions with which all thinkers should be concerned and that it is unfortunate that americans have not concerned themselves with these questions the lack of interest in this important question or lack of understanding of it is responsible for much of the confusion in regard to integration which is changing the entire relationship of the negro to american society as far as i have been able to discover what negro intellectuals have had to say concerning integration has been concerned with the superficial aspects of the increasing participation of negroes in the economic and social and political organization of american society practically no attention has been directed to the rather obvious fact that integration involves the interaction of the organized social life of the negro community with the wider american community moreover there has been an implied or unconscious assimilationist philosophy holding that negroes should enter the mainstream of american life as rapidly as possible leaving behind their social heritage and becoming invisible as soon as possible this has been due i think to the emergence of a sizeable new middle class whose social background and interests have determined the entire intellectual orientation of educated negroes in my black bourgeoisie i have considered this phenomenon and it is unnecessary to go into the question here there are certain phases of this phenomenon which are relevant to this discussion the first aspect is that the new negro middle class is the stratum of the negro population that is becoming integrated most rapidly because of its education and its ability to maintain certain standards of living in its hope to achieve acceptance in american life it would slough off everything that is reminiscent of its negro origin and its negro folk background at the same time integration is resulting in inner conflicts and frustrations because negroes are still outsiders in american life despite integration the middle class in escaping from its sheltered and privileged position in the negro community has became more exposed to the contempt and discriminations of the white world thus the new negro middle class is confronted with the problems of assimilation and their intellectuals have not provided them with an understanding of the problems this lack of understanding on the part of the socalled intellectual fringe of the new middle class is due partly to the general antiintellectualism of this class and partly to the desire to achieve acceptance in american life by conformity to the ideals values and patterns of behavior of white americans this is no speculation on my part every study that has been made reveals that they think very much the same as white americans even concerning negroes moreover socalled negro intellectuals continue to repeat such nonsense as no race has made as much progress as the american negro in the same period and that his remarkable progress has been due to oppression yet anyone knows that after years american negro intellectuals can not measure up to african intellectuals it was the white scholar buell gallagher in his book color and conscience who showed clearly that negroes in every part of the world where they enjoyed freedom had achieved more intellectually and artistically than the american negro all of this drive towards conformity to dominant beliefs and values is implicit or unconscious striving of the middle classes to become assimilated the great difference between the orientation of the african intellectual and the american negro intellectual is striking when one considers their starting point in their analysis of the position of the people for whom they are supposed to provide intellectual leadership all african intellectuals begin with the fact of the colonial experience of the african they possess a profound understanding of the colonial experience and its obvious effects upon not only their traditional social organization but the less obvious and more profound effects upon the culture and the african personality the american negro intellectual goes his merry way discussing such matters as the superficial aspects of the material standard of living among negroes and the extent to which they enjoy civil_rights he never begins with the fundamental fact of what slavery has done to the negro or the group which is called negroes in the united states yet it is as necessary for the american negro intellectual to deal with these questions as it is for the african intellectual to begin with the colonial experience the american negro intellectual is even more remiss in his grasp of the condition and fate of american negroes he has steadily refused to recognize what has been called the mark of oppression it was the work of two white scholars that first called attention to this fundamental aspect of the personality of the american negro moreover it was the work of another white scholar stanley m elkins in his recent book on slavery who has shown the psychic trauma that negroes suffered when they were enslaved the pulverization of their social life through the destruction of their clan organization and annihilation of their personality through the destruction of their cultural heritage sometimes i think that the failure of the american negro intellectual to grasp the nature and the significance of these experiences is due to the fact that he continues to be an unconscious victim of these experiences after an african intellectual met a group of negro intellectuals he told me that they were really men who were asleep all of this only tends to underline the fact that educated negroes or negro intellectuals have failed to achieve any intellectual freedom in fact with the few exceptions of literary men it appears that the ne intellectual is unconscious of the extent to which his thinking is restricted to sterile repetition of the safe and conventional ideas current in american society this is attributable in part of course to the conditions under which an educated and intellectual class emerged in the american society this class emerged as the result of white american philanthropy although the situation has changed and the negro intellectuals are supported through other means they are still largely dependent upon the white community there is no basis of economic support for them within the negro community and where there is economic support within the negro community it demands conformity to conservative and conventional ideas witness for example the vote of the national medical association in new york city against placing medical care for the aged under social security the action of this group might be attributable partly to ignorance and what they conceived to be their economic interests nevertheless it was done under the domination of the american medical association which ignored the whining complaints of negro doctors against racial discrimination i could cite other examples which more clearly represent the absence of intellectual freedom in regard to national and international issues most negro intellectuals simply repeat the propaganda which is put out by people who have large economic and political interests to protect of course negro intellectuals are in a different position from the standpoint of employment if they show any independence in their thinking they may be hounded by the fbi and find it difficult to make a living at the present time many of them find themselves in the humiliating position of running around the world telling africans and others how welloff negroes are in the united states and how well they are treated one is reminded of the words of langston hughes in his recent book ask your mama where he says that the african visitor finds that in the american social supermarket blacks for sale range from intellectuals to entertainers thus it appears that the price of the slow integration which the negroes are experiencing must be bought at the price of abject conformity in thinking one of the most important results of the lack of freedom on the part of negro intellectuals has been their failure to produce men of high intellectual stature who are respected by the world at large we have no philosophers or thinkers who command the respect of the intellectual community at large i am not talking about the few teachers of philosophy who have read hegel or kant or james and memorized their thoughts i am talking about men who have reflected upon the fundamental problems which have always concerned philosophers such as the nature of human knowledge and the meaning or lack of meaning of human existence we have no philosophers who have dealt with these and other problems from the standpoint of the negros unique experience in this world i am not talking about the puerile opportunistic rationalizations of the negros effort to survive in a hostile world the philosophy implicit in the negros folklore is infinitely superior to the opportunistic philosophy of negro intellectuals who want to save their jobs and enjoy material comforts the philosophy implicit in the folklore of the negro folk is infinitely superior in wisdom and intellectual candor to the empty repetition of platitudes concerning brotherly love and human dignity of negro intellectuals who are tyrants within the negro world and never had a thought in their lives this brings me to say something of what negro intellectuals or scholars have failed to accomplish as the intellectual leaders of negroes they have failed to study the problems of negro life in america in a manner which would place the fate of the negro in the broad framework of mans experience in this world they have engaged in petty defenses of the negros social failures but more often they have been so imbued with the prospect of integration and eventual assimi lation that they have thought that they could prove themselves true americans by not studying the negro since integration has become the official policy of the country they have shunned more than ever the study of the negro they have remained intellectually sterile while propounding such meaningless questions as should negro scholars study the negro should negro painters paint negro subjects should negro writers and playwrights write negro novels and plays about negroes this is indicative of the confusion among negro intellectuals but more important still it has meant that negro intellectuals have cut themselves off from a vastly rich source of human experience to which they had access it is scarcely believable that the only significant studies of negroes in politics have been the work of white scholars i have already mentioned other fields of interest in which scholars have made significant contributions of course some of this failure has been the result of ignorant administration of negro schools which have refused the intelligent proposals of negro scholars let us take the case of conants book slums and suburbs which deals with the tragic position of negroes in america as long as years ago i pointed out that urbanization had changed the entire relationship of negroes to american society and that comprehensive and fundamental research should be done on negroes in cities but those negroes who have controlled the destiny of negro intellectuals ignored this and even today no negro college or university is concerned with this fundamental problem conants book which reveals the poverty ignorance and social disorganization of negroes emphasizes a phase of the integration and assimilation of negroes to which i have only vaguely referred it deserves special attention in what i am undertaking to discuss not only has conant devoted attention to the position of negroes in slums but i have noted that ashmore has published a book dealing with this problem and the frustrations of the negro middle class the significance of the large proportion of unemployed impoverished and socially and personally disorganized negroes in cities for our discussion can not be overemphasized it shows clearly that whereas a relatively large middle class is emerging in our cities at the same time a large degraded proletariat is also appearing it reveals the wide economic and social cleavage which is becoming more manifest between the middle class and the masses of negroes these negroes have little education practically no skills and what is more they have never known a normal family life because of their lack of socialization they can hardly take advantage of the educational institutions they are unprepared for employment in an industrial society and they are unfit for normal social life conant is afraid that they will become susceptible to communist propaganda but he does not know negroes if they were to become communist their lives would be organized about objectives and goals which would have some stabilizing influence but most of these negroes will become the victims of liquor dope and disease and they will engage in all forms of crime and antisocial behavior those who seek an escape from their frustration and bewilderment will not join communist movements they will join all types of religious sects and cults some of which will have nationalistic or racial aims in fact the growth of the black muslim movement represents disillusionment on the part of negroes concerning integration and a repudiation of the belief in assimilation which is so dear to the middle classes recently we have been hearing about the revolt against the leaders of the negro the most significant sympton of this revolt has been the revolt of negro youth against the old respectable and conventional leadership which acted as mediators between the negro community and the white community the most dramatic aspect of the revolt has been the sitin movements which are a direct attack upon segregation the aim is in tegration and utimately assimilation if i gage correctly the aims of the leaders this seems to emphasize the failure of negro intellectuals they can only see assimilation beyond integration but there are problems of american life that negroes will have to meet in becoming integrated and assimilated and they concern the economic and social organization of american life i pointed out at the beginning that whatever change had occurred in the status of negroes was due to changes in the economic and social organization of american life american negro intellectuals seem to be unconscious of this fact and seemingly believe that integration and ultimate assimilation will solve the problems of the negro it is very important for our discussion on integration and assimilation that the leaders of the nonviolence technique have gone to india for philosophical and ideological justification of their revolt against segregation and discrimination in american society that the technique should be nonviolent is natural since negroes who are outnumbered by whites and threatened by the armed might of whites could not resort to violence or revolutionary tactics i do not think that it represents any moral superiority on their part moreover i do not think that gandhism is really applicable to the negros situation in the united states nevertheless i recognize that it achieves a certain moral respect ability because of its religious basis this is especially important where negroes confront the guiltridden respectable white middle classes in analyzing the movement and in seeking its religious and moral inspiration we should recognize that it has its roots in the religious experiences and culture of the negro folk the leaders may speak in philosophical and ideological terms that are drawn from an alien culture but the dynamics of the movement are to be found in the religious experiences of the negroes when negroes are forced to face hostile white mobs they do not sing indian hymns they sing negro spirituals and the hymns of their fathers which embodied the faith of their fathers in a hostile world that the negro leaders should turn to an alien culture for the philosophical and ideological justification of their revolt shows the extent to which negro intellectuals are alienated from the masses it is also an indication of the failure of the intellectual leaders to perform their role in relation to the negro they have failed to dig down into the experiences of the negro and provide the soul of a people with exceptions and i will name langston hughes as a conspicuous example they have tried to escape from the negro heritage it was their duty to put this heritage in history books in novels and in plays in painting and in sculpture because of their eagerness to be accepted as americans or perhaps sometimes because of their fear they have written no novels and plays about denmark vesey harriet tubman or schields green who went with john brown they have accepted supinely as heroes the negroes whom white people have given us and told us to revere even today they run from dubois and paul robeson in view of the negros history the negro intellectual and artist had a special opportunity and special responsibility the process by which the negroes were captured and enslaved in the united states stripped them of their african culture and destroyed their personality under the slavery regime and for nearly a century since emancipation everything in american society has stamped the negro as subhuman as a member of an inferior race that had not achieved even the first steps in civilization there is no parallel in human history where a people have been subjected to similar mutilation of body and soul even the christian religion was given them in a form only to degrade them the african intellectual recognizes what colonialism has done to the african and he sets as his first task the mental moral and spiritual rehabilitation of the african but the american negro intellectual seduced by dreams of final assimilation has never regarded this as his primary task i am aware that he has carried on all sorts of arguments in defense of the negro but they were mainly designed to protect his own status and soothe his hurt selfesteem i am talking about something entirely different i am referring to his failure to dig down into the experience of the negro and bring about a transvaluation of that experience so that the negro could have a new selfimage or new conception of himself it was the responsibility of the negro intellectual to provide a positive identification through history literature art music and the drama the truth of the matter is that for most negro intellectuals the integration of the negro means just the opposite the emptying of his life of meaningful content and ridding him of all negro identification for them integration and eventual assimilation means the annihilation of the negrophysically culturally and spiritually guy johnson has written recently that in the next years there will be more integration but far less than the negro hopes for and as a consequence there will be much frustration moreover as park once wrote the negro will be treated as a racial minority rather than a racial caste i am inclined to agree on the whole with this prediction especially for the south but even in the north where negroes will achieve greater integration i can not envision any assimilation in the foreseeable future the best evidence of this is the manner in which the centennial of the civil war is being celebrated the important fact about the civil war is the emancipation of the negro and lincolns achievement of worldwide immortality as the emancipatornot as the savior of the union which was a local political event yet the nation has ignored and repudiated the central fact which is the most important element in the boosted moral idealism of the united states the negro is left out of the celebration both physically and as a part of the heritage of america the civil war is supposed to have been the result of a misunderstanding of twobrothers white brothers of course and the emancipation of the negro is forgotten confronted with this fact the negro intellectual should not be consumed by his frustrations he must rid himself of his obsession with assimilation he must come to realize that integration should not mean annihilationselfeffacement the escaping from his identification in a chapter entitled what can the american negro contribute to the social and economic life of africa in the book africa seen by american negroes i pointed out that the american negro had little to contribute to africa but that africa in achieving freedom would probably save the soul of the american negro in providing him with a new identification a new selfimage and a new sense of personal dignity i want to emphasize this by pointing out that if the negro is ever assimilated into american society his heritage should become a part of the american heritage and it should be recognized as the contribution of the negro as one recognizes the contributions of the english irish germans and other people but this can be achieved only if the negro intellectual and artist frees himself from his desire to conform and only if he overcomes his inferiority complex it may turn out that in the distant future negroes will disappear physically from american society if this is our fate let us disappear with dignity and let us leave a worthwhile memorialin science in art in literature in sculpture in musicof our having been here how marian anderson blessed my life never have i been one to seek out celebrities somehow it didnt appeal to me to join a noisy milling throng secure an autograph or to shake the hand of a famous personagenever except once i still contemplate on the urging which propelled me backstage that night in milwaukee in my husband was teaching in wauwatosa a suburb and our budget was tautly stretched of necessity fifty different ways so it was that when a neighbor approached me with a paid admission asking me to accompany her to marian andersons concert at the civic auditorium i was doubly thrilled thrilled because the love of music was an integral part of our lives and happy for this opportunity as we hadnt been able to afford many concerts but there was a stumblingblock to my acceptance which my husband duly pointed out some years earlier i had lost a child and had been advised i would probably never have another now i had become fruitful again and the doctor had circumscribed nearly every move i made prohibiting me from stairs from crowds from wearing heels and from becoming weary i desired this child with all my being but i also yearned passionately to hear this wonderful woman in person so to all my husbands arguments i promised to be careful careful it was a joy to be in a crowded hall again and observe the people streaming in from every direction there were both negroes and whites some from each group were garbed in glamorous evening attire others were dressed in casual street clothes while there were some who looked downright shabby i found myself thinking how marvelous and right it was that all these folk representing the entire ladder of financial standing and many walks of life should be congregating for this occasion i knew that there were some of our colored friends who probably came from the dilapidated coldwater tenements which are the blight of every metropolis this appearance of one of their own would serve as a challenge for courage and the memory of this evening would linger with them as the afterglow of a brilliant sunset seen across barren plains i knew that there were whites present to whom this evening was just another event of the social season who would return to their exquisitelyappointed homes with no thought as to the farreaching implication of social equality presaged by this artists appearance i also knew that there were some like myself who loved beauty in any form be it wrapped in brown or in white covering the lights were dimmed the usual hush descended over the entire assemblage the curtains parted to reveal a plain empty stage empty save for a little man seated at a grand piano and miss anderson herself standing tall still almost forbidding in her bearing her gown floor length was of winecolored velvet simply fashioned with long sleeves and modest decolletage welcoming applause thundered throughout the vast building and still the artist stood quietly almost statuelike there was no effort on her part to sell herself to the audience by the customary sweeping curtsies and sparkling smiles most performers employ only her somber eyes betrayed her interest as they swept over the sea of upturned faces and when the ovation finally died away she merely lowered her head in acknowledgment before signalling her accompanist to begin time stood still for me as she sang opening her mobile mouth to emit glorious warm rich tones and as the full purity of her voice reached out to embrace each person present one realized that this lady need not resort to stage mannerisms or gestures her gift was her lovely instrument which she gave unreservedly in a varied offering of classics german lieder and spirituals she herself was only the channel through which beauty flowed constant and moving encore followed encore until she finally sang schuberts ave maria the crowd attentive before now was spellbound with the silence so pronounced one could have heard a pin drop as the last note faded away a holy solemnity seemed to pervade the place i mopped my wet cheeks then glancing around saw tears on other faces both brown and white this group who moments before had been wildly cheering was suddenly on its knees gradually people arose until everyone was standing in silent tribute to this masterartist and then they began filing out as if from a place of worship my neighbor and i had reached a sideexit when i impulsively turned to her and said lone i must go backstage and tell miss anderson what inspiration and courage her singing has given me i must tell her do you mind she looked at me so very ponderous and awkward then at her watch well your husband did say not to be too late you know yes i know i know but ive never felt so moved in my life it wont take too much longer i pleaded she smiled indulgently after all pregnant women often get extreme ideas all right ill go along she answered the line of greeters was longer than i had anticipated and i shifted my uncomfortable weight from one swollen foot to the other while my friend looked more and more disapproving but slowly we approached the great lady and i mulled in my mind the verbal bouquet i would present her when i finally stood before her no words came she was taller than i so that she gazed down on my tentshaped figure and her dark liquid eyes seemed to hold a composite of all the sadness and compassion in the world then her large strong hand grasped mine and all my flowery words slipped from mind any i heard myself murmuring brokenly ohmay god bless you onstage she had only offered fragments of smiles but now she suddenly flashed a wide one which lighted her entire face her reply remained with me like a benediction all through the next difficult days thank you he will be blessing you too before long and he did as two weeks later a lovely girlchild was born to us by rights this story is finished but an epilogue must be added in order to show how miss anderson not only inspired and encouraged me then but later gave me comfort nearly two years ago my mother was in our home slowly dying from cancer one sunday night marian anderson made a guest appearance on tv and i turned up the volume so her voice would reach mama in the bedroom l sl when the warm rich voice began singing hes got the whole world in his hands i slipped to mamas door to see how she liked it i paused unobserved as i saw a thin bony hand upraised while i heard mama say with conviction and hes got me in his hands too the memory of that scene etched indelibly on my mind comforted me often after mama left us again marian anderson unknowingly had blessed my life agony in angola angola has been in a q state of virtual civil k war since march gr when heavy fighting between angolan nationalists and portuguese whites broke out in the northwest section ol that west africa colonythe prize possession of portugal for over years in all some whites and about africans have been slaughtered an estimated africans have fled to the neighboring congo for safety because of tight censorship control clamped on the press in angola and in lisbon by portugals premier antonio de oliveira salazar few dispatches concerning the angola trouble have been able to reach the outside world the onthespot reports that have found their way into american newspapers and magazines can to a large degree be credited to the zeal and forthrightness of protestant missionaries and african pastors and teachers who have suffered greatly at the hands of portuguese civilians and military angola with its million africans and whites is portugals cinderella colony times larger than portugal herself under the harsh portuguese rule the exploited angolan africans have gained little economic advancement and few educational privileges there has been no political participation by the people either african or white the lot of the average african under portuguese rule has not changed substantially in years the presence of the protestant church in angola has been one of the brighter spots in the existence of that nations africans for more than years protestant missionaries have been at work there teaching in schools operating hospitals building modern villages raising crops and most of all spreading the gospel the missionaries have often been the only people angolans could turn to for counsel in angola missionaries and africans became close companions and worked and worshiped together few portuguese whites ever dreamed of such association with the africans thus when trouble broke out last february and march inevitably the protestant church was suspected of having supported the nationalist movement this suspicion grew when africans attacking whiteowned plantations and homes bypassed protestant stations the protestant church in angolaespecially that part of it supported by american methodists and british and canadian baptistshas suffered greatly at the hands of portuguese who have entered on something of an antiprotestant crusade the methodist church has suffered considerably more than other denominations and churches work ing in angolawith all the damage done by portuguese whites who blame that church for much of what is happening the methodist board of missions in new york estimates that at least of its african pastors have been killed either by portuguese civilians or by military forces some after hurried trials others without trial in half of the methodist area in angola the luanda area african pastors and teachers reportedly are in prison have fled with their people or have been killed only are accounted for and known to be in no immediate danger the church has lost one of its top district superintendentsguilherme pereira ingles who had developed and served one of the largest methodist districts in all of africa according to reports he was shot in the leg and taken to quibaxi for imprisonment after a hurried trial he was shot to death his body was loaded in a truck with others who had suffered a similar fate then dumped into the dange river armed white civilians have destroyed or seriously damaged many of the denominations churches schools and centers in the capital city of luanda seven schools and chapels and one social center with clinic kindergarten and nursery services were destroyed last year bishop ralph e dodge toured methodist mission stations in angola as he did again recently alarmed at what he saw on that first visit he warned that the portuguese were in serious trouble one paragraph of his report to his board in new york gave this graphic picture of angola before the revolt started there are few colored or african lawyers and doctors assimilados hold important posts in one or two government departments and thats all schooling is still left almost entirely to the missions on a voluntary basis the protestant church alone has educated more africans angolans than the government russia is making propaganda broadcasts in portuguese and the voice of america is hardly heard because it comes at an hour when most africans are in bed causing great concern is the seeming isolation of american consular officials they seem to be quite confident that nothing is going to happen to portuguese africa an attitude understandable when they have almost no contact with the african people the outspokenness of the protestant churches in angola against the current abuses practiced in that west african nation by the salazar regime of portugal has surprised both friends and opponents here to fore the missionaries have suffered in silence with the people of angola all at once they have become vocal in bringing recent events in angola before the conscience of the civilized world for judgment indignation at the regime of antonio de oliveira salazar arises from four main sources brutal treatment of africans terrorist tactics and intimidation religious discrimination lack of forthrightness in official dealings let it be said that over the past years a sizable reservoir of good will has been built up between most protestant leaders missionary and african and the local portuguese european population in fact close and lasting friendships have been formed no one can be fair and honest without acknowledging many excellent qualities in the portuguese people generosity hospitality lack of strong racial prejudices and so on few are the leaders of the protestant churches who have not benefited from these commendable qualities during their stay in portuguese africa individual portuguese citizens have gone out of their way to be friendly to a passing stranger and in remote areas have opened their modest homes at any hour to anyone in distress protestant leaders readily acknowledge their gratitude for innumerable kindnesses shown them by gracious portuguese colonists and officials it is this graciousness on the part of some of the portuguese which has until now kept the pressure of resentment from rising to the breaking point it should also be said that the protestants in angola do not condone violence perpetrated by africans any more than they do that perpetrated by the portuguese no matter how severe the provocation the truly christian position must be one of nonviolence the fact that in angola the provocation finally went beyond the africans endurance can be understood without any attempt at justification protestant church leaders there emphatically deny that they had any part in planning the bloody revolt or that sizable numbers of protestant christians participated in the massacres but that the brutal retaliation of white portuguese against all africans and especially against the educated protestants has evoked a fairly solid block of protestant opposition cannot be denied although angolas protestant churches have ministered to the spiritual needs of europeans as well as africans few europeans have affiliated themselves with protestant churches portugal being a predominantly roman catholic country has favored people of that faith for decades consequently most of the work done in angola by protestants has been among africans missionaries have grown to understand admire and trust the african people without being blind to certain weaknesses and the need for spiritual as well as intellectual economic and social development which the latter encouraged against protestant property the methodist mission in the center of luanda the capital city suffered a mob attack under police escort this was followed by others elsewhere in luanda and in other parts of north central angola many churches and schools were destroyed by white terrorists it is rumored that even the government now recognizes that it permitted mobs to go too far in destroying church property following the unfavorable american vote in the united nations but it was more than reaction against the american vote that triggered the vandalism for years portuguese plantation owners had resented protestant schools which they said brought about a reduction in the number of laborers resentment had been rising against the protestant educational program in which a limited number of africans were preparing for university training and an even smaller number were already studying in portugal and elsewhere the general wave of terrorism which followed the march revolt in the north provided an opportunity for the embittered europeans to get even with the protestants for limiting the supply of cheap labor through an effective if limited educational program after the mob violence by europeans the feeling rose among missionaries that if the police permitted such action in the capital city there was not much to be gained by continuing to remain silent thus the story of property damage so much less significant than the loss of life estimated at africans and whites was also presented for world judgment a third factor one which has long offended the protestant discrimination in portuguese africa protestant tax money along with that of other groups is used to subsidize the work of the roman catholic church protestant marriage and baptismal certificates have never been officially recognized thus protestants are forced either to deny their own faith in seeking a repetition of the ceremonies in the catholic church or to forego the needed documents the children of protestants married in evangelical churches are officially considered illegitimate the salazar government fails to recognize protestant churches as legal entities and usually refers to them as sects for the past quarter of a century the portuguese government has permitted few if any protestant missions to be established in angola whereas the program of expansion by the roman church has been facilitated to such an extent that protestant workers have had to take jobs constructing catholic churches in protestant communities in one portuguese territory no protestants can train as teachers because all teachertraining facilities have been turned over to the roman church and protestants are excluded from all such facilities a very illuminating new book protestantism in africa by professor jose julio goncalves concludes that while protestants should not be opposed openly they must not be encouraged or they would grow too rapidly therefore the only feasible way to handle the protestant problem is to discriminate against protestants and that is just what the salazar regime has done for years though it has laws proclaiming to the world that it endorses freedom it instructs its agents to interpret those laws so as to thwart the protestant witness the deviousness has been an offense against the protestant conscience which believes in dealing with all religious groups openly and on a basis of equality a fourth factor which has been hard for protestants to understand is the lack of forthrightness on the part of the salazar government in one protestant missionary asked for permission to open a new mission although the matter was pursued in both luanda and lisbon no reply has yet been obtained lisbon laying the blame on luanda officials and vice versa a request from another missionary to establish residence in mozambiquecosting him more than in fees for translating into portuguese all documents from birth certificates to university diplomashas after a wait of five years been neither granted nor refused this lack of frankness is very hard for protestant missionaries to comprehend the portuguese have some laws which are among the best in the world but interpretation is left to the whims of petty officials who openly declare that they are the law interpretation of the laws varies not only from place to place but from day to day depending on individual officials mood and motivation thus it is that constant confusion prevails one official will give one interpretation and the next will give another in one instance a friendly official authorized a school to be built after the foundations were poured and all the materials purchased his successor refused to recognize that permission had been granted so for five years the material has stood beside the completed foundations waiting for a new and more amenable administratorin the hope that he will reverse the decision of his predecessor protestants who normally give and expect a straightforward reply are constantly frustrated by the referral technique and all the continual delays it is not the little frustrations however which have caused the protestant leaders to adopt a stiffening attitude toward the salazar government but the fact that the world should know what is happening to human beings living behind a jungle curtain floridas first distinguished author or many years when jrj giving talks in florida p j i have pointed out that there is only one first w c i ass nativeborn florida author who has written any even small body of work about the state marjorie kinnan rawlings philip wylie and all the others were born elsewhere and adopted he florida scene the exception was zora neale hurston seldom on inquiry had any of the audiences ever heard of her or known any of her work at that point i revealed to the white southern audiences that zora was a negro as i announced this i looked around for the nearest exit i never had to use the exit and when i told this to zora she roared with laughter on february at age zora died in fort pierce florida in poverty and obscurity she is a prime example of the excellent american writer who in our smashhit or virtually nothing kind of literary civilization gets lost in the shuffle far more recognition should be given to such writers and i ask permission to give this to zora i regard her early books their eyes were watching god jonahs gourd vine and the florida parts of mules and men depicting life in the turpentine camps to be in the top rung of american writing certainly as good as anything anyone has ever written about florida and take another look at those titles they are as exceptional as the wonderful imagery she possessed and gave to her readers as real as the hurricanefrom the viewpoint of the negrowhich she pictured among her people in the vegetable raising district around lake okeechobee zora not only could write but knew what she was writing about her autobiography dust tracks on a road won an anisfield award for better race relationships she knew how to express herself the peak of her economic careerand it was mt everest rising from the plainwas the short period during which she worked as a writer at paramount in hollywood when i asked her what she thought of california she wrote back true to her native florida i like my land lying down how did this girl born without her permission in possession of a black skin in a backwoods florida town make a place for herself in the world her handicaps would seem to be almost insurmountable eatonville her birthplace is a remote community of a few hundred negro people in northcentral florida not far from orlando it is a place of dirt streets incredibly colorful negro cabins set beautifully beneath towering live oaks dripping with long beards of spanish moss it was the first incorporated negro town in the united states and one of the very few which is entirely negro zoras father was a baptist minister he was able to augment her primary education to such an extent that she was able to work her way through two years at howard university in washington d c by serving as a maid then she won a scholarship for two more years at barnard college and became the second negro to be graduated from that school during this period she supported herself by being secretary to fannie hurst when she and miss hurst travelled and wanted to eat in restaurants from which negroes were barred miss hurst introduced zora with an air of great mystery and vast importance as the princess zora and there was never any difficulty it being assumed that zora must be royalty from the far east after barnard zora studied anthropology for three years working under dr franz boaz and for this work morgan college at howard conferred upon her the degree of littd she worked in the anthropological field off and on for most of her life her studies and reports on voodoo in the united states and haiti are definitive on the subject and one of them when her research penetrated too far nearly got her killed meanwhile she also wrote on general subjects and her writings included novels to live during this usually penurious period she taught at north carolina college for negroes during these years she was also awarded two guggenheim fellowships and a rosenwald grant zora was rather short and squat and black as coal she didnt look and sound much like a doctor of literature but more as though she could do a good days washing she was filled with an effervescence for life seldom seen in the human race she had an abrupt explosive laugh that burst like a bomb she always had some new idea or project she enthused over some she actually carried out it was both exhilarating and tiring to be with her for she caught you up in her ideas to the point of exhaustion she herself never seemed to feel she was absolutely and completely improvident saving what little money she ever earned was a repugnant idea to her when she did save it was to pay for some new project such as an abortive one of mystery involving an expedition to honduras which she financed and from which she returned flat broke i never could find out just what that project was about probably it was one of the harebrained kind she sometimes developed she couldnt help being sensitive of the color line but her sensitiveness was of another kind than the usual it was never bitter she was always proud of being a negro and once told me she wouldnt be white for anything in the world she wrote in her autobiography my own circumference of life is there i give you all my right hand of fellowship and love and hope for the same from you in my eyesight you lose nothing by not looking just like me you who play the zigzag lightning of power over the world with the grumbling thunder in your wake think kindly of those who walk in the dust and you who walk in humble places think kindly too of others consider that with tolerance and patience we godly demons may breed a noble world in a few hundred generations or so zora not only preached this with some biting irony but also carried it out gently in the life she loved to live with zest once when she was visiting me and my wife at our florida home and we had asked her to stay to dinner while the meal was being prepared a white caller came to the door zora seeing him before we did stepped away so that the man would not see her afterward we told her that she need not have done this she said that she didnt want to take any chance of embarrassing us we did not always get on as well as that after the honduras debacle she wrote to me from miami that she did not have eating money but she had the promise of a job in new york if she could raise the fare to get there i sent her a few dollars and advised friends in miami of her plight they got together and raised enough for her fare instead of using it for the avowed purpose she did not go but remained in miami when i remonstrated with such behavior and scolded her she wrote back that she had read just at that time that i was going through the trying process of having a book published because of this she understood why i was so testy and she forgave me for being put out with her at the time i was prone to think that perhaps too many scholarships and fellowships and grants might have been given her generating the conviction that others should support her and that there should be a limit to such grants perhaps i dont know i got over my aggrievement when i learned with amusement that she had gone to work in a miami beach house as a domestic and that her employers one day had found out who she was by reading an article she had written in a copy of the saturday evening post on their livingroom table then i remembered how one day she had shown a single spark of defeatism over her color she had told me she had written an article but she didnt think that the saturday evening post would buy one from a negro i told her that was the only stupid thing i had ever heard her say because of it i wouldnt write a note to the post for her for if i did and her article was accepted she might even erroneously have some question in her mind she was to send it to them and find out for herself the post bought that article and others commercial writing however did not consistently appeal to zora because she didnt care enough about making money still filled with ideas and schemes rarely based upon getting rich she drifted to the fort pierce area of florida during her two last years she earned a precarious living as a substitute teacher at lincoln park academy there and contributed to the local negro paper the chronicle then she had a stroke that halted work on a new book she was writing she spent the last months of her life in a county home her funeral at a tiny negro funeral home in fort pierce was attended by over people sixteen of them white the mourners overflowed the small hall out onto the porch and then into the yard there was a little printed program entitled funeral rites of the late zora neale hurston which offered a brief biography the order of the service and the names of the pallbearers and flower girls who were some of her students expenses were paid by contributions many from those who never knew her the local negro population did not need a white florida writer to be there to speak an appreciation to tell them who zora neale hurston was she was someone they may not have understood too well but they knew she had pulled herself up by her bootstraps and done something not many white people ever do the wonderful understanding of negroes for the human race born perhaps of their necessity to tolerate it was never better expressed than at zoras funeral when these people among whom she had lived so briefly nevertheless stood by one of their own the editor of the paper for which she worked said zora neale went about and didnt care too much how she looked or what she said maybe people didnt think so much of that but zora neale every time she went about had something to offer she didnt come to you empty the minister said when people learned i was going to preach about her they asked me what can you find to say well i can find a lot of things they said she couldnt become a writer recognized by the world but she did it the miami paper said she died poor but she died rich she did something the main hymn sung at the service was hell understand and say well done an exact appraisal of the situation the single jarring thing and that meant reverently was the way they dressed her in a short frilly pink dressinggown with frothy pink mules on her feet an incongruous garb for one so real and earthy i can hear zora herself commenting on it and saying she wouldnt be caught dead in such an outfit i am sure she would have added her favorite statement as she loved to roar gleefully i aint got but two things to do stay black and die she has achieved her purpose part of it with some magnificent writing she is out of circulation and all her books are out of print one cannot be rectified the other should be by tommy l mack between rounds the b y twelve active members a of the leimert chess ihj club contributed fif teen dollars each to the naacp for the third quarter then completed arrangements to fish and golf at lake arrowhead during the last two weeks of august our western avenue barber fred clay suggested getting back to the business of chess when reverend jess patterson asked for a short delay to collect from each member fifteen dollars more for the freedom riders of core fred switched his cigar to the other side of his mouth and reminded jess he had just collected two hundred dollars vacation expenses from everybody furthermore he had had an empty chair for two months now the group sat silently after the minister explained the need for additional contributions then he said quietly well gentlemen if we cant support them with a little cash i motion we spend our vacation in the south ed smith who had taken over his fathers grocery store and was in the process of building the first negroowned supermarket in los angeles was the first to contribute the fifteen dollars followed by builder steve wright who was trying to integrate a new development professor hubbard was last to contribute before returning to his table he asked gentlemen everyone has already given of his money but why shouldnt we also go i quit placing my chessmen and was aware of a shifting uneasiness pervading the room why the hell should we spend our vacation in jail replied the barber there are other ways of going about those things he didnt answer what other ways but steve wright who from previous discussions had some support for his plan suggested we back his building company in negotiating financing through a local savings and loan association and with the negro press supporting us we could begin breaking down the walls of housing discrimination in california the minister said the situation was more grave in the south and our obligation was clear positions comprising elements of truth which conscionably could not be dismissed were reiterated but with no indication of resolution finally dr rogers ended the meeting by suggesting we ponder the matter and reach a decision at a later time i drove slowly along the sparsely lit westside streets realizing steves remarks were more meaningful as i observed fewer houses and an increasing number of large apartments which seemed even more crowded because of the darkness i entered and closed the door quietly enough but i expected dorothy to call to me because we usually had a late dinner on thursdays after club meetings a light from the bedroom cast its brightness across the dim hallway then i saw the thin hands of the black forest clock and realized she must have eaten long ago a magazine on child care had slipped from her limp hand to the floor the other hand rested on the fold of the bedspread which sloped from her swollen stomach i felt that any project which might take me away from her at this time could be summarily dismissed i switched off the reading lamp and went to bed quietly relieved no one had asked my opinion on the question of a freedom ride to the south at breakfast dorothy seemed nervous as she sipped coffee and waited on me it was almost time to go before she told me she had lunched last tuesday with professor hubbards wife then she asked what was your position on the freedom ride project i havent given it any serious thought dear seems a fine thing to me she said as she handed my coat i brushed her hair aside and kissed her forehead as i left for the hospital whitedressed orderlies wheeled quiet stainless steel carts containing used breakfast dishes through the brightly lit corridors ward nurses were preparing to give bed patients individual therapy as i picked up the distribution from the message center before going to my office absently i initiated circulation copies then found a new case i opened the file but kept wondering if anyone in the club actually would ride to the south and i was annoyed because dorothy apparently had discussed the matter with professor hubbards wife and had not mentioned it to me my irritating discomfort increased somewhat when the dermatologist came into my office and sat crossing his legs got your crystal ball mr miller he asked maybe a little common sense will help the expression on his face reflected my tone of voice rough case i explained whats the problem a kid in the prison ward what is he doing up there pumped his stomach he paused and recrossed his legs they said he stabbed another boy who is in emergency now oh i see he broke out in a rash at the prospects of police interrogation so i asked them to postpone questioning until tomorrow thought you might have a chance to look in on him and give me your report whats his name he hasnt told anyone wont tell who his family is either dr walton said a little more information was on his chart then left for a conference i returned to the new file planning a tentative appointment then phoned the receptionist notifying her of my destination and took the elevator to the prison ward on eight the guard greeted me and unlocked the door after a brief exchange i indicated i wanted to talk to the patient alone he was standing by the window the flannel hospital pajamas fitted his stocky body loosely his wavy blond hair was meticulously combed red welts stood out from his face hello what the hell do you want help if i can i dont need your damn help i looked at his bed chart his stomach had been pumped of barbituates the skin disorder tentatively diagnosed as a reaction from nervousness manifested with fear was under observation my name is your name is sam and you look like an attendant im a medical social worker and my name is robert miller the boy was silent i repeated the next question twice then real ized he had heard me but was not going to talk any more it was just as well i thought under the circumstances even an initial interview could be aggravating but since he was no longer defensively verbalizing i thought it safe to ask for his cooperation he remained silent and there was no discernible change in the defiant expression on his face when i asked his name i suggested his parents would start checking the hospitals and police stations when he didnt come home tonight the boy turned toward the window i knocked on the door and the guard unlocked it i told him loudly enough for the boy to hear to contact me if the patient made such a request he nodded and closed the door there was no doubt the boy was quite frightened and was courageously trying to conceal his fear with aggression i felt certain also that my being a negro made it easier for him i stopped at my office and phoned emergency they told me todd duncan was the name of the boy treated earlier for knife wounds he had been transferred to ward two the nurse told me todd was in as she opened his file she said his right lung had been punctured by a sharp instrument he had a slight temperature from infection and was now in an oxygen tent she returned the file and added his parents had been there all night there was a small brown lady sitting on a cushioned chair in the corner of the waiting room i dragged my foot once not to startle her and she raised her head her red eyes were nearly closed by puffed eyelids she lowered it again i introduced myself and apologized for intruding at such a time but explained i was interested in the circumstances surrounding the incident its all right mr miller im cried out she said i might as well talk about it some after a moment she began as if she had already gone over it many times todd went back to los angeles she paused but before i could ask she explained they lived in glendale and had been plagued since the day they moved into that typical american community i remembered the newspaper accounts the dailies reported it was allegedly some teenagers who disturbed the peace protesting the addition of a negro family to the all white community the negro weekly reported some teenage hoodlums and other irresponsible citizens had smashed windows burned a cross on the lawn and honked automobile horns during the night outside the home of a negro family recently moved to glendale it added that the police behaved in the usual way in such cases the woman said she had been frightened for todd and asked him not to go i guess the kids are a little different from us mr miller i need time to think your parents should be notified yes they should be his voice rose they should be here he said pointing at the floor but theyre not theyre not even in town he shouted theyre too damn busy being successful to care about me he sat on the stool at the desk nervous tension and anxiety had caused the small red welts to reappear on his chin and about the sides of his face my name is howard lancaster he said calmly i had to lean closer to hear the quiet voice repeat his parents name and address so i could note them then in the same tones he spoke of the disorganization and the resulting coldness of his home life his father was a public relations expert for an electrical company and he traveled extensively his mother was a buyer for a downtown fashion agency both were frequently away from home at the same time as was the case this weekend it was during these times he had begun using seconal to soften the loneliness of rejection howard concluded he was unappreciated and was an unimportant member of his family the boy turned from me but i knew he was crying i phoned howards address to the investigating officer who was in the process of questioning witnesses regarding howards companions the only thing on which all of them agreed was there were a total of three white hecklers one of whom pushed todds girlfriend i asked for her address then went to see her i spoke but the two boys their ball and gloves beside them sat in silence on the lawn of the blue stuccoed duplex i pressed the button twice before the large oaken door was opened by an eightyearold holding a baseball cap in his hand he stood to the side of me telling his friends he still couldnt come out then he turned and called deanie and wandered outside adjusting his cap on his head nadine lewis was an olivecomplexioned girl with thick black hair draped about her shoulders her hazel eyes had been crying i told her i was from the hospital and her eyes brightened i considered that todd had an abnormal temperature and he needed help to breathe under the circumstances i could only tell her we would have a report on his progress tomorrow it was all my fault she half whispered as she sat on the sofa will you tell me how it happened miss lewis i asked and sat in a chair near her it started because of my clumsiness i guess some white guys were heckling us and i suppose the blondhaired boy was kind of drunk and was showing off anyway he came over yelling at us to get out then he bumped into me knocking me off balance toddwas near and he caught me she paused and continued the other kids probably thought something was going on and rushed over his friends also came over and thats when it must have happened were you pretty close to the blond boy during the whole thing yes you see anyone with a knife no she replied then added i didnt know anyone had gotten hurt until i saw two of them running some of the kids were kneeling over todd and the others were holding that drunk one she paused finally the police came we were both silent for awhile then she said that since the incident a hundred more students had come by her house to register for the students for civil_rights now association and they would begin picketing monday we could use a little more guidance mr miller but nothing is going to stop us from enjoying the full citizenship which is our right under the constitution i felt as uncomfortable in nadines presence as i had felt with mrs duncan yet i was impressed with nadines determination which was something akin to the will of a man dying of thirst in a desert as long as he saw a mirage he would not cease to struggle but making an illusion a reality was a monumental task i guess thats why i hadnt tried it individually or with a group and though ive been moderately successful i knew the social climate had been such that my full potential had already been aborted i could have wished her luck that the project would be successful or safety in the face of mobs threatening physical violence instead i said it was going to be a hard task and hurriedly left when i returned to the hospital there were two messages for me one from the police informing me they would clear with the hospital later today to take howard to juvenile hall and that his mother had returned home the other was from howard asking me to come see him he greeted me before offering me a seat at the desk then returned to his bed the springs sagging beneath his weight i told him his mother had returned his head slowly nodded she was a part of it mr miller he paused and continued she was with some of our community leaders when they met at at one of the fellows house and he overheard them discussing ways to get the negro family out of the neighborhood did you get to know todd i asked no he replied i saw him in his yard a few times then about a week later we were in the car and he came out of his house with this big sign sit until served so we just followed him howard stood with his back to me and began explaining it was his intention just to frighten todd when he was interrupted by a knock on the door the guard with two folding chairs preceded a stylishly dressed lady who embraced howard and a man in a wrinkled suit carrying a small briefcase im robert im mrs lancaster and i want howard out of here the woman began my attorney has already explained you havent a single reason to hold him here his release might have been arranged mrs lancaster if the police had been able to contact his parents well im home now she said so everything is all right and i dont have any time to be wasting around here a boy has been stabbed mama said howard quietly you didnt do it she said but i was partially responsible and i was with them when they did it you didnt do it she repeated but i know who did both mrs lancaster and the attorney came to their feet you stay out of this mrs lancaster said i think you should talk this over with me howard before you say anything else said the attorney ive already thought it over the boy said in monotones and i know we were all wrong but its all over now howard said mrs lancaster no its not all over he yelled they think i stabbed that boy youre innocent let them find who they want im going to tell them howard persisted no howard we live out there thats why i should tell mama i forbid you she snapped his quiet firm voice broke the silence bill hopkins daryl long and joe joseph stewart had the knife the nurse said the oxygen tent had temporarily been removed the infection had been cleared and she permitted the parents to see todd briefly now mrs duncan was sitting in the same place her husband and her mother had joined her and they refused to go home though the nurse told them todd would be all right he opened his eyes as i called his name i told him nadine and the other students were continuing the demonstrations and there was a weak grin on his discolored face finally he said id be with em if we hadnt had trouble last time did you know those boys i asked him they burned a cross on our lawn he answered you know which one stabbed you he nodded affirmatively was it howard lancaster i dont know their names the blond one no at the hearing three weeks later howard and todd identified joseph stewart as the one who did the stabbing joseph was ordered to the california youth authority his companions bill hopkins and howard lancaster had had fewer prior police contacts and a subordinate role in this incident both were ordered placed in a forestry camp all the parents were counselled and admonished i said goodbye to howard and followed todd and his parents out of the court building where nadine and the other students rose from the shade of the fan palms and quietly greeted him in the hot august sun i drove home in anticipation of dorothys approval of my decision later i would tell the chess club of todds courage and of his enterprising parents whose move was equally important and probably more fundamental because full citizenship is impossible without fair housing from which all else could emanate i felt a committee to develop wrights housing plan would be selected that night after which i would motion the remaining members take a freedom ride to light the lamps the vividly discomfitv f ing insight into what it i rfeels like to be a negro sla in he south and i n w r deed through the united states is disturbing many bookreading whites and roiling us up into a state wideeyed aghast and protesting by turns the relentless finestyled and bitterly entertaining melancholy of say james baldwin plunges the white southerner into wretched shock somewhat alleviated by hot surges of indignant identity with negroes if one is addicted to mr baldwins essays his insistence on showing us his plight is also likely to evoke an occasional cry for mercy like please mr baldwin we all got troubles valdostabom louis lomax is a rather more treacherous writer to read and talk with mr lomax writes sometimes so candidly and in such fresh style of the unsuspected anguish of the negro lot that one is charmed and amused at the satire and force of his prose only to be felled by his insistence too that we behold the perverting misery of race discrimination he talks with an exuberant and amiable vitality in a disarming accent still redolent of south georgia and just when you think everything is going to be all right because he is such a friendly fellow his heavylidded eyes darken and deepen with an impaling effect to tell the uncomfortable truth as he hopes somberly that white people will learn to love before the negro learns to hate other new novels and essays and texan john howard griffins shocker black like me about his southern adventures in negro disguise confront us with unimagined depths of pain and anger among negroes and yet in the dourest and most persistent of the negro writers there seems detectable a thin strong theme of wary optimism about the south a hope for freedom friendship and equality unprecedented between two races living together this great high hope so cautiously suggested by negroes is also entertained by thoughtful white southern writers in a frequently quite emotional assertion of the similarity and natural compatibility of negroes and whites down here the late w j cash patron saint of southern white selfcriticism observed with an intensity comparable to mr baldwins that negro entered into white man as profoundly as white man entered into negro subtly influencing every gesture every word every emotion and idea every attitude and with a biting sorrow comparable to baldwins acutely intelligent and humorshot gloom suggests a southern personality common to negroes and whites which might liberated from our awful shackles make a free and affectionate society in the symposium the south i erner as american l d reddick a negro scholar points out temperamental likenesses between dixie whites and negroes in speech gait food habits and orientation toward life we talk and laugh the same way make the same judgments and weep at similar sentimentalities says reddick quoting charles black that southern whites and negroes are bound in a special bond in a peculiar way they are the same kind of people even their strife is fratricidal james mcbride dabbs in the southern heritage wrote through the processes of history and the grace of god we have been made one people and it is disastrous to talk and act as if we were two if on the contrary we would play the game wholeheartedly together if we would be our deepest selves there is no telling what great age might develop in the south mr dabbs with a white southern love and audacity exceeding any negro literary optimism i know of also wants southerners to rise to the level of loving passionately our rich and varied configuration of people black and white as we love our earth and landscape in which case we should not only solve our greatest problem one of two major problems of the world today but our age would become a challenge to generations yet unborn another writer leslie w dunbar in the autumn virginia quarterly review looks beyond the hope of messrs cash baldwin lomax and dabbs to his own southern white assertion i believe the south will out of its travail and sadness and requited passion give the world its first grand example of two races of men living together in equality and with mutual respect the souths heroic age is with us now maybe mr baldwin and mr lomax ought to come on back home i tremble to consider mr baldwins response to a suggestion that the deep south is his home but he has confided that his alabama parents just barely made it to new york in time for his birth and that traveling south was strange to come back to a place youve never been still his deep south origins and happenso birth in harlem are sufficient for any ancestorworshiping southerner to claim him as rightfully our own anyway it occurs to me that the stingy shy but very eager beginnings of our first grand example to the world are preparing a place a home where all of us may feel like people instead of like whites or negroes this is apparent in the desegregations popping out all over the south so fast you cant count them and the community pride relief elaborately casual acceptance and occasional glad burst of good manners which accompany the forced change maybe mr baldwin amid his own kind of folks who know so well his intelligent gloom and comic ironies might mitigate his melancholy and enrich his wary hope and perhaps the compatibility of white southerners who already love before mr lomax hates might invite and expand his natural and indigenous southern exuberance and idealism maybe not next week but it may not be long before our rich and varied configuration of people black and white will meet as these writers already have to clean repair furnish and light the lamps and fires in our common home garden party at lastourville the lambarene airstrip is no idlewild every time a plane circles you know it is the plane dark heads everywhere lift toward the sky as for the second coming in the land rover we bobbed along the dirt road waved at from the huts and arrived at the airstrip what looked like a hundred people mostly africans were waiting for the plane men in their sunday best in orange trousers and yellow silk shirts women in crazyquilt wraps their children on their backs dignified black officials with their untutored wives vous etes avec une femme ou avec deux the steward asked and crowds of bigeyed children two particularly elegant specimens in rumpled jacketsone with a hawaiian sport shirt underneath another in a jaunty racing capstood a little apart from the crowd after a short time we all scrambled into the old dcthe ingredients for a fine and brotherly jelly if a few screws got loose the captain walked through the cabin a thin somewhat bent and unhappy looking fellow of about fortyfive with a small mustache and eyes which looked disgusted and also a little yellow i remember thinking gastric ulcer bad liver he paced all the way down the cabin and said angrily to the steward get them all up front cant you see we are overweight our point of gravity is much too far to the back all the people behind me were somehow pushed beyond the door which divided the fuselage in two whether they were sitting lying or hanging ill never know for although the door flew open every minute it was kicked closed again too quickly to see what was going on behind it we were flying already and there was the river the schweitzer hospital and the godawful jungle stretching endlessly the stink the heat and the anxiety were almost unbearable there would be three stops before brazzaville at the first stop some africans got off to go to their villages and a few white passengers joined us the second stop would be lastourville the plane touched down and made a sort of jolly jump on what is called a runway in this part of the world we piled out as the chickens and goats scattered before the invasion from outer space the dinnerjacketed gentlemen and their wives and many others clambered into a truck which served as the local limousine service the other passengers walked out of the sun to spend the half hour for loading and unloading in the shade of one of the three small buildings which formed the only shelter on the airstrip the main building was about twenty feet long and one story high with four glassless windows and no door on it in faded lettering was painted lastourville two smaller sheds carried respectively the words meteo and t s f we sat in meteo because there were a few chairs and a bed a few minutes later madame meteo very pretty and young walked in with a child at her breast she sat down to complete the feeding smiling at us only then i noticed that this was not a waiting room but the bedsittingdrawing room of mr and mrs meteo mr meteo also came in soon sat down and said well youll have a long time here more than half an hour i asked ah oui monsieur he said maybe tomorrowhe had the beautiful ivory smile of africaand went on i have just radioed to brazza but whats happened i asked bewildered something wrong but didnt you notice you smashed two wheels of your landing gear coming down i went out and saw indeed that there were more people standing around and under the plane than usual for on an african airstrip there are always a number of unauthorized visitors watching the proceedings of fueling loading and unloading a few of them with lighted cigarettes in their mouths there was very little left of two of our three wheels and the jolly little jump at the landing might well have been our last one the answer that came back from brazza obviously said that it was sunday and que voulezvous cest la periode des vacances but tomorrow morning they would send a plane to pick us up nobody was excited the eighteen passengers merely shrugged their shoulders and the captain found a bottle of whisky we sat in our dead plane waiting for the flight engineer to come back from his explorations in the town of lastourville about five miles away after a while i went for a walk down the road to look at the few mud huts before the first one a woman sat on her haunches a bronze statue she looked at me impassively in front of the second hut an old woman her breasts bare was delousing her daughter the third hut bore a sign with a name and under it ancien combatant an old man in yellow trousers the remains of an army tunic and a faded scarlet fatigue cap on his gray curls arose from a box in his bonedry dirt front yard and saluted gravely his neighbors one in a nightshirt the other in old blue shorts grinned and we exchanged a few words in french in the trembling heat we must have been apparitions to each other back at the plane my fellow passengers were still drinking whisky it was stifling i sat down and read an old parismatch the captain looked a little less grim after his third whisky do we sleep in the plane i asked him maybe he said we have two ddt bombs the steward consoled us pleasantly i know i said because they had fallen on me during the jump there was the sound of a jeep in the distance and the navigator came back he had a bottle in his hand with the compliments of the commissaire de district who was also trying to arrange lodgings for us for the night but it was difficult for lastourville only had four european families there was plenty of space for the african passengers however another truck arrived and we were taken to the heart of the village the road went downhill past the huts i had already seen and kept on going downhill for five hundred feet through a dark funnel of dense virgin forest then all at once we were at the end of the funnel a vast valley spread out below with the wide ogowe river winding through it and rows of mountains receding into a blue background behind it as in a medieval painting deep down in this shangrila a few neat houses african customs of his region but the animals interested him more on his walls were beautifully framed pages from buffons histoire naturelle and most of the books on his shelves were about animals animals are my passion he said as he got up lightly for such a heavy man and waved us to the buffet which had been prepared and here hundreds of miles away from the next settlement in a funnel of virgin forest on a large mahogany table covered with damask waited an exquisite buffet froid you were unexpected and i am sorry but you will just have to take potluck smiled the commissaire waving his arm toward caviar mallosol pate de campagne foie gras thon a la portugaise and thick slices of cold roast beef there were freshly fried potato chips and many more complicated and tasteful things and warm fresh french bread there was an endless supply of mellow bordeaux and a particularly fruity cool moselle wine had the plane really miraculously made so safe a landing or had we already ascended to some afterlife standing around a table piling plates with delicacies in front of wide open doors with the soft murmur of cataracts below and a too esthetic crescent moon over the palm trees after supper we returned to the terrace and more drinks were served in the stillness of the equatorial evening we were all enveloped in irreality how long shall we still be tolerated on this continent mused the priest sipping his cognac i dont know said the commissaire but i wouldnt know what to do in france that i can tell you theyll still need us for a long time to come growled the texaco dealer they arent reasonable enough to see that said the radio man their leaders know that they couldnt operate a radio station that they couldnt drill the oil wells that they havent one single economist but the young hotheads think they can do everything because they are completely ignorant and the russians will try to confirm them in their beliefs and take over we dont want to exchange a mild tyranny for a harsh one said the african journalist we know very well that we got an education from you that without your engineers technicians and doctors we are sunk we need you administratively medically technically but then i am a moderate and i know it yes said the texaco man you know it but still you want your independence dont you and expect us to pay for everything fill the gaps in your budget defend you and give you every service for free do you think that can go on forever what is your press doing to make it clear to your people how much you need us if we get out youll go back to the jungle in a few years time look at the congo he said triumphantly i am told that leopoldville is already beginning to be overgrown with jungle youll start eating each other again the lumberjack joined in viciously i think we wont said the journalist quietly we know it will be difficult but we have men of good will we are divided in tribes and we cannot sweep away the old customs but we have more than we ever had we have a french as a common language we can communicate with each other we want a civilized way of life even the village people want it maybe they dont quite know yet what efforts it will demand of them and your politicians wont tell them either said the pilot mixing in for the first time they are just fighting about who will get the greatest power the biggest car and the most trips to paris or the united nations they will learn and our people will learn to distinguish between them the journalist replied our people are tired of being black subproletarians they feel the need to live like other human beings you have taught them that need if you have taught them anything we may have taught you many needs said the priest maybe you were better off before we came we have taught some of you in order to make you clerks in our offices and mechanics for our caterpillars but we have failed to raise the level of the family for how few girls have we trained it is true your people havent cooperated very much now you want bicycles radios and sewing machines and cameras and you think that is culture and im afraid youll sell your soul to whoever promises things to you you are thinking of the russians again mon pere said the journalist with a smile i grant you that where there are frustrated discontented politicians and povertystricken populations the communists have their chance but we dont want them the chinese communists have done fantastic things in the few years they have been in power but we dont think their example could possibly work in tropical africa on the other hand i grant you that we want the things you have we want housing food hospitals and education especially education but above all we want human dignity you never gave us that did you you took it from us you didnt mind doing things for us but never with us you despised us really now we want to build our countries ourselves for we have learned that we are human beings like you if anything more human than you for a few moments nobody spoke then the priest said what i worry about is that you have no tradition of responsibility except to your clans you have no tradition of the brotherhood of man except within your tribe and we have not been able to instill it in you the african smiled again arent you a bit optimistic about the honesty of your own politicians and your european history as i read it is not exactly a demonstration of brotherhood between your tribesmake it african and it will be different compounded of old and new theirs and ours not a mixture of both heritages but a new compound if this new product frightens us and we cannot accept it we shall lose the continent spiritually politically and economically and it will seal our doom for africa is awake now my host was petting his friend the baboon the moon had disappeared and a hot heavy breeze was blowing on the terrace the guests dozed over their drinks is africa really awake the commissaire said pouring himself a last cognac or do we whites just think so because we are falling asleep he looked at me with a bitter smile and lifted his glass happy dreams mon ami by roy gibbons drdaniel hale williams noted chicago negro surgeon made headline history in he won international acclaim that year as the first surgeon ever to operate successfully on a living human heart an organ previously regarded as forever inaccessible to the surgeons knife this skilled and gifted man died in at age known affectionately as doctor dan he was among the founders of provident hospital and a charter member of the american college of surgeons numerous honors came to him during his productive lifetime in which he also won distinction as a professor of physiology and a brilliant diagnostician in addition to sparking the construction of provident he likewise led the way in setting famous freedmens hospital washington d c on a sound medical foundation as its surgeon in chief dr williams numerous achievements as a medical educator and pioneer are among great contributions which marked the emergence of scientific medicine just before the turn of the century and added to chicagos luster as an internationally renowned haven of healing historians say back in the summer of tempers rose in a saloon not far from provident hospital where dr williams also was that institutions first surgeon in chief the disturbance soon became a brawl a man was stabbed and rushed to the hospital the victim a negro expressman named james cornish was unable to tell the length of the knife blade which had pierced his chest dr dan the red headed negro physician examined the wound and concluded that the blade had entered the mans heart in those days this was considered an inevitably fatal injury the xray had not been invented dr dan therefore had no way of determining by examination how serious the wound was standard practice in those days was to avoid treating internal wounds in the region of the heart to save the mans life dr dan had to venture into unexplored territory there was no penicillin or other wonder drugs blood transfusions had not been developed only crude anesthetics were available and these were not always reliable in those days too if a patients lungs collapsed during surgery there was no method such as exists today to reinflate them automatically everything pointed to repeating the failure experienced by a few daring doctors who had tried entering the heart and failed however as history now records the event a saving quality was present at the disaster scene in the form of a special surgical genius possessed by dr dan he accepted the challenge and the operation was begun as one biographer recalled everyone present must have shuddered when the intrepid surgeon put the point of his scalpel to cornishs inert body dr dan had sent word to a few medical colleagues inviting them to witness the operation six doctors four of them white and two negro crowded into the small operating room first dr dan made an entrance about the size of a knothole into the stricken mans chest this provided a kind of miniature trap doorpermitting him to peer inside just as he had assumed one of the internal arteries was damaged the continued bleeding of that blood vessel would have caused cornishs eventual death with great deftness dr williams tied off the injured vessel and held apart the wound in the heart sac while he examined the fluttering heart muscle the assailants blade had reached that structure too had it penetrated even a fraction of an inch deeper cornish would never have reached the hospital alive fortunately there was little bleeding from the heart itself and dr williams decided that the heart muscle required no stitching he irrigated the wound with a degree fahrenheit salt solution then he grasped the fluttering edge of the severed heart sac with a long forceps he held the edges with considerable difficulty while sewing them together with a suture of fine catgut the trail blazing operation was over three weeks later cornish was again brought into the operating room this time dr dan made a inch incision in the mans chest and through the opening drained off five pints of bloody serum which had accumulated in the pleural cavity there were no signs of infection however and days after he entered the hospital the once dying patient was discharged as cured he was reported still in good health years later with apologies to pepito threetables away sitv ting in the sun the two girls and the blond young man sipped iced vermouths and chatted around them all the languages of western europe crackled and cooed i could not hear their voices but it was easy to tell they were americans the girls as cool and comely as mannequins in orange juice ads wore just a trace more makeup perfectly applied than the other women the man crewcut and cleareyed wore polished cotton chinos on his long casually outstretched legs and there was about all three the glow of good food and good care and unlimited soap and water in palma de mallorca in the late afternoon after siesta time the tourists and international idlers flock to plaza gomila and sit at tables of the outdoor cafes and gossip and drink aperitives and plan their evening dissipations occasionally i sat in the plaza too in the shade for my father and mother had the foresight to relieve me of the necessity of torturing my skin to bake it brown i was sitting there with friends a frenchman and a dutch woman discussing the palma opera season a week away over syrupy palo tunel with soda another acquaintance an englishwoman was to be prima ballerina in the opening opera aida she was a charming woman once very well known long ago she had danced with pavlova and that was why we three were planning to be down front on opening night malicious well maybe but it promised to be quite a show and then glancing up my eyes met those of the blond young man toasting in the sun he smiled and nodded i turned to see who was behind me only a table of spaniards fervently discussing pesetas the favorite national pastime next to futbol and bullfighting no he was smiling and nodding at me i smiled and nodded right back then went on talking about the superannuated ballerina a moment later i glanced up again and the young american was still staring pensively now but seeing me look up the milk and fresh fruit smile flashed quickly over his face he nodded again this time i didnt reciprocate once was enough no point in being ridiculous but i wondered fleetingly what he was up to what his angle was in palma one never knows i soon found out before i caught a ship and took off for west africa i lived in a salmoncolored miniature villa in the middle of a huge garden where flowers and fruit bloom all year round there isnt another house like it on that sunsprayed blueandpastel island there are hundreds of villas yes fabulous estates places fit for kings and often actually occupied by the remnants of europes exiled nobility but none so small and compact and delightfully romantic as mine when i returned from africa rich in experience but virtually penniless my lovely villa was in the hands of someone else fortunately a friend i was invited to put up in what had been a few weeks previously my own guest room water a bit deep for him anyhow i saw you sitting in the square and i made up my mind to tell you that im sorry i bothered you it was just on my mind all the europeans keep asking me about it and telling me they cant understand how things like that can go on in america hell i cant understand it either i could sympathize with him europeans had showered me with so much unwanted sympathy over little rock and assorted racial incidents that i had contemplated passing as a guinean however i reflected how capriciously ironic of fate to implant in this golden innocent the toxic seed of a nations guilt suddenly i had an impulsive idea considering the status of my wallet it was madness say do you have to get right back to your friends i asked how would you like a drink well im meeting the girls later on he hesitated a moment you dont have to buy me a drink he said but id like to what do you say sure i feel like i need one he said with a quiet sigh i led him to the nearest bar and we both ordered cognac we sat on the patio looking northward across the gently rolling sea and we talked until long after the moon rose over the bay of palma on a clear night its an exquisite sight and it was a clear night all the while i kept thinking of pepito and hoping he wouldnt mind too much my not coming home to get him but then there was no need to feel too conscience stricken pepito had all that wonderful garden to romp around in inside nigeria many foreigners have often seen nigeria with her million people living in square miles of territory not only as a large and exciting country but also as a selfconfident democratic and stable country in which freedom and moderation are the chief determinants of national life no doubt there is some truth in this evaluation although the political stability has often hidden the lacklustre political leadership and venality within a countrys maturity nehru has said is measured by the questions it poses to itself and its failure is often due to its posing the wrong questions just now nigeria politicians talk of tribes chieftaincies and religion while the basic socioeconomic problems of the dayfull employment and social reconstruction for instanceinterest but a few moneybags appeal to them more than lofty thinkers yet the spiritual life of europe today belongs to christ and marx not croesus or charlemagne of asia to buddha rather than famenane or genghis khan and without the creators of vision to guide them the people are doomed to decay the federal government of the northern peoples congress npc and the national council of nigeria and the cameroons ncnc has all the virtues and vices of coalitions especially one between a feudal and a socialdemocratic party there is caution and there is confidence but speed and imagination are often iacidng while the npc is shedding some of the worst excesses of its feudal philosophytribalism and class demarcationat the national level the ncnc has had to abandon much of its socialist dreams of the agitational days before independence for both sir abubakar balewa the npc prime minister and dr nnamdi azikiwe expresident of the ncnc and now nigerias governor general want to see the ni gerian constitution work and therefore they use their influence to dampen the eagerness of their more extreme supporters who want a change in the status quo although their regional colleagues feel themselves free to experiment along feudal or socialist lines as they wish in their sphere of influence ironically the conservative orientation of the federal government has driven the fascistinclined action group opposition more and more to the left so that today the party which in abjured any consorting with foreign ideologies and five years later saw republicanism as the daydream of a lunatic fringe of the nationalist movement has become a great champion of socialist nationalisation and now advocates a republican constitution for nigeria and a union of african states the ag which in the federal election campaign advocated a prowestern foreign policy for nigeria is today urging for a positive neutralist line and friendly relations with the communist states the party is committed to a policy of creating three more states out of the existing regions three in number and it therefore sees the recent decision by the nigerian parliament to establish a fourth midwest region as a triumph of its policy curiously enough it was the ncnc which under dr azikiwes leadership spearheaded the struggle for nigerian freedom and laid the foundations of its socialist and republican traditions but under the necessities of office today finds itself fighting a rearguard action against the forces of political radicalism in the country like the social democratic parties of western europe the british labour party french socialist party the german spd etc whose dilemma it is facing todaya choice between the old capitalist enemy and the new communist ogre the ncnc is now fighting shy of nationalization of the basic industries and the establishment of a republic what with its recurrent internal crises and lack of clarity as to objectives it has ceased to enjoy that overwhelming mass appeal which made it the truly national organization in the heyday of its struggle for national freedoma fate that has met the pakistan muslim league and the sudanese umma party whose ineptitude and corruption invited a military dictatorship in their country a few years after independence to recapture the massive popular support of its agitational days the ncnc must needs establish high standards of integrity and austerity such as dr nkrumah is currently imposing on his cpp colleagues in ghana in place of the acquisitive and exhibitionist propensities of the leaders the party must no longer mistake mediocrity for moderation and must ensure that its standardbearers are not men of thermidor little men of great inheritance who are not seasoned in the struggle or attuned to the powerful forces now moving the continent of africa today many nigerians and their foreign admirers have often pointed to the size of the country as a criterion for its leadership of africa but size alone is not enough and to advance nigerias claim to african leadership she must not only have something to give to others in the sphere of goods and ideas but also she must produce great leaders frances greatness was once focussed on a louis xiv or a napoleon as indias contemporary influence in world affairs can be attributed to the greatness of her nehru in africa the struggle for independence has thrown up a number of towering personalities nassar in egypt houghuetboigny in ivory coast sekou toure in guinea jomo kenyatta in kenya nkrumah in ghana and so on has nigeria produced a dominant national figure who can be said to exceed these in greatness or who with her vast national resources behind him can assert the nigerian personality on the world stage to the extent for instance that an nkrumah has done for ghana or a mao tse tung for china many nigerians will say that dr azikiwe is the man and at one time there could have been no doubt as to the greatest african of them all but when in nigeria the people reflect their uncertainty in the multiplicity of their national leadership prime minister balewa is always mentioned along with governor general azikiwe and northern premier ahmadu bello leader of balewas party the northern peoples congress while opposition leader obafemi awolowo and the other regional premiers michael okpara for the eastern region and samuel akintola for the western region closely trail behind with diverse followerships and ideologies on top of this a sizable number of extreme radicals reject the leadership of all six and so africa does not know nigerias man of destiny just because nigerians themselves do not know him to lead people one must be able to reflect their inmost moods and interests in all parts of africa today there is an irresistible demand for independence for selfexpression for developmentan instinctive desire which some englishspeaking nationalists have described as the assertion of the african personality and the frenchspeaking africans see in terms of negritudeand it follows that no nation will be accepted as leader of contemporary africa which does not reflect this moving desire of africans everywhere to assert themselves after many centuries of imperialist degradation this mystic faith in independence has also an important corollary for many african nationalists the unity of africa and breaking down of the arbitrary barriers imposed by the th century scramble for africa by european powers it does not matter if this desire for union is seen by the realists as a mere daydream for dreams are the stuff out of which great realities are woven and in our lifetime we have seen idealist dreams about socialism and the freedom of afroasian nations realised to a marvellous degree what is more regional groupings are sprouting forth in both east and west of the continent and recent conferences in tunis monrovia addis ababa and cassablanca indicate that the idea of african unity is gaining ground all over the continent the question now is has nigeria this strong mystic faith in african unity and independence i am not sure that she does as yet at least to the degree necessary to inspire others to dare for these great ideals the popularity which countries like ghana and the united arab republic enjoy among many africans derive from their pulsating faith in the cause of african unity and independence even of african socialism thus when egypt challenged successfully the might of anglofrench imperialism over the suez canal in or ghana rushed aid to distressed guinea congo and south african nationalists she elicited the admiration of ardent nationalists everywhere who wish quickly to redress the wrongs which theoretical oppositional elements are being systematically repressed in all three regions through the agency of the customary courts and denial of state patronage while the freedom of speech is nullified by the men of means who can fool and mislead the people through their control of the organs of public opinion moreover the big monopolies have made nonsense of personal freedom by their control of the organs of employment and entertainment fixing their own prices and influencing the law in their sole interest it is true that independence has brought increased prosperity to the governmentariansthe ministers contractors senior civil servants and their dependentsbut the vast majority of the people live in a background of dismal and abject poverty born to a regime of endless night this squandering of national values has had the worst effect among the youth who forever see promise mocked by performance and look in vain for any systematic revival of national culture or for the rationalisation of foreign techniques in order to usher increased wellbeing for the people yet nigerialarge rich radianthas a great destiny for in its illimitable space thought and things can develop and this slumbering giant is likely some day to startle the world in an age in which the problems of africa dominate international politics rupture in labors ranks much of the civil_rights progress that has been achieved in recent years can be attributed to the effective cooperation of jewish and negro antidiscrimination agencies these groups together with the support of key trade union officials are largely responsible for the passage of fair employment legislation in eighteen states they are the effective force behind the drive for open occupancy in housing they have backed attempts to implement the u s supreme courts school desegregation decision and they have given their time money and moral support to the students involved in the movement yet the fact is that the negro jewish civil_rights coalition now faces disruption a dissolution that seems symptomatic of the worsening relations between white and negro liberals in general the winds of change sweeping africa are also stirring the surfaces of negro life in america they are setting events in motion which seem to be taking the american negro into increasingly militant and uncharted courses of action what white liberals often regard as progress negroes increasingly have come to reject as mere tokenism and correspondingly many white liberals have begun to regard negro militancy as racist selfseekingthe first cracks in the negrojewish civil_rights coalition appeared after the formation of the negro american labor council an organization of negro trade unionists founded two years ago by a philip randolph president of the brotherhood of sleeping car porters and sole negro member of the aflcio executive council the nalc has emerged as a most outspoken critic of token progress in race relations within the labor movement while several jewish trade union leaders and two important jewish labor agenciesthe jewish labor committee and the american jewish committees national labor servicemore and more have been placed in the position of defending the official line of organized labor that the unions have made substantial progress in civil_rights job equality and related issues thus to the comfort and cheer of many conservative elements within the unions the creation of the nalc has served to divide longtime allies in the struggle for civil_rights on july seventyfive negro trade unionists met in new york city at the request of a philip randolph to discuss the problems which confront negroes in the labor movement and those which face the negro union leaders within the negro community in the course of his long career randolph had made several previous attempts to build a mass organization rooted in the negro working class the most notable of which was the famed march on washington movement that resulted in an executive order from president franklin d roosevelt in to establish the wartime fepc he was unsuccessful however along with frank crosswaith and othersin developing a more permanent organization under the name of the negro labor committee the principal difficulty being the lack in that period of a sizable and firm base of negro union members but as herbert northrup among others has shown large numbers of negroes entered unions through the world war ii labor shortages and the postwar economic boom the result is that today any negro labor organization has as a potential base some million negroes who are now members of the aflcio moreover a growing number of negroes hold posts in labor organizations both large and small and participate regularly in union conventions ironicallyin the light of subsequent eventsthe committee of seventyfive summoned in by randolph decided that what the present situation required was a permanent organization patterned after the jewish labor committee the nalc would speak for organized labor in the negro community just as the jewish labor committee did in the jewish community and in carrying on its fight for equality within the labor movement the new organization would ally itself as its jewish counterpart had done with other civil_rights organizations the committee of seventyfive called for a founding convention in a declaration which foreshadowed the tone and style of the nalc established some ten months after this first meeting we resent jim crow locals we deplore the freezeout against negroes in labor apprenticeship and training programs we disclaim the lack of upgrading and promotional opportunities for negroes we repudiate the lockout against negroes by some unions we above all reject tokenism that thin veneer of acceptance masquerading as democracy since hundreds of thousands of negroes are the victims of this hypocrisy we ourselves must seek the cure in terms of hundreds of thousands in the dimensions of a mass organization randolphs reasons for helping to establish the negro american labor council are as he presents them clearcut and logical he argues that since the trade unions are essentially urban organizations and since negroes are moving to cities in large numbers it thus follows that labors future is tied up with the future of the negro randolph emphasizes that aflcio president george meany is not a racist yet meany hasnt a sense of the urgency of the question that is necessary in the th century randolph doubts in fact if anyone except a negro can have that sense the new organization over which randolph presides is then a response to the basic need of the negro masses to have a voice of their own and as randolph firmly adds the voice of black labor is not going to be consonant with those voices that come from nonnegro sources or from negroes themselves that are nonlabor there is another side to the activities of the nalc randolph believes that his group represents the last chance of preserving the influence of organized labor in negro affairs the negro community possesses two principal mass organizations other than the political machine james z wilson notes in his important new book negro politics the labor unions and the churches in recent years however the unions have come under attack because of their discriminatory practices and organized labor has come to be viewed less as an instrument of negro militancy than as a proper object of it under these circumstances the officers of the nalc as veteran trade unionists think that their organization can save labors standing within the negro community insofar as the nalc was created by negro union staffersand not by negro workers or by rank and file union membersit might be called a middleclass organization however the most serious economic consideration behind its existence is the plight of the negro worker economists are given to treating unemployment in the united states as troublesome pockets of an expanding economy but to negro workers these pockets are a sea of quicksand sucking them down to extinction according to official labor department figures nonwhites comprise a full per cent of all the currently unemployed this figure includes puerto ricans as well as negroes but the departments statistics for the past winter also show that the negro unemployment rate is almost twice as high as the rate of white unemployment per cent as against per cent for whites further an urban league survey of unemployment among negroes in cities reveals that the percentage of the negro work force unemployed is frequently twice to three times that of the total unemployment rate thus in chicago where the total unemployment rate is per cent the percentage of negro jobless is in louisville kentucky the total is per cent while the corresponding figure for negroes is per cent in pittsburgh the figures are as against per cent in new york city as against per cent these statistics also suggest why with much less urgency by the white american community than by the negro in st louis there are unemployed negroes out of a total of jobless in gary indianamore strikingly out of a total of in detroit out of a total of but even when he has a job the black workers position is far from enviable in the median wage of the negro male worker was only per cent as much as that of the white worker as against randolph comments wryly when a negro worker goes into the market as a consumer he cannot presume to pay only per cent for comparable goods and services purchased by white workers the fact is negroes pay relatively much higher prices similarly white women averaged a year while negro women who it should be added are more often the breadwinners of the familyonly earned various staff members of the urban league all believe discrimination to be the main cause of negro unemployment and they all feel that trade unions have a lot to answer for in this regard shelton granger executive director of the leagues cleveland branch puts it succinctly rate of unemployment high rate of discrimination higher major offenders are banks insurance companies retail outlets and building trades unions marvin e jones vocational services secretary of the baltimore urban league insists that until unions and employers cease to discriminate by race thus presenting the opportunity for negroes to participate in apprenticeable trades management training programs etc permanent relief is inevitable for the unskilled worker though this last point may be overstated the fact remains that the position of the negro worker is steadily deteriorating in manufacturing negroes have been confined by and large to the semiskilled and unskilled jobs often these were dirty jobs that white workers did not want yet now because of the drop in the number of manufacturing jobs due in turn to the recession and the encroachment of automation competition for all kinds of workincluding semi and unskilled jobsis considerably more intense than it has been for some time in this situation the negro competes at a great disadvantage take for example the building tradesone of the few areas where the work force is expanding secretary of labor arthur j goldberg recently advocated that the aflcios building and construction trades department develop a steppedup apprenticeship training program he pointed out that if we are to fulfill our needs in the construction field during the next ten years we will have to produce about million additional skilled craftsmen here assuredly is a potential field of employment for negro workers yet under present practices they are all but barred from it the naacp estimates that less than one per cent of the apprentices in the construction industry throughout the united states are negro even in the relatively liberal state of new york the proportion of negroes in the building trades apprenticeship programs during the last ten years has gone up exactlyfrom to per cent julius thomas urban league director of industrial relations reports that in out of major cities the league did not find a single negro apprentice there was one negro apprentice electrician in each of four cities and one plumbing apprentice in five throughout the cities surveyed the urban league found a total of roughly negro apprenticesamong all fields its difficult says thomas to encourage a negro youngster to take an interest in apprenticeship training when it takes us three years to get one negro electrician hired in the nations capital roy wilkins of the naacp has remarked that given a continuation of present rates of advance it will take negroes years or until the year to secure equal participation in skilledcraft training and employment but thomas adds unless we get that training were in for becoming permanent wards of the richest country in the world the merger of the afl and the cio in achieved very little to alleviate these conditionsor so many negroes believewe have not realized says dr james m nabrit jr president of howard university in this combination of the afl and the cio what we had hoped for in the labor movement randolph expresses the feelings of many negroes when he says that unless the aflcio can be shaken loose from the position it now holds negro youth has no future the question is can the nalc do the job perhaps this question is best answered by illustrating the power which the nalc seems able to wield secretary goldberg in february of this year accepted an invitation to speak at a washington d c conference sponsored by the nalc the day he was scheduled to speak turned out to be an extremely busy one for the secretary so he suggested that william wirtz his undersecretary and a former law partner of adlai stevenson would be happy to substitute nalc leaders however said that they would have the secretary of labor or no one goldberg showed up president kennedy was also careful enough of the sensibilities involved to send the conference his greetings although by normal political standards such as attendance the meeting was not a success in contrast the aflcio not only did not send greetings or a representative but pointedly refused to send even an observer from its civil_rights department it cannot be said however that the nalc has won widespread support among negro workers its growth so far has failed to match the expectations of randolph and his followers the organization claims a membership of and a rundown of the various unions to which nalc vice presidents ber longmost of them are paid functionariesindicates that these members are drawn from the auto workers the steelworkers international union of electrical workers hotel restaurant retail clerks district of the retail wholesale department store union the brotherhood of sleeping car porters the longshoremen and the teamsters nalc chapters have been established in most of the major industrial centers of the north chicago new york pittsburgh youngstown these chapters function in a variety of ways which again serves to illustrate certain of the nalcs strengths and weaknesses the detroit chapter called the trade union leadership council is with members the largest and most active group in the nalc it is almost exclusively political and as one might expect largely concerned with the affairs of the united auto workers one of the tulc critics declares when a slate for union offices is drawn up especially in the uaw its just about got to be cleared with the tulc but there hasnt been any action aimed at discrimination or any effort made to bust through barriers erected by the building trades to negro employment the chicago nalc a chapter of some which is less fully oriented toward the activity of a single union has tried mainly to get a few negro youngsters out of the vocational schools trained in buildingtrade skills training is obtained outside the building trades regularly endorsed washburn school for apprentices negro nonunion skilled tradesmen do the teaching then if youngsters are rejected because of color we build up the record mobilize public opinion and prepare the way for a breakinwe hope the new york city groupanother chapter that draws from a wide variety of unionsengages mainly in fundraising activities the nalc has bypassed the usual union structure to recruit members and to ask for support it cannot or feels that it cannot appeal to union executive organs for support financial or otherwise as both the jewish civil_rights agencies and the naacp do it has turned instead to the negro churcheswith what response it is difficult to determine one thing however is clear the nalc cannot as yet mount the kind of communitywide offensive against job discrimination that a group of ministers recently did in philadelphia by conducting selective boycotts to force companies to open up hiring and upgrade negro workers why has the nalc failed to achieve the status and power that its founders were so confident it could have according to one active member of the organization it has been bugged from the start by confusion as to its role the labor secretary of the naacp for example vigorously performs many of the functions that might be thought to be the special province of a group like the nalc randolph however argues that the trouble stems from a lack of funds to carry on a nationwide systematic organizing campaign and from the intimidation of negro unionists by white leaders still others believe that the fault has been the lack of guidance from the national office the absence of program and direction one white opponent of the nalc says that it doesnt fight cases doesnt try to break in and doesnt send in complaints to the aflcio civil_rights department many other criticisms have been made of the nalc on the one hand its leaders have been called uncle toms one labor leader asserts that the nalc is a creature of functionaries appointed by white elected leaders to placate or to serve as channels to negro members and on the other hand george meany has told randolph at the february aflcio executive council meeting youve been doing a job outside the labor movement not in cooperation with us it has also been charged that the nalc is a racist caucus and that one of its prime goals is the election and appointment of negroes to union posts if its leaders succeed in building a powerful and militant mass organization presumably they will be able to maintain their position of power within the rapidly changing negro community the nalcs answer to its critics is perhaps best summarized by herbert hill labor secretary of the naacp who has worked closely with the new organization since its inception hill argues that the nalc had a choice of degenerating into an apologist for the labor movement within the negro community or of pursuing a vigorous role it did not want to compete with other organizations to give more awards to george meany it is this vigor hill feels that is resented by aflcio leaders and by the spokesmen of the jewish labor committee and the national labor service of the american jewish committee the dispute between the nalc on the one side and these two jewish labor agencies on the other has many ramifications the jlc was originally founded in long after jews had won recognition for their important role in the building of the american la bor movementand first served as a rescuerelief operation to aid jewish trade unionists and socialists in escaping from nazism and stalinism from the beginning the jlc has eschewed internal union politics altogether except possibly in predominantly jewish unions and only after world war ii did it become really active in the field of civil_rights like other jewish defense agencies the jlc operates on the assumption that the problem of bigotry and inequality is indivisible its technique is to place its staff people in key cities where they organize local labor committees to combat discrimination today the jlc has ten field representatives heading various state and city labor council antidiscrimination efforts william becker for example the jlc official in san francisco is generally credited with being the prime mover in californias adoption of a state fep law two years ago the american jewish committees national labor service also voids internal union politics but operates in a slightly different fashion from the jlc it was for example instrumental in getting both the afl and cio to develop their own fulltime civil_rights departments the ajcs national labor service also performs an educational function providing unions with civil_rights literature and advice in time the jlc and the national labor servicedespite their protests to the contrarycame to be considered by many white unionists as the voice of pronegro labor within the aflcio one source of the current conflict between the nalc and these two jewish agencies can be found in this confusion but a more immediate cause was an accident of history the appointment of charles zimmerman the jlcs chief civil_rights spokesman as chairman of the aflcio civil_rights committee just at a time when negro militancy was on the rise one jewish civil_rights professional explains this particular development in the following way among professionals in intergroup relations the jews are the longest in the field the most skilled and most experienced negro professionals resent this negroes have developed their own leadership and they dont want whitesjews or anybody elseto be in the forefront of the civil_rights fight deep bitterness now exists on both sides negro unionists have criticized the aflcio civil_rights department for inviting leaders of the jlc and the director of the ajcs national labor service harry fleischman to participate in trade union civil_rights conferences while not inviting either the nalc or the naacp in the past fleischman zimmerman who recently resigned from his post with the aflcio after serving four years and emmanuel muravchik field director of the jlcs antidiscrimination department have worked closely with randolph on civil_rights matters and jlc staff members in some instances even helped to organize nalc chapters but this cooperation broke down within the nalcs first year the jlc says one nalc activist is too eager to see progress where it aint he cites a press release based on a jlc survey hailing as a year of race relations progress within the unions there was no survey and not much progress he believesand he is not alone in this beliefthat the two jewish agencies are more interested in protecting their relationship with aflcios top leaders than they are in furthering civil_rights within the labor movement many jewish trade unionists are antagonizedand somewhat puzzledby the point frequently made in nalc statements that only negroes are entitled and able to speak for the negroes this puts off many jewish unionists who otherwise might be sympathetic to the nalc theyll tell me about discrimination asks a jewish trade union leader yet the jewish labor committee is most frequently cited by nalc spokesmen as a comparable organization and as a justification for the negros right to organize a committee of his own though many outside observers believe that both the jlc and the i ajcs national labor service have defended labors record of progress in combating discrimination much more vigorously than is necessary muravchik and fleischman argue that more can be done to promote the cause of civil_rights in the un ions by combining praise with crit icism this attitude exposes them to attack herbert hill for example calls them apologists for racism fleischman replies that hills approach discourages good guys from pushing civil_rights why do it at all if all youre going to get is blame for tokenism anyway they ought to get credit for things done i dont see this as a whitewash of labor racists one wonders if this growing antagonism between the jewish and negro labor camps is a precursor of strained relations between the larger jewish and negro defense agencies and ultimately between the two minority communities in general the deterioration in negrojewish relations can be found in many areas beyond the narrow confines of labors civil_rights circle negro ghettoes are spilling over into older jewish neighborhoods negro small businessmen are competing with jewish businessmen for the same customers aspiring negro politicians are striving against jewish politicians for leadership in minority group areas though conflict seems inevitable and natural as the urban scene changes some jews have been guilty of racial bias that has been newly precipitated in the white community even among people who were previously convinced of their freedom from it by aggressive negro demands for full equality and there has also been a revival of antisemitism among negroes enough to cause some of the negro press to cater to it occasionally it may well be that what james baldwin has called the negros naked and unanswerable hatred of all whites will come in this difficult period to center on the jew whatever its ramifications the split between the jewish and negro elements in labor is likely to widen until the position of the negro worker dramatically improves such improvement depends of course upon a number of external factors one is the effectiveness of the kennedy administration in enforcing the nodiscrimination clause in government contracts in this connection the immediate response of the administration to naacp demands for investigation into discrimination at the marietta georgia plant of republic aviation is clearly a good sign but even administration support will not be adequate unless drastic action alleviates chronic unemployment and prevents discriminatory unemployment generally there is also a pressing need on the part of organized labor for strong and imaginative action against discriminationparticularly against barriers in the building trades george meanys offer personally to recruit qualified negro apprentices in order to break discrimination among the washington d c construction unions was a gesture in this direction but so far it has proved to be no more than that another social consequence of continued discrimination is certain the further spread of the black nationalism bewailed by white and negro civil_rights spokesmen alike randolph attacks the chauvinist aspects of black nationalism in nearly all of his speeches but his statements also emphasize the conditions which give rise to such chauvinism the basic remedy for black nationalismwhich can become a danger to social peace as white nationalism is a danger to social peaceis the abolition of white nationalism which expresses itself in lynchings mob law disenfranchisement segregation and discrimination randolph does not believe that negro trade unionists are under the influence of the black muslims the current extreme exponents of black nationalism within the negro community but it is clear that the movement already wields its strongest appeal among the unorganized and voiceless negro masses there are signs that the muslims have already begun to exert strong pressure on the nalc and its leadership this pressure in turn partly explains the intensity of the nalcs attack against the unions for in any confrontation with the muslims the nalc will be at a great disadvantage until such time as it can defend trade unionism without having to apologize for the adverse effect on some union practices on negro life in america the world and a threeyearold there is a little boy of my acquaintance who is very happy and very friendly hes the normal type threeyearold with all the afflictions common to that age group he is deaf when he doesnt want to hear an order he sometimes sasses his mother and occasionally throws temper tantrums that last until broken up by several smart slaps to the rear he delights in daredevil stunts that make his mother quake with terror but all these things are normal for little boys and not to be taken too seriously the important things are that he is very normal and very dear to his parents and like the little girl in the nursery rhyme when hes good hes very very good he will sometimes stop in the middle of a game to say i love you mommy he loves an audience and will entertain them with several catchy tunes from a tv nursery school by counting from to saying his a b cs up to f and pledging allegiance to the flag he drops everything to watch the tv commercials many of which he knows by heart he loves to brush his teeth but usually eats most of the toothpaste and he makes you think of cherubim when he sings jesus loves me even though a few moments before he pierced all ears in the vicinity with an unearthly shriek for no apparent reason all very normal and as i said very friendly when his mother or grandmother takes him to the supermarket he says hi to everyone and everything on the street people dogs and trees the reactions of the humans are varied and interesting most even those in a great hurry pause smile and say hi gently some speak vaguely as though its an interruption they dont exactly resent but dont exactly relish either others look down for he isnt very tall suck in their mouths and hurry past when this happens the little boy looks puzzled for a few seconds but being three years old quickly forgets in saying the next hi because hes curious about everything one day he will ask why those people dont speak and his mother will have to try as best she can to explain shell have to tell him that he represents in miniature a minority group hated by some for the color of their skins and the size makes no difference that the people who wont speak to him here are representative of those in other parts of the country who throw eggs at sixyearolds for the crime of wanting the education their parents pay taxes for but she wont tell him the way these things affect her she wont tell him that the sight of children and old people mistreated by mobs fills her with a helpless rage that breeds hate and the desire to hurt them as they hurt these innocents who are aspiring to be treated as free and equal humans but she knows that these people should be pitied more than those with the most dreadful ailments known to medical science for the disease of bigotry corrodes the soul and so she is ashamed to hate so much and profess to be a christian for she must be able to guide herself before trying to direct another life she wont tell him these things instead shell tell him they are fortunate to live in a section of the country where any person with intelligence has a good chance of being able to use it shell tell him of the fine school she attended that he will soon attend where all students are given the same opportunities to learn and the same punishments when they dont try hard enough where they all eat in the same cafeteria and use the same water fountains and rest rooms where the qualified members of his race turn up on lady of the lockup he steel looks softer v cty under a coat of fresh it jl paint but steel is still steel each cellblock is done in a pastel feminine color there is a pink room a couple of blue rooms green rooms a yellow room and a gray room but steel is still steel bars are still bars and you cant see anything through the side windows but a brick wall on some days puddles form on the roof between the windows and the brick wall and the girls know its raining outside and on some days the afternoon sun comes slanting in through the bars and the girls know the weather is fine all this steel around you kind of seeps in a thin woman with sunken cheeks and a boyish haircut said one day recently and when you cant see nothing but a brick wall that gets to you too committed on a vagrancy charge she stared thoughtfully at the ranks of gray bars that closed in around her im getting out this afternoon she said im getting out nearby jail matron geneva reardon stood with a big key ring in her hand and smiled a warm open smile geneva reardon understands how little things like sunshine and cigarets and candy and lipstick can become very big to a woman in the davidson county jail she knows that sometimes just having somebody around who will listen to your troubles gets to be big she knows because she spends eight or nine hours a day six days a week in the house of steel on the seventh floor of the davidson county courthouse she listens to a lot of troubles and often the troubles bring tears trouble gets them here she says in a voice thats soft and kind of throaty a lot of them are young and scared and pathetic a lot of them come from broken homes and never had a chance everybody calls her miss geneva her hair is gray her color tan but she has found that trouble seldom makes color distinctions hers is a manysided job a lot of it involves supplying prisoners both male and female white and negro with the things they need from the courthouse commissary like cigarets and stationery combs and razor blades candy bars soft drinks and ice cream she often calls their families she calls their lawyers she tries to find answers for questions like when is my trial coming up and my babys been sick miss geneva can you find out how he is and how can i make bond she handles their money for them each withdrawal from personal effects is replaced by a receipt bearing the prisoners signature sometimes she dips into her own pocket recently a woman in her fifties was jailed on a bad check charge she had come up from florida and didnt have a dime when the case came up for trial the judge dismissed it but freedom left her stranded miss geneva slipped her a dollar for a meal you can eat across the street she said then you come back while the woman was gone the matron made arrangements for her with travelers aid two days later she was on her way back home they send me letters and cards she says every once in awhile i hear from one of the boys whos gone to prison from here one time a woman invited me to come and visit her in california then one day she called me long distance she said when you come out miss geneva dont tell my family where you met me they dont know ive been in trouble but i dont plan to go ive been to california miss geneva figured the last thing she would ever do was work in a jail born and reared in nashville she attended a catholic school took a business course at tennessee ai state university and worked for years for two doctors who shared a downtown office eventually both of her employers died and she was out of a job when sheriff leslie jett was elected and started shuffling personnel some of genevas friends in the courthouse put in a word for her and she was hired she went to work last sept at first i was afraid to come up here she says id never been around a jail before i had no idea what it would be like but i found out it is altogether different from what i thought it would be already she has glimpsed the tragic and the sordid sides of life behind bars we had one boy who had a new baby he had never seen and he was going to prison his wife brought the baby to jail he sat on a bench and said i want to hold the baby she put it in his arms he held the baby and cried this same prisoner she adds had engaged in a socalled kangaroo court in jail which involved brutality and sexual perversion among a small group of prisoners sometimes there are a dozen women in jail charged with all sorts of crimes from drunkenness and vagrancy to forgery bouncing checks assault and murder the drunks are usually repeaters margaret is an example she turns up about once a month one day recently she sat at the long metal table in the cell for white women dragging on a cigaret and bemoaning the injustice of it all they said i was drunk she declared i was drinking buttermilk they put me in for being drunk on buttermilk she wore a blackandwhite checked dress her hair was stringy her face puffy her eyes bleary and sad now miss geneva there she said shes sweet shell treat you right nearby sat two girls awaiting trial for forgery there was ann thin and pale hair brittle from too much reddish dye and too little shampoo she said she was but looked much younger were something special said ann who boasts of a long juvenile record we got big headlines when they pulled us in her partner linda who also said she was seemed quieter more thoughtful her hair was dark brown and she wore a tight black dress that bared her shoulders forgerys no good she said not when you get a long time behind bars at the moment the girls shared the coveted pink room a cellblock containing four bunks with steel walls painted a bright flamingo their personal things were scattered around and they seemed right at home nobodys gonna get this cell said linda i figure well be in here a good long while yet our trial doesnt come up till september and i dont see how we can make bond they promised me theyre going straight when they serve their time said miss geneva softly thats right miss geneva said linda we aint gonna do nothin more leastways not here in nashville the matron produced a batch of mail and handed a letter to ann i got a boy friend in the cell right next door said ann he writes to me every day this jails all right if you like it interjected margaret but me i dont like it miss geneva has found a formula of her own for getting along with prisoners kindness she says always works as an example she cites the case of a yearold girl who was awaiting trial for murder she came in sullen hostile and demanding preferential treatment i went out of my way to be nice says the matron in about a week we were getting along just fine i think it shamed her last christmas the male prisoners chipped in and presented her with a fivepound box of candy and one of the women knitted her a white stole i like my job she says thoughtfully i feel like im helping people who need help henry armstrong ii t was friday night and a few pugilistic hopefuls were working out in the ringside athletic club at a easton avenue upstairs over a good will industries store a punching bag made a thunderous noise a muscular youth rhythmically skipped rope a traditional exercise for training fighters in a foot roped square an agile young fellow with wide shoulders shadow boxed cutting an imaginary foe to ribbons with his fancy footwork feinting and darting punches he stopped abruptly hi champ he said with awesome respect to the man in the white sport shirt who walked up and leaned against the ropes appraisingly the man in the white sport shirt was henry armstrong who was serving gratuitously as athletic director of the ringside club a little over years ago he was one of the great fighters of the modern era and the only man ever to hold three world championships at the same time he grew up in st louis henry armstrong was now though he didnt look nearly that old he weighed around which was a good pounds over his fighting weight it was years since he had crawled through the ropes to face an opponent his fair weather friends and the good time charleys and the crowds that cheered him were gone and so was the he had made in the ring when he was a conquering hero to the faithful oldtimers who knew him in his prime and to the youngsters who have heard or read about his legendary ring prowess he is still the champ but there is another designation which is much more important to him now he is the rev henry armstrong ten years ago long after his fighting days were over he turned to god and was ordained a baptist minister of the gospel since then he has preached from hundreds of pulpits has addressed numberless organizations in his evangelism he has been particularly interested in building youth physically and spiritually believing that god has his hand in many things henry armstrong feels that his great record in winning three boxing crowns may have been part of his longrange planning it made him an idol gave him great influence with youth ergo the triple championship set up a platform for his evangelism among the young henry armstrong was a youth himself just on the threshold of his amazing career when he left st louis more than years ago the decades that followed were turbulent and epic and he did not come home again to stay until about a year and a half ago his return then was almost unnoticed and just as quiet has been his sojourn with mrs velma armstrong a st louisan who is his second wife they live in a modest duplex at a penrose underway right now at the ringside athletic club on easton avenue is a unique experiment in the combined religious and athletic approach to youth the gymnasium was dedicated as a church it will be a gymnasium with the usual bag punching rope skipping sparring and such during the week but on sunday the spacious gymnasium is filled with folding chairs and services are held it is my own idea said henry armstrong and much good may come of it i am a sports figure and i am trying to exert a good influence on youth in the sports field there is nothing more appropriate than that there should be a church in a gymnasium for this purpose it could develop into a great work for christ though okley clark owner of the ringside club and the rev mr armstrong are both baptists the gymnasium services are open to all creeds and colors it was in the cotton country near columbus miss that henry armstrong got his first look at the world on dec he was the eleventh of children in a sharecropper family named jackson he was called henry jackson after his father he was little but powerful durable and determined the boll weevil and the flood waters of the tom bigbee river discouraged the jacksons and sent them migrating north to st louis when henry was they settled around the papin and chouteau sector west of jefferson and henry went to the toussaint louverture school the main recreation of the neighborhood kids was fighting and though henry was inclined toward peace and nonaggression he had to do more than his share of scrapping because he was little he compensated by going in for body building and in his basement on josephine street accumulated an assortment of exercising machines as he grew up he worked as a bowling alley pinboy haunted the gym of the old pine street ymca which turned out many a fine boxer he later attended vashon high school graduated in l i years was poet laureate of his class an excellent student with ambition he wanted to go to college and amount to something he had notions of being a doctor but his mother and grandmother always wanted him to be a preacher when he graduated from high school in he got a job with a railroad section gang laying tracks at carondelet and then one day a wayward wind blew a sports page his way with a headline that announced kid chocolate had received a purse for defeating a singer in rounds what fabulous pay for minutes work thats for me henry announced im going away and become a champion and when i come back here ill be riding in a big shiny limousine just like kid chocolate he went to pittsburgh a good boxing town with a couple of fighter friends but he soon came rolling back in a beatenup old nash amid the jeers of his acquaintances he had been knocked out in his first professional fight when he entered the ring underfed and exhausted it was the only time in his whole career that he was put down for the count he won a second fight but the pittsburgh campaign which he fought under the name of melody jackson was an economic and artistic flop humiliated he and an older fighter friend harry armstrong sneaked off hopped a freight hoboed their way eventually to los angeles then regarded as the land of milk and honey by okies and other hardup folks henry started all over again as an amateur which meant he had to change his name to keep his oro record in pittsburgh from being detected so henry melody jackson became henry armstrong he took the last name from his longtime pal and sometime trainer and fellow adventurer harry armstrong he learned fighting could be a hungry unremunerative vocation he also learned what it was like to be a human chattel his first manager tom cox paid for his contract sold him later to wirt ross for ross in a few years sold him to eddie mead for the money being put up by actors a jolson and george raft henry got none of the profits of his sale after amateur fights of which he won he turned pro in and rapidly became one of the great fighters of modern times he was a formidable fighting machine a paragon of endurance he delivered a ripping storm of blows an incessant barrage from the time a bout started until it ended sports writers soon gave him such nicknames as hammering henry hurricane hank the human buzz saw the human dynamo perpetual motion and homicide henry he scored knockouts in his professional career alone between and he won straight fights he fought over times altogether and were title bouts he earned more than in he was elected to boxings exclusive hall of fame he started out in the featherweight pounds class and then successfully invaded the lightweight and welterweight divisions he had to knock over petey sarron oct and a couple of others before he got clear claim to the featherweight title he won the welterweight title from barney ross on may and the lightweight title from lou ambers on august henry armstrong was at the peak he was the unprecedented triple crown holder the toast of fightdom he remembered his mothers prediction at the time ot his birth that he would some day be the big cheese of the family that the whole world would know her boy and she also had said some day hell be a preacher yes he would be a preacher some day but not yet first he had to go through an agonizing or deal that would make him humble and suppliant he had hardly reached the top of the mountain he had hardly glimpsed the world at his feet when he began going down the other side in a return match lou ambers turned the tables won a slashing victory over armstrong on august and regained his title young and strong fritzie zivic of pittsburgh on october defeated armstrong and snatched the welter title from his faltering hands zivic beat him even worse scoring a technical knockout in the th in a second bout january henry armstrong was washed up after one of the most dazzling of all ring careers because his eyes had been gashed badly he was warned not to fight any more but he had been prodigal he needed money he hit the comeback trail and made a good chunk of dough but there were still too many parties there were bad investments too and he didnt have it any more he could lick secondraters yes but the old speed was gone the boys at the top were too good for him now on february he got a pounding from a palooka named chester slider he knew that he was through it had happened to many another idolized champion the fame the fortune were too much henry armstrong reached bottom in and then in a mom ment of despair began reading the bible and turned to god here was another kind of comeback a better kind he was invited to preach in a pulpit and he did he preached again and again and then one day he was ordained a minister of the gospel in the morning star baptist church of los angeles from then on some called him the champ and some the rev henry armstrong the stormiest protestants the negro and his whole baptist fellowship had their beginnp nings in america in stormy weather the forceful wind of ii exploitation lifted him out of a benighted environment in africa and brought him against his will to this land of cultural disparity the colonists found the labor of the american indian unprofitable and that of the white indentured servants inadequate much cheap labor was needed here for the american virgin soil was looked upon as the land of promise for raw materials to produce new commodities of commerce negroes made their appearance in america in years before the first baptist church was organized by roger williams the controversy over slavery was already at fever heat and the colonies were debating as to whether it should be sanctioned rhode island began to regulate the importation of negroes and define their rights in in that same year the first baptist church had a division vedder states that complete records of the fellowship are lacking and all that is i certain is the controversy began and continued until it reached the acute stage in thus baptists from the very beginning seem to have multiplied by dividing the people called baptists also set sail in america on rough seas nowhere else in the world has negro slavery exercised such a large influence upon the christian church as in the united states all of the great american churches grew up in more or less intimate contact with the institution of slavery and all of them were of necessity greatly affected by it the most important of the many schisms which have occurred among the american churches were those growing out of negro slavery while some of the most difficult problems facing the churches today are due to the negro and the bitter conflicts which have arisen in the churches because of him coupled with these superimposed conflicts were cross currents within the free fellowship of the churches the early historical local independency of baptist churches in america tended to impede the formation of any general organization until in a general missionary convention was formed to permit baptists to express themselvs in terms of missionary activities in the state conventions in the south withdrew to organize the southern baptist convention in the northern baptist convention was organized a delegated body under whose direction the many agencies of the baptists in the north and west now operate tossed and driven it is understandable that a slave people should be caught in the middle of every vicious circle without much voice or power of decision during the early years of baptist history in america it was after the baptists had spread to virginia that negroes won consideration as part of this movement that had experienced slow growth up to the beginning of the eighteenth century in general the negroes were followers of the baptists in virginia and after a while as they permitted colored men to preach the great majority of them went to hear preachers of their own color george liele the earliest negro baptist preacher in georgia was brought from virginia by his master henry sharp around presumably he was associated with the church in which sharp was a deacon and matthew moore was pastor the church gave liele the liberty to preach and his master gave him the time he was later freed and gave full time to preaching up and down the savannah river and in south carolina liele was known to have preached in the first negro baptist church in america at silver bluff s c this church was given support by sharp and a planter by the name george galpin when the british came to savannah the silver bluff church seems to have been abandoned but it was revived after peace came in under the direction of reverend jesse peter who as a slave had remained in south carolina during the period of the revolution jesse peter and a white minister abraham marshall organized what was probably the first negro church in georgia in a barn near brampton where andrew bryan won through lieles influence had been preaching in this congregation began building a church in the suburbs of savannah in in the meantime baptist churches were being established in virginia north carolina and south carolina the owners of slaves were beginning to discover that their slaves were of increasing value to them after becoming religious it is difficult for many to accept the fact that josiah bishop and william lemon performed duties as pastors of white baptist churches in virginia and joseph willis a negro minister licensed in became the organizer of the white and colored baptist association in louisiana in it was in the baptist churches especially that the negroes shared with the white men the fellowship of the gospel the reasons for the close relationship in this church were the same as those which prevailed in the methodist denomination with the added attraction of free congregational polity the latter feature permitted the negroes to organize and govern their own churches and so provided them with a practical equality in religious affairs even in natchez miss a baptist church had members of whom only were white with many exceptions to the general rule prior to the great rift in over the slave issue the slaves as a part of the household of their masters worshiped in the same churches after the rift between the northern and southern elements of the baptist denomination nobody was sure what to do with the negroes and they were too handicapped to do much for themselves the negro churches were certainly shaped in iniquity if not conceived in sin confused and rejected by the proclaimers of their faith negro christians could not be too sure of the rock upon which their church was built to this day many leaders refer to the negro churches as a protest movement and others refer to it as a sore on the body of christ to relieve their plight the board of missions of the triennial convention continued to send missionaries and established for the training of leadership among negroes such schools as morehouse and spelman in atlanta ga shaw in raleigh n c leland in louisiana benedict in columbia s c virginia union in richmond va and jackson college in jackson miss the last is now a state school southern baptists continued to give aid to negroes and it was customary in all of their annual meetings to hear reports on the instruction of the colored population even during the civil war their efforts have not ceased until this day they support many training institutes contribute more than negroes themselves to the american baptist seminary in nashville and within the last decade have begun admitting negroes to southern baptist seminaries a new unit evolves there had been organized missions among negroes as early as when the african baptist missionary society was inaugurated at richmond virginia it sent lott carey to africa with a regularly organized baptist church of which he was pastor it contributed its means through the american baptist union a northern white organization until from to it contributed through the southern baptist convention white because white southern baptists divided from white northern baptists in on account of the slavery question solomon cosby and w w colly were sent out by the african baptist missionary society of richmond virginia through the southern baptist convention that was the taproot of the historic tendency of negro baptists which has persisted for more than a hundred years in national negro baptists consciousness expressed itself in organizing the american baptist missionary convention it was organized in the abyssinian baptist church of new york it was composed of the colored baptists from new england and the middle west it could not operate in slave states like the african baptist missionary society of richmond virginia which functioned through southern whites but the atmosphere was full of hope for emancipation or emigration in three years after the last meeting of the american baptist missionary convention of which we have any account he negro baptists of the south took the leading part in organizing the baptist foreign missionarv convention of the united states of america which was the first unit of the national baptist convention to avoid a volume of details regarding the mushrooming and splintering of negro baptists between and we move on to the historic background given in the preamble of the constitution of the national baptist convention usa incorporated three negro baptist organizations claiming national status exsited in the united states prior to these three organizations in their separate conventions voted to meet in atlanta georgia september and form one body for the purpose of more effectively carrying on the benevolent activities for which baptists stand the organizations so uniting were as follows the baptist foreign mission convention which up to that time had been doing missionary work on the west coast of africa the national baptist convention which had done its missionary work in the united states up to this time the national baptist educational convention which was directing its efforts in christian education among negroes in the united states from this point began the major negro bodies as we know them today rocked by internal struggles the organized activities of negro baptists were hardly launched before divisions and rebellion arose the foreign mission board had been located at richmond virginia doing business for the whole colored baptist group since its authorization by the foreign mission convention of usa in the changing of the domicile of the board from richmond va to louisville ky was the first battle on board the new baptist vessel insult was added to injury by changing also the personnel of the board the brethren in richmond refused to communicate and would not turn over deeds contracts or records in the disgruntled exmembers of the foreign mission board led in organizing the lott carey foreign missionarv convention one of their contentions was that the national baptist convention was drawing the color line although the lott carey convention was reunited to the national convention by compact in it continues to function as a separate entity most of its support is from the eastern seaboard and a few states in the midwest the majority of the pastors and most of the presidents of that body have been members of one or the other of the larger national conventions while negro baptists were seriously threatened because of the relocation of their most active board the question of convention control was pressing hard for attention if the national baptist convention of usa had been incorporated before it changed the foreign misson board fom richmond virginia to louisville kentucky the old richmond board never would have defied the parent body nor taken the lead in organizing the lott carey foreign mission convention in generally the new denomination was set up along the lines followed by the two white conventions structures were set uo and empty portfolios granted to the key personnel of the various boards in the home mission board began publishing sunday school literature later the publishing board of the national baptist convention usa was incorporated under the laws of the state of tennessee in a crisis the incorporated publishing board refused to obey the orders of the unincorporated convention which created it the courts sustained the rights of the selfperpetuating publishing board because the unincorporated convention died each time it adjourned the convention realized that all of the boards whose charters were like the publishing boards could defy the parent body and do as the board had done the convention prepared to incorporate itself in order to control its boards and retain its property the publishing board forthwith attempted to split the national baptist convention of usa to retain a group which would furnish patronage to support the selfperpetuating independent publishing board the cause of the confusion manifested at the national baptist convention is the attempt and purpose of the convention to control its publishing board located at nashville tennessee by reason of the peculiarity of the laws of tennessee this board elects its own members although for years the convention thought that by electing members in open session they really became members of the board to its great surprise in the course of time it became known that no one is a member of the publishing board unless elected by the board itself baptists left chicago in with two camps one led by r h boyd secretary of the publishing board and the other by the convention president e c morris the latter group gained charter in the district of columbia and became the incorporated baptist convention commonly today older ministers use the names boyd and morris to distinguish between the two major conventions the national baptist convention of the usa and the national baptist convention usa inc these are the grand divisions of negro baptists although the lott carey missionary society is also chartered all boards of the incorporated convention except the publishing board remained loyal however there have been minor controversies over the national training school for women and girls in lincoln heights washington d c the founder of the school the late miss nannie helen burroughs was also president of the womans auxiliary to the national baptist convention usa inc she was favorable toward permitting the convention majority control on the board managing the school which also has members from both the american and southern baptist conventions the issue has been relegated of late to low priority because of other matters involving the establishment of tenure and regulating board operations within the last twelve years the convention has added a bath house sanitarium hospital board to manage the bath house in hot springs ark now leased to a private group immediately after his election in miami fla in september j h jackson added thirteen new departments and commissions to the nine divisions already provided by the convention naturally there has been confusion as to areas of responsibility caused by the inevitable overlapping assignments recently a small committee was sent to africa to do an investigation with regard to the purchase of land this special committee is separate and distinct from the foreign mission board the oldest and most virile unit of the denomination which is directed by c c adams corresponding secretary of philadelphia pa where the home office is now located the current deadlock in the incorporated body is due to differences over administrative policy and the tenure of the convention president section iv article of the constitution as revised in reads a president of this convention shall not be eligible for reelection after he has served four consecutive terms until at least one year has elapsedthis constitution was declared null and void on the opening day of the seventyseventh annual session in louisville ky in september before the messengers were enrolled marchers invaded the auditorium from the streets to the tune of music men were jailed opposing officers kicked out and litigants who contested the action in court expelled the resulting unrest was the basis of the groundswell that produced the taylor team and the spectacle at the philadelphia convention in a letter was sent out on august over the signature of m l king sr pastor of the ebenezer baptist church atlanta ga father of martin_luther_king jr we are engaged in a mighty crusade in our national baptist convention this crusade through our candidate dr gardner taylor looks forward to restoring our denominations harmony unifying our parentbody and auxiliaries behind kingdom objectives committing the convention to real leadership in civil_rights struggle providing regular itemized financial accounting to all pastors reestablishing a system of tenure after open refusal to permit an election by roll call of states the delegates remained in convention hall in philadelphia on september and a fair election was conducted with for the incumbent j h jackson pastor of olivet baptist church chicago ill and votes for gardner c taylor pastor of concord baptist church brooklyn n y what is the present state of affairs philadelphia courts have disclaimed jurisdiction in the matter because the convention is chartered in the district of columbia on january in hot springs ark jacksons group issued a declaration of the independence of the national taylor team the national baptist convention usa incorporated and its board of directors will accept the fact of the independence of the national taylor team the real deadlock is over the source of authority whether the board of directors or the messengers enrolled in any annual session make the decisions for the convention this problem is aggravated by the fact that any member who says he is a baptist can register and vote in annual sessions for the fee of ten dollars big battles swell the messenger roll and help the exchequer unfortunately the struggle for office seeps down through state conventions district associations and local churches many states have two conventions enrolled annually because every state president enrolling with two hundred dollars is automatically a member of the board of directors mississippi enrolls four state conventions regularly the state conven tion presidents are also concerned about tenure and even local pastors fear that their churches may rejoice to find a method of rotation millions on board according to the listings in the yearbook of a merican churches the national baptist convention of america has members and the incorporated convention has five million these figures are based upon reports for and as of today these bodies easily boast of more than eight million souls it is widely accepted that seventy per cent of all churched negroes are baptists onethird of the baptists of the world are negroes the third largest protestant group in america is the baptist denomination among negroes being outnumbered only by the methodist church and the south baptist convention to be the largest bloc of colored protestants in america and in the world in these times when nationalism is emerging in africa kindles in negro baptist bosoms a new sense of destiny and worth being the largest group in the negro structure the titular head becomes a towering figure within and without the group hence there are no expresidents of the parent body nor of most of the auxiliaries added to the egocentricities that are common in human circles is the element of negrocentricity that is sweeping america through the kneelins sitins standins wadeins and the like many negro baptists are so busy with race that little place is left for redeeming grace stuck in midocean and casting eyes about other members of the baptist fleet are noticeable out there in the mist and foam national baptists have working relations with all of them educational projects the baptist jubilee advance the baptist world alliance and the national and world councils of churches with one exception the southern baptists who do not affiliate with national or world councils these relationships are more nominal than vital as to the national baptist convention of america preachers of the incorporated convention cross lines in accepting churches and vice versa without strife but neither is there any sign of union in the near future as to the american and southern baptist bodies we seem to pair off against each other american baptists and negro baptists agree that southern baptists are highly bigoted negro baptists and southern baptists tend to label american baptists as being spiritually barren and american baptists and southern baptists would agree that negro baptists are sadly belated many of our large national baptist churches do affiliate with the american baptist convention since local independence is the baptist pattern only pressure from local churches will make for true progress in the direction of improved organizational procedures and wider coopthe crying need of negro baptist churches is for recruits to the christian ministry with dedication and training to keep the constituency stabbed awake at the local level yet there is some anxiety that we may lose our most promising young people en masse by too long delay heaped upon our inner contentions and the need for leadership are the multitude of new problems incidental to integration and urbanization we may keep looking within rather than without for much longer than we would like to admit in the meantime negro baptists can look forward to more sailing on a stormy sea have a future in politics leitmotiv of southern politics for some decades has been the lament that dixie has lost its voice in national party councils the prayers for deliverance from this obscurity follow ancient rituals of imprecation and gesture like a rain dance now in one of those twists which make politics ever unpredictable the prayers are about to be answeredafter a fashion the south is likely soon to return to political prominence and a southerner may well become a decisive influence in national affairs but the manner in which all this is to come about may send the southern shamans scrambling to their altars to dispatch amended petitions to the almighty for the potential savior of southern political influencealbeit not southern politicsis not a lone knight but is colored and some five million strong the souths negroes are the largest single untapped reservoir of voting strength in the nation registered and voting cohesively they can alter the course of events not only below the masondixon line but throughout the nation they can force a realignment of politics along more clearly defined liberalconservative lines and they can shatter decisively the tottering dinosaurdemocrat pterodactylrepublican coalition in congress needless to say any man who could unite and guide these potential voters would become a powerful arbiter of party platforms patronage and legislation it is too early to say that the rev martin_luther_king jr has become such a leader or even wants to but it is already certain that he is the fulcrum of the coming upheaval in southern politics it may be that he will decide as he clearly has not decided yet to enter the party hustings openly rather than to prompt from the wings or it may be that the souths white politicians many of whom are far more flexible and far less committed to the eighteenth century than is generally realized in the north will seize the initiative and provide their own leadership whoever the leader or leaders though the change is coming and the new political body will not remain headless for long the potency of an organized negro voting bloc is no untested theory of course it has been preached for years by the naacp it has been demonstrated time and again in fiercely competitive twoparty races in industrial states and even in a few southern cities such as atlanta and memphis without the negro vote in key states last fall john kennedy would not now be wearing his paperthin mantle of victory the negro vote has made scores of senators congressmen and governors vociferously civilrights conscious and it has won an amount of attention far beyond its proportionate size but not since reconstruction days when it was cynically manipulated has the negro vote counted for much in statewide races in dixie for decades its impotence could be blamed on white primaries kukluxism and lack of education even today in some of the rural southparticularly in the black belt countiesthreats violence and official footdragging present serious physical obstacles to voting by negro citizensyet the plain truth is that negroes themselves are in no small part to blame for their failure to realize their voting potential whereas the number of negroes on the souths voting lists surged dramatically in the first years after the demise of the white primary in georgia alone some registered within a few months time it soon reached a virtual plateau the net increase since is little more than this is true even though more and more of the souths negroes live in cities where they encounter little or no official opposition to registering a recent premayoralty primary registration drive in atlanta sponsored jointly by longstanding negro voter organizations and dr_kings southern christian leadership conferance fell far short of its goal despite an enormous pool of qualified negroes and the complete cooperation of the fulton county registrar in spite of this pessimistic current history there are signs that the most spectacular and significant gains in negro voting in history are in the offing for one thing the negro leadership is learning the hard lesson of organization we were naive enough one negro leader summed it up to believe that with the increased interest in civil_rights negroes would just go out and register on their own without any prodding the atlanta registration drive for instance might well have succeeded had it started earlier only after the drive was publicly announced did its leadership settle to the grinding task of setting up a block organization where it was needed most in the lower and lowermiddle income neighborhoods despite its weight in atlanta elections the negro vote thus far has been concentrated in the uppermiddle income groupswhat one negro critic labeled leading negroes as distinguished from negro leaders the experience will not be wasted however the new organization plans to remain semimobilized throughout the year and hopes to build from its newly established base this awareness of the importance of organization probably will receive more concrete recognition in the near future through a concerted southwide voterregistration drive involving dr_kings sclc the naacp and other humanrights groups a second reason for believing in a coming new wave of negro voting is the attention now being paid to the question no responsible negro leader has ever denied the value of the ballot although some perhaps have been suspicious of their more conservative white friends urgings to concentrate on voting in any case it is true that other activities have at times obscured the issue since the brown decision the naacp has been involved in a deluge of antisegregation litigation the energies of the sclc and the student movements have been drained by the timeconsuming planning and execution of nonviolent protests from lunchcounter sitins to freedom rides i have always said dr_king explained in an interview that i think one of the most significant steps the negro can take is the short walk to the voting booth yet its not a substitute for other things its not an eitheror proposition but a bothand in fact dr_king maintained that the other things have made it easier to interest the negro in the ballot box they have helped to overcome the my vote doesnt count psychology which exists among negroes because of the legacy of discrimination and slavery and segregation according to dr_king another evidence of the coming voting breakthrough is perhaps barely discernible outside the south itself where one comes over the years to appreciate the various nuances of southern oratory to the outsider current southern political speeches may sound the same as those of ten or twenty years ago but to the native they sound more moderate more flexible for instance senator herman talmadge of georgia whose reputation on the race issue was once little different from his late fathers is now being accused in some extreme quarters of selling out to the niggers for his refusal to use the filibuster in obviously hopeless legislative fights and for failing to insist that georgia close down its publicschool system to prevent desegregation senator talmadge like many another southern congressman is clever enough to read the handwriting on the wall and politician enough not to talk himself into a corner if the handwriting were not already large enough the justice department has been engraving it in sixfoot letters several times as many votingrights suits against southern registrars have been filed during the first eight months of the kennedy administration as were instituted in the three previous years of the voting laws existence only the most intransigent southern politician can fail to be impressed by this a man who is any politician at all is already planning how to survive when the negro vote becomes important perhaps decisive in his constituency legal or moral arguments aside there is cold logic on the side of the administrations energy the pure mathematics of the squeaker requires the democratic party not only to hold on to as much of its previous vote as possible but also to expand its support to provide a cushion for the inevitable dropoff if the administration is after new voters it can find no greater unexplored territory than in the south in last falls election the voter turnout by state ranged from idahos per cent of the civilian population of voting age to mississippis per cent the eleven beyond his immediate sphere of action in june for instance he addressed a freedom rally at the sports arena in los angeles sponsors were hoping for an attendance of fifteen minutes before the rally was scheduled to begin the fire department ordered the doors closed after had jammed inside another showed up of whom at least half remained outside listening to the fourhour proceedings on the publicaddress system a close associate recently said when they the kennedy administration want to know how negroes feel about something they call martin this may be an oversimplification but it is true that dr_kings influence with his own race is highly respected by white politicians the dignitaries on the platform of the los angeles rally included californias governor edmund brown new yorks governor nelson rockefeller after declaring at the national governors conference in honolulu that civil_rights was the paramount moral issue in american politics met with dr_king to discuss the issue at length and of course the political benefits which flowed to john kennedy last november as a result of dr_kings temporary imprisonment in georgia are well known the nonviolent movement of which dr_king has become the symbol has achieved considerable progress and influence thus far without becoming directly aligned with either party dr_king himself endorsed no candidate in and he is clearly undecided whether to become identified with either party in the future for the time being his political activity will be limited largely to voter registration the major emphasis will be in cities where tangible gains are possible but the nonviolent techniquein the form of registrationoffice standinswill be utilized to dramatize the plight of negroes in rural areas dr_king is not worried that negroes will be at a loss to know without overt guidance which candidates to support theyre going to vote for the candidates who stand most forthrightly for human rights he said neither is he concerned as are some writers that even if negroes register in large numbers in the south they will have no one to vote for in state races registration will inevitably have an impact he contended and either incumbents will see the light or new candidates with better vision will come forward i have followed a nonpartisan course dr_king concluded this doesnt mean that i am not interested in politics i am intensely interested in politics and maybe i will have to change some day but i feel that someone must remain in the position of nonalignment so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of bothnot the servant or master of either if civil_rights is destined as governor rockefeller contends to become the nations paramount moral issue then dr_kings cause probably can best be served if he remains nonaligned as a speaker he is superb as an articulator of nonviolent direct action his effectiveness cannot be challenged but his philosophical bent and his gentleness of nature make him not the best of administrators and he has tended to leave the work of organization to others the best guess at this time is that he will remain the conscience of both not the servant or master of either a gutter full of dreams he didnt eat much breakfast he sat around and tried to read but finally he gave that up and went out into the back yard the alley smelled like rotten eggs and fat maggots swam in the garbage cans some had lids some didnt hosea douglas picked up some pebbles and began tossing them around every time he hit a can the flies buzzed off in a black spiraling cloud he watched the flies return and swarm over the dead rat smashed into a red tirerutted pulp by a passing truck milk colored water trickled between the brick paved alleyway and formed a puddle where the alley dipped flies found that too everybody accused him of being a dreamer nobody he knew could see any reason in the world for his going out that afternoon and trying to get a job playing ball for a professional football team like the cougars he watched the flies buzzing around in the alley that was reason enough for him hey boy you looking for something that was how they greeted him when he got out to the camp id like to try out for the team he said to one of the fat guys who seemed to be in charge you what aint this the tryout camp of the cougars the two fat guys looked at each other well boy now look yeh youre kind of light for a linesman the other fat guy told him i dont play on the line i play in the backfield you what give him a suit luke a short baldheaded guy with a cigar told them yeh but give him a suit okay the man called luke shrugged come on you after hosea got his equipment luke took him to the dugout there was a lot of nervous talk going on in there hey youse luke said in his high nasal twang and the talking stopped this boy heres gone try out for the team luke grinned and left all of the players began to test their equipment seeing what kind of shape it was in then one after the other they filed out and left him in there alone with his dreams on the way out he bumped into a huge blond guy scuse me the guy said thats all right the blond guys eyes followed hosea out the door hey youse luke said when he spotted hosea coming over to join the group gathered around him run back in there and get that other guy to hurry up and get his butt over here i aint got all day it turned out the blond guy wasnt in any hurry and took his time dressing so that by the time they got outside the gathering had broken up and the backfield was passing footballs while the linemen charged each other where the hell youse guys been luke wanted to know you messed around and missed defensive and offensive instructions well thats just too bad for you cause i aint bout to repeat them the blond guy shrugged hey youse whats your name luke asked him elmer jabloski yeh well youse and your buddy better watch out attitude counts on making this team too the blond guy looked at luke and laughed luke turned red youse guys might just as well turn in your suits now he said what you play jabloski asked hosea quarterback jabloski didnt bat an eye come on lets go over with the backfield coach blakey invited me to the tryouts not ole lard ass hosea started to say no one had invited him but he didnt know what would be the point in saying that they had trouble breaking in the circle at least hosea did so jablo ski took a ball and he and hosea started throwing it at each other then the baldheaded guy blew a whistle all you guys who came to try out come around front so i can get a look at you he said there were twelve of them ill consider myself a lucky sonofabuck if i find at least one good player among you he said and ill be even luckier if the one i find can last over two seasons in this league he looked them over like they had leprosy in case anybody dont know it im leon blakey and i run the show now this here is mike cassares and this is craig luke my assistants the way it wound up everyone was on a team except some veterans the coach was sure of and hosea jabloski cassares said the coach said to put you in as linebacker think you can play that i play football jabloski said he did too like he was bom into a pair of shoulder pads and football cleats he could sense what hole a play was being run through and bottle it up before it got started good he could get knocked flat on his back and he would get up and still make the tackle he practically crippled both the rookie quarterback and his hopeful tryout replacement blakey sent in his veteran but not before moving jabloski over on offense the first time jabloski got the ball he ripped through the secondary and ran over the safety man without even breaking stride that would have probably been good for a touchdown if blakey hadnt blown the whistle luke started bawling out the defense really giving them hell until blakey told him to shut up blakey called the defense into a huddle and told them what he wanted them to do whatever he told them didnt work too well because on the next play jabloski went ten yards with half the secondary riding him blakey rubbed his chin and frowned jesus christ cassares said aw that hams just lucky luke said with that smile i wonder how much its gonna cost us to sign him up blakey said he dismissed two tryout hopefuls playing guard they didnt argue with him they just limped off the field and went into the locker room hey kid blakey said no sense in you hanging round if all youre going to do is loaf get over there and take mursons place at safety hosea pointed a finger at his chest me yeh you murson looked up and saw him coming he left without saying a word taking it easy on his left knee they finally got some guards and a linebacker in the game who could bottle jabloski up at the line of scrimmage so the quarterback opened them up with a couple of end runs by his two halfs then with the defense honest he faked a handoff and faded back a long lanky end got behind hosea and hauled one in he was off to the races but hosea reversed and managed to get him fifteen yards out from the goal line the whole defensive unit turned and looked at hosea without saying a word jabloski caught a short hard one in the flats and headed down the sidelines he was by the secondary before they even realized what had happened and hosea had to come all the way from the far side to get him he had a good angle on him and went into him low driving with his shoulder as hard as he could jabloski seemed to take off and fly hosea stopped him though two yards out from the goal line jabloskis momentum carried him five yards after his feet had been knocked from beneath him hey luke how bout sending us a safety man somebody yelled you dont like him blakey said chewing on his cigar the linebacker kicked the dirt out of his cleats you dont like him naw i sure as hell dont blakey shrugged and sent in another guy to take hoseas place hey you he yelled as hosea headed for the sidelines get over there and take the right halfs slot on offense the offensive quarterback looked up and saw hosea heading his way hey coach what the hell you trying to do ruin me you can play right half cant you kid well to tell the truth i really play quarterback now that was too much for both teams but blakey just nodded his head okay kelly i dont want to make you look bad so you rest a while and let the kid take over for a spell kelly fired the ball at hosea blakey looked over the defense and smiled okay cry babies whats your excuse now st louis in august the hottest month in the year the center overshot hosea and he barely had time to catch up with the ball before the whole defensive line smothered him whats the matter boys blakey said you forgot how to block he was grinning when he said it but on the next play the line held the center overshot hosea again though and the ends caught him as soon as he picked up the ball blakey blew out a couple of oversized smoke rings and sent in a new center the new center found hosea with the ball all right but the left guard crashed the line and caught him before he could pivot around hosea got up slowly all he could think about were the curbs over the gutters where he used to sit with the other kids when he was a child and plan all the big things they were going to do when they were grown hey boy luke shouted from the sidelines a big lopsided grin ballooning out all over his face what kind of quarterbacking you call that losing thirty yards on three plays the offensive team began to grumble in agreement hosea wiped his sweaty hands off on his pants he didnt hurry getting back to the huddle on the next play the left guard crashed again only this time hosea was rolling out to pass so it didnt matter he couldnt find a receiver anywhere though and that really got his goat but he didnt give up hell no he reversed his field and left half the defensive line strung out behind him he headed for the sidelines and got back up to the line of scrimmage only to find two guys from the secondary set and waiting then he got his first break since he had been out there jabloski came up from nowhere and nailed one of them with a block from the blind side that must have knocked him five feet in the air hosea gritted his teeth and stiffarmed the other guy so hard it felt as though his elbow was pushing up through his armpit his only chance was walking that chalk line and he knew it and he took off into high but the linebacker managed to get over there and block his path hosea broke stride and the linebacker grinned hosea got his head down and his knees up high that was the way you ran over a man that made the linebacker grin all the more the linebacker weighed twohundredandthirty pounds only he didnt try running over him at the last split second he straightened up and gave the linebacker his left leg the linebacker shifted in to take it and thats when hosea pivoted on his right spinning in a circle like a basketball center playing the key and while the surprised linebacker went sprawling after a left leg that was no longer there hosea shifted back into high and went into the end zone standing up it got quiet as hell out there st louis in august hot enough to mangle boy i like you jaboski said putting his arm around him you play football youre in the wrong place boy they told him cant you tell when you aint wanted yeh go home black boy fore you get your neck broke they tried to break it too only he caught them at their own game faked a pass down field and handed off to jabloski who went sixty yards down the middle of the field without anybody touching him jabloski threw the football over the goal line in contempt and blakey had to call the scrimmage off to prevent a freeforall blakey thought all the tryouts except jabloski should go home jeez i dont see how he can let you go jabloski told him while they were mounting the steps after dressing yeh st louis in august hot enough to kill see you jabloski told him and headed for the parking lot hosea headed for the streetcar line hey you hey kid hosea turned around whats your name hosea told him guess you realize what youll be up against in this league that was just a small sample of it out there hosea didnt say anything blakey puffed on his cigar jesus you got a great pair of hands kid i sure would like to use you what you think of that hosea didnt say anything he felt too thunderstruck to ever say anything again a child have you ever seen any real indians asked my sevenyearold son richard when he came home from school for lunch one day of course i replied you probably have too there may be some at school with youi havent noticed his eyes widened but they dont wear feathers on their heads no most indians now dress just about the way you and i do they used to wear feathers and sometimes now some of them dress up in costume for special parades he thought for a moment i guess maybe johnny brown is an indian no johnny is a negro i said dont you know what a negro is no do we know any negroes if it had not been for his serious honest little face i could have thought he was joking then i remembered another time when he had made a similarly surprising remark he had been telling his grandmother about one of his little playmates and she had asked him is he white or colored he had replied i dont know i had thought then that he had just failed to notice and i was glad that it was unimportant to him but with this question today i knew he did not know what a negro was why of course dear i replied we know johnny brown and his family and many others i mentioned the names of several of his friends who are negroes his eager little face registered surprise are they he pondered but bob the man who used to work for us said negroes have black faces now i was beginning to understand richards bewilderment yes i said people often say they have black faces but they are not really black some are very light tan and others dark brown we are said to have white skins but we are not white like this tablecloth are we negroes he then asked no i answered we are white if we are in the sun a lot and get our skins tanned then will we be negroes he wondered no we stay what we are bom i tried to explain then he began to think of the children in his schoolroom the idea of classifying children by race was a new one to him he had thought of them as boys and girls those he liked or those he didnt like but he had never thought of them as belonging to different races he mentioned several names remarking that he thought they might be negroes not knowing these children i could not tell him i said i had seen some chinese or japanese children at school too and tried to describe them i think maybe mary is chinese he said i like maryshe isnt a tattletale like sally i do not know to what race mary or sally belongs and richard is only guessing aside from this momentary curiosity about races probably started by some history story at school he doesnt care to him the important thing about people is not their skin color or eye structure but their behavior the subject was dropped a little later but when his nineyearold brother came home richard asked danny did you know johnny brown is a negro danny assumed the knowing attitude that a nineyearold is apt to take toward a sevenyearold sure and his family are all negroes too he told his younger brother after talking a little more about the subject danny said well what i dont understand is what race is this was said in a tone of dismissing the subject rather than of further inquiry he would leave this illogical complexity to the adults his statement rang in my mind for some time and i felt how good it would be if adults too could admit that they do not know what race is by william p grayson twentysix years ago when i started in the advertising business neg r annual income was rougmy iobillion today it is billion and growing rapidly taking stock of our economic importance is timely and pertinent to the whole of the american negros struggle for firstclass citizenship in the fight to eliminate discrimination and segregation we might give thought to the effectiveness of our individual application of the economic technique along with our freedomrides sitins prayins wadeins we suggest the investin counterattack the power of the almighty dollar to change minds and to create acceptance can be illustrated by the story of the minister of a church located in a neighborhood where the winos found it a convenient and comfortable place for sleeping one sunday morning the church had its usual number of smelly alcoholics as one was leaving he grabbed the ministers hand and loudly said rev that was the damndest sermon i ever heard you really had a hell of a message today now brother you mustnt use that kind of language here all of you are welcome to come here but i cant have you insulting my members and contributors with your foul language and profanity excuse me rev i didnt mean any harm but that was such a hell of a good sermon i put in the collection today the ministers eyes lit up as he forgot himself fifty dollars well ill be damn twentysix years ago advertisers and sellers generally considered negro families only as submarginal consumers bargain basement buyers and a convenient target for the disposal of irregulars markeddown nondurable goods and the happyhunting ground for the sale of questionable mailorder products those were the years when the mass communication mediums were effectively projecting an image of the negro stereotype today the economic strength of i the negro consumer is realized it is a market that is recognized as important to many industries vital to the success of many advertising campaigns and essential to the very existence of some major corporations don connell of the giant market research company of america an outfit that provides statistical data for the formulation of product manufacturing and selling strategy for many of the top us corporations recently pointed out industrys new approach to the negro market ten years ago marketing men had a great deal of curiosity interest and desire for information about the negro market but no compelling need to act on it today marketing men approach information on the negro market as a prelude to action it is a marketing fact of life that can only be ignored at the expense of profits donald i rogers writing in the n y herald tribune says the american businessmans needs for profits will bring equality to the negro where common sense and common decency have failed the negro market amounts to billion annually smart businessmen are cultivating it with utmost care the gross national product of the negroes in the us will total more than billion this year nobody is going to segregate that much money the wall street journal in a june article the negro consumer says never before have they been courted so assiduously by people with something to sell what is this negro market and what is our economic strength the negro market as i view it is not a market to be measured by color alone we are consumers with ambitions and aspirations that are limited and restricted by ethnic mores as a result we develop a different set of motivations and a purchasing pattern that varies considerably from those of nonnegro consumers with otherwise comparable characteristics advertising men have come to realize that there is no longer any single mass market sociological psychological and economic factors influence buying decisions there are many markets made up of individuals with similar buying patterns to reach them admen have gerrymandered us consumers into dozens of markets and submarkets each with its own preferences status symbols and standards of conformity we have the youth market career womens market house garden interest market group and leisure market consumers the largest most clearcut and distinct market of all says newsweek is the negro market our economic strength today is important to industry onethird of all of us live in the cityzone of the major markets of the us white families are shifting to the suburbs of major markets and only of the total now live in the largest cities our economic strength is vital to the success of many advertising campaigns because negro urban families tend to spend more for certain products than white families in the same income group in a city survey of families with comparable incomes we found that negro families spent an average per year for soft drinks while white families spend negro market families annually spend for cosmetics and toiletries compared with spent by equalincome white families the average expenditure of negro households is almost times larger than white households for hair preparations and vi times larger for phonograph records and times larger for candy we spend more for movie attendanceand some giant corporations must continue to marshal our economic strength in order to maintain the relative position of their brand among competition a major cigarette brand a premiumpriced mens shoe a popular brand of blended whiskey are a few examples of the many product types that are vitally dependent upon our continued purchases and preference for that matter total scotch whisky sales in the us would drop if overnite we decided to go on the wagon the travel industry is just beginning to recognize that we spend more than the average spent by comparable income white persons for travel our economic strength to this industry is some million this year the negro market will buy of detroits new auto production and will spend million for automobiles the average negro family will spend for clothing this year for a total of nearly billion we spend proportionately more for food clothing and housefurnishings per household than comparable income whites in practically all sections of the country these figures impressive as they are are only a small index of our economic strength the potential of the future is even greater what about the future will the negro market continue to grow will negro families earn a larger percentage than the of the nations billion consumer income markets of the sixties a book by the publishers of fortune magazine predicts that the consumer markets of the s will be shaped by teenagers who will demand vast amounts of foods and will enter massively in the market for secondsa second car a second tv two telephones etc this emphasis on the purchasing importance of young families are additional reasons why the future looks bright for us new employment opportunities are more likely than ever a study of population trends seems to bear this out in the us census showed a decline of twomillion in the white population in the age group white males of this age group in the population declined this is the group that is now years of age and the age group most preferred by employers already these statistics are being translated into future planning by industry and government in baltimore for example the twintrends of the white migration to the suburbs and the concentration of negro families in centralcity has resulted in a loss in total city population between in the same period the percentage of negro population to the total increased from less than to more than a breakdown of the population also revealed that of the citys white population is years old or over compared with for the nonwhites in the city dr matthew l tayback assistant commissioner of health for the city of baltimore has said it is safe to characterize the baltimore negro population as a young one and the white population as an elderly one this is essentially the whitenegro characteristic of many american cities since the negro population is young and at the age of new family formations and product acquisitions the negro is the manufacturers best consumer potential for food clothing home furnishings drug and personal cares products and automobiles industry should know that the negro consumer wants recognition our studies indicate that negro readers of a dozen or more different magazines find high class negro models in a negro magazine more appealing and interesting than white models these industrialists are responsive to your opinions your preference for negro or white models to demonstrate illustrate or recommend brands that are soliciting your business is important to marketing and sales experts industry is also interested in knowing your preferences in magazine reading large sums are spent in media research to study reading audience characteristics the daniel starch research organization provides a measurement of the percentage of negroes and whites in the audience of magazines generally magazines that are oriented primarily to reflect the interests and participation of a particular reader group have heavy concentrations of readers of that group for example all of the home service mens and weekly magazines have to white readeraudiences ebony magazine with beautiful negro models in ads and feature pictures has negro families in its reading audience life magazine has negro families in its circulation look magazine covers negro households and saturday evening post reassessing our economic strength we find that the negro market is million population with billion to spend onehalf of the negro population is strategically located in major markets and comprises over of the total population for those cities national advertisers striving mightily to get a toehold are vitally interested in favorably influencing negro consumer acceptance manufacturers are concerned about the local policies of downtown department stores where their brands must be sold these retail outlets now have up to negro customers the negro market is big and will probably increase to of the gross national product a possible increase of about billion more as negro family income goes up purchases of homefurnishings are planned first following this the negro family plans a trip abroad ranking third on his priority list is home improvement the growth and importance of our economic strength can best be summed up by a quote of excerpts of a letter from the secretary of labor to the president of the united states dear mr president he wrote for your interest and consideration i am forwarding a special study the economic progress of negroes in the us a notable development in recent years has been the steady improvement on the social and economic status of negroes in education type of work income housing and other areas for which measures are available the historic differentials between whites and negroes have narrowed this report while measuring progress permits satisfaction with past achievement only as a prelude to a determination to forge ahead with vigor in opening doors of opportunity even wider the secretary concludes as i would restate our own evaluation of the negro market potential it is not a basis for complacency but a spur to continued action my countryman my enemy ten per cent or so of the american servicemen on okinawa were negroes very occasionally they ran amok especially in an area known as koza four corners the four corners consisted of some five hundred gaudy bars with names like cotton club and new york jump the bars were monopolized by the negroes and whites who entered the area ran the risk of being beat en up sometimes young negroes marched up the hill from the four comers towards the business section of koza fighting and wrecking bars as they went the negroes in turn complained that some of the nco clubs and other places on the island were virtually off limits to them a negro air force staff sergeant said in his big deep voice it just about takes an act of congress for a negro serviceman to get in those clubs or some of them if an okinawan waitress in a club that has white southerners on its committee dates a negro or is even seen talking with a negro she gets fired i asked a white staff sergeant what he thought of that the white serviceman has just as much right to want his recreation spots for himself and his friends without having negroes around as the negroes have to want them integrated he said judiciously about negroes and okinawan girls he said its considered fashionable here for white and yellow to mix but its kind of taboo for white and black to mix he concluded anyway you dont gain acceptance for yourself and your friends by mob violence not long ago about a hundred of those young negro hoodlums marched up from four corners and tried to take the town a negro from texas a marine sergeant said gloomily that the four corners was just like being across the tracks in any mississippi town he added you know it was set up to be like that about six years back or more they just kind of gave the four corners to the negroes to keep us quiet and to try to cut down whiteblack fights on his first pass being unaware of all this he strolled into the white area of koza a white mp walked up to me and tapped me on the shoulder keep moving boy he said i beg your pardon i said dont get wise with me nigger he said you heard me tar baby the sergeants jaw muscles tightened at the memory now look here i said to him he continued im a sergeant in the marines heres my pass damn your pass he said up here youre nothin but another loudmouthed nigger the thing is said the sergeant earnestly that the peking radio reports all this you know some americans think we ought to keep quiet about it and never tell anyone like you cornin in from outside but the peking radio talks about it the okinawans know all about it just our own folk back home in the states they don know about it the okinawans to whom i talked seemed surprisingly placid about any whiteblack tension in their midst before the war the japanese soldiers on okinawa also committed criminal acts a policeman said but when it was suggested that indigenous law enforcers should carry firearms for the protection of themselves and other okinawans only okinawans guarding american bungalows and american military installations had gunshe smiled and shook his head that might only provoke the foreigners against us now they fight each other he said but this was an official view another okinawan said more bitingly white americans who treat black americans as inferiors are hardly likely to think of asians as equals how negroes escaped slavery in the revolutionary war in the revolutionary war the american negro was a pari ticipant and a symbol he was active on the battlefronts and behind the lines in his expectations and in the gains he registered during the war he personified the goal of that freedom in whose name the struggle was waged the negros role in the revolution can best be understood by realizing that his major loyalty was not to a place nor to a people but to a principle insofar as he had freedom of choice he was likely to join the side that made him the quickest and best offer in terms of those unalienable rights of which mr jefferson had spoken whoever invoked the image of liberty be he american or british could count on a ready response from the blacks on the american side the negro saw only limited military service until the war dragged on into its third year this negative attitude toward enlisting the colored man sprang from a reluctance to deprive a master of his apprenticed servant or chattel slave and from the fear of putting guns in the hands of a class of persons most of whom were not free in the main the negro was thought of as a servile laborer rather than as a potential warrior but when manpower needs became acute whether in the volunteer forces the militia or the continental troops hesitancies and fears were put into the background and the negro was mustered in this procedure typified an attitude toward negro enlistment that would prevail in americas future wars from colonial times until the twentieth century the negro would be bypassed in the early stages of conflict but as the struggle grew arduous civilian authorities and military commanders would turn to the one great remaining manpower pool and the negro would emerge from his status as a rejected inferior to become a comrade in arms some twenty months after the war broke out between england and her former coloniesby the close of grim necessity forced the states to reconsider the decision to exclude negroes from their armies bound by the necessity of conciliating southern views congress still refused to sanction negro enlistments but the states went ahead early in massachusetts included negroes in the list of draft eligibles and the legislature of rhode island at its february session voted to raise two battalions of slaves the substitute system encouraged the enlistment of negroes a man summoned to service was permitted to get someone to take his place and to procure a negro was easier and less expensive than to procure anyone else in virginia and in maryland the change in attitude toward negro soldiers was a consequence initially of the difficulty of mobilizing white manpower and later of the southward shift of the main theatre of war unlike their sister states south carolina and georgia steadfastly refused to legalize slave enlistments south carolinas heavy negro population made her fearful of such a step and georgia shared these misgivings when these states remained adamant even after the fall of savannah late in congress recommended that they raise negro troops but these two states declined to reverse their stand and maintained it to the end the negro welcomed the resort to arms although not very strong on theory he fulfilled the pragmatic requirements of a revolutionary he had little to lose in goods or lands and he lacked a sentimental or blood tie with england at any rate black americans quickly caught the spirit of in the words of frederick douglass the most prominent colored american of the nineteenth century the revolutionary war announced to negroes the advent of a nation based upon human brotherhood and the selfevident truths of liberty and equality there were portents of a new era individual slaves petitioned for their manumission groups of slaves memorialized state legislatures to abolish slavery for the first time a gallery of distinguished negroes made their appearance among them phillis wheatley precocious poet prince hall founder of negro masonry and benjamin banneker mathematician and astronomer negro soldiers served in the minutemen companies of massachusetts in the early weeks of the war in the state militia of the northern states and in the state and continental forces they saw action in the continental army at monmouth the last major battle in the north at yorktown where on july the continental army passed in review baron von closen an aidedecamp to general rochambeau made note that threequarters of the rhode island regiment consists of negroes and that regiment is the most neatly dressed the best under arms and the most precise in its maneuvers negroes served on sea as well as land in the chesapeake waters of virginia and maryland the use of negro pilots often impressed slaves was not uncommon and the massachusetts legislature ordered that captured slaves be made to serve on state vessels negroes were numbered among the more than twenty thousand seamen aboard the armada of american privateers it is not possible to give accurate figures as to the number of blacks in the american armies not more than a third of the negroes who bore arms were racially labelled moreover colored combatants were interspersed with whites in what today might be called unsegregated units it has been estimated however that negro soldiers served in the patriot forces a respectable figure particularly since so many were not free to act although man power shortage was the paramount factor the changed american sentiment toward drawing negroes into the war effort and thus conceding them a higher status was in part a reflection of the humanitarian impulse which inspired the revolution and was engendered by it antislavery sentiment mounted rapidly and action was taken on both continental and state levels above the potomac public opinion turned strongly against slavery by march pennsylvania was ready to lead the way by passing an act for its gradual abolitionwars end brought further gain to the negro to the slave soldier who had borne the responsibilities of citizenship before he could enjoy its rights it brought freedom and in some instances a land bounty in new jersey slaves belonging to tories were freed by act of the legislature waged in the name of liberty the war caused many americans to give a hard look at their own domestic practices abolitionist societies multiplied often under quaker sponsorship northern states following pennsylvanias lead took action to abolish or circumscribe the slave trade and slavery in the south the wartime decline of the staple crops tobacco indigo and ricedecreased both the value of the slave and the reluctance to give him his freedom thousands of negroes gained their freedom by joining his majestys forces faced like their opponents by a manpower shortage the british were receptive to the use of blacks and in commanderinchief sir henry clinton issued a proclamation offering freedom to negroes who would join the royal standard the british move was countered by the americans who exercised closer vigilance over their slaves removed the ablebodied to interior places far from the scene of war and threatened with dire punishment all who sought to join the enemy to negroes attempting to flee to the british the alternatives liberty or death took on an almost literal meaning nevertheless by land and by sea they made their way to the british forces in the south the british employed hundreds of runaways as shock troops others served as guides and spies it was as military laborers however that they found their widest use negro carpenters hostlers blacksmiths axmen and miners markedly increased the striking power of his majestys armed forces the british discovered as had the americans that a negro laborer could perform a service that otherwise would have to be done by a white soldier when the war ended hundreds of negroes were evacuated from savannah charleston and new york with the departing british forces the establishment of american independence did not bring all that many negroes had hoped for the idealism of the declaration of independence gave way to the conservatism of the constitutional era but if the negro felt that the cause of liberty had lost momentum his mood was somewhat brightened by the conviction that the revolutionary era in which he lived had marked out an irreversible path toward freedom that henceforth there could be no turning back even if there was a slowing down evacuation with the british if they have a sufficient number of transports they will carry with them about twelve thousand negroes which they have now in charles town and which they have stolen in their various expeditions into the country ralph izard to mrs izard october the chief concern of americans about negroes in the thirty months after yorktown was their disappearance whenever the defeated british made their final withdrawals whether by land or sea thousands of slaves went with them take what precautions they would the americans could not prevent mass exodus of their black bondmen which began immediately after cornwalliss defeat the articles of capitulation at yorktown stated that any american property held by the british garrison was subject to recovery the surrender terms were silent however about slaves who would try to escape by going aboard the departing warships of the royal navy americans did not need to be told that prompt action was necessary to forestall the flight of slaves on the very day of the yorktown surrender general george weedon placed sentinels all along the beach to prevent them from reaching the vessels of the royal navy prompt as was his action he feared that many runaways had already secreted themselves on board the ships on the next day weedon sent a letter to governor nelson apprising him of the situation virginias chief executive had not been idle within twentyfour hours after the surrender he had written to cornwallis asking him to prevent negroes from making their escape by boarding the sloop of war bonetta which was allowed to sail to new york with news of the capitulation these negroes cautioned the governor would endeavor to lie concealed from your lordships notice till the vessel sails general washington lent his support to the effort to keep negroes from leaving the state he was disturbed about the number of slaves who attached themselves to the british or posed as free men in order to deceive american commanders to put a stop to such irregularities washington on october ordered officers of the allied armies to deliver all negroes who came into their hands to a guard to be established at yorktown and gloucester under the superintendency of david ross virginias commercial agent negroes who could prove they were not escaped slaves would be released slaves whose masters lived in the vicinity would be issued a pass enabling them to make their way home unmolested slaves whose owners were not virginians would be advertised in newspapers of their home states while waiting for their masters to claim them they would be sent into the country to work for their victuals and cloathes washingtons order seems to have placed a check on slaveseizing by american and french officers as well as those of the enemy doubtless this was what he intended for he was fully aware that some american commanders had a weakness for acquiring property in blacks ten days before cornwalliss capitulation washington requested american army officers to report any negroes they had who have come out of york henceforth if any officer kept such a person in his service he would be called to the strictest account washingtons order also applied to officers of the state militia civilians did not come under military regulations and to prevent them from retaining other peoples slaves the virginia legislature in may ordered all holders of runaways to deliver them to their masters if known if the master was not known an advertisement seeking him was to be placed in the virginia gazette any person who could prove his right to a slave lost during the cornwallis invasion might apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant of recovery to compel americans to give slaves back to their owners was a trying task but it was nothing compared to getting the french to give up their negroes in dealing with an ally whose assistance at yorktown had been almost invaluable a delicate touch was essential washington used a personal approach in writing to the count de grasse on behalf of a maryland master who had lost upwards of forty slaves five of whom had been taken in the bay by a french ship and carried to the west indies i will take it as a very great favor if your excellency will direct them to be sent back by any vessel coming either to virginia or maryland the expenses of their return trip would be paid by colonel william fitzhugh their master the difficulties of negotiating with the french were tvpified by an incident which occurred when the french troops were stationed in charlotte county in southeastern virginia an american militia officer colonel thomas read sent a sergeant and a guard to the french camp to apprehend runaways and return them to their owners the french commander the marquis de choisy informed read that he considered his application unnecessary insisting that he had already come to an agreement with the governor respecting slaves the rebuked read dismissed the guard but he informed governor harrison that unless the negroes who had deserted to the french were quickly reclaimed those who have property of that kind in the vicinity of the camps will suffer by their going off with such complaints mounting governor harrison took the matter up with general count rochambeau expressing his reluctance to trouble the french commander harrison nevertheless found it necessary to mention that reports were coming in every day about negroes harbored by the french troops and that there was no way in which masters could recover their property except through your justice he asked rochambeau to issue orders to hold all negroes within his lines simultaneously the governor ordered the virginia commissioner of war to order a detail to receive the slaves supposed to be with the french army two days later rochambeau explained his position he and many other french officers owned negroes but these had come from rhode island having either been captured there by the french fleet or purchased from rhode islanders moreover some of the negroes with the french were hired others were free he was ready said rochambeau to help the virginians recover slaves but not at the sacrifice of the rights of his fellow frenchmen rochambeaus response was hardly satisfactory to the state authorities the governor notified virginias delegates to congress a week later that the french troops were moving northward with many negroes since some of these belonged to north and south carolina masters he thought that the congressional delegates from those states should be notified in order to recover the negroes when the french reached philadelphia the exasperated governor then unburdened himself to george washington declaring that he had written so many protests to the french authorities about loss of slaves that i am wearied out without being able to procure them some indeed had been returned but most of them had been kept by the french either for want of their owners having any proof at hand or the negroes declaring themselves free little could be done about runaways who passed themselves off to the french as free men except to put notices in the press a baltimore master advertised for ned who was skulking in the neighborhood of this town in order to join the french they would likely welcome him as a refugee according to the advertisement because he was very capable of being a waiter or hostler to any officer having been a waiter and coachman to colonel white of the state of georgia ever since the war commenced for some months after the surrender at yorktown the british appeared unable to carry on the war and too proud to make peace but by april his majestys ministers had decided to evacuate their troops using three of the major seaports the first of these departures took place at savannah in the summer of a week before the date set for the evacuation the georgia assembly urged governor john martin to request of the british commandant of savannah that no negroes or other property belonging to americans be carried off the legislators also asked governor martin to grant permission to citizens having property in british hands to lodge a formal claim realizing that georgia needed all its manpower resources to rebuild the states economy the lower house also tried to persuade departing tories to leave their slaves behind the commissioners for the sales of forfeited estates were empowered to purchase negroes from evacuees and sell them to residents on condition that the purchasers would not carry them out of the state for at least eighteen months british military forces formally withdrew from savannah in july evacuating loyalists with their slaves as well as troops on july general leslie ordered the royal navy to provide shipping accommodations for whites and negroes an embarkation return of august lists six ships as having carried negroes to jamaica by december an additional negroes had been taken to st augustine seven months later this figure had reached of whom were men women and children another problem which leslie laid before his superiors was the british obligation to the negro when leslie learned that charleston was to be evacuated he asked the commanderinchief for instructions as to the disposition of the negroes under commissioner cruden and those employed in the different departments there are many negroes who have been very useful both at the siege of savannah and here he wrote some of them have been guides and for their loyalty have been promised their freedom he pointed out that no matter how the sequestered negroes were disposed of there was an obligation to those who had voluntarily joined the british something was owed them because of the promises made to them and because of their past services they could not in justice be abandoned to the merciless resentment of their former masters carleton supported leslie in refusing to give up negroes who had borne arms for the king or had otherwise incurred the resentment of american patriots leslie therefore appointed a commission composed largely of military officers to hear the appeals of negroes who had served with the british army or who claimed to have fled to the british in response to proclamations offering them their freedom the responsibility which he felt to the negroes aggravated his major problem in the evacuationthat of trying to assure the south carolinians that their property would not be carried off masters were already sufficiently alarmed by the difficulty of recovering slaves by legal process they had to prove ownership and in establishing such proof they could not employ the testimony of the slaves themselves or of other negroesa law which the south carolinians themselves had enacted the british evacuated charleston without any supervision of their shipments when on december they finally left the city they took negroes of whom onehalf were destined for jamaica of the remainder all but went to east florida with a few finding their way to st lucia halifax england and new york the last american port to be evacuated was new york by november when the last of his majestys troops boarded their transports the final peace treaty had been signed since this treaty included a statement relating to negroes the new york evacuations had a broad interest one involving policy and its observance by the signatories the preliminary articles had contained an agreement that his majestys forces should withdraw without carrying away any negroes or other property of americans the terms of this agreement signed at paris on november soon became common and official knowledge in america on april commanderinchief sir guy carle ton issued an order from his new york headquarters warning all masters of british vessels not to commit any breach of the article relative to negro removals on the very same day the congress instructed general washington to make arrangements to obtain the delivery of the negroes and other american property then in the hands of the british or their adherents a week later washington wrote to carleton suggesting a meeting sir guy was willing if unenthusiastic i cannot decline the personal interview proposed by your excellency this important conference was held at orangetown on may washington was accompanied by his military secretary and flanked by three witnesses one of whom was george clinton new yorks able war governor washington led off by stating that he had asked for a personal conference as the speediest way of reaching agreement over the major problems connected with the british evacuation namely taking over the posts occupied by the british troops and recovering negroes and other property belonging to americans carleton replied that the british were leaving the county as fast as they could civilians had already been sent away including some negroes expressing surprise washington observed that transporting negroes was contrary to the provisional treaty carleton then advanced a point of view which dismayed the american negotiators despite its familiar ring it could not have been the intention of his government said carleton to ignore its obligations to negroes who had come into the british lines under proclamations of freedom issued by his predecessors to deliver up such persons some of whom would thereby be executed and others seriously punished would be a dishonorable violation of the public faith however if british evacuation of the negroes was subsequently declared to be a treaty infraction the crown would compensate their owners with this possibility in mind carleton had directed that a register be kept of all negroes involved thus the british evacuation of new york as of savannah and charleston proceeded with little american hindrance alexander hamilton found the british point of view on slaves defensible but his was an almost solitary voice in nonloyalist circles indignation over the carrying away of slaves was both widespread and enduring it was to affect american diplomatic relations with great britain for nearly half a century years after the war americans were still hammering the point that the payment of prewar debts in london and glasgow should be withheld until his majestys government made restitution for the lost blacks it appears that the position britain finally adopted on the return of slaves was formulated by guy carleton whose view became standard policy negroes who were with the british prior to the signing of the provisional treaty on november were free those acquired after that date were to be given up in arriving at this dictum carleton was doubtless moved as he claimed by a sense of responsibility to the negroes a farseeing man carleton may also have felt that if britain defaulted on promises of freedom made during the war any similar proclamations in future conflicts would not be trusted nevertheless he carefully fulfilled his assurances to washington that he would keep a register of negroes to facilitate the compensation of their american owners he assigned a board of three men to keep the register and every wednesday morning the board met for two hours at fraunces tavern with the three american commissioners by the time his majestys forces officially withdrew from new york on november the british commissioners had compiled a detailed list of negroes they had inspected comprising men women and children this massive inspection roll of negroes bore eight columns listing the names of the negroes their former masters and the names of the vessels on which they were embarking one heading was entitled description and bore such arresting comments as fine boy an idiot likely rascal snug little wench and nearly worn out to these negroes who left new york must be added the hundreds of unregistered ones carried away in private vessels the total number of colored persons who left that city as well as other ports can only be guessed perhaps it would be safe to say that during the evacuations the numbers of negroes leaving savannah was charleston and new york if anything these figures are a bit low and they do not of course include those who went off with the french nor the thousandsperhaps around five thousandwhom the british carried away prior to the surrender of yorktown many negroes were carried off without regard for their own wishes this would be particularly true of slaves belonging to departing loyalists likewise many negroes who had deserted to the british were not consulted about their being taken off in the evacuations perhaps most of these former runaways would have left america voluntarily since the british had assiduously spread the idea that those who went back to their american masters would be severely whipped and then assigned the hardest kind of labor the belief that their former masters would treat them harshly for having fled was no doubt a strong factor in shaping the conduct of negroes who had a free choice in peacetime a recovered runaway was not likely to get off lightly in wartime a slave who not only had taken to his heels but had joined the enemy had reason to feel nervous about the welcome he would receive upon his return to the home plantation to allay this fear some masters promised a pardon virginias theodorick bland jr sent word to his slaves isaac and kitt who were in new york that if they would come back to framingdell the family plantation in prince george county he would let bygones be bygones neither would listen isaac informed blands emissary that he had heard that once a slave had returned to his master he was treated with great severity exclusive of the thousand or more youngsters who were born within the british lines and who therefore might be considered bom free a small number of adult free negroes perhaps a few hundred went off in the evacuations there were eight free negroes among the colored refugees who came to east florida from south carolina as of july numbered in the black emigrants from georgia to east florida as of july were free negroes accompanying the british from charleston to new york late in was free negro bacchus a smith by trade thirteen free negroes men and women were included in the adults sailing out of new york in november on the peggy concord and diannah thousands of negroes were taken to other islands in the british west indies from to the colored population of jamaica showed an increase of practically all of the black immigrants were slaves many had been brought in as slaves but many others who came expecting to be free were seized by those holding no legal title and sold for rum coffee sugar and fruits perhaps the most noteworthy of the negroes taken to jamaica was george liele who as a slave and a free man in georgia had been a dedicated preacher brought to kingston in as an indentured servant liele worked out his time in two years once he obtained his certificate of freedom liele resumed his work in religion preaching in private homes and then organizing a churchthe only baptist church on the island by more than persons had received baptism at his handsmany of the negroes evacuated from the united states did not go southward thousands went to canada perhaps their lot may be suggested by focussing on the story of africanborn thomas peters darkskinned and of large frame peters had in fled from his master and joined the british during the war he served as a sergeant in a negro armsbearing pioneer company being twice wounded in battle with the coming of peace he and his wife settled at annapolis in nova scotia a province to which many of the canadabound negroes went the british had promised peters and his comrades not only freedom but a farm his majestys officers were slow in making good the promise of a farm and the civilian authorities were likewise dilatory the black settlers in nova scotia felt cheated either the surveyor was too busy to mark out their lands or the plots they received were largely thick pine forest and hard to clear finding themselves landless or holders of land that would produce little many negroes apprenticed themselves to farmers or congregated in burchtown a nearly allnegro community peters was a patient man but after six years of waiting he determined to go to england to seek redress from the kings ministers by virtue of a small sum raised by his fellows and by working as a hand to pay his passage aboard ship peters arrived in london early in here he received a welcome that must have made up for much of the disappointment of the preceding years granville sharp and his fellow reformers took peters in tow and soon the former slavesoldier became a london celebrity his eloquence his passion his spirit made him the rage of the newspaper world the latest fashionable craze and the newest object of philanthropy to assist peters his abolitionist friends drew up a memorial in his name and sent it to william w granville secretary of state for foreign affairs this document described the plight of colored families at annapolis royal and families at new brunswick these negroes would remain in those provinces it was said if they could obtain the full grant of land and provisions originally promised them otherwise many would be willing to migrate to any country which would make them a competent offer this petition which peters signed by making his mark brought quick action the secretary of state ordered the governor of nova scotia to investigate the matter if the charges were true the governor was informed that the province must fulfill its obligation or send these families to sierra leone a removal to sierra leone would entail some expense but his majestys government had an obligation to these negroes for their wartime services the idea of transporting the canadian negroes to africa originated with the directors of the recently incorporated sierra leone company founded to enable destitute negroes in london to make a new start by settling them on the west coast of africa the company had acquired a site and begun operations by the time peters visited london on its board of directors in the company counted such wellknown abolitionists as thomas clarkson william wilberforce and granville sharp it was sharp who introduced peters to the other board members and enlisted their interest in the black nova scotians in turn peters was favorably impressed by the kindness of the board membersby their assurance that he and his associates would be welcome to sierra leone and by their belief that his group would be better off there than in frigid canada with the tacit support of parliament and the approval of peters the sierra leone company got busy on august the company authorized two agents lawrence hartshorn of halifax and john clarkson to screen out the candidates for resettlement and get written testimonials as to their character sobriety and industry the agents were authorized to offer twenty acres of land to each prospective migrant with ten additional acres for his wife and five for each child many of the candidates were personally enlisted by peters who returned to the province prior to clarksons arrival including his family peters recruited a total of eightyfour persons from st john new brunswick and annapolis and brought them to halifax some applicants made their way alone many of these arrived at the headquarters city only after hard journeys of up to miles through wooded and little known country thanks to men like george and peters there was no problem in recruiting good prospects indeed the directors of the sierra leone company were surprised and gratified by the number of applicants by the end of the year a large enough group had been recruited and the ships chartered on january a bit over three months after his arrival at halifax agent john clarkson could joyfully write i am now under sail with a fair wind and fine weather having on board souls in fifteen ships properly equipped and i hope destined to be happy for the next few weeks the embarking nova scotians were not as happy as clarkson had hoped the expedition ran into heavy squalls temporarily separating one ship from another some sixtyfive of the voyagers died at sea and another hundred were too ill to be landed when the fleet pulled into kru bay in early march when the remaining thousand stepped ashore they found that little preparation had been made to receive them they knew they would have to work long hours if they were to succeed in throwing up enough shelters before the rainy season set in but if at the moment their new dwelling site lacked adequate housing it bore a sweet sounding namefreetown who was marcus garvey in jamai ca a named amy garvey on the arm of her chair and invokes the name of her late husband he was no damn fool says he was no buffoon or clown american negroes will find out that he was right integration is not enough far away in the damp chill of london another woman named amy speaks the name of the man to whom she too was once married his spirit is still a dynamic force in the world the seeds he scattered in the s are beginning to bear fruit in america in washington park on chicagos south side an old black man holds a small audience with the same name that mahn he sings in a pronounced west indian accent that mahn was right no one is going to help the black mahn but the black mahn that mahn marcus moziah garvey has been dead now for years he died broke an exconvict and some said a failure but time has dealt kindly with the jamaican firebrand today years after his stunning harlem triumphs his name is on many lips a few months ago during the nationwide uproar over black nationalist groups commentators and columnists summoned the ghost of garvey recently a book black moses and several articles in scholarly journals have probed into his life when kwame nkrumah the first african prime minister launched his ship line he went back to garvey for a name black star not the least of many factors in what approaches a garvey revival is the increasing interest of american negroes in a resurgent africa among many people who feel recent events vindicate the little giant are the two women named amy garveys widow amy jacques and his first wife amy ashwood contend that he was a prophetic figure who lived years before his time garvey they say did two vitally important things he went to the heart of the race problem by ripping away the shame and inferiority that were stunting the growth of the black men he focused attention on africa when black nationalism was dormant to understand these contentions and the air of controversy that still surrounds the garvey name one must go back years to the heyday of garveyism the man behind the ism was a short black spellbinder with a dandyish mustache and piercing magnetic eyes during the fabulous s he hypnotized the harlems of america with a backtoafrica movement using as a text the slogan africa for the africans at home and abroad garvey preached the gospel of a united africa under the rule of black men in the process he developed what many sociologists consider the first and only mass movement among american negroes he gave his followers parades uniforms and pageantry he declared god and jesus black and urged negroes to glory in their blackness garvey talked big and dreamed big the late james weldon johnson said garvey collected more money an estimated million in one twoyear period than any other negro organization had ever dreamed of he organized cooperatives factories a small army and a commercial steamship venture the black star linearrested in on a charge of using the mail to defraud he was convicted and subsequently deported to his native jamaica in his dreams shattered he died in london that commented professor albert bushnell hart of harvard university is the difference between success and failure had garvey succeeded in his undertakings he would have been uncontestably the greatest figure of the th century having failed he is considered a fool to many of his contemporaries garvey was a fool or worse but says amy jacques garvey they were blind all around you she adds all around you you can see the things he saw then coming true going back into the turbulent racial history of the s she avers that it was important for a leader to come forward at that time and tell negroes that they were somebody it was important to assure them day after day by every technique available that black was not a color to be ashamed of he gave to millions of people who had no ambition who felt they were born with a handicap a new sense of dignity and personal worth she says he made the masses feel proud of their black skin their kinky hair and their thick lips he lifted black people up and made them feel that they were something of value garvey told them god made you black and he didnt make a mistake race pride meant something to every individual thats why he urged negro children to play with black dolls i remember the controversy over the painting of a black christ his critics laughed and said you see garvey wants to make everything black garvey knew and said that god is a spirit but he said since you are made in the image and likeness of god when you visualize him you must visualize him as looking like you instead of visualizing him as looking like another mana white man carried away by the polemical skill of her late husband she laughs and her eyes sparkle oh she says you cant beat his arguments you cant beat them theyre irrefutable few things are more alive to amy jacques garvey than her late husband when i talk she says i talk for garvey i feel i can interpret how he would feel if he were alive the dynamic woman who has edited a book of garvey speeches has at her fingertips almost everything garvey said and did she can quote for hours from his speeches all around her in the handsome house on kingstons mona road are garvey paraphernaliaold books busts and pictures mrs garvey who has lived in kingston since her husbands death raised their two boys marcus jacques and julius and put them through school by dabbling in real estate and disposing of inherited property amy jacques who is thin and intense differs considerably from her childhood friend amy ashwood who was garveys first wife amy ashwood is heavier and although she lives in london she wears african tribal robes both women however are natives of jamaica both have written books about garvey unpublished and both are persuasive conversationalists amy ashwood started with garvey in jamaica and was associate secretary of his first version of the universal negro improvement association she was also garveys private secretary he divorced her in and married amy jacques who was then his private secretary at the time of the divorce amy ashwood said some harsh things about the man who proclaimed himself provisional president of africa but time has mellowed her now living in london where she operates the afropeoples centre she spends most of her time preaching the gospel of the new africa which she says owes so much to garvey garvey stole the march on africa she says africa was slumbering when garvey struck at that time the american negro did not want to hear the word africa she smiles you would try to talk to them and they would say i aint lost nothing in africa more than any other man of his time garvey made a contribution towards awakening the masses of the world to racial insecurity although he was not the first to visualize a strong and independent west africa he gave the idea the new urgency and a tremendous impetus although both women agree on garveys main contributions to the modern world they expressed in separate interviews different opinions on other aspects of garveyism amy ashwood for example believes that garvey would have adjusted his program to changed conditions amy jacques denies that he would have changed every plank in his platform she says is valid amy ashwood says that garveys bitter enemy the naacp is the american organization doing the most to propagate his ideas the naacp she says has acquired the mantle of garvey they are the aggressive organization in america today they are making all the moves garvey would have made it must be remembered however that the naacp is a nationalist group and there are other problems outside the united states which it is not addressing itself to amy jacques expresses the traditional garvey opinion that the naacp is an organization of middleclass negroes dominated and financed by whites it cant be called a negro organization she says apart from a few lodges and churches there are few purely negro organizations in america such an organization is vitally necessary she says garveyism is still pushed by garveyites in america amy ashwood says flatly that backtoafricanism which most laymen consider a central tenet of garveyism is outmoded she says i dont believe the backtoafrica movement would be valid for american negroes today i rather think that the booker t washington philosophy of dropyourbucketwhereyouare should permeate american negroes after marcus garvey had returned millions to africa spiritually he had done his work it was finished in the real sense i believe if garvey had lived he would have studied the conditions in africa even more than in the new world and he would have realized that the return to africa had taken placethat the black man in the new world could make a greater contribution to africa by remaining in america rather than migrating it is a sensational misunderstanding of garvey amy jacques says to imply that he advocated backtoafricanism people misunderstood him as a matter of fact the term backtoafrica was used and promoted by newspapers negro newspapers mostly to ridicule garvey there was no backtoafrica movement except in a spiritual sense but migration was planned to liberia because concessions were given there the idea was to take only enough to establish a township as an example and patterns for africans he never advocated mass migration the idea is ridiculous garveys whole program she continues was based on reuniting the three units the people on the homefront in africa american negroes and negroes in the west indies he always saw the three units together he believed in and gave his life for a united race he knew that once a strong african nation was established negroes everywhere would automatically gain added prestige and strength the second mrs garvey is critical of american negroes who she says do not always understand that big cars and fine apartments are not basic to the good life for a man to be respected she says he must have a parent tree the jews have palestine the italians have italy the important thing is nationhood american negroes will eventually win their fight for integration but it will be a hollow victory even if the negro is allowed to participate in a small way he will be swamped as a personality in the body politic and in the years to come the practical realization will be absorption if the american negro is to gain national prestige and racial prestige and economic stability he must become part and parcel of a united race you can have all the highpowered cars you want and all the plush apartments that you want and i can have a horse cart and yet something deep down inside of me makes me feel damn proud to be in a nation of my own and to walk on ground that belongs to me on ground that is being developed and administered by black men of my own choosing what garvey understood was that minority citizenship cannot fulfill the demands of a full man what kind of man was garvey was he a con man or a genius demagogue or prophet he was an enigma amy ashwood says he was a prophet student of mass psychology and something of a healer he was also a racialist in the sense that he conceived it his duty to stimulate in the members of his race something which was a source of great anger to their oppressorsand that something was pride in their origin she falls silent and her hands clutch at the air as she tries to find words to enclose the man finally she says because he could speak to the masses in a language they could understand he was able to assume the mantle of black moses among the contemporaries were many better educated men but most of them lacked the common touch amy jacques says he was a showman an opportunist and a propagandist of the first order he used everything he could to draw attention to and dramatize his ideas he was calm almost phlegmatic in conversation but the minute he walked on a platform he was transformed he could put his finger on the pulse of the audience and address himself to that point in her book she writes a witness at his trial compared him to a master musician who had complete control of his instrument and plays on it at will and his faults amy ashwood says like the rest of us he was made of mortal clay and he carried his full burden of human weakness and limitation his chief failing was his inability to share responsibility he was autocratic vain and he loved to hog the spotlight he erred in trying to shine too brightly amy jacques says he was not practical he was always so eager to get things done and in cases where he had to rely on others he felt they would do in the same circumstances what he would have done despite these faults both women say garveys name will live in london in an apartment building that once belonged to a lord amy ashwood puts the case for garvey this way he must be resting peacefully and joyously in the certainty that history will give the verdict that he neither lived nor labored in vain and that his successes by far outweighed his faults and mistakes ghanas black star line is a living compliment to garvey nkrumah hasnt forgotten him amy jacques says garvey immortality is assured she says further that garvey knew it he will never be forgotten because he always saw the three units as one he knew that he had made a contribution and he knew that what he had done was worth it he did the dirty work negro leaders owe him a vote of thanks he worked with the masses if the foundation is poor ignorant and rotten how can you build a superstructure that will last he laid the foundation so that a superstructure could be built on it and he did it the only way it could be doneby meeting the masses where they were by dealing with their hopes their frustrations and their fears and so today nkrumah and kenyatta give him credit for the work he did ironically enough garvey never set foot on african soil today as the flames of black nationalism race through the west indies and africa he lies dead in a london grave but his bust rests on a slab of concrete in kingston jamaicas king george vi park a stones throw from the offices of a colored premier this is as close as he ever came to the black_power that obsessed him perhaps as the two amys contend this is close enough marcus moziah garvey they say was a black moses who saw the promised land he never entered from ebony march an american story jworked for a week yes i did that r i worked for a ge ss week not for eight hours but from sun up to sundown i think now what a big fool i was you know they still have people doing the same thing right now i am now years old born july i was in a little town called speed north carolina there were very few negroes who had their own land i heard my grandfather tell that his father had a farm and that it was paid for well this same white man that i worked for for a week his father fooled a acre farm out of my greatgrandfathers mother for my grandfathers father was dead at the time well at that time my grandfather was a boy he said that he cried all night thinking of what a fool his mother was thats why im glad those boys and girls the freedom riders and sitin demonstrators are fighting for their rights thats why i join the naacp every year i may not be able to get a lifetime membership but i can pay every year and be a member well you see my grandfather raised me he tried to send his son and i to school as long as he could so we made it to the eighth grade this white man that we lived with said that we were too large to be going to school that he should put us to work so he did in i got married so in my one child was bom i had always said to myself that i would never stay there and work for a week for the rest of my life so i began farming with my wife annie sun up and sundown and at the end of the year we still had not made a thing so in december of my set of twins was bom in we began to farm again i told my wife one night there is no way in the world we can live off of a week then i left and came to baltimore after a week i had a job i then sent back for my wife and kids i got a job as a steel worker i now earn a week so thank god i prayed and i prayed i thank god again thats why i know there is a god i have people there in north carolina today doing the same thing today all of the south is not bad but most of it if the south had been right and not judged me by the color of my skin i would be there today and be happy to be there so thats why i am praying for those boys and girls also the naacp we cant all live here in baltimore ill always be praying are todays athletes too dull it seems unquestionably to be true that detroits assemblyline system produces fine cars but some doubt clouds the profitable applicability of this system to sports or are todays athletes too dull in an era not so long gone sports were filled with colorful entertaining characters and these showmenathletes added a great plusquality to games that is sadly missed today in this age of conformity we have a plethora of skilled players who hold their bats the same way run track the same way kick field goals alike but you can count on the fingers of your right hand the stars who still dare to be individuals in their quest for uniformity sports stars today even dress alike and that often approaches the somber style normally to be expected of morticians and income tax consultants of the younger boxers only louisvilles cassius clay is refreshingly different archie moore and sugar ray robinson remain dominant individualistic personalities but such are their dwindling athletic fortunes that they very well may have been removed from the ranks of headliners between the time this story was written and run off the press at negro digest in baseball vic power clevelands first baseman labors to display his amazing artistry afield but instead of appreciation he inspires the defamatory charge of being a showboat to be called a showboat if you happen to be an athlete is a clean sort of way of getting cussed out perhaps the most colorful major league baseball player is the caucasian star washingtons jimmy piersall the payoff for his individuality is a resounding cry from opposing dugouts youre crazy in professional basketball there is wilt the stilt chamberlain who as a superblytalented athlete standing feet inch is forced to be an individual bill russell of the boston celtics is the rare player who sports a beard reportedly because hes tired of people mistaking him for chamberlain and bill occasionally looses his emotions through the medium of a roundhouse right to an opponents jaw but essentially russell is a super defensive player and though he ranges upwards of feet inches he no longer stands out physically at a convention of cagers the fbi if given ample time might assemble an allamerica squad composed of colorful stars for the most part however the big heroes of today are about as colorful as the fading strains of a funeral march heavyweight champion floyd patterson hibernates between bouts roger maris the yankee home run slugger often attempted to impersonate greta garbo i want to be alone during his stretch run on babe ruths record jimmy brown the cleveland browns fullback and soft drink salesman is sheer power and speed and all business about the job of scoring touchdowns it is now as if sports heroes are doing probation on their candidacy for election to the staid and stoic ranks of back bay society only a few of them have the courage to twist in public and virtually every word they utter bears the stamp of a publicists approval i became startling aware of this a few years ago after a certain bigoted caucasian player had spit in a negro stars face when i asked the negro star about this great expectorator he said oh hes a nice fella great ball player of course current sports stars boast many technical qualities the oldtimers never matched this is therefore not a saga dedicated to the theme that the old days were necessarily better this writer belongs to no oldtimers club himself and to confess a truth it is possible that some of the legends ive heard from the oldsters themselves are nothing more than pure fiction on the other hand i do know that in my own time ive watched with growing alarm frequently with yawning boredom the development of factoryline athletes the decline of individuality in sports and this decline appears to run handinhand with the total conformism sweeping this country it is my contention that when sport submerges athletic personalities in its conformist system then games lose much of their appeal their zest their artistry it always has seemed incongruous that a ball player who must hit the dirt on a slide into second base which is about as undignified an act as you can commit in public particularly the bellyslidewill turn around and chastise a contemporary for being a showboat simply because the latter prefers to catch throws at first base with a flairful sweep of one hand instead of playing it by the book in the old days sports stars werent nearly so businessminded as they are today they werent pampered nearly so much the modern athlete wants three days off if he contracts a hangnail and they appear to have loved their games more up to a point a businessminded attitude can be good for the athlete and his sport certainly it is not necessary to drink to excess spend money wantonly on wild wild women and spout profanity in public to earn the reputation of being a character this is not the type of color which is lamented here any athlete who has moxie enough to save his money build an enterprise to insure his future is applauded here on the other hand where would archie moore be today if he were not a colorful figure would dizzy dean remain one of the highestpaid baseball broadcasters if he were not a masterful mangier of the queens english isnt it true that even joe louis remains a popular figure because he possesses a dynamic personality what is this color that i lamentand who were the most colorful athletes of the lost era color is as difficult to explain as why one hollywood actress is sexy and another isnt it is a quality that distinguishes one performer from a crowd in a totally individualistic way it is most often an inborn not a manufactured quality although enterprising publicists often seek to create it color may be found in the way a star speaks runs makes a catch color is a plusquality in a skilled performers stockintrade color in an unskilled performer isnt worth a nickel at the gate but color properly placed is surefire box office even in depression times it is a quality that endears one performer to the crowd while another just as good technically may elicit respect but no fanlove color is a quality with which a player on a losing team may yet salvage some enjoyment for the partisan fan it is often expressed through an athletes display of unshakeable confidence in himself in the fearless way frank robinson digs in at the plate babe ruth used to call homerun shots ted williams used to thumb his nose at sports writers there is no questioning the fine athletic skills of emlen tunnell of the green bay packers hank aaron of the milwaukee braves or elgin baylor of the los angeles lakers but these are not particularly colorful stars they are superstars make no mistake about it and in baylors case perhaps the negative is being stretched yet these are athletes who always make the most difficult play look routine the colorful athlete gets a tremendous kick out of playing money is not a first consideration and he is not ashamed to let people know he enjoys what hes doing he always seems to be having fun the same difference is noted between a louis armstrong and a typical cool cat jazz artist louis plays and sings with a flair all his own with voice and trumpet sounds unmistakably his with an overflowing good feeling and enthusiasm that the stuffy bearded ivyclad cool cat never matches such is the way with a colorful athlete as compared to the assemblyline star sheer size alone does not necessarily make a player colorful nor for that matter especially good ernie ladd of the san diego chargers stands feet inches weighs pounds and eats like food is going out of style but nobody has nicknamed him big daddy big daddy lipscomb of the pittsburgh steelers on the other hand is not only huge enough to inspire awe he is also good enough to engender respect and flairful enough to be truly colorful most frequently as in big daddys case you are told that a player is colorful by his very nickname somewhere along the line while exuding color he has inspired a coach writer or teammate to give him this catchy monicker such was true of satchel paige goose tatum sweetwater clifton rarely does a colorful player bring such a name as elijah percival or jeremiah into sports in all the annals of sport there never have been more colorful athletes than satchel paige jack johnson or goose tatum among negro performers and mickey walker babe ruth or babe herman among the caucasians walker is remembered as the great fighter who was known to show up for a bout intoxicated get clobbered into sobriety then go on to win his battle ruth was of course the bandylegged potbellied cocky heavyeating funloving homerun hitter who revolutionized offensive baseball herman will always be remembered as a hardhitting erraticfielding star who allegedly caught baseballs with his noggin and of an occasion stole bases that were already occupied all six of these performers had this in common they were uncommonly colorful and they were uncommonly skillful i shall dwell on the former trio at more length satchel paiges main forte was his ability to throw a baseball faster with more accuracy with more complete confidence in his ability than anyone of his time he attracted possibly more fans in more big cities different countries and hick towns than any other pitcher who ever lived because while winning games and striking out batters he was also a master showman a titanic entertainer satch wasand is at age a dramatic actor of no mean skill which he has demonstrated in one hollywood motion picture he knew instinctively how to manipulate a crowd as well as how to fool batters lean and lanky he affected a slowdrag type of walk that sent crowds into gales of laughter the moment he stepped out of the dugout or bullpen he invented a series of original pitchesand gave original names to pitches that everyone else threw when satch joined the cleveland indians in youthful gene beardon was surprised to learn that satch threw the spitter supposedly a new pitch oh that satch rejoined is that what you call it ive been throwing that pitch for years few pitchers would have had the audacity to call in their infielders and outfielders confident that they could strike out the side but satchel paige did it few pitchers would have dared throw the hesitation pitch at major league hitters but satch did few pitchers possessed his keen understanding of human nature his witticisms his flair for conversation when satch realized that there was some question as to his age he did not end all suspense by merely telling people the truth instead again displaying his flair for showmanship he let everybody guess built the guessing game up into a national contest which still goes on as early as a fan walked up to satch and claimed you must be because i saw you pitch a game in good public relations was a part of satchel paiges color he loved nothing better than an engaging conversation i once saw him patiently and smilingly sign more than autograph slips in a boston night club during world series time although he had come out of his hotel room only to dance the rhumba he made every person he signed for feel as though he got the biggest bang of his fife out of the project he actually enjoyed it and on that night satch could have run for mayor of boston and won there never was any walking through crowds of kids for satch as some of todays lessable prima donnas do i once heard him scold roy campanella for refusing to sign an autograph for a ladys kid roy was too busy eating but satch wasnt another part of satchel paiges color was his intellect although most of his color stemmed from his skill and his humor on the mound satch like louis armstrong actually was and is a geniusuntutored by oxford standards perhaps but no less a genius he speaks with authority on subjects ranging from muleskinning to engineering i once saw satch talk a famous magazine photographer up a tree on photography photography is one of his many hobbies when he was with the old st louis browns satch did the same to a collegegraduateengineer on the subject of engineering it is satchs claim that he once sang in a tuskegee institute quartet that he foiled a murder attempt on himself by sitting down crosslegged to eat bugs with south american savages when you can come up with stories like that you just have to be colorful for imagination is too a part of color jack johnson was not only in all probability the greatest heavyweight fighter who ever lived he was by far the most colorful cocky and contemptuous of his foes fearless in the ring as well in private life possessed of natural leanings toward the dramatic jack enlivened his sport as it had not been enlivened before and has not been enlivened since he suffered a loss of popularity because he dared marry a white woman but none of this can detract from the fact that jack johnson was a colorful practitioner of legalized mayhem nothing proves it more than the fact that during his lifetime he was star athlete actor preacher singer nightclub operator writer and whatall jack was known to toy with his intended victims just for the fun of it and the fact that his supreme confidence antagonized fight crowds delighted him he knew this invaluable secret to be successful you either have to make them glad or make them mad the villains role was not distasteful to him jack was so skillful a fighter that he could call his shots as babe ruth is supposed to have called his homerun shot in the world series of and in the long ago when jim jeffries came out of retirement to assume the role of white hope in a bout with champion jack johnson gave a classic performance while rumors of a fix floated around the ring jack toyed with the massive jeffries methodically chopping him into human hamburger then when jack decided that it was time to end the thing he said well jim you better go for yourself this is itor words to that effect some historians say that until that moment jeffries expected jack to take a dive final proof of jack johnsons colorfulness as a boxer can be found even today in nationwide arguments about his titlelosing bout with jess willard willard will never achieve in history complete acceptance as the better man that day because johnson was shown while taking the count holding an arm and gloved fist over his head as if to shade the sun from his eyes willard claimed a clean knockout johnson insisted that he was forced to throw the fight and his proof of course was the controversial photograph somewhere in the byways of america reese goose tatum still plies his trade as a professional basketball star like satch and jack goose has been a tremendouslytalented athlete both in baseball and basketball but he is most widely known for his rare ability as an athletic comic and pantomimist in the latter category he is without peer internationally known goose brought up from arkansas to the harlem globetrotters a flair for making people laugh he inculcated this into his playing possessed of unusuallylong arms an individualistic gait and a loosejointed body goose seemed to make each shot of the basketball a thing of productional comedy he was the sort like satch who could rouse an audience to laughter just standing stilldoing absolutely nothing but just standing there looking around yet his knack for scoring baskets was uncanny in baseball he sometimes affected an oversized first basemans mitt a comic split as he fielded a low throw a little bit of a jig as he made a fancy play perhaps this was showboating but it was also an art a clean art and millions of people enjoyed it unfortunately there has developed among negroes a school of thinkers who decry the talents of such people as satch and goose and louis armstrong this is partially attributed to the fact that negroes have been brainwashed into thinking that the talents of these men constitute uncle tomism or deplorable buffoonery or lack of dignity which negroes can no longer display to the world but there is a difference between being an uncle tom and being a true clean wholesome showman red skelton a superb clown takes pratfalls and he makes millions of dollars doing it seldom if ever has satchel paige done anything degrading on the field of play many ingroup critics forget that colorful oldtimers of paiges clan are untutored geniuses that in spite of the handicap of poverty and lacking formal education each one through his special genius his wealth of color perfectly matched with his athletic skill has become an international celebrity great as they are none of our young stars of today are as widely known nor as widely loved as satchel paige some of the younger players look down their noses at him but they crave the lavish approbation the public pays him in a sense the decline of colorful athletes can be charged to or attributed to progress each of the three athletes dwelled on here came to the bigtime already possessing certain original traits each had learned his sport in his own way he was a product of a more individualistic society none had been subjected to a coaching system nor had he been taught that conformism was the rule of life today in baseball most players are products of a farm system where everyone is taught to hit alike run alike field alike unless the athlete follows closely the pattern laid out for him he is liable to be turned away by a manager most professional football players are collegetrained and they therefore bring with them a certain amount of social finesse to coin a phrase which might be most pleasing to the late emily post but which does not easily make for individualisms in their sports no one is encouraged anymore to be different the grayflannel suit is madison avenues trademark and most young advertising men in that sector feel out of place if they dont dress in grayflannel ivy league or whatever is the current style of dress on madison avenue similarly athletes now are encouraged to dress alike wear ties whether they feel comfortable or not clear statements through publicists never speak out on a matter thus when a jackie robinson or sugar ray robinson speaks independently he is frowned on when a ted williams refuses as he used to to tip his hat to the fans after hitting a home run he is called a rebel no one can change willie mays breadbasket catch and despite his rating as the greatest allaround player in the game willie is called by a few critics a showboat actually the modem athlete is afraid to be colorful unless one comes along who just happens to be so good and so distinctive a personality that no one can change him the colorful athlete finds it most difficult to make it the decline of the colorful athlete is to be lamented it must be admitted that athletes and teams are better than ever because new records are being set all the time but there is something about the factorymade athlete that just doesnt measure up to the oldtime colorful player be he baseball football basketball horse racing hockey or track star these factorymade athletes make it look too easy they have lost the skills so recently displayed by such as kid gavilan in boxing with his bolo punch and his fine sense of timing which allowed him to goof two minutes of each round and fight furiously for one colorless athletes are fine when theyre winning but in this one mans opinion theres nothing duller than a colorless athlete losing on moving fences as bom and grew i to manhood south of the masondixon line and although some twenty years after the civil war and the freedom of the colored man there still existed a feeling of race prejudice as a youth i was indoctrinated with the idea that the colored family was of the servant class uneducated and destined to live in the poorer sections of our city that as a race they could never be educated to the degree attained by the members of the white race yet working for my family was old isaac johnson and his wife cecelia they were descendants of a slave family and neither were free until after the civil war fortunately they had been the chattels of a family by the name of clark good people and with this family they spent their early lives matured fell in love and married isaac as i remember him with his white hair and beard was a saintly man a lovable character and loyal servant cecelia his wife just as saintly and lovable was beloved by and depended upon by our entire family and as a cook she had no equal as a youngster i loved to sit upon their laps and listen to their tales of days spent in slavery and of their experiences during the civil war on isaacs knee with my head upon his shoulder i would listen in awe and enchantment as he would unfold to me how he had stepped upon a copperhead snake the snake biting him on the foot how he immediately took his jackknife made a cut where the fangs had entered the flesh letting the blood carry away the pisen as he termed it the story of how the union soldiers the northerners in dem bloo uniforms in de middle of de night stoled all de food de cattle de horses scotched de land and took ebrey ting de old massa possessed and then he would add ah hopes you son will nebber grows to see de likes ob dat kinda war well old isaac and cecelia passed on to their reward and we their chillen as they called us grief stricken placed them in the hands of thar lawd years passed and i grew up in i with old isaacs thoughts in mind went off to war during my service overseas as an ambulance driver i saw wars destruction and devastation i carried back from the front the maimed bodies of all nationalities regardless of race creed or color i learned that war was no respecter of mans station in life the great and the small the white the brown and the black were mowed down as a reaper would do its job in a field of grain as old isaac would say de war god is no specter of persons dey all looks alike to him then i learned of an incident which cut deeper into my feelings that man regardless of race creed or color is as old isaac used to say one of de lawds chillen a group of boys after a costly advance returned to a small french village taken with the loss of several of their buddies they gathered their bodies together catholic protestant and jew and went to the village padre requesting permission to bury their dead in the village churchyard cemetery the old padre granted permission to bury all the baptised buddies within the cemetery but he said the laws of my church will not permit me to allow you to bury the unbaptised jewish boy in consecrated ground they then laid to rest the bodies of all their buddies except the one jewish boy in consecrated ground and with sorrowful hearts they placed the body of the boy of jewish faith in a grave just outside of the burial grounds returning sometime later to visit the village cemetery much to their surprise they found the grave of their jewish comrade in the cemetery grounds surprised they called upon the old padre and asked him why the grave was now within the cemetery enclosure his reply to them was as i informed you boys my church would not allow the unbaptised to be buried in consecrated ground but there is no law on earth that prohibits me from moving the fence your buddies all rest in the arms of our saviour so i have a confession to make that i shall always hold within my heart old isaacs philosophy we is all of us de lawds chillen regardless of the color of our skin or our station in life old isaac was a true disciple of his lawd his hopes dat i would nebber see a war did not come true but in the old padre i found another isaac who taught me all men are created equal regardless of race creed or color may this confession convince others whose prejudices are wavering it took old isaac the old padre and two wars to convince me that all we have to do is move our fences the tuskegee story the spectre of white political nation nondo mihaunts fearful whites from downing street tq elizabeth ville and from manhattan to the golden gate but nowhere is legal takeover by negroes more postuskegee pres luther h foster sible than in tuskegee alabama and nowhere else have affronted whites contorted the law to such ludicrous lengths to preserve a political supremacy the unique demography of tuskegee and macon county makes this a major battlefield for the balot testing ground for the fearsome question of whether negroes would participate or dominate if given the chance for only here in this black belt oasis do negroes rest on all three legs of the tripod to power only here does the negro population enjoy superiority in distribution of wealth and educational reserve the countys population disparity negro white is a carryover from slavery when the many black hands were needed for the comfort of the white few and has increased by virtue of two major negro institutions located here the countys only two financially important establishments thus far have been tuskegee institute and the veterans administration hospital their combined gross annual payrolls alone total million million and million respectivelymore than half the countys total income million each institution is predominantly negro with token integration in the last several years amounting to about a dozen whites altogether unless the county attracts more white industry soon it is ironic but conceivable that whites will press for more integration into the two negro institutionsparticularly the veterans hospital tuskegee institute with a teaching and research staff of including phds eight edds two mds nine dvms and holders of masters degrees and a nonteaching staff of answers the question of educational preparedness even without adding the welltrained nucleus of the member staff of the veterans hospital eleventh largest in the nation the stakes and the strategy even so the denial of political power even political expression to that otherwise prodigious group hasin the pastbeen almost absolute but this has been possible only by denying those citizens the most basic tool of democracy the ballot thus the battle lines are drawn negroes many whites say would take over local government and send representatives to the state house and possibly to congress in short order but squarely between tomorrows negro political representation and todays nonpolitical negro is the high barrier of discriminatory voter registration supporters of the barrier are referred to looselybut with some exactnessas state officials and the whites downtown doing most to beat down the barrier is the tuskegee civic association many of whose members were among the all but five negro voters gerrymandered out of the city in by an act of the alabama legislature before the foursided city map was carved into a sided spectacle negroes were registered city voters no one has doubted and few have denied that the intent of the gerrymander was to prevent negroes from voting in city elections true to its character tca reacted to the gerrymander by educating macon county negroes on the merits of not shopping with white merchants and of setting up more businesses of their own which they did unlike most protest groups which have sprung up across the south since the tca is more than years old it has consistently employed discussions and time consuming attempts at conciliation and meticulouslydocumented complaints all without violence or unsavory advantage neither has it sought or received official interference in either direction from the va hospital or tuskegee institute the tcas plodding pace often seems incongruous with the efforts of younger groups whose accent is on direct and immediate action its policies and strategy are very much debated whenever the impatienteven those within the organizationplace a measuring stick alongside tcas accomplishments what does tca do and how fast they ask last winter tca president dr charles g gomillion himself sadly remarked that no progress has been made in race relations in tuskegee since he came to the community years ago gomillion head of tuskegee institutes social science department noted that there had been some material progress among negroes but progress otherwise was impossible since no white person in macon county will meet with negroes to discuss any type of problem another avenue the may civil_rights decision was legal payday for those who had waited painfully since plessy v ferguson legalized segregation in similarly tcas biggest payday came last march when a supreme court verdict followed by the federal district court in montgomery struck one of the most direct blows ever dealt to disfranchisement since enactment of the th amendment for the first time in the nations constitutional history the supreme court ruled in a case on gerrymandering which the court had previously regarded as a political thicket out of judicial bounds but the court held that the tuskegee gerrymander was indeed an exceptional case and ordered the citys boundaries restored on grounds that the intent was to deny a basic federal right to otherwise qualified voters the techniques used to prevent negroes from registering and voting are too incredible to be recounted in any but a compilation of southern tragicomedy but as a partial result of its patented chicanery alabama placed ahead of only her sister antagonistmississippiin the small percentage of voters in alabama ranking th had only per cent of her votingage people at the polls while mississippi showed per cent the national average was per cent the elections found throughout the south only per cent of votingage negroes registered as compared with per cent for southern whites in macon county less than per cent of the votingage negroes were registered while the books showed whites registered although the census showed only white persons of voting age that bleak pattern anchored the tcas case gomillion v lightfoot before the supreme court which remanded it to federal district judge frank m johnson jr sitting in montgomery judge johnson ordered among other things that sixtyfour named negroes must be registered within days within days after examining an applicant the registrars must tell the applicant whether he is registered and if not why the board must register any negro whose performance in attempting to qualify is equal to the performance of the least qualified white applicant ever registered and until notified otherwise the board must report to him each month on progress made this was by far tcas biggest triumph in its years of peaceful efforts but with voting an elemental matter in a democracy the victory was a major achievement in the total southwide struggle for civil_rights since no other case so dramatically and clearly defined the voting issue and unmasked the awesome determination of those who fear the wrath of negro votes important though it was tca members saw clearly the incompleteness of their victory while headlines across the country underscored the verdict tca celebrated cautiously what macon county negroes have had to learn is that while laws are tools they are merely tools and must depend upon the skill and intent of the mechanics who use them who owns government what have the whites to fear or hope for in being outvoted by nonwhites would there still be a place for them in a government which rightly or wrongly they feel is really theirs to run or ruin what does the tca really want to accomplish for the macon county negro participation in accordance with his interests and ability is gomillions answer if in time he is interested in and capable of filling the majority of positions then he should go into them gomillion adds but to take over just because we are in the majority in populationwe are not interested we want to start at a level at which we can begin to learn the various intricacies and move on in accordance with our interests and merit we dont take the position that we ought to have the majority of the positions simply because we are more numerous now there are people who do feel that waybut that is not the policy or thinking of the people i work with in the tca we would advocate or support no one for office merely because he was a negro dr gomillion who thinks tuskegee mayor howard rutherford appeared more openminded on local race problems at the time of his election says now that less conciliatory interests appear to have gotten to the yearold mayor even so the tca president says he plans to negotiate soon with the mayor on such goals as jobs for negroes in local governmental agencies the mayor refused to answer questions on race at the time of this writing because i honestly dont think they will help solve the problems in tuskegee he did say however that he thinks tuskegees race problems are lessening and that we could work the problem out all right if people would be levelheaded and calm votes make a bargain the mayors plea for a period of calm is sincere such a period would allow him to make quiet overtures to negro voters who now equal white voters and who will surely gain ballot superiority be fore another election date arrives following judge johnsons orders last september negro municipal voters were added to the permitted to vote before the citycarving at that time whites were registered but they have not added substantially to that number since the restoration of city boundaries with the court holding the door open negro voting applicants are pouring in at the unprecedented rate of per registration day two per month with per cent of them passing the tests white county voters recently outnumbered registered negroes by about but at the present registration rate the string of votingage negroes yet to register leaves little room for doubting the outcome the trend against the ballot bigots is gradual but unmistakable in macon county and the city of tuskegee mayor rutherford knows that from here on in heor whoever wins the electionmust get the negro vote this makes for a bargain heretofore nonexistent much credit for the bargain is due to va employee william p mitchell meticulous energetic and methodical chairman of the tca voter franchise committee the most consistently informative and effective of the more than consecutive tuesday night lectures since were mitchells clear analyses of the legal loopholes ferreted out or contrived to disqualify negro voters it was mitchells kind of educating and encouraging which fostered the economic withdrawal that closed the towns only movie and at least of the towns white merchandising concerns tca is kaliedoscopic there are many stories in the tca story there are the crusade the internal problems and successes of a negro middle class a towns moral struggle and the oddity of a white minority whose tradition time is ploughing under and of course it is a story of votingwhich seems a threat to one group a right to another and a question to all on the matter of motive much of this composite story was told recently at tcas fourth anniversary celebration of its crusade for citizenship a campaign given impetus by the gerrymander of the rev k l buford tca vice president and methodist minister summarized the voting and gerrymander victories and observed another significant achievement has been the spirit of togetherness by which we are now benefited our forces are not divided now our strength is not dissipated as it once was you will remember that it was at this very point that our white neighbors were misled they predicted that we would not stick together they said that we would sulk for a week or two but that we would come back and the whole thing would blow over in a few days but we did not sulk we did not pout like children but we determined that we would join hands the high and the low the lettered and the illiterate the fortunate and the unfortunate the man who lived in a palatial home and the residents of tenement farm houses the man of means and those who were not so fortunate and we decided that this was every mans battle but the race has not been won as yet and we cannot afford to grow content at this stage in the game for the race will not be won until the last vestige of discrimination and secondclass citizenship has been swept from our view certain differences between the tca and other protest groups are clear generally they add up to the tcas more leisurely pace which due to local circumstances macon county negroes can perhaps better afford tca strategywithdrawal instead of sitins conciliations instead of demands court cases instead of placards downtown and educating to vote instead of to ride may be only surface differences yet such strategy could mean that tca hears the sound of another drummer as thoreau put it if so it could mean that tuskegee negroes will get there by walking instead of marching to participate instead of dominate the new challenge to negro colleges can be proud of the y m jit t private negro colleges ww and universities for the ln efh role which they play as a powerful force in the social and cultural changes taking place in the areas where they are located the private negro colleges developed the first generation of negro leadership they later provided the first teachers for the publicly supported colleges and public schools the educated negro ministry and the first opportunities in such professions as medicine and law these colleges and universities subsequently produced leaders who enriched the main stream of american culture booker t washing ton walter white j e k aggrey and charles s johnson to name a few from the past they have continued to develop men whose achievements rank high by any scale of values mordecai w johnson john hope franklin thurgood marshall and martin_luther_king jr are part of a long list of alumni whose accomplishments form the most concrete justification for the support of the private negro colleges one important mission of the private negro colleges is that of identifying recruiting and financially assisting the talented negro student to obtain an education but the task is even greater than this for we must not only identify recruit and finance todays student we must provide him with guidance and widen his horizon by pointing the way to the many fields of study and job opportunities outside of the traditional professions of teaching preaching law and medicine it is for this reason that i have chosen as the subject to discussemployment prospects in the international field with particular emphasis on africa why africa it is in this area where the interest of many of us gravitates that the united states faces a number of key challenges foremost among these is the continuing clarion call across the continent for selfdetermination the magnitude of this demand may be seen in the fact that during the past two years new nations have emerged in africa african countries account for some member states in the united nationsmore than from any other continent it can be expected that several new nations will join the group in a few they look to the united states for years these new nations are completely committed to the principle of total independence and freedom a similar clear and unequivocal commitment our series of votes in the united nations on the angola situation demonstrate that the u s government is aware of the need for action on this issue the second challenge is the need for accelerated even rapid social and economic development in all of the new african states the great need is not only one of raising the standard of living of the majority of the people but also one of planning and economic development in all of their human resources of massive health programs and of transportation communication and electric power networks africas great mineral and agricultural potential has only partially been exploited the continent produces most of the worlds cobalt diamonds and gold it is the source of substantial supplies of copper iron maganese and uranium among the principle agricultural resources are cocoa coffee palm oil rubber and vanilla the need for technical knowhow as well as technically trained personnel is great the united states together with other highly developed countries of the free world has obligated itself to assist the new african nations in longrange programs of economic and social development the third great challenge is that of educationthe basic tool from which all other instruments of progress are fashioned over per cent of the population of africa is illiterate the scale of this problem can be seen from the following today for the african countries as a whole only per cent of the children of primary and secondary school age combined are enrolled in school the situation varies ranging from two per cent of the school age group in several countries to nearly per cent in others in the majority of cases the proportion of children out of school exceeds per cent of the school age population it is axiomatic that a high illiteracy rate is incompatible with rapid economic growth and social advancement the african governments agree that the key to the future is education by education i am speaking of a wellbalanced system of primary secondary and technical schools as well as colleges and universities all of these institutions can grow and expand to meet the challenge of the vast shortage of skilled manpower technicians teachers administrators doctors nurses and specialists of all kinds this lack of trained personnel rather than finances is often the bottleneck to development the united states in cooperation with the various agencies and member states of the united nations is attempting to meet this need squarely with a broad program of assistance now where do we fit in the colleges and universities of the united states are deeply involved in our efforts to meet these challenges first of all they are engaged in the massive program of educating and training the thousands of foreign students who annually come to the united states during the school year we had a total foreign student population of of whom approximately were from africa in addition our american institutions are involved in training thousands of students in americanaided colleges and universities in africa secondly our american colleges and universities are providing many of the specialists for the technical assistance educational and economic development programs that are in operation abroad this is especially true of the staff of experts sent out by the agency for international development commonly called aid and of course i must mention the peace corps which is relying heavily on recent college graduates for its inspiring programs abroad the private negro colleges are not newcomers to the task of edueating africans in fact they have pioneered in this field among the best known of the distinguished graduates of the american negro colleges are president kwame nkrumah and the late dr j e k aggrey of ghana governorgeneral nnamdi azikiwe of nigeria and dr hastings banda of nyasaland the united negro college fund institutions are continuing their links with africa as participants in the african scholarship program of american universities which is directed by dean henry of harvard university not only are we bringing students here but some of our schools such as hampton and tuskegee are operating programs and sending specialists to africa under contract with the u s government but this is not enough notwithstanding the needs of our own country for highly trained personnel the negro colleges and universities should share in the national efforts to meet the tremendous demands placed upon our country by the underdeveloped nations of africa and of the world we must make every effort to encourage and to prepare forward looking internationally minded young men and young women who are eager and capable of serving our government and international organizations both here and abroad in the past because of the spectre of discrimination we have had reason to hesitate in preparing our selves for positions in the international field there is no longer cause for reluctance there is now a challenge the fresh invigorating wind of opportunity that prevails in the field of international employment today the most important limitation of opportunities for the negro in international work is the limitation that the negro sets for himself today the opportunity to equal or surpass the widely acclaimed accomplishments of a dr bunche is much greater opportunities for welltrained negroes at home and abroad are open with such private organizations as the rockefeller brothers fund the ford foundation and the africanamerican institute in addition the opportunities for qualified negroes in the department of state in the international offices and bureaus of other departments and in the united nations and its specialized agencies such as the international labor organization the food and agriculture organization and unesco to mention a few are unprecedented secretary of state dean rusk at the state department conference on equality of employment opportunity last august stated we are determined to do everything we can to insure that discrimination is not practiced in the department of state and that we open up the channels of opportunity to all of our american citizens he further said that american personnel overseas must be representative of all the american people and that is not yet the case that we would like it to be he heavily underlined the fact that the department of state is seeking bright young negroes to take the foreign service examination and competent experienced negroes for appointment to middle and highlevel jobs but let us note with all honesty that negroes took the recent foreign service examination and none passed in the future let us not be weighed and found wanting in my capacity as assistant secretary of labor for international affairs one of my principal tasks is to serve as chairman of the united states delegation to the annual conference of the international labor organization widely known as the ilo the international labor organization which has its headquarters in geneva switzerland has sent out over experts of nationalities to undertake over assignments in different countries these experts are trained in many different fields one country may want an agricultural advisor another an educational expert and a third an instructor in the automotive or electrical trades to qualify technical competence and experience often carry as much weight as a phd i should mention that among my other duties i am a member of the board of the foreign service of the united states my office has responsibilities for recruitment training and orientation of foreign service officers particularly those who specialize in labor matters thus you can see that i have a personal interest in preparing more of our young people to take a place in the international field are we ready to meet the challenge can we provide qualified individuals in sufficient numbers who can take advantage of these opportunities in spite of our limitations of funds facilities and faculties we have an obligation as educational institutions to exert every effort to prepare our students for international service or at least to give them a sufficiently strong background so that they can go on to graduate schools elsewhere and qualify themselves what is needed is a good general education including facility in written and spoken english and a good background in sociology anthropology history government geography economics and administration those students interested in becoming foreign service officers need fluency in at least one modern language in addition to the general liberal arts background already indicated in this regard i call to your attention the administration bill now before the congress which calls for grants and loans for the construction of academic facilities and college scholarships for needy and talented students the approaching death m of james crow news bulletin james crow alias jim crow or segregation age active during his youth in the ku klux klan in mob violence in racial discrimination and segregation in public schools and public transportation has been a patient at the confederate hospital since may his condition following his last heart attack remains unimproved and his physician states his name is still on the critical list medical bulletin shortly after the civil war james crow wasted his energies in many nefarious activities sowing wild oats during the reconstruction period he deprived the negro of political equality and to him it became a holy crusade in which a noble end justified any means this patient was in the heat of the battle to reduce the negros citizenship to a matter of inconse quence to be sure he helped to draft southern legislation separating negroes and whites on trains in depots and on wharves by negroes were banned from white hotels barber shops restaurants schools and theatres eight years ago james crow collapsed from overwork and a rundown condition for three months he was critically ill while recovering from a segregationectomyremoval of a cancerous segroid gland by surgery his present condition is further complicated by the effect of several heanf attacks that resulted from blowing his top when he learned how the supreme court had been chipping away at the practice of segregation the last great weapon of the confederacy his previous medical history shows that by the time the justices had finished with the cases of elmer henderson h marion sweatt and g w mclaurin james crow had become a miserable wreck of skin and bones too fragile for the south to lean on his physician gave him up for dead but he rallied through the crisis on may the u s supreme court ruled that segregation in public schools was illegal james crow suffered a relapse and his physician had to give him a shot of white supremacyllin the court on may handed to the lower courts and local school boards the task of ending all segregation in x public schools against the doctors orders james crow got out of bed and aligned himself with southern reactionary forces that pledged themselves to retain segregation at all cost by the threat of imposition abolishment of public schools pupil assignment and other means this led to his present illness james crow recently suffered another relapse because of the nationwide conference of sitdown demonstrators held in raleigh n c although too weak for any active participation in heckling of boycotters and spraying of students with water hoses he is confident he will rally to recovery as he has done in the past however his physician is very doubtful prognosis dr mordecai johnson eminent specialist has warned james crow to slow down the spread of his cancerous activities while yet there is time to save himself from the hopeful words of dr thurgood marshall world renowned legal cardiac specialist and consulting specialist james crow learned that he had better conserve his energies because complete destruction of all enforced segregation is now in sight his pastor seeing how feeble james crow is his church minister has urged the aging man to renew his faith in god and man because the time is past when christians in america can take a long spoon and hand the gospel to the black man out of the back door the shadow of john brown on the ninth day of may in the year of our lord a group gtocss of peoplel moj tly e groes gathered as they have done for a number of years upon a small plateau lying high in the adirondack mountains in northern new york state there they commemorated the onehundredth and sixtysecond anniversary of the birth of john brown abolitionist they recalled that this man left his family his farm and his home on this very spot now only three miles from the famous resort town of lake placid to try an experiment in martyrdom this year they also remembered that it is the close of the first century since the beginning of the civil war it was this very john brown who triggered that conflict when in the summer of i had a visitor at my home on main street in lake placid in the person of a frail old colored man lyman epps i therefore had the feeling when we shook hands that i was fingertipping a full century of american history it was on the eighth of december a bitter cold winter day that this man lyman epps had lifted up his voice to sing blow ye trumpets blow as the remains of john brown abolitionist were lowered into the frozen adirondack earth at that time there were many controversial opinions about john brown in his own community some said he had been a martyr others thought him a daring and idealistic patriarch still others those practical ones we always have with usdeclared him an outright fool be that as it may john brown with his five sons and a handful of dedicated followers both white and colored had previously left the log cabin home in what is now known as the north elba township and stealthily headed toward the arsenal at harpers ferry virginia so great was this mans hatred of slavery and its injustices and cruelties that under his inspired leadership the little band dared surround and capture the united states arsenal at harpers ferry john brown had the forlorn hope that the negro slaves would rise up against their masters and join his crusade but the slaves knew little of the movement for their liberation the whole project had been poorly organized if at all for a pitiful few days the band held the fort they were then captured some killed john brown was hanged and his body brought back by his wife to the cold north where today john browns body lies amouldering in the grave while his soul goes marching on here then before me in this yearold negro whose wrinkled face reminded me of a brown withered apple was a living attestation to those days perhaps it was the quiet reserve in which he held himself that gave lyman epps an aura of great dignity out of proportion to his fivefootfive stature when i asked him to what he attributed his many years of earth he gave me a wry smile and answered maam i alius behaves muhself if there is a better rule for longevity i do not know it he sang a ballad for me in a tuneful voice a bit on the quavering side and then confessed his most earnest wish he wanted to be permitted to live in the old brown homestead to wear a cap with an emblem on it in the shape of a golden eagle and to be allowed to tell the summer tourists who flock into the place what he knew about john brown and his family i promised him i would write to the governor this later i did i received an answer from a secretary who referred me to a department who referred me to a bureau who referred me to a society who said no it didnt matter anyhow for on november lyman epps passed to his heavenly reward at the age of our village clerk matthew clark told me that he and the undertaker and two colored women wrapped in large woolen shawls against the bitter cold were all that followed the body to its grave there had been no singing perhaps the winter wind moaned through the lonely pine trees as the last of the living symbols of the civil war passed from our region what i gathered from my talks with lyman epps and from what i later learned interviewing some of the descendants of the john brown neighborsnow my neighborsis here related and history corroborates the story abp the year was on a beautiful morning in june of that year john brown abolitionist walked out of his house to where a hundred feet beyond lay forever imbedded in the mountain soil a great granite boulder some ten feet high and about thirty feet long from the back of this stone where it sloped upward to a rounded top john brown climbed its weather worn surface and mounting its crest began to chip away at the flintlike face of the rock as he continued hammering the thought came to him that this smallish plateau had been a wise choice for the building of his home the sight was high enough above the road to alert him to any ones approach from the south there the trail stretched back through some five miles of cascade notch with its elongated lakes and primitive forests to the south rose the peaks of the great range of mountains the highest of these marcy lifting its head over five thousand feet above sea level this mountain range seemed to encircle john browns tract of land as if to protect it from the waves of hatred flung at him from that direction his onestory clapboard house did seem dwarfed by the vastness of the great wilderness about it but through those very windows bleak and small as they sometimes seemed he could always get a clear view of the top of whiteface mountain miles to the north today that peak seemed to stand isolated against the summer sky and coldly aloof from the affairs of men as coldly aloof as john brown felt himself to be from the bickerings and indecisions of friend and foe the sky began to cloud over a cooling breeze was blowing up it drove the milky whiteness of the swishing mares tails overhead northward until finally the rolling vapors were swathing the peak of whiteface mountain in undulating gray clouds as if to hide its countenance from the tragedy to be enacted at its base with his chisel he had recessed the first initial j into the stone surface and the second initial b had been begun when john brown felt himself tiring he wiped the sweat from his eyes absentmindedly with his shirt sleeve how much harder than chipping this flinty rock was it to pierce the complacency of his country men he pondered to violate their pharasaical serenity or force them to take some steps to liberate the unhappy slaves from their misery it must be done it must be done and god john brown feels has appointed him for the task a sadeyed elderly woman mary brown now leaves the house and walks slowly toward the great rock she comes to call her husband for his noonday meal he is not quite through he tells her the homely little woman stands mutely beneath him and waits she has guessed at her husbands purpose atop the rock in her heart she has prayed for wisdom with which to turn him back from his resolve put me here mary when i come back he instructs her here in the shadow of this great rock mary brown is too inured to anguish to afford the luxury of even womanish tears she feels certain it will be her mournful duty to put john brown here for his last sleep she knows that now her husband has determined to leave his mountain home his family his neighbors and his friends for the fatal and sublimely irrational attack on the government arsenal at harpers ferry the negro slaves must be freed if only to prove to an apathetic world that there are no inferior nor superior races since in spirit all humanity is one mary brown had not yet resigned herself utterly to her fate she had one last hope she would try to pierce her husbands selfesteem when the hammering had stopped she looked up at john brown and told him of an incident which had occurred that very morning in their house some childish difference had arisen between their daughter and a neighbors girl while at their play in the heat of their quarrel the neighbor child had spat out that her grandfather didnt think much of john brown she had heard him tell her father that so far as he was concerned john brown was gods damnest fool if this was what their neighbor and supposedly good friend thought of her husband what mary brown cried out would the world say of his proposed venture in the south john brown looked down on the stricken face of his wife he noticed her careworn face and her work hardened hands he tried to comfort her to assure her that the raid on the harpers ferry arsenal might just prove a success if he outlived the attack there would be honor and plenty for all if it was gods will that he pay for the enterprise with his life god had prepared him for that too perhaps the world must exact a sacrifice for awakening it to the sufferings and indignities of slavery when he returned to her then she must put him here beside this great boulder for his eternal rest and as for the neighbor she need not be distressed over that why a hundred years from then nobody would either remember the neighbor nor his sayings c the year was it was a beautiful summer day in july the state of new york that now owns the john brown place has recently had it restored to its original status as when the brown family lived there a stir of excitement is evident in our selfcentered little village of lake placid a commemoration service is to be held out at the old john brown farm three miles beyond us it is to celebrate the passing of a full century since john browns sacrifice shocked the people of this country into its bloodiest civil war also this day will mark the completion of the restored homestead in what john brown would have called his dooryard there stands today a bronze figure of more than life size of the patriarch he seems to be walking toward whiteface mountain in the north with his right hand extended in a gesture of explanation to a kinkyheaded little frightened negro boy about whose shoulders john browns left hand rests benevolently the great stone boulder lies a very short distance to the left it is now fenced in with a spiked iron enclosure the tract of land about it is filled today with the parked cars of many people white and black who have come to hear the speeches and browse through the restored home of the patriarch chairs for some two hundred visitors are arranged in the open before the speakers stand so that all may sit and listen to the tragedy of john brown in solid comfort i flowed along with the crowd to the glassedin grave marker in the shadow of the great boulder john brown is recessed in letters a yard high newly cut into the stone a slim and wellgroomed lady is down on her knees in the grass before the small and glassencased old tombstone which john brown had himself brought here from off his fathers grave in new england standing beside the notetaking lady kneeling there i recognize one of my not too distant neighbors an elderly proudlooking woman by reputation a great church worker the kneeling lady rises and is introduced to me she speaks with a marked southern accent when she laughingly explains that her husband had refused to accompany her to the affair he had stated that john brown gave the south enough trouble while he was living and he her husband being a southerner had no desire to see any more of him nor to meet with any of the rabblerousers who again so recently have come to upset the peace of south with their protests their law suits and their agitators i felt it unwise to pursue a topic of conversation so very controversial i simply shrugged my shoulders and looking up alarmed at the swiftly overcast sky i said could john brown be here today i wonder what he would think my neighbor friend gave me an oblique smile as if to say between you and me i might add something to that and she did at this very place and almost a hundred years to the day it was that john brown told mary brown his wife not to distress herself over what a neighbor had said so disparagingly about him i suddenly recalled that i stood in the presence of a descendant of that very neighbor why you know she gloatingly whispered my great grandfather did not think so much of john brown my people turning to me as you must know were his very close neighbors in fact it was my greatgrandfather who helped care for the brown family when the abolitionist left them on his wild adventure south my father once told me that his grandfather always maintained that john brown was gods damnest fool we stood a bit shocked we were hushed by the fact that this nice churchgoing lady would use the name of god in vain and on the sabbath too suddenly from the mountain range a terrific wind blew up a very black cloud gathered directly over us it did seem as if john brown had overheard and resented my neighbors remarks everyone ran for his car i arrived home just as the storm broke it was like a cloudburst it darkened the whole countryside bodies of water like overflowing turbulent rivers poured down on everything i looked up and out of my window over the turmoil of the downpour i could just barely detect the tip of the gold cross standing atop the stone church steeple the other side of main street i clenched my fists i cried out in my heart give em hell john brown give em hell the crispus attacks story it was a moonlit night made brighter by the new snow that blanketed the cobblestone streets groups of young men paraded up and down king street around the commons speaking in hushed tones casting hostile glances in the direction of the british soldiers standing guard and moving about the commons it seemed that resentments of the past five years mounting in intensity had reached the point of explosion the very atmosphere of boston was electric with tension what had been for many years only routine disgruntlement became with implementation of the hated stamp act a cause that was november the citizens of boston had resisted protested refused to cooperate and the act was repealed the following march but then the stamp act was followed by measures only slightly more bearabletaxes on glass paper lead tea plus a law establishing a civil list making local officials responsible only to the king of england the people demonstrated cried taxation without representation to humble them the kings agents brought in two regiments of british troops and when the citizens refused to house them the troops were billeted on the commons and in faneuil hall this stratagem had not worked of course the people became more bitter their resentment flared into taunts incidents between the redcoats and people of the town occurred more frequently and now this day march a british soldier had struck a small boy with the butt of a musket some man among the townsmen called out to the soldiers and hard words were exchanged the soldiers stepped forward to face one of the roving gangs the two groups squared off against each other the townsmen with cudgels and clubs the redcoats holding their muskets at the ready then from among the citizens a man named crispus attucks stepped forward he was tall somewhat burly with dark brown skin and hard curly hair beneath his cap he was a stevedore and sailor a husky man now in middle years known as the mulatto he faced the british soldiers and spoke out fearlessly the way to get rid of these soldiers is to attack the main guard he shouted strike at the root the roving crowds of townsmen drew up behind him voicing their agreement shouting their anger at the band of armed soldiers let us drive out these rascals they screamed they have no business heredrive them out an officer appeared and ordered the soldiers to run your bayonets through them the townspeople if the soldiers were attacked the soldiers began loading their muskets when they raised the rifles the townspeople surged forward accepting the challenge led by crispus attucks you cowardly rascals for bringing arms against naked men a citizen screamed lay aside your arms and we are ready for you attucks backed up by his sailor friends shouted let us fall upon the nest come on dont be afraid of themthey dare not fire knock them over with his club he aimed a blow at captain preston who had rushed out to command the soldiers the captain deflected the blow from attucks club the club knocked the musket from a soldiers hands attucks quickly seized the bayonet from the fallen musket but as he rose with it he was tackled by a british soldier why dont you fire cried someone from the ranks of the militia and the soldier stepped back and fired his musket crispus attucks fell dead on the commons in rapid succession five other muskets blared forth and four other citizens fell beside attucks two of them samuel gray and jonas caldwell died instantly the other two samuel maverick and patrick carr died later maverick the following morning carr on march the first blood of the american revolution had been shed the excitement which followed that massacre never abated the bells which were rung in the town calling the people of boston into the streets was the summons to arms and rebellion three days later a public funeral was held for the first martyrs of the rebellion four hearses met at a junction in king street and from there a procession moved six deep to the middle burying ground the four victims carr was still alive were buried in a common grave under a gravestone with the following legend long as in freedoms cause the wise contend dear to your country shall your fame extend while to the world the lettered stone shall tell where caldwell a ttucks gray and maverick fell for the next several years and until america had won independence from england march was celebrated as the principal american holiday to this day march is known as crispus attucks day and is marked by those who remember that crispus attucks was the first hero of the american revolution until that march evening when the finger of immortality pointed to him crispus attucks was little known even in boston he had been a slave and it is known that some years earlier he had fled from his master william browne of framingham mass for browne had advertised in the papers for attucks return the following commercial appeared in the boston gazette or weekly journal of tuesday october ranaway from his master william browne of framingham on the th of september last a mulatto fellow about years of age named crispus six feet two inches high short curld hair his knees nearer together than common had on a light colourd bearskin coat plain brown fustian jacket or brown allwool one new buckskin breeches blue yarn stockings and a checked woolen shirt whoever shall take up said runaway and convey him to abovesaid master shall have ten pounds old tenor reward and all necessary charges paid and all masters of vessels and others are hereby cautioned against concealing or carrying off said servant on penalty of the law boston october subsequent advertisements for attucks return appeared in the boston gazette on november and november and then attucks name and activities went unrecorded until after the events of march where did crispus attucks spend the intervening years no one knows for certain but scholars and researchers have offered many opinions the late john wesley dobbs of atlanta wrote crispus attucks might have gone to sea he might have visited foreign lands this we do not know but we do know that he was very much alive on march when he showed up on king street with a big stick in his hand ready to die and to become one of americas greatest heroes he died defending the honor integrity and selfrespect of all american citizens living then and the ones to be born later on according to dobbs attucks did two important things on the day he died he firmly established himself as a man of valor fortitude and bold enterprise he believed in that most precious american heritage of freedom and he made the down payment on liberty and freedom for all members of his racial group who were to live after him the martyrs grave that crispus attucks shares with his fellow patriots now lies in the northeast corner of the old cemetery between the park street church and the tremont building in boston it is near the grave of samuel adams one of the signers of the declaration of independence six years after attucks death but an even more imposing memorial to attucks heroism stands in boston commons the scene of the boston massacre and of attucks death it is a monument erected by the state of massachusetts in on the monument freedom holds in her left hand a broken chain and in her right the flag the american eagle sits at her feet on a bronze tablet the boston massacre is depicted crispus attucks lies dead and his fellowpatriots mortally wounded are falling back into the arms of the citizens the words of two great americans are carved into the monument those of daniel webster say from that moment we may date the severance of the british empire and those of john adams say on that night the foundation of american independence was laid and an american negro born a slave set the moment in motion allan morrison it is our feeling that the position of the negro in the theater is neither safe nor secure it is obvious that the negros share in the benefits of the american theater has never been commensurate with what he has given to it the theater has depended heavily on the negros vitality and creativity but has not accorded the negro artist equal status or opportunity artists have borrowed liberally from the negro but they have not seen fit to recognize the contribution with the honesty which should be consistent with american tradition they do not accept the negro as their equal in the performing arts since the time of the shakespearean actor ira aldridge who achieved great fame in europe negroes have had to fight to gain a place in the theater and express themselves there the fight goes on people in the theater and show business as a whole are fond of pointing to the socalled liberal tradition in their profession and declaring that artists do not discriminate those of us who have been around a while know that this is not true artists are capable of bias but to face the problem squarely and to put the responsibility where it belongs we must admit that the artists are not always responsible for the exclusion of negroes or other minorities or the refusal to make proper use of their skills and talent this is usually the prerogative of the producers and of those vitally importantand sinister influencesknown as sponsors recently we have heard about the energetic campaign of p jay sidney aimed at ending the unfair and distorted image of the negro projected by the theater the movie industry radio and tv he has not hesitated to tell people who are nationally known that they are phony liberals he has picketed the theatre guild the paramount talent association and others and he has achieved some result he has received assurances from some of these people that there will be an improvement in the american scene this is an important question now the united states is concerned about its image abroad but many of us are more concerned about the image at home the fight that the negro is waging is not only for an increase in the share of employment but for a difference in the portrayal of the negro there is the increasing importance of the presence of negroes in our society it is a national problem which is causing us embarrassment abroad the facts are rather depressing the truth is that the entertainment media of this country are not depicting the negro correctly and his contemporary role in society times have changed today the negro as citizen worker professional scientist has spread completely across the whole spectrum of this country negroes are entering new fields the change in conditions requires a parallel representation on the stage in the movies and on tv because of the aura of liberalism that has grown up around the theater it has been rather difficult to level strong charges against the theater or the other arts but i do not believe the arts can be exonerated from charges of race barriers within it barriers do exist against negroes and this is a denial of democracy but also it does a great disservice to the arts since it denies the logical use of the skills and talents of nonwhites ossie davis as to what the theater offers the negro performer writer director or producer now i would say it offers him an eitherora chance to fight like hell or starve to death i remember an occasion when we discussed the theater in american culture etc and this afternoon the theme might be better understood if we try to indicate where this particular part of the american scene fits into the total picture and i would like to give you some background thoughts and ideas to see what the fight is in the late s the supreme court of the united states gave the dred scott decision which was that the negro had no rights which the white man was bound to respect the civil war revoked that decision and put in its place the th th and th amendments and two civil_rights acts meant to show that the negroes had all the other fundamental and basic rights that anybody else had but at a later date in the supreme court threw out the substance of the amendments and substituted another rule which was that of separate but equal but what this meant was that you did not have to include the negro you did not have to respect all of his rights provided you gave him a token indication of membership in the human race and provided you gave him a separateand certainty not equalshare of the substance of this country then in this was reversed by the supreme court this latter philosophy embodies the minimum changes going on in this country today and that is simply fight the struggle to push to extend to all our citizens those rights previously reserved to the whites only all of us have suffered from this exclusion this perversion of our democratic heritage and it is as true in the theater as in other places so we come today to see what we can do to explain this fight to ourselves and to indicate how we might help to bring to fruition that democracy and the rights to which we are all entitled this particular aspect of the theater today is a depressing one and i would like to indicate briefly some of the nature of what we face as a negro and nonwhite performer in the theater i testified as a witness before actors equity as to the nature of the discrimination and the substance of my testimony was a sample drawn from one weeks fiscal statement in conjunction with the play with which i am associated and i showed by the report that in a negro show written by a negro featuring negroes and about negro life negro people were employed this is against all of the other employment figures for our show where we have stagehands none of whom are negro none of the ushers are negro none of the scrub ladies are negro and none of the other attendant functionaries are negro this in spite of the fact that my producer is not a man who attempts to discriminate what i am implying is that the exclusion of the negro from the theater is part of a system which was set in motion a long time ago and if we are to do what is necessary about eradicating this condition we must address ourselves to the system which automatically goes into operation the minute a negro becomes involved in a production much of this is automatic one thing having nothing to do with the particular choices of the people in positions of authority and power we must certainly address ourselves to getting that aspect of this question taken care of we must address ourselves to those who do have policymaking positions and who can hire more negroes practicing a fairer presentation of the american scene in their choice of players the american scene is far more integrated than we get when we go to broadway and when we look at tv and the movies i feel good about the future because it is my nature and i feel that men and women can do what they will and must do if they know what needs to be done if they agree why it needs to be done and if they are willing to bestir themselves to see that it gets done my feeling at the moment is that our position is going to get worse instead of better because the theater is going to get worse before it gets better and because we are not yet as a people as ready to face facts and implications as we ought to be we will discuss them think about them but to take a vital step and become active is something else normally what we do is acquire information express our willingness but draw back at the final commitment philip rose i am interested first in the remark about the final step raisin in the sun and purlie victorious represent very small steps because i am interested in integration in the theater and i dont think raisin in the sun or purlie victorious represent integration in the theaterrather they represent a reflection of our society and that integration does not exist in our society these plays are important but i am more interested in how do we fight forhow do we getintegration in the theater when we have an author like ossie davis who writes a play and we succeed in getting it on that is fine but i am interested in other playrights writing today and largely they just dont write parts for negro actors or directors when casting dont think in terms of negro actors i would like to throw out for discussion the questionhow do we break the door down how can we get through to the playwrights many of the plays that are presented could have more validity by showing negroes on the stage and this can do more to bring in money than a lot of other things now being done i feel that it has to begin with the playwright because finally what it must lead to if our society gets to that point is that eventually we can cast negroes simply as actors and they will not have to be cast in terms of their skin color and then we will have the theater showing the way instead of following behind what society is doing another thing is that we still have to go through many arguments with people because when you do a play with negro actors then you better be successful you can do plays which run for a week or two and nobody says anything but if you do a play with negro actors and it has a short run they say thats why it failed because there were negroes in it negro plays should have the right to fail too how do we proceed negroes could be used much more than they are why arent there negroes in subways are for sleeping there is nothing in new york probably which is as integrated as the subway i am doing a play now laid in rome but there are negroes in the chorus we have to show that it can be done by doing it stuart vaughan let me start by saying that i have just come back from europe where we spent eight months seeing foreign productions we came back to see what our feeling about the new york theater was going to be we went to various productions the two plays which we liked bestthe two productions we liked bestwere purlie victorious and moon on a rainbow shawl and the companies in those plays are in a great proportion negro performers i would like to say that after having seen the work of the berliner ensemble and others in europe mr daviss work stands up with the finest acting in the world and his play had an impact and drive which i responded to with great sympathy we have no need to apologize for the talents and abilities of our negro actors maybe because negroes have to fight to get where they are perhaps that is why they are so vital now i want to raise a problem i have directed a number of classical plays in new york and i want to raise this problem because i need to be informed i have tried to use negro performers in classical plays wherever i could and i have found myself limited by my own esthetic concepts which may be too narrow and i have found myself limited by the historical validity which is in the head of my audience negroes could be used in many of shakespeares plays but people are not used to the idea in some cases makeup solves the problem but of course in some cases it does not what are we going to do about this problem i do a play like the octoroon which has to do with the negroes past why did we do it perhaps to get a reaction of disagreement it was an artistic success in terms of what we were trying to do what should we do about plays which have a place in their historical past what do we do about the historical problem howard da silva all of this so far has been interesting because so many questions have been raised here does our problem begin with play writing what about casting i think the battle has to be waged on all fronts in all ways you need only read a few novels about negroes to realize how shabbily they have been treated in all the arts i would like to pose thiswe all work in the theater and the method has become second nature dont we know that there is a difference between the surface representational way of presenting an art and the evocative wayevoking the reality if you have a talented actor there before three minutes have gone by if an actor is creating you dont care if he is polkadotted it has been my experience that where you have a gifted performer the question of pigment is discarded very quickly by the audience which easily bridges the gap i would like to see us continue the battle on all frontsdo more to encourage the writing of works about negro life both contemporary and historical and cast negroes irrespective of pigmentation without waiting for a future time lets do it now ruby dee ive just read for a job doing a tv commercial and i want it desperately i would make a lot of money and it would be secure but the money would go back into the theater because the theater needs help one positive thing i feel todaythis is shown first with purlie victoriousfirst i want to commend the new producers like mr rose and the people of dedication like mr da silvaand to say that pur lie victorious is attracting a whole new kind of audience and that is wonderful people who never came to the theater before are coming to see purlie victorious and one feels as if one is reaching to appeal to ones source i feel happy that we can walk into a gathering of negroes and be applauded for our performance that is importantthat more of us are encouraged to come to the theater if we encourage more negroes to come to the theater purlie victorious will have repaid its backers i feel if there is some forward thrust to life there is life and hope and something that people of good intention can do in the world is to encourage the negro audience of course i believe in integration but before one can integrate we must think in terms of equals i would love to see negro producers i would like to see negro money take over some of the houses then we could say that we will develop this kind of talent we will put in the american scene a new look a new life we will encourage our writers and assure them of a market this is all very indefinite but before there can be real respectartist for artistwe must seize the reins we must equate when we operate in terms of the pattern of society we get a certain kind of respect and help and it may be that in the theater by seizing the reins we will accomplish something by getting a new audience purlies pearls we want our cut of the constitutionnot with a spoon but with a shovel im a great one for racial pride its just that i dont need it in my line of work man if slavery comes back i want to be your agent you are a disgrace to the negro profession why some of the best acting in the world is done in front of white folks purlie victorious judson the irreverent reverend in ossie davis play purlie victorious a little ary his one was going to t be a jewel really a perfect jewel isobel snead could hardly wait to tell the girls at bridge this afternoon after the succession of clumsy incompetent maids she had had to let go one right after the other it would be a relief to put the children and the house into helens hands helen she tasted the name found it flat a little ordinary she decided like ellen and edith or may isobel liked names with a flair reaching on the night table for pencil and paper the thought came to her again like a fat maggot that she must have been completely witless to have married alfred snead you just knew a man with a name like that drank beer and from a bottle every time she heard a name like cartwright or rhinelander she wanted to kill alfred now she started to scribble roxanne illena helena there it was under her very nose helene of course with a carrot after the last e or whatever it was they called that little jigger they used in spanish or was it french she lay back on her pillow thinking how beautifully impressive it would look when writing to her sister back on the farm helene is quite adequate in a foreign sort of way the children adore her and have been behaving beautifully after the last one then at bridge this afternoon she curled her toes thinking about it when you said helene people just naturally thought of someone aristocratic well no not that at least not in a maid but she did have a grecian air about her tall aloof and just awfully efficient she was probably a bit stupid back of that madonnalike expression but you didnt really have to know anything to be a domestic really those girls were always feeling sorry for themselves but if they only knew it they were the lucky ones at least they didnt have to get in the rat race called culture where you had to be on your toes every minute for fear you would get caught off guard and say something wrong she closed her eyes and sighed luxuriously she would have the girls greeneyed at bridge and how too perfectly lucky that helene fitted the size twelve uniforms they had on hand now alfred wouldnt have a chance to blow his stack about buying a new batch he loathed having the girls wear uniforms she rolled over spreading her arms high on the pillow it was simply delicious she decided being able to lie in bed without hearing the morning ruckus of the children she thought now of the girl calling the children to dinner alto fred still called it supper helene would say firmly going right up to them dinner is being served children you will come now some of the other girls in the block in just any kind of a dripdry would yell out loudly you kids coming suppers on she yawned hating the thought of getting up but it was nearing ninethirty and she wanted to watch the girl a few hours before leaving to play bridge after all she had only come three days ago but what a blessed three days the change in the children was simply unbelievable she never had seen two such rude illtempered disagreeable children as chrissy and roger had been this past year which just proved you couldnt be too careful about selecting a maid chrissy had the makings of a lady underneath it all like her mother but roger was quite like his father quite boorish at times she watched the morning breeze play with the curtains alfred had not yet come up to tell her goodbye before leaving for the office she wondered if helene had offended him not that he was easily upset no he was too thickskinned for that more than likely he had angered her it was just like him with his coarse brand of humor she cringed thinking of his morning greeting to that other one what was her name well girlie this egg aint even been laid yet and worse yet his oolala when a vulgar fat gyrating alfred was just leaving she heard him say ouilafo as he opened the front door she walked upstairs slowly and sat down on the vanity to think it was very quiet downstairs too quiet she thought as far back as she could remember the children had made so much noise in the morning she hadnt been able to sleep they were such lively healthy uninhibited youngsters so very normal i since this helen had come they had been acting subdued queer sort of it just wasnt natural for children to be so quiet and well behaved why they were frightened that was it that girl had them scared they were cowed into being good her headache had cleared now she started to dress thinking it over she realized that all along she had thought the girl had a mean eye it was the madonnalike expression that fooled one for the sake of the children she would just have to let her go it was too bad really how would she ever be able to teach the children not to be prejudiced when one right after the other failed to prove himself her self she corrected mentally no color line in hell say once there tt was a negro in at ii lanta who had made up his mind to commit s j mcs suicide so one day he went down to the main street and took the freight elevator up to the top of the highest building in town in fact the highest skyscraper in georgia negroes could not ride the passenger elevators but he was so anxious to commit suicide that he did not let jim crow stand in his way he rode as freight once at the top of the building he took off his coat drew a deep breath approached the ledge and jumped off he went hurtling through the air and was just about to hit the sidewalk when he saw a white woman come around the corner he knew he had better not fall on that white woman so he curved and went right on back up there was another negro who one day came to a strange town in mississippi where he had never been before when he got off the bus he did not see any of the race around so he asked a white man where do the colored folks hang out here the white man pointed at a great big tree in the public square and said do you see that limb negroes in arkansas when you ask them what life is like in tennessee will tell you the white folks are so bad in memphis that black folks cant even drink white milk but if you ask negroes in tennessee what it is like in arkansas they will say man in that state you better not even put your black feet in no white shoes there are innumerable variations on the use of the word white in the south they say for example presumably in fun that the reason negroes eat so many blackeyed peas in dixie and in louisiana so many red beans is because for years after the emancipation colored people did not dare ask a storekeeper for white beans red beans or blackeyed peas okay but it was not until folks began using the term navy beans that ne groes had the nerve to purchase white beans too in a wylie avenue hashhouse one day i heard a negro say to another one at the counter here you are up north ordering white bean soup man i know you are really free now everybody laughed some of these types of jokes are even laid on animals they say there was once a black cat in mobile who decided to head for chicago because he had always heard that up north there was no color line hardly had that cat gotten to chicago than he met a white cat desirous of being shown about the black cat said to the white cat lets go round the town but the white cat said to the black cat you better set your black self down in some places so another pleasantry goes white folks are so mean they will not give a negro the time of day a colored man said to a white man what time is it sir the white man asked the negro do you play chess the negro said yes sir the white man said then its your time to move these and hundreds of other jokes of a similar nature which negroes tell on themselves belong in the category of white is right yellow mellow but black get back their humor is the humor of frustration and the laughter with which these sallies are greeted for all its loudness is a desperate laughter white people often do not understand such humor at all negroes do and such jokes told at appropriate moments amuse them no end shortly after the big detroit race riots a cartoon appeared in a negro newspaper that harlemites thought highly if wryly hilarious but no white person to whom i have ever shown it even cracks a smile let alone laughs aloud the cartoon pictures a wall in a sportsmans den on which the heads of the game he has bagged are hung a deers head an elks head a tigers head among them mounted like the others is a negro head two little white boys are looking at the head one little boy pointing at the negros head tells the other youngster my daddy got that one in detroit last week most such jokes however are at the expense of the south in harlem they say a young mothertobe about to bear her first child decided to go back down south to be with her mother when the great event came her young husband tried to keep her from going pointing out to her that aside from having better hospital facilities new york had no jim crow wards and colored physicians could attend patients in the hospitals in the south one often has to have a white doctor since many hospitals there will not permit negro doctors to practice inside their walls still the expectant mother insisted on going home to mama the father in harlem waited and waited for news of the birth of his child no news came the ninth month passed the tenth month passed finally he phoned his wife and told her something must be wrong to go to the hospital anyhow and be examined she went the white physician marvelled that her child had not yet come putting his earphones to his ears and baring her abdomen he pressed his instrument against her flesh to listen for the prenatal heartbeats of the unborn child instead what he heard quite clearly and distinctly inside the body of the mother was a sugar chile robinson type of voice singing the blues wont be born down here wont be born down here if you want to know what its all about as long as south is south wont come out no i wont be born down here he wasnt she had to come on back to new york to have her baby harlemites swear that that colored child had plenty of sense a great many jokes with which negroes regale each other but seldom tell white folks are hardly complimentary to racial intelligence jokes relating to tardiness are among them some such jokes even go so far as to blame the darkness of the race upon a lack of punctuality on that morning long ago in the dawning of creation when the lord called upon mankind to wash in the river of life they say that everybody promptly went down to the water to wash except the negroes the negroes lingered and loitered along the way dallied and played and took their own good time getting down to the river when they got there the other folks had used up all the water and had emerged whiter than snow in the river bed after so much washing the negroes found only a little mud into the mud they waded with their bare feet late in their desperation they bent down and put the palms of their hands in the mud too by that time even the mud was used up therefore to this day nothing is light about negroes except the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet late always late other jokes relate to behavior and how a negro in so far as these jokes go will always snarl things up even in heaven they say the first time a negro went to heaven all the other angels became excited when they heard he was coming and had prepared a great welcome for him even saint peter and the lord were moved at the prospect of greeting the first member of the darkest race into celestial glory in honor of the occasion the gates of pearl were shining and the streets of gold had been polished until each cobblestone gleamed but what did that negro do that negro was so excited when he first got his wings that he took off then and there at top speed and would not stop flying he flew and he flew and he flew and he flew in his crown of gold and his snow white robes he lifted up his wings and flew like mad from the east to the west from the north to the south up and down and all throughout the universe he whizzed by the golden throne at miles per hour wings spread like a constellation he flew around gods footstool so fast the cherubinis thought he was greased lightning he went past st peter at such speed that he started a tailwind on the golden streets finally saint peter said whoa but that negro did not stop peter sent a band of angels out to catch him but they could not get anywhere near that negro gabriel blew his horn but he paid him no mind he was a flying soul he made wings do what wings had never been known to do before he looped a loop in the sky then he looped another loop and tied a knot that negro was gone solid gone he scattered feathers all over heaven and stirred up such a gale that the lord god himself stood up and cried stop when he stopped that negro skidded bang into the pearly gates broke one wing smack off knocked his crown into eternity snagged his robes wide open and fell panting at the foot of the throne saint peter just looked at him and said just like a negro in the category of the bawdy joke there are hundreds illustrating the prevalent folk belief in the amorous prowess of the negro male many such jokes cut across the color line in boastful fashion they say a white man came home one cold winter night to find his golden blond wife on the living room divan deep in the loving arms of a great big dark negro petrified in his astonishment the white man forgot to close the front door the icy winds rushed in thinking his wife was being raped in a frenzy he cried darling what shall i do to this negro she sighed from the couch just shut the door so he wont catch cold even in hell according to the joke makers a negro is hell since for so long negroes had had such a hard time on earth as compensation up until the end of the civil war all of them automatically went to heaven when they died but after lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation and things got a little easier for negroes on this globe the lord decided to send a few colored folks to hell the first negro consigned to the devil was a tall strapping man of color who in his day had been a great lover from st louis to the gulf because his boudoir skills left him so little time for grace the lord said send that negro to hell so peter threw him out of heaven no sooner did the negro set foot in hell than he grabbed the devils daughter and ruined her ten minutes later he enticed the devils wife behind a hot rock and ruined her about this time the devils mother came along the negro grabbed her and ruined her the devil suddenly became aware of this mighty despoilation trembling for the first time since he had been ruler of hell he fell to his knees and called on god for help lord please take this negro out of here before he ruins me whether or not hell then began to draw the color line the story does not say but negro jokes often draw a color line through their humor in such a fashion that only a negro can appreciate them certain aspects of the humor of minority groups are often so inbred that they are not palatable for outside consumption there are thousands of jewish jokes that rarely reach the ears of gentiles and if they did they might be embarrassing to the ears of both groups so it is with negro humora part of it is intended only for negroes to others such jokes are seldom funny anyhow the point is lost for often the nuances are too subtle for alien comprehension a joke is not a joke when nobody laughs by sandra e haggerty no one would know if you didnt tell them the old lady seated next to me smiled reassurringly rich thats it they must be rich she turned to the girl sitting next to her and went on only the rich ones go to college my brother and i tried to suppress our obvious amazement we were in utah heading via bus to utah state university in logan this was our first encounter with a native loganite many similar experiences were to follow in what is called by some the last stronghold of the mormons as the bus wheeled its way northward through sardine canyon and down into cache valley i was in awe of the picturesque beauty so unlike my stereotyped idea of what utah should look like i expected barren desert land as far as the eye could see i later learned the topography of the areaits marvelous mountain ranges and desert lands we got off the bus at logans small combination restaurantbus station and surveyed main street simultaneously we were being surveyed always before when people stared i was egotistical enough to think it was due to an attractive personal appearance but having spent most of my time in denver new york city and california all fairly cosmopolitan areas this had never been a problem but in logan well logan turned out to be a utopia of provinciality foreignersthose not only from foreign countries but those foreign to cache valley were out of place we took the towns only taxi and went up on the aggie hill we soon discovered that there was no university housing available then came the search for a place to live we went to several private homes advertising student housing only to be rebuffed with sorry no smokers no drinkers and no foreigners it was then we realized that we were not being recognized as negroes but as iraqis persians etc my brother and i are fairskinned negroes we learned that many of the people in the area had never come in contact with negroes and were not aware of the great variation of skin color hair texture etc that exists among american negroes finally allowing the landlord to believe that we were iranian students we acquired a small three room house situated down on the island which was really too far from the campus for walking but we did not realize this at the time still excited about attending a new college that year it was my senior year and my brother was beginning as a freshman we cleaned up the little house and the next day headed for the campus after registration we found there were eleven other negro students on campus all but one were on athletic scholarships i was the only negro girl on campus we immediately learned the magnitude of influence the mormon church had in the city on the people and on the university the first statements i heard concerning the mormon religion were biased coming from the other negro students the foreign students and the jack mormons mormons who had broken away from the church the mormons believe the negro is cursed they believe the negro is inherently inferior the negro cannot belong to their church negroes are not allowed to step inside their temples tabernacles or wards their religion is the only true religion the first quarter passed with no major incidents most of our contacts were with other negro students and the foreign students of which there were about on campus most coming from iran iraq africa the west indies and south america most of these students were in the agricultural fields sadly to say many of them had been only to logan and had not visited other places in the states consequently they were forming opinions about the united states using logan as an example and sadly to say hate the lds latter day saints talk was prominent among them i felt kind of greedy in my contacts with the foreign students there was so much to be learned from them so many new ideas to be gleaned from and exchanged with them i felt sad that so many people in logan could not see the wealth of faraway places that had been brought to their doorsteps winter quarter my brother and i moved into the dorms on campus when i went to report for my room the house mother asked my name i told her she looked all through her room chart and couldnt seem to find my name i told her i thought the room number was still not looking at me her eyes scanned to room and she murmured no thats not it two ne she looked up at me embarrassed now excuse me dear what did you say your name was i repeated my name and added and i am a negro my roommate was the only other negro girl on campus that quarter shortly thereafter came the big blowup several of the white girls were known to be dating negro fellows this had been going on for some time but never so out in the open the school administration was bombarded with complaints from various sources one sunday afternoon all the negro fellows were called together the content of the meeting was ambiguous reports varied depending on which of the fellows was telling about it but in essence the problems of interracial dating were discussed and the negroes were asked not to date the white girls the next day the whole campus was buzzing about the meeting accounts varied and stories were grossly distorted rumors ran rampant the colored guys will be expelled if they are seen with white girls they will lose their scholarships the guys wont be allowed to play ball the following day a discussion group hashed over the subject a committee was selected to see the president to clear up rumors and to ascertain university policy concerning the subject of interracial dating during the meeting the president stated that the rumors were untrue that the negroes social activities would have no bearing on their athletic and academic activities the furor eventually died down then there was the night utah state played brigham young university a long time bosom enemy of states i was particularly anxious to see the game because the star player on byus team was an old school buddy of mine during the game a fight ensued between one of our negro players and my friend on the other team reportedly name callingthe seemingly favorite insult between white and blackwas the cause of the ruckus at any rate feelings were keyedup and after the aggie victory i went to the opponents dressing room to say hello to my friend the hallway outside the dressing room was filled with angry byuers this was another time when seemingly i was not recognized readily as being a negro i listened to the talk those dirty niggers play like animals usu should be barred from the conference everytime we come down here those black niggers start a fight theyre not athletes theyre animals id never been so disappointed in humanity at that moment my date for the evening who happened to be a dark skinned negro pushed his way through the crowd to find me i took his arm and stood very close to him everyone became quiet all eyes were upon us some faces seemed to mirror disbelief others distaste and dislike and still others a somewhat apologetic look about this time the players came filing out of the dressing room my date asked a tall fellow standing near us if he would call my friend he looked at us strangely and called again silence evidently people thought there was going to be another fight my friend walked over seriously then his eyes dropped down to me and a big grin broke across his face we chatted excitedly i learned he had married one of my girl friends tensions relaxed slightly but we were still the center of attraction after goodbys and an invitation to visit in brigham city my date and i left followed by stares i later found out that byus favorite nickname for usu was usuall designating the growing negro attendance in an effort to understand logan the people and their religion i often talked to a returned missionary whom i had classes with i also took the utah history course the memorable thing my missionary friend told me when i asked about the mormon attitude toward the negro why negroes could not hold the priesthood i wanted to know i had learned that negroes could be members of the church and that there were negro mormons was this analogy suppose a father has two sons certainly he loves both of them very much however one of the sons as in many families is a little more capable a little more conscientious than the other son this does not mean that the father loves him any more on the contrary a parent seems to love the seemingly less competent child more due to his need anyway this father has a huge fortune that he must leave to his sons it is natural that he should give this responsibility of wealth to the son who is most capable of taking care of it so it is with the priesthood i did not agree with my friend in this line of thinking but it was a concept that i had not heard previously on several occasions the negro students were invited to be panel members in some of the sociology and psychology classes some of the questions asked of us were unbelievable are negro babies born black are negroes sexually more potent is it true that negroes have speech defects there were many and varied explanations for why the negro exists and why he is black and needless to say a great deal of time was spent discussing the issue depending on who the explanation was coming from and the seriousness of the speaker these statements were sometimes fascinating sometimes humorous and at times disgusting but always highly interesting cain killed abel and all cains descendants were cursed with black skins ham son of noah had a black wife whose descendants were cursed with black skins there are three lives the before life the here and now life and the after life the people who lived wicked lives in the before life are cursed with black skins in the here and now life the negro today however all is not lost for the black man by leading a good life now may redeem himself and his white skin for the following life and then the negro students joined the act and added such explanations as in the beginning everyone was black god sent a big rain for everyone to wash themselves the rains came and everyone except one lazy fellow washed away the blackness when he awoke only a puddle of water remained and he was able to wash only the bottoms of his feet and the palms of his hands the lord baked his people when he made them and he simply cooked some longer than others some he burned up completely there were many jokes circulated among the nonmormon students about the mormon religion and its founders joseph smith and brigham young calling joseph smith ol joe or mighty joe young and brigham young brig and pres was common about this time a book entitled mormonism and the negro was being sold in the book store briefly it dealt with the curse of black skins that the negro is under and why the book in my opinion was ridiculous it caused quite a bit of commotion and i was pleased to learn that it was not endorsed by the mormon church through my study of utah history and my association with the professor who taught the course i gained an appreciation and understanding of the mormon people which i had not had previously i found their history to be exciting and unique in many instances their pioneering spirit the incorporation of religion and everyday living and the fight against persecution for the practice of polygamy in the early days are admirable even though i could never believe in the mormon religion i respect it i would like to see a greater reciprocation of respect for differences in this area in the past few years this university has grown appreciably athletic wise due in great part to the negro athletes recruited from other states if this is to continue the university is going to have to offer these athletes and other outsiders as well much more than a continuing battle against provinciality is the negro really ready preach brothertjpjtt hood help the han vv dicapped do unto others as you would have others do unto youbut where are these people when a helping hand is needed where are the people who expound all their theories on how we should help one another when the boys at the bar will listen where are the people who make such public displays of contributing to the most fashionable charity in other words where are all the phonies hearts to the sincere plea of a person in need there are those who have practiced what they preach those who have quietly aided others in a less favorable position but they are few and far between lets stop crying in publicand start helping in private for only in this way will we ever reach our goal the old line of no one wants to help us is oldhat for no one will help you if you dont first attempt to help yourself lets stop putting the burden completely on the white man and shoulder some of it ourselves when the day comes that we have helped one another to the best of our abilityand have exhausted all outletsthen turn to others for additional help for thenand only thencan we say that this old world still has a fighting chance that our children have a past to be proud of and a future to look forward to with anticipation does the bible support segregation several years ago a new bishop was appointed to a certain diocese in the southern united states the bishop was a yankee and his flock both priests and laity were somewhat apprehensive as to how tu he would conduct himself in the delicate area of race relations shortly after his arrival he called together the clergy of his diocese when he appeared before them he was holding a copy of the bible in his hand fathers he said i will accept any policy on race relations that squares with this his priests and people understood him this statement marked the beginning of steady progress in realizing a truly christian policy of racial integration in the churches and institutions of that diocesebut in recent weeks we have been subjected to the dismaying sight of a catholic laywoman defying the bishop of her diocese on the basis that his directive on the desegregation of the new orleans catholic schools contradicts the plain teaching of the bible now while it is true that down through the ages the bible has been used by men to justify the most heinous of crimes we need only think of cromwells psalmsinging soldiers in our day it is hard to take the allegation that the bible teaches segregation seriously we might not be too surprised to find a backwoods snakehandler espousing this doctrine or some south afrikaner supporter of apartheid but to find such an attitude among catholics is a shock and a scandal i have not made any survey as to how prevalent such ideas are among catholics in this country but i seriously doubt that the lady in question is in any sense representative of the laity in the south or anywhere else but perhaps just for the record we might inquire into the merits of the case can we find anything in the bible which justifies racial segregation the racist has certain pet passages which he loves to quote out of context both literary and historical genesis the first book of the bible is a favorite quarry of texts for the rabid segregationist ironically enough one of the principal aims of this book is to show the unity of the whole human race both in regard to its origin and its destiny let us examine a few of these passages in the fourth chapter of genesis we read gods words to cain cursed shalt thou be a wanderer and a fugitive on the face of the earth and the lord put a mark on cain gen this text from the story of cain is actually pointless when taken as a justification for segregation cain was a criminal who had just killed his brother abel the lords curse was his punishment for that crime and no one can seriously speak of membership in any particular race as being a crime original sin too has sometimes been interpreted by racists as an early attempt at integration satans words to eveyou yourselves will be like gods gen are thus supposed to reflect her desire to rise above her station it is hard to suppress a smile at such mangling of the text adam and eve did indeed sin by trying to arrogate divinity to themselves but to equate this with the demand of any human being for equal rights based on common humanity and citizenship is nothing short of nonsense but the biblethumping segregationist goes on to find other texts and one of his favorites comes from the sixth chapter of genesis the sons of god seeing the daughters of men that they were fair took to themselves wives of all which they chose and god seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth repented that he had made man miscegenation cries the segregationist biblical scholars for centuries have puzzled over the meaning of this obscure passage one thing however is clear this passage has nothing whatever to do with racial mixing here the book of genesis is talking about groups which it represents as being just a few generations removed from their common ancestors no racial differences could have developed in such a short span what about the oftrepeated allegation that the sons of noah ham shem and japheth are the ancestors of the modern races this is based on genesis and the sons of noah who came out of the ark were shem ham and japheth these three are the sons of noah and from these was all mankind spread over the whole earth bible scholarscatholic and noncatholic alikeare agreed that this verse was never intended as an historical explanation of the racial origins of mankind in races of the old testament a h sayce remarks attempts have been made to explain the names of the three sons of noah as referring to the color of skin japheth has been compared with the assyrian ippatu white shem with the assyrian samu olivecolored while in ham etymologists have seen the hebrew kham to be hot but all such attempts are of very doubtful value it is for instance a long stride from the meaning of heat to that of blacknessa meaning indeed which the hebrew word never bears but even if we were to grant that this passage is concerned with racial differences at most it would indicate that the biblical author was aware of various racial differences and could by no stretch of the imagination be regarded as a justification of the practice of racial segregation everyone im sure remembers the story of the tower of babel from chapter of genesis the tower which was going to reach to the heavens which god prevented when he made the various groups working on it speak in different languages and so be unable to understand each other and which ultimately led to their separation from each other the segregationist grabs this text too as proof that races must be kept separated but this interpretation completely misses the point of the story we are dealing here with a parable on the pride of man the diversity of languages and consequent dispersion is seen as a decline from the primitive unity of the human family and not as a step along the road of progress to the racist abrahamwho in some ways was a champion of exclusivenessmay seem the patron saint of segregation but his exclusiveness was tribal not racial in fact the difference between abraham and the neighboring peoples was no greater than that between the english and the scotch abrahams first son ishmael had an egyptian mother agar and cetura who bore abraham six children genesis and was a northern arabian actually abrahams apparent zeal for racial purity in making isaac his heir and in sending his other children away was occasioned by sarahs sharp tongue and confirmed by gods selection of isaac as the one through whom he would fulfill his promises to abraham abraham himself had been quite willing to make either ishmael or his slave eliezer his heir and his concern to obtain a wife for isaac from his own people was merely an example of the bedouins concern for tribal solidarity and lets look for a second at some of the other great names of the old testament moses wife sephora came from the land of madian which was a part of arabia exodus even a casual reading of the book of kings shows that the harems of david and solomon were certainly a mixed bag but perhaps the outstanding example of extratribal marriage in the old testament is found in ruth the moabitess ancestress of both david and christ himself in short the ancient israelites were a blend of mediterranean peoples and any attempt to claim that they were concerned about racial purity is a myth the one real example of an attempt to prohibit intermarriage with nonjews by the priest ezra and the governor nehemiah was based on spiritual motives nonjews were pagans and there was real concern that intermarriage would cause defections from the faith of israel another popular prooftext is verse of the th chapter of leviticus do not breed any of vour domestic animals with others of a different species do not sow a field of yours with two different kinds of seed and do not put on a garment woven with two different kinds of thread the purpose of this piece of legislation was a religious one it was to inculcate practices which would serve as reminders of a religious truth the need to preserve the faith of israel undefiled by any admixture with pagan cults like much of old testament law it has been superseded by the new testament and no longer is binding on us yet the tortuous reasoning of the segregationist would seem to be that although we no longer have to avoid the mixtures expressly condemned in this passage we plant hybrid corn wear suits made of dacron and wool and crossbreed cattle we must treat it as the biblical warrant for avoiding a kind of mixture never even hinted at in the text we might summarize the old testament attitude on racial segregation by saying very simply that the ancient israelites had no such concern those passages which might at first glance seem to lend support however fanciful to segre gationist views are either concerned with other matters entirely are examples of tribal suspicion of the stranger or based upon religious and not racial grounds in turning to the new testament we find that jesus himself was by no means of pure stock both st matthew chapter one and st luke chapter three give christs family tree and in both accounts of it we find several nonjews but still more important the new testament teaching of christ and the apostles offers no foothold for the segregationist actually it provides much more support to those who would abolish every sort of invidious discrimination st paul summarizes the whole new testament teaching on the unity of mankind in christ to the galatians he writes no longer is there jew or greek no longer is there slave or freeman no longer is there male or female you are all one in christ jesus galatians he reminds the ephesians christ it is who has made both jew and gentile one and has broken down the partition wall of hostility which separated them ephesians against this background of new testament thought we might pose a different question from the one with which we began this inquiry if the bible neither supports nor tolerates segregation does it demand integration the scene of judgment described by matthew chap indicates that there is one and only one decisive question christ will ask us have you loved your neighbor as yourself he has never assured us that such love is free of risk it may well mean risk of health or wealth or even life itself but neither has he offered to excuse us because of such risks of course the problem of integration or segregation is a modern problem it did not exist in the world of the bible but this modern problem nevertheless demands the light which biblical teaching on human relations can and does shed upon it how can any christian seriously maintain that segregation is compatible with christianity or refuse to work actively in so far as he is able for the elimination of this scandal from the modem world the unity of mans origin and destiny the community of mans fall and redemption the demand of christ for a love that surmounts all barriers of social or class distinction leaves no other alternative do not be surprised brothers if the world hates you you know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers he who does not love abides in death everyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him little children let us not love merely in word or with tongue but in action in reality i john a kind of homecoming oday february i set foot on african soil for the first time i had expected and anticipated a spiritual excitement a kind of dramatic consciousness of identity with the spirits of ancestors long dead and unknown and i wished very hard to feel something anything truly different after the long hours in the airplane but all that happened was the heat which soon had my shirt sticking to my back in the short walk from the plane to the airport lounge airport guards with rifles or with pistols holstered at their sides yet wearing friendly smiles and saluting the travelers with friendly gestures of welcome the sky blue and clear and limitlessly empty except for the large wrynecked carrion crows which circled lazily patiently confident that sooner or later they would find a meal the long ride to the hotel in conakry capital of the former french colony of guinea along a narrow asphalt road fringed with trees suddenly and sweetly familiar the trees of boyhood and hometown cocoanut palms curving sinuously upward their tufted tops swaying in disdainful majesty above the green banana and papaya trees mango trees so deeply green each leaf seemed to be in shadow breadfruit and laden orange trees here and there a clump of the sweet cassava plant or the blooming hibiscus and bougainvillea and now it came to me in a tearstarting rush i had seen it all before in the british guiana of my boyhood all of it the crows and the trees and the low huts strawthatched with walls and floors of packed clay as the car sped along the road i caught glimpses of familiar faces long remembered and i had the feeling that if i leaned out and called out a name someone would answer with pleased recognition as i approached the center of conakry the feeling of being in familiar surroundings decreased probably because the buildings seemed so strange square and shuttered tenthirty in the morning and everywhere groups of people sitting at doorways or outside the shops or in the shade beside the road men always the men sitting dozing or in friendly argument among themselves men talking and laughing while women moved among them with bundles or large household vessels balanced casually on their heads and tiny children strapped straddlelegged on their backs in front of the shops the innumerable tailors each one pedaling industriously on his treadletype sewing machine undisturbed by the talk and laughter of the groups of men around them who had plenty of time to stand stare and comment and the others those easily identifiable as strangers always in groups of four or more strongfeatured men who reminded me of the drillers and surveyors and oilmen of maracaibo but without their easy banter and ribaldry russians czechs and chinese all looking serious and dedicated as if determined to prove that they were not tourists i called at the bank to change some travelers checks into the local currency but finding it closed during the midday lunch period not much lunch for the staff i thought for now is the time of ramadan the moslem month of fasting i wandered around and sat in the bar st germain for a beer and sandwich nine chinese eight men and one woman sat at a nearby table waiting to be served the lunch they ordered meanwhile reading technical pamphlets and books with hardly a single word exchanged between them the waiter a friendly little man originally from somewhere in the west indies noticed my interest in the chinese group we call them the miracle workers he said they build well and very quickly have you seen the exposition building i replied that i didnt know there was one nice he said very nice and they build it like that and he snapped finger and thumb to indicate high speed the men were lean hardlooking and young the woman slim and petite her hair severely short her face impassive and without makeup when the food arrived they kept their books open and read while they ate as if the food held little interest for them and was merely a necessary interruption in the flow of more positive endeavors other people dropped into the bar and my friend the waiter would say russian or american one partly graying man approached my table greeted me in french and sat down he said he was a correspondent from yugoslavia in guinea to cover the impending visit of marshal tito now i know why there are all the flags and street decorations i said well partly he replied most of them are left over from the visit of the russian premier who was here a short while ago i returned to the bank in the afternoon the staff was just arriving and was busy shaking hands with each other in the french manner the bank is a large building the offices at street level with several other customers white and black i waited at the counter while the staff showered each other with courtesies they were all very young and when they were finally seated at their desks and had begun their various activities they seemed very slow and inexperienced typewriters and adding machines were operated slowly and ponderously and i had the feeling that they were all in training if not completely new to the job when finally a clerk approached me he took what seemed to be an awfully long time to complete several forms then i was told to sit and wait so i stood at a barred window and watched the movement in the street outside people spitting all over the place so with some disgust i turned away awful isnt it a man was standing beside me he too must have been watching the people i mean the spitting he went on but theres a reason for it theyre fasting most of them and what with the heat and the dust it is very difficult to swallow the saliva so they spit same thing in all moslem countries try fasting and you might feel yourself wanting to spit too he was tall and thin and very red as if new to the heat and strong sunshine he spoke in english each word clearly and carefully enunciated as is the case when one is using a foreign language his thin bony face had a sharp intelligent look but pleasant with curiosity and understanding it must be difficult for them in this heat i replied not knowing what else to say theyre accustomed to it he said its one of the things that binds these people together their religion and helps to rally them for political action when necessary which part of africa you from im from the west indies i answered and i am visiting africa for the first time to take a look at things i come from prague he told me im a teacher i am here helping to train teachers so we talked about teaching i mentioned that i had taught in schools in britain and referred to the kind of problems i had encountered there in guinea he said there was never any problem of discipline because religious and other influences conditioned the child to respect his elders and the educated person commanded a position of prestige the main problem was how best to meet the acute shortage of schools teaching staff and equipment and at the same time keep pace with the hunger for education which was everywhere in evidence as i spoke with him i realized that he had a real and simple belief in human dignity and his work was important in that it was geared to a readiness to be sympathetic and helpful i noticed that while talking the time had slipped away and we were still waiting for our money so i approached the clerk who had attended me and asked if there was any reason for the delay everything is ready he replied but the cashier has not yet returned from lunch he was very matteroffact about it and i felt myself becoming impatient and irritable especially as the clerk casually ignored me and went on laboriously adding figures on a machine the czech teacher said this is not paris or london you know after all theres nowhere to go in a hurry so dont be too impatient these young people are trying to do a very complicated job without much experience when the french left they took every piece of equipment they could with them together with the experienced staff so these young men and women have to learn as they go and banking is not the easiest of business transactions nevertheless they are making it work no matter how slow it seems as they become more and more accustomed to the routine of the work and the techniques of international finance the whole thing will speed up and heres something else when it is finally running smoothly all of these young people will have the satisfaction of knowing that they did it themselves thats important you know soon afterward the cashier arrived a goodlooking obviously pregnant young woman she quickly checked through the forms made some rapid calculations on a small adding machine and paid me the amount i required in guinea currency from the speed with which she worked in such contrast to her colleagues it was clear that she was very experienced and pregnant though she was very much needed once out in the street the czech teacher remarked thats a sign of the times all the white faces were on the wrong side of the counter i understood his little joke when i left him i wandered away from the center of town through the narrow streets lined with the allpurpose shops of the lebanese traders past a high wall behind which could be heard the alltoofamiliar sounds of childrens voices i followed the wall around to a wooden gateway and entered a small courtyard where about a hundred children sat in tight rows behind long narrow trestletype desks and repeated the instructions of a teacher as he explained simple arithmetical tables with the assistance of a blackboard i paused but he noticed me and came over i apologized for interrupting his lesson but he seemed quite pleased to have a visitor especially when i mentioned that i too had been a teacher as soon as the children saw me they stood up very quietly a gesture of respect i had received previously only in the public schools of britain and it occurred to me that whatever the shortages in other fields this new state was not ignoring the importance of social niceties the class was mixed boys and girls of about eleven years all simply sometimes poorly dressed without any attention to uniformity but their black faces and lively eyes shone with their hunger for knowledge and information the teacher wore khaki slacks and shirt and simple sandals of broad strips of leather fastened to thick rubber soles which i suspected had been cut from old motorcar tires on his brown intelligent face he sported a sparse scraggly beard which did nothing for him nor took anything from himit was simply there thats all his french was beautifully articulated and i later discovered that he had studied for eleven years in dakar are you over here to help us as a teacher he asked oh no i replied im merely wandering around africa looking for things to write about my first visit you know welcome again he said and we shook hands again but its a pity youre not a teacher we desperately need all we can get see for yourself i need at least another teacher to help me here any likelihood of the situation improving oh were getting help he replied but not enough quickly enough people are going to help us from china and czechoslovakia and yugoslavia and the west indies you know martinique and guadaloupe where they speak french sometimes it even becomes a bit complicated when some of the new teachers have to teach through interpreters until they can manage in french damned funny at times his laugh was easy and pleasant i suppose that limits the scope of the teaching you are able to do i suggested not too much he replied because we are adapting our educational plans to our needs and right now we need artisans and agricultural workers more than we need clerks and potential bureaucrats so we are concentrating on primary education to supply a broad general base then in the secondary schools we are providing technical education planned to create an interest in the country and a willingness to contribute to its development the child who gets an education must appreciate that the state needs his trained usefulness you mentioned teachers from china czechoslovakia etc i said do not they present the possible danger of introducing communistic ideas into the minds of the youngsters immediately his face lost its pleasant friendly mien his eyes shone with controlled anger and he replied you americans are all alike black or white youre all the same in a hasty attempt at apology i said im sorry i did not mean to offend you by asking that question incidentally im not an american im a west indian please forgive me if my question annoyed you im not annoyed he said carefully im merely sorry for you because you americans have developed such a phobia about the word communist that you see nothing but communists wherever you go here in guinea we are desperately trying to transform independence from a political attainment into an economic reality to do that we need help and we are not too proud to accept help but we will not accept any help if it means jeopardizing any part or aspect of that independence we sacrificed so much to achieve i looked at the children and noticed that they were watching somewhat anxiously something of the teachers changed mood must have transmitted itself very quickly to them and they were in silent response to it the teacher himself seemed suddenly aware of the childrens interest because he turned and rapidly wrote a few simple problems on the blackboard which he instructed them to copy and solve in their notebooks when they were busy at this he turned once more to me maybe you americans would like to help us if he emphasized that little word with hands and shoulders and eyesit even had a strangely sibilant sound as he hissed it at me maybe you would help us but only on your terms because you neither understand nor believe in african neutrality and that is simply explained by the fact that as yet you do not believe or respect africans he paused and shrugged a tired patient gesture i am not a communist im merely a teacher trying to do my job as well as i am able this is not a communist country and i think i can safely say it will never be the day you black americans understand what personal independence really means you will begin to understand how we feel about our country he was not angry but i was becoming bored with being called an american and being blamed for their supposed sins of omission i made one more try im not an american im from the west indies oh yes so you said he answered smiling suddenly but you sound like an american you ought to stay here awhile and becomewhat is the termbrainwashed he laughed at this and i joined him and on that easier note i left him the afternoon sun was very warm and i made my way in the general direction back to my hotel anticipating a refreshing shower and a change from my sweatdamp clothes here and there i saw groups of workmen swarming over the skeleton of a new building and it was with something of a shock that i realized that nowhere in sight was there a single piece of mechanical equipmenteverything was being done by hand ladders were makeshift arrangements from roughly cut saplings as were all other wooden supports in use concrete was mixed by hand and passed by a chain of hands to the place desired here and there i saw a european directing operations and i guessed from their slavic features that they were eastern european but in spite of what the young guinea teacher had just said there was not much evidence of concentrated popular effort in fact conakry was to me singularly depressing i passed a group of women dressed in their national costume with wide flaring skirts and an overmantle of embroidered gauze on their heads they wore headkerchiefs of brightly patterned cotton tied to show wide points rising elegantly from each side like the wings of some exotic bird immediately the rusty wheels of my memory quickened into gear and i recalled seeing women similarly dressed long ago in my native british guiana on market day in the countryside yes memory was clearer now i could even remember seeing a photograph of my grandmother wearing that distinguishable headkerchief i looked closely at the women observing their finely shaped features black and silky smooth did my origins lie somewhere here with these people i could not understand a word they said for they spoke an african dialect but they smiled at me and i bowed as i passed i was feeling something now and it was a good feeling for the very first time in many years i was walking among people without being conscious that i was different from them although a stranger to africa i felt sufficiently identified to be at ease comfortable to belong passersby might readily recognize that i was a stranger to guinea but unless my speech gave me away it would be assumed that i was african from some other territory or state a stranger but not strange because i was by origin a fragment of the whole back in england persons often asked me from which part of africa are you because on first contact they immediately associated my black skin with africa now in an african town among africans i felt at east and realized with something of a shock that the white faces looked strange to me a group of men standing outside the office of air france chatted softly but earnestly about the congo and patrice lumumbas death for which they blamed the united nations in general and the negligence of ghana in particular i sat nearby to listen surprised at the amount of information they seemed to have with them the congo was a cause celebre and indicated the need to so order their own internal affairs that it would never be necessary for the united nations or any other organization to intervene from a passing taxi a radio blared forth the sound of childrens voices in song something in praise of president sekou toure their voices too loud and evidently untrained but undeniably enthusiastic as the men spoke of the congo it was clear that lumumbas death and in such strange circumstances crystallized in their minds the evils of all colonialists and their policies one man made a reference to tshombe and spat on the ground to show his disgust from what they said i learned that the guinean forces in the congo had been recalled some had already returned home now and then someone spoke of we in africa or we africans but i had the feeling that for them africa meant guinea because there was little or no reference to any of the other african states it was very exciting to watch them and notice that the language they used their mannerisms and fondness for the philosophical turn of phrase were all very french indeed but none of it detracted from their dignity or belief in the rightness of their opinions back at the hotel i had an excellent dinner and from my corner table observed the other diners some of whom were guests at the hotel others officials resident in the town and able to afford the exorbitant prices charged for the meals bits of conversation could be heard in russian yugoslav czech chinese german french arabic english and american eating was a long drawnout affair because after dinner there was nowhere to go and nothing to do for entertainment having eaten i sat at the bar next to a tall very black man who between sips from his glass held it up to the light as if determined to discover how such a harmlesslooking liquid could produce the kind of effect it was having on him his hands holding the glass fondly like a communicant were large and powerfullooking as were the shoulders and chest which bulged the thin gaily colored shirt and i was sure that when he stood up hed be six feet tall or more his thin face was dominated by a large aquiline nose and marked high on each cheek with three vertical incisions which made him look rather like a pirate in festive mood i ordered beer and surreptitiously studied the antics of my companion as they were reflected in the mirror over the bar he must have caught me at it because he suddenly turned to me and asked stranger he spoke in english yes i replied ghana no im west indian he looked more closely at me as if to locate something in my face you look like a ghanian he said tonelessly and went back to his careful examination of his drink turning the frosty glass slowly in his fingers then how do you like my country he shot the question at me without turning his head i only arrived today i replied ive been wandering around town taking a look are you a salesman or with a mission or something no im a writer looking for copy this is my first visit to africa and im trying to record my impressions he pivoted around on his stool and very seriously extended a large hand welcome to africa he said his grip was strong the fingers cool from contact with the glass this is my first food today he continued shaking the glass been fasting sunup to sunset ramadan you know ive read of it i replied know anyone in town not really just nosing around i could show you around tonight if you like he offered his drink completed we set out he was even taller than i had guessed about two inches over six feet and walked with a slightly stooped posture as if accustomed to accommodating persons much shorter than himself the night was cool from the soft sea breezes and from the forecourt of the hotel could be heard the soft murmur of the tide on the beach close by overhead the towering mango trees lost their tops against the darker sky now crowded with stars which seemed brighter because of the dimly lit streets we followed the road around from the hotel and he pointed out the stately gardensurrounded houses once the residences of highranking french officials and now converted to service as ministries of one sort or another when the previous occupants the french left he remarked they literally gutted the houses what they could not cart away they smashed baths toilet bowls everything on into the town by now the shops were closed and the streets were for the most part deserted except for an occasional group of two or three men chatting beside an open doorway a general air of depression seemed to hover over the whole place and nowhere could i detect any sound of music or laughter god what a place to be stuck in i thought what does one do for entertainment in this place i asked he stopped with that curious habit of listening with his head cocked to one side entertainment he echoed oh i see what you mean there are no night clubs or brothels here these days the french took them with them when they departed so hastily but we manage very well without them he laughed luckily we are a polygamous people so have ways of entertaining ourselves then in a serious vein we do know how to enjoy ourselves believe me but right now most people are observing ramadan and that is a very quiet period for us we walked in silence for a while past the deserted market with its tiers of open stalls through narrow streets lined with closely packed twostory buildings dark behind their tight shutters and empty except for mongrel dogs foraging in the shadows on past the high wall of the soldiers cantonments until we reached some open ground beyond which the chinese exhibition building rose in massive silhouette here we stopped very impressive i offered in an attempt to probe his thoughts what he asked the exhibition building like a transplanted piece of new china oh sure he replied his thoughts elsewhere before long all the open land like this will either become development areas or be turned into parks and playgrounds for our children but before that happens we have lots of lessons to learn and the chief one is to live without the things we cannot affordthings like night clubs and brothels he turned and grinned at me his teeth a flash of white in the dark gloom of his face we africans often talk glibly about independence he continued after a while before it is achieved the very word has a certain magic quality and very often we expect that many of the problems which attend the winning of independence will solve themselves in some magical way here in guinea we are learning that independence must be more than a political milestone it must become a spiritual quality so that we can better apply ourselves to the grave tasks ahead of us this quality of the spirit is not breathed in with the night air at this he waved his arm in the gesture of an oratorit has to be learned and developed we the old ones learned it through fighting and sacrifice and we have to teach it to our children with everything else they learn in that way all of us will understand and accept that each one of us has the responsibility for making this country great excuse me please i interrupted but are you a lawyer or teacher perhaps no he replied im a soldier he began walking and i fell into stride with him have you been to the congo his answer was long in coming yes he finally replied and for me the most important lesson is this that under no circumstances must we in guinea allow our internal affairs ever to deteriorate to the point where any outside country or organization needs to intervene or is asked to intervene but fortunately that is very unlikely we walked in silence for a while all kinds of questions clamored within me but i felt that he was in the mood to talk and needed no prompting from me it was a saddening experience for me he continued to see an organization like the united nations forces of which we were a part become so completely ineffectual as an organ for peace and stability through the vagueness of its mandate the irresolution of its authority and the proved inexperience of some of its top personnel who though tagged and uniformed as military personnel had neither the tradition of military action nor the personal experience of situations of armed conflict to guide their decisions much of what happened in the congo since july of must be laid at the doorstep of the united nations and it will long remain a matter of national and personal regret that we contributed by association to the whole unhappy situation the congo dilemma is a monument to human error everyone involved in it made mistakes varying only in degree unfortunately in nearly every instance mistaken action was persisted in primarily to save somebodys face or defended because no other course of action seemed effective stupidity is no respecter of persons and many innocent people have died because of it we in guinea can avoid such fatal stupidity by teaching ourselves and our children to appreciate the disciplines and responsibilities of independence and so to believe in this little country of ours that no hardship is too great and no contribution too small in helping its progress does the man in the street feel the same way as you do about the countrys development and his involvement in it i asked yes of course he replied even though he might not be as articulate in exposing his feelings while youre here talk to them yourself and if you have the time get up into the country among the smaller towns and villages talk with the people you might run into a few surprises we continued our walk swinging right along the tarmac road which followed the twisting coastline overhead the palm fronds whispered softly as they touched each other sly sounds vaguely heard against the wash of the tide and the heavier chorus of crickets frogs and the sleepless nightjars people passed us talking softly together the slap slap of their sandaled feet audible long after they had faded into the distance we need help to do the things we need to do here he continued and we are getting help from certain quarters but we need more the time must come when we shall resolve our differences with france without sacrifice to our national pride or integrity and one fine day the americans will think seriously enough of us and other african states to treat us with the dignity due to independent states and their inhabitants we are sick of being badgered or maneuvered into situations of choice between east or west merely because the united states will not conceive that we are free people and intend to remain free from any kind of influence or control jesus christ the damn folly of it he exclaimed do you know something none of the russians or czechs or yugoslavs or chinese who come here ever ask about the united states and what we think of them we have a few american teachers in our schools but no one asks us if that means that were becoming capitalists why the hell cant americans recognize that to people like us freedom and independence are the most precious things we have anyway he said more calmly it may all work toward our good the hardships we experience now might prove to be the best possible thing that could have happened to us dont you think i ventured that your political conduct i mean your countrys political conduct must reflect a truly neutralist attitude if you expect to be believed that is not what is expected of us he replied no one believes in african neutrality we are exnected to be either prowest or procommunist and if we refuse to enter bodily into one camp we are promptly branded with the label of the other if i or one of my countrymen should visit russia tomorrow the word would go around that i am prorussian or procommunist and id have a hell of a time if after that i wanted to visit the united states but take the other side of the coin no eastern european country would refuse me entry merely because i had previously visited the united states what does that make you think who is it that has the growing up to do we were now once more outside the hotel de france well here we are he said tell you what if you like i could take you around tomorrow we could take a run up into the country and let you see whats happening there conakrybrothels apart or the lack of themis like any town anywhere which has felt the influence of a cosmopolitan population upcountry you might better see and understand the things ive been talking about id like that fine i replied delighted to have so interesting and responsible a companion showing me around this was indeed a lucky break one thing you can do he said seeming in no hurry to leave when you write about us let them know that what we need even more than their money or their machines is their respect theyve got to learn to respect us as equals much of the time they humor us ive seen it with my own eyes so i know what im talking about nowadays wherever an african goes and speaks he is listened to and nobody ever attempts to be critical of him unless they feel that his political complexion differs from theirs theyre never very much concerned with the man or the content of his talking but merely with the kind of political alignment he represents or seems to represent we command attention in the councils of the world primarily because we are africans and so we are wooed and solicited and pampered like clever performing monkeys because nobody is really taking the trouble to look behind the facade and understand the african the first thing about our new independence is our desire to be seen and heard often we are unprepared to be seen and heard and our posture is merely an imitation of those who so recently controlled us yet it is readily applauded and encouraged uncritically just because we are africans however when we are reported i notice that our remarks are invariably qualified by reference to our use of english or french as if that were the seal of cultural arrival it is hardly ever noticed that every african who stands up in the worlds councils speaks a language different from the one he learned at his mothers breast and is consciously or unconsciously making a concession to those who would otherwise find it nearly impossible to communicate with him on the other hand we africans do not seem to have finally made up our minds about the grave responsibilities which lie ahead we resent the old image which nonafricans entertain about us but we have done little to present a new and clearer image of ourselves very often we behave as if we are shipwrecks struggling helplessly in the floodtide of independence instead of capable marines managing our political affairs with judgment and discretion we have a hell of a lot to learn from each other and from nonafrican people with wider experience of government industry and representation than ourselves but we need the kind of constructive criticism and appraisal free of political bias which would stimulate us to increased responsibility of expression and action he laid a fatherly hand on my shoulder and said you must forgive me my young friend for preaching to you but it is not every day that one has the opportunity to talk like this with an outsider too often you people are in a hurry to judge us out of hand and naturally our first impulse is to resent your criticism because you have shown very little inclination to understand and be at least patient with us try to balance everything you see and hear against the fact that we were suddenly thrown upon our own limited resources with the added handicap of the antipathy and distrust generated by the conduct of the french in the last days of their control remember that in spite of our difficulties we are a small country but a united one have a good night and well start upcountry early in the morning ill call for you around eight oclock i watched his tall figure swing easily down the path onto the road to move into the treecrowded shadow of the still african night i breakfasted at am and comfortable in cool khaki shirt and slacks i waited for my friend who arrived promptly on time in a large chauffeurdriven american car he may have noticed my surprise because he said laughing i wangled it on the argument that you were an important visitor its one of our official cars outside the hotel the air was damp and fresh with dew which still hung in misty patches over every ditch or narrow gully the driver leaned heavily on his horn as we moved through the town streets already crowded with people on their way to their various jobs or to the large market in the center of town we slowed down as we passed the market the air now heavy with the ripe odors of dried fish fruit and a wide variety of unfamiliar herbs and roots people shouted at each other across the inches which separated them in the ageold exercise of haggling over the price of an article their arms flailing the air in wild gestures or their fingers fluttering in insistent illustration every kind of merchandise seemed to be on sale but most of it utilitarian and of cheap manufacture brightly patterned cloth from japan cheekbyjowl with gay enamel cooking utensils stamped with the legend sierra leone independence large bunches of bananas and plantains piles of local oranges chickens lying on their sides with legs securely tied their eyes halfglazed with fear the public letterwriter sitting at his little table ready to serve the illiterate for a price and the ubiquitous tailor the whir of his restless treadle lost in the general cacophony this country is rich very rich my friend said look at the color of the i earth weve not even begun to tap our resources of bauxite or lets say were i only scratching the surface so far under that useless grass theres wealth i waiting to be dug up but it requires money lots of it wish i knew a short i cut to fort knox he laughed then as if struck by a sudden idea he said i tell me something about president kennedys peace corps what will it do i and how does he plan to set about assembling it i why does everyone ask me questions about america as if i am an i american or somehow responsible for what happens there i seem to spend i an awful lot of time explaining that british guiana is not the usa all i i know about it is what i have read or heard in france i replied strange the way americans see africa he murmured more to himself than to me i wonder who it is that advises him about us in africa peace corps where would he send them and what will they do and what is most important how will he choose them i read that they will be mostly young men will their expressed liberality be a qualification would they have to like black people before they become eligible or will they be shown how to be a liberal after they are chosen would a man be barred because he is a southerner even if they satisfy all of mr kennedys requirements does that imply that we in africa will believe in them what guarantees have we that the men of the peace corps who come to be nice to us in africa would be just as nice to black americans in the usa and when they come over here what will they do just tell us what nice people americans are were not interested in peace corps were not interested in hearing how peace can best be preserved from young liberal americans wed rather have some of the practical symbols of peace out there he pointed at the blur of landscape flitting by you know bulldozers and tractors and wed welcome young peaceful americans who could teach us how to turn this brown grassy promise into a productive certainty so that our country might taste the fruits of peace before they grow too old to care peace corps he whispered that is the kind of charity which should begin at home and be firmly restrained from leaving it his lips tightened into a thin bitter line or perhaps he intends sending black americans to teach us about peace they are not much better than the white ones i hear that they want to identify with us africans and that theyve started all kinds of organizations which claim to reflect african heritage very good provided they maintain the distance between america and africa and are sensible enough to understand that a black skin does not make everyone an african ive seen them here and in other places in africa and been rather sorry for some of them when i observed their disillusionment with us from thousands of miles away tomtoms and grass huts and polygamy seems very attractive and picturesque and freedom for africa is an exciting battlecry but close at hand the heat and the dirt and disease and shortages play havoc with lofty resolutions i suddenly felt somewhat out of accord with him maybe this was aimed obliquely at me because i too felt a sense of identity with africas political destiny surely i interrupted the expressions of solidarity from black americans is all of a piece with african progress even though they come from people several generations removed from the african scene im concerned with positive values he replied sagely not with questionable postures the best contribution any outsider can make is to be as active and positive as possible in the fight against indignity and inhumanity americans are americans and the black ones should concentrate all their efforts in fighting the many forces of indignity which beset them in america that is the kind of contribution we need herethe encouragement of knowing that on all fronts the fight for social equality and political freedom is firmly joined do you know and once again his face relaxed in a smile quite often i meet black americans in africa and by god theyre so american in everything they do and say that they dont seem to realize it and we africans find it most irritating because of the common factorour black skins seems pretty hopeless does it i asked not altogether he assured me laughing maybe one day we africans will become as familiar with airconditioning and laborsaving devices and department stores so that well develop a few more factors in common with our american cousins there was a question which had been on my mind all day now that he seemed relaxed and affable i decided to plunge in about your president i began well what about him so far you have said nothing about him in european newspapers i have seen him referred to as dictator procommunist strong man and demagogue so far you have been very frank and outspoken in your observations about the outsiders would you be just as frank in telling me about guineas leadership after two years as an independent state again the familiar headononeside pause but this time the beginnings of a smile tickled the side of his mouth and ran along the big arched nose the things you read were mainly true but the people who wrote them did not understand the truth they were writing they did not even know they were writing the truth because they do not know the man easy relaxed patient even fatherly now hed be generous and explain it carefully to me two things they do not understand the africans background and the meaning of african nationalism in africa we have always been accustomed to authoritarian rule it has been the basis of our social structure long before any european ever set foot on african soil and it still survives in the heart of every african no matter how europeanized he might seem to be in africa we respect strength and we honor it when it is allied to personal courage and skillful leadership our president has these qualities and he is an african in the fullest sense he is well informed although he never attended university either here or abroad and when he speaks he speaks the language of our people in the way our people understand we trust him and we follow him dictator demagogue those are european terms they have no meaning in the context of africa nor has the term democracy in guinea we are for the most part of our three million people illiterate democracy presupposes a literate majority of the population what we need what we must have is strong forceful leadership toward achievable targets designed to involve everyone irrespective of educational or other considerations he sipped his drink before continuing as for the other thing it seems impossible for the outsider to get into the skin of the african to understand the terrible but wonderful spirit which has recently been released within and among us you blind yourselves with label and name tags and refuse to look behind them to apprehend the facts if an african reads marx or engels you brand him communist if he visits prague or moscow you brand him communist would you consider him a capitalist if you caught him reading the financial times the lesson you need to learn all of you both east and west as you are fond of describing yourselves is that we are first and last africans we are willing and ready to learn from you all of you but we have no wish or intention to be anything but africansfree independent africans your newspapers expend a lot of time and energy criticizing our form of government let them note that we are all firstclass hundred per cent africans there are no secondclass citizens among us let them also note that the oneparty rule which they find so difficult to swallow is not restricted to guinea liberia ghana tunisia these are but a few where the same things exist and sierra leone go there and take a look milton margai has no opposition party to contend with then theres nigeria right now we have the job of feeding housing and educating our people and of building our economy so that we can continue to improve their food housing and education and we have a leader who is young strong and vigorous enough to do just that i suppose you have noticed that our shops have no luxury goods and our women do not wear the latest paris fashions but what is important is the fact that although the french revoked their support of our budget we are not economically crippled as a matter of fact we are stable and moving ahead later on we may give some attention to putting a little icing on the cake he laughed and i felt an admiration for this man if he truly expressed the general attitude of the people then guinea was well on the way to setting its mark on the whole continent of africa this was undoubtedly a big night people were arriving for the show mostly europeans men and women dressed fashionably in light linens and silks all looking enthusiastic greeting each other somewhat loudly now and then my friend would indicate an ambassador or special envoy from europe or another african state a tall distinguishedlooking fairskinned negro immaculate in a white sharkskin suit was identified as the united states ambassador the tone of my friends voice did not convey much enthusiasm he may be leaving us soon he remarked as the gentleman passed us on his way to the main hall i thought that the ambassador may have completed his tour of duty and was moving to some other theater of operations one must never underestimate the deep effects of conditioning he said seemingly talking more to himself than to me that is why we must use every means possible to keep reminding our people that every aspect of their daily lives must reflect their consciousness of freedom and independence treat a man unequally and after a time he will think or behave unequally even if you subsequently place him in high office he will occasionally betray some residual traits of inequality we are a free and sovereign state and would prefer that representatives from other states at ambassadorial and other levels are chosen from among the best in their field and at the moment we are inclined to doubt that black americans have had sufficient opportunities at higher diplomatic level to provide them with the background and experience necessary to the efficient execution of the job of an ambassador we cannot be expected to entertain the highest regard for a black ambassador when we know that in many parts of his own country he would be refused hotel accommodation and other facilities merely because of the color of his skin and when he speaks to us on matters of importance we cannot be sure that he speaks on behalf of all america it therefore follows that america must quickly introduce changes to equate the status of her black citizens with that of her white citizens or keep the black ones out of internationalrepresentative office may i ask you a rather frank question i interrupted why not its a free country he grinned you are bitter about america arent you one might even say you are positively antiamerican arent you guilty of the same kind of phobia which you so determinedly condemn in them its strange he replied but i feel no hatred no none whatsoever is that difficult for you to believe lets put it this way im impatient to see some improvement in the relationships between other countries and ourselves but i think it is necessary to speak ones mind ive been speaking frankly with you because i hope that in reporting me you will present the truth and perhaps it might lead to some revision of attitudes no im not antiamerican i am merely proafrican even if at the moment all africa for me is concentrated in the word guinea i suggested that we get seats for the fashion show and we inquired at the desk but discovered that we were days too late all available seats had been sold and there was not even standing room it was no great disappointment because the long car trip the heavy meal and the beer all conspired to produce a comfortable lassitude and we agreed that perhaps bed would be best i said goodbye to my friend as he would be busy from then on and would be unable to spend more time with me and retired to my room to scribble down everything i could remember of our conversation later i could hear the sounds of music and cheering from downstairs but soon these subsided into the dark peace of the african night man barry sat at the breakfast table obscured from his wife hy a c pyof the new york tribune occasionally a hand reached out for coffee and returned then replaced the cup see where theyre considering a tax hike he complained seems theres no end to taxes after eating barry kissed his wife grabbed his brief case and started for the door oh he said hows herbies cold its better his wife replied but im keeping him out of school again today just the same good barry said he hastily opened the door and made his exit on his way to the bus stop he noticed one of his neighbors working on a bicycle tunde he saidin greeting what are you doing my friend i fix my bike replied smiling tunde it has bad chain very bad thats why i walk i never have trouble walking and riding the bus maybe when independence come you ride car hey no i think maybe i get refrigerator to sleep in this african heat very bad you know tunde laughed and flung a joshing hand at his departing neighbor who saw his bus rumbling down the dusty road after getting on he took a seat next to anna polynova a middle aged woman he had been riding with for years ahh a good morning to you she said cheerily she had been saying it the same way for eternity and nikoli returned her greeting as he always had how is your little ivan today she inquired oh hes better today replied nikoli still has the sniffles though my land she remarked were hitting the moon and all when are we going to cure the common cold maybe well find it there nikoli said what asked anna puzzled the cure for the common coldon the moon oh ho laughed anna but maybe well find something worse when the bus reached his stop in downtown moscow nikoli bade his commuter companion farewell and stepped to the street he strode briskly along the ginza slightly swinging his brief case back and forth it was a beautiful day and people crowded the street en route to their jobs shimura usually grimaced upon smelling the dirty canal water but on brilliant days as this one he would forget all unpleasantness he briskly entered a building and crowded himself into an elevator good morning shimurasan greeted one of his coworkers ah good morning mochidasan he said your son tanizawa is he all right today yes said shimura he just has a mild case of the sniffles today returning home from work in the afternoon robert was quite weary from a hard days work he held his brief case as though it weighed fifty pounds and didnt swing it at all he found his neighbor as he had left him tampering with his automobile only there were many more parts lying about now hey george robert called directing his voice to a pair of feet george emerged from under the car showing a greasy face with a clean smile you know man he said i think i better get me a mechanic man what you need now is a car teased robert they both laughed but robert stopped when his son skated up to him hi dad the boy said hi son say if your cold is bad enough to keep you outa school it oughta be bad enough to keep you off the street oh im over the cold now dad the boy said and hurriedly skated off robert shook his head in disgust you know its a shame he said to george with all the opportunities coming for our people and him not caring about school like that yeah man said george these kids today dont know whats happening robert shrugged and headed for home see you later man ok man said george take it easy yeah its never too late to learn dver wish you had do more education you look around and see the everlessening number of unskilled job openings and wish that you your husband or the boy you hope to marry could get out of the rut and uncertainty of earning a living with so little skill and knowledge to offer do you look at others and envy their progress and bemoan the luck that keeps you down but i had to go to work early my folks couldnt afford to keep me in school too many mouths to feed around our house all i wanted to do was fool around nobody made me study i got expelled i wanted to marry and have a home of my own many excuses many reasons but the statistical truth revealed by the u s census bureau is that only about seven percent of the adult population of the united states has a high school education yet in spite of this low educational level jobs are getting scarcer for unskilled and uneducated workers machines in factories and offices are demanding knowledge not manpower alone men and women who know who are willing to keep learning even if they had to quit formal schooling early are the ones industry wants fortunately however it has never been so easy to continue education as now even if you are employed fulltime have children or are handicapped in some manner somewhere somehow there is a chance for you your husband or boy friend to learn thereby improving chances for earning more money and getting more satisfaction from living first of all do not admit defeat you are not alone your need has not been forgotten more and more employers union leaders recreational workers librarians ministers and various welfare and civic organizations are recognizing the hunger of people for more learning they see that the increasing automation of our space age is going to require a trained people actually a college degree is not a requirement in most fields neither is a high school diploma however the one requirement is usually a willingness to seek more learning lets consider some of the avenues to more knowledge offered for the taking some free some for nominal fees there are the ymca ymha ywca here are offered courses that vary in different communities but included are everything from swimming to stenography and selling write to your local y organization for a complete listing of courses offered for increasing skill and enjoyment of living industry has encouragement programs for employees who want to better themselves eastman kodak gives tuitionaid for employees studying jobrelated courses u s steel bell telephone standard oil western electric and ford motor training company are only a few of the big companies that have varied programs for onthejob training direct financing for further education or reimbursement plans for ambitious employees write to these and other corporations and learn what each company has to offer in educational plans for vocational advancement universities have extension courses that offer credit and noncredit programs in such subjects as nursing teaching animal husbandry soil conservation dairying marketing recreation family health engineering public relations labormanagement relations etc one big college city college of new york offers some courses for younger children at the same time parents are attending classes trade unions often have libraries and workers educational programs to help in general and special knowledge for the laborers advancement and happiness study by yourself this is perhaps the biggest selfimprovement field for those whose education was interrupted home study methods are important big correspondence schools such as the international correspondence schools scranton pennsylvania not only give courses for those who answer their advertisements but cooperate with thousands of industries and businesses in providing easy methods of furthering education for groups and the individual some of our nations leading men in business and politics had little formal education but a high percentage of them got more education by means of home study courses and local adult education programs you may also study alone in other ways consult an expert in some field and ask his help or advice on securing additional education and information in his particular specialty get acquainted with your public library ask the librarian for help in learning how to use the card indexes and in finding materials that you may study at home make a plan of action in learning then follow it work full or parttime as an apprentice this can be one of the most thorough ways of learning and one of the shortest and most practical paths to mastery education need never be completely finished for the person who wants to keep ahead in this fastpaced world and its all up to you why boxers go broke boxers the process of going broke is much like an inevitable incurable feels early stages but is terribly painful ever after is a disease that afflicts most of the bigname highestpaid boxers regardless of race creed or disease good it color regardless of their own innate intelligence regardless of good management regardless of all the bad examples lateera fighters could learn from sugar ray robinson is a mental giant in his craft he is a man who understands sharpies and sharp practices yet a few years ago sugar ray sat in the guest dining room at the ebony magazine offices and literally cried over his financial woes he blamed friends whom he had trusted implicitly exheavyweight champion ezzard charles admits that his managers were gentlemen and most of his federal income taxes unlike joe louis were paid off the top of his purses yet charles couldnt escape an attack of secondstage poverty jimmy carter several times lightweight champion was once so frugal that he wouldnt even purchase an automobilebut somehow his money trickled through his fingers as if they were paralyzed and his bank account leaked like an open wound the total number of oncerich fighters of the past halfcentury who have escaped the financial blight can be ticked off on the fingers of one arthritic hand the fact is charles an expert on the subject has neatly packaged the complete story by saying of himself i seem to have gone the way of all champions at the time he spoke charles was bereft of plush cincinnati home several businesses dozens of old friends and the gleaming cadillacs he used to drive but still possessed of a fine mind and a keen will to win he was fighting backholding down a promotional job with a wine company learning the wrestling profession manfully holding his family together always a man capable of turning the fetching word charles concluded i lay me down to bleed a whileand then rise to fight again the inability of boxers to hold onto their money earned through a rigorous expenditure of blood sweat and tears only slightly less horrifying than war between worlds composes the saddest sorriest most sickening story in sports the number of exfighters who once earned more money in a night than many workers earn in a lifetime only to end up as charity cases is legion conversely the number of negro boxing greats who retained their wealth from careers end all the way to the pearly gates hardly totals more than one celebrated casethat of the late harry wills jack dempseys chaser who amassed a considerable fortune and then carefully maintained it throughout his declining years to drop a few more names beau jack the lightweight who supposedly was protected by some of the finest minds in boxing traversed an unusual circular route from shoe shine stand to riches back to shoe shine stand when it was all over jack admittedly was no more knowledgeable of what had happened to his money than a preschool age kid who attempts a scholarly reply to that famous toothpaste query where did the yellow go joe louis financial difficulties are known throughout the world although joe who probably when i was dieting for fights virtually living on cups of tea charles continues my buddies were drinking scotch and eating steaks on me i used to visit a place in cincinnati called the cotton club there were guys there who used to hit me for eight and nine dollars a day every day i think now that those guys must have been junkies some guys would borrow as much as a day from me in a sense im glad that its all over now and i dont have to be bothered with that group anymore because they were not for real joe louis sugar ray robinson ezzard charles jimmy carter beau jack and henry armstrong another member of the clan probably grossed as much as million in boxing an incredible amount of money properly invested this money might well have been the foundation of enterprises now worth a billion dollars henry ford for one never possessed any such beginning bankroll but it is not entirely the fault of boxers that they are unable to manage money most of them gush up through solid bedrock of poverty into sudden fame and undreamedof riches the wise management of money as millionaire j paul getty has said is a talent that does not come easily fighters who have in most instances barely finished high school simply are not prepared to contemplate what all the money they earn so quickly means sudden wealth causes them to lose equilibrium gives them a sense of power they cant handle makes them do foolhardy things busy fighting making personal appearances training and having fun they reserve little time to study such as banking or the stock market although many boxers do selfeducate themselves admirably in the basic economics of life the sad truth is that few fighters actually control their own money most of them notably excepting sugar ray robinson docilely take orders from others some are owned by individuals or syndicates managers may take as much as per cent of the purses boxers earn v is the usual percentage a champion fighter must employ trainers rent training quarters and pay various other normal and abnormal expenses such as paddings called publicity by the time all the deducts are in the fighter finds that his oncehefty purse has been greatly decimated and then there are income taxes which constitute a vicious circle once a fighter has become delinquent for while he is fighting to pay off the pastdue bills he is piling new tax debts on the old unless he has hired reputable managers or accountants a fighter who earns a halfmillion or a million dollars in one year can easily fall into serious difficulty with the government once the treasury department held up a sugar ray robinson purse of several hundred thousand dollars louis tax bill the result jewelry and other socalled accoutrements of luxurious living of course if one is to be fair he must note that spendthrift boxers are no more egocentric nor hardly more careless with their funds than many of the nouveau riche of business or industry the basic difference however is that the boxer gets only one shot at riches he doesnt keep big money long enough to become truly accustomed to it what is the remedy for this disease of going broke which is so peculiar to boxers before an attempt is made to answer that question perhaps this point should be made most often it is the general public the fans who lament feeling the plight of oncerich boxers gone broke invariably the boxers themselves will tell you on reviewing their careers that if they had their lives to live over they wouldnt change a thing it sometimes seems that boxers dont expect to hang onto their money it comes easily and it goes easier many boxers live with the wild abandon of people who know the hellbomb is on the way and the bomb shelter is made of cardboard boxes nevertheless many concerned people suggest programs rules and regulations to protect the boxer and his money these suggestions usually begin from two points the appointment of a federal boxing czar and special income tax consideration for fighters this consideration to emphasize a payasyougo plan and special rates to equate taxes and the boxers short period of high earnings some of the suggestions advanced in recent years though wellintentioned probably would violate the civil_rights laws if put into practice in many cases the boxers themselves would have to be protected over their dead bodiesfor one seldom finds a rich champion who is humble enough to admit that he needs help in anything unless it is in an introduction to that pretty babe over there the rich boxing champion unfortunately is more apt to react in the manner of a wellknown fighter of a few years ago on being given unsolicited but undoubtedly sound advice by a sports writer who loved him like a son the rich champion turned a deaf ear a frigid shoulder and a pipinghot retort i dont tell you how to write do i he sang for the angels rtlesville is a small almost asleep southern town on the mississippi river in the old days excursion boats used to sail up and down the mississippi carrying cotton on the way up and happy people on the way back i remember especially how the shouts and the music coming from the boats sounded like the distant revelry of remembered carnivals and i would run to the apple tree in our yarda splendidly arching tree on which i had nailed thin planks of wood for a ladderand i would climb up as high as i could to see the big white boats sailing brilliantly in the sunlight from one of those boats many years ago so people told me stepped charlie logan the boat was going north so charlie must have come from someplace further south although nobody ever knew where i first met charlie when i was nine years old while exploring the outskirts of the thenbustling little town where my father a methodist minister had just been assigned to a new church i was pedaling on my bicycle up a steel hill where the tall red and yellow hollyhocks allowed only brief glimpses of the mississippi below when i decided to stop for a better view completely enraptured by the wide panorama below i began walking toward the edge of the hill suddenly the ground gave way and i found myself clinging fearfully to a clump of thick grass on the edge of the hill i was too terrified to yell for help and as i began edging my way toward the top i imagined i could see my body slipping from the ledge and plummeting to the jagged rocks below suddenly in the midst of my struggling two dark arms darted down and strong hands lifted me upright i stared up into the dark smooth face of a man whose strangely laughing eyes and strong hands gave my shaking body mental and physical support it was charlie logan thank you i managed to say weakly my heart seemed as if it was pounding through my chest i glanced backward over the hill and quickly retreated from the treacherous edge towards my bicycle charlie gave a chuckle that sounded like a low rumble of thunder thats all right son he said youre a brave boy didnt even hear you cry for help shakily i mounted my bicycle and began coasting downhill almost at the bottonttt glaneed back briefly to see charlie standing like a muscular brown statue in his somewhat tattered shirt with a grin on his broad dark face somehow i still remember the way charlie looked then but years later i was to remember him looking altogether differently my mother and father met charlie about two days after my fearful experiencean experience about which i knowing the restrictive measures of my father and the fears of my mother refused to tell them we heard a knock on the door my mother in her friendliest and most melodious voice had called out just a minute as she quickly glanced in the hall mirror and patted her hair in place on her way to the door move your guns out of the way billy she said in a hushed voice to me on the floor then she opened the door and there flashing a broad whiteteethed grin was charlie are you the preachers wife maam charlie said yes wont you come in my mother said hesitatingly charlie looked down at me on the floor and grinned have a seat wont you my mother said pointing to a wooden chair near the door charlie immediately contented himself with talking to me howre you doing son he said lets see your guns over there iscooted around on my knees and dragged the gun from under the big padded sofa charlie had a strange pleased smile on his face when i handed him the gun and he stroked and patted it as if he was caressing a favorite pet he barely looked at my father who had just walked out of the room where he had been reading hello preacher charlie said still stroking the gun this heres a brave boy you got preacher charlie said poking the gun toward me fearfully i awaited what was to come but charlie didnt mention the neardisastrous incident he just continued to rub my air gun and talking more to himself it seemed than to my father and mother im gonna get a houseful of guns im gonna get me a trunkful of shells too charlie said one of these days theys going tbe a war between us colored people and them white people on white horses and im goin tbe ready the eyes of my mother and father met they looked back at charlie who began talking faster and louder i had a family once but they left me to go up north i had a son once too until those white people on white horses got him he never done nothin wrong preach er he never done nothin wrong but they beat him and they beat me lawd he didnt even cry preacher and those white people with those white sheets on jus laffed they wouldnt even let me help im charlie was almost crying now but he rambled on he said his family left him but he was glad that they were gone because those white people on white horses might try to kill them too he said he had a wife but she went to heaven shes gone where im goin tgo when i leave this world charlie said then he started to cry i had never seen such big tears before they dropped on the wooden polished floor and on charlies dusty shoes making mudspattered spots on the worn leather my mother said something soothing and patted charlie on his shoulders which seemed to be bent low with a heavy weight my father said well charlie gods going to make everything right after a few minutes charlie wiped his eyes and walked out without a word to my mother or father mom hes got my bb gun i whispered shhh my mother said but mom hes got my bb gun i screamed i started to run out to tell charlie to bring back my bb gun but my mother caught me at the door i clung to the screen door long enough to see charlie walking slowly down the street wiping his eyes with his forearm and carrying my air gun like a stick in one of his big hands charlie could sing real loud he would stand outside the small methodist church my father pastored until it was almost time to sing then he would march up to the front row of seats and sit down when the time came to sing charlie would sit up straight as a cigar store indian rear back his head and really sing after church he would walk to his home smiling to himself he wouldnt look back or talk to anyone he would keep on walking and smiling to himself until he got to his oneroom boxlike shack that was covered with red rubber shingles charlie told my father one day when dad was trying to tell him in a tactful way to sing more quietly that he was singing for the angels those angels in those shiny white robes gonna like the way i sing charlie said theys going to put in a good word for me to god gods probably too busy to hear me but he wants us people to raise up a joyful noise anyway my father gave up after that conversation nobody could learn much about charlie he never invited anyone to his home and if a stranger or visitor came to his place he always met them at the door charlie ran errands and worked around the yards and houses for the wealthy people in town they all liked him and at christmas time they would give him bushel basketsful of food and clothes but charlie never worked at one place for any length of time sometimes he would quit a job for no reason at all several times he was told not to come back to work but his white employers always talked fondly of him he was a good worker and many times charlies neighbors would see him returning from work late at night carrying some kind of a crooked stick in his hands the children of those wealthy people liked him too sometimes in the late afternoon or whenever charlie was coaxed long enough he would tell them stories everybody in the big houses knew where charlie and the kids were at those times because they could hear that deep throaty laughter of charlies accompanied by a chorus of childish laughter charlie would make the children tremble with fear when he told them ghost stories but he often made them laugh when he teased them about their pet cats and dogs he would feel the little cats body or the little puppys underside and say hes got some good ribs on him whens he goin tbe ready to eat the kids would laugh and tell him that nobody was going to eat their pet charlie would reply when he gets a little more meat on those ribs hes going to be just right for eatin but despite charlies fondness for the wealthy people and their children he would insist on saying that there was going to be a war between us and those white people on white horses some day my father once told him no charlie one of these days each person is going to accept the other as a brother and well never want to hurt the other again no they wont preacher you watch and see what i tell you charlie said one of these nights youre going to hear those white horses cornin and youre goin to see white people come out of the woods with sheets on and theyre goin to pull you outta your bed and beat you charlie began to talk louder and louder and his eyes seemed to grow bigger and he shook like he was cold you aint goin tbe able to do nuthin preacher but you got a brave boy here he said pointing to me when they start to grab holt of you hell start booming and hell keep going boom and boom and boom and calm down charlie calm down my father said nobodys going to hurt us thats just your you jus watch what i tell you preacher you jus watch what i tell you im telling you the truth you jus and charlie talking as he walkedto the earth under his feet would mouth his warnings all the way home nine years passed during which time my father was transferred to other churches his new assignments were to take him far away from the mississippi and far away from charlie however we continued to hear from old friends who would write and tell us about how the church was going along with reasons they didnt like the new pastor one of them wrote that charlies still singing for the angels and added hes becoming harder to get along with here lately maybe its because hes getting up there in age three years later on my way back from the navy base where i was stationed my train stopped for a halfhour lay over at hartlesville i took the opportunity of renewing old friendships and surprising some of my fathers old members with my growth in the past years wheres charlie the man who used to sing so loud i asked their expressions became almost solemn he lives the same place one of them said sister johnsons been with him since i dont have much time i said ill drop by to see him on my way to the station goodbye ill tell dad i saw you charlies house looked surprisingly smaller and more ragged than i had remembered it the loosened and fallen shingles left the little shack with a ragged checkerboard appearance i knocked on the door then pushed it inward at the response of a small voice inside as i blinked to get accustomed to the darkness i made out the form of an old lady sitting by a bed and in the small bed lay an old man with a large bony frame his face resembled a dried prune how are you charlie i said the question seemed somewhat strange for the old man laying there with the empty gaze aimed toward me was not the charlie i had so fondly remembered through the years do you remember me charlie i bent down closer to his face his watery eyes seemed sunken amidst his wrinkled skin whats wrong with charlie i asked the old woman the old woman just shook her head suddenly charlie looked toward the dark ceiling his eyes rolled and for the first time he seemed to be seeing he started to rise y heah them angels is cornin he whispered hoarsely jus lak i toldja they would an singin even louder than i used to sing i grabbed charlies shoulders as he seemed to totter precariously on the bed and eased him back down the old lady just sat calmly and patted charlies arm and looked with meek concern into his face charlie seemed to breathe a deep sigh of relief as he lay motionless my eyes wandered from charlie and the rickety wooden bed to a dark corner near the window which afforded the only light in the dirty cluttered shack what i thought at first glance was thin cordwood stacked against the wall were guns and almost to one side stood my bb rifle from ever so long ago blue bright and shiny my gun and all those others near the guns was a huge wooden trunk curious i walked over to it the lid was unlocked i lifted it and to my amazement saw boxes and boxes of shells and bullets of all kinds stacked to the very top and then i recalled charlies warnings of years ago i knew the purpose for which those guns and ammunition somehow had been collected by charlie through the years i knew they had meant death for those longremembered riders on white horses who dared not come while charlie was still alive on this earth and singing for the angels the new negro saint hen the cardinals in rome approved the canonization of blessed martin de porres during the recent consistory presided over by pope juan xxiii a memorable event became part of church history this is the first time in the history of the roman catholic church that a latin american negro was elevated to sainthood and friar de porres also is the fourth latin american saint the others saint rose of lima peru st felipe de jesus of mexico and saint maria ana paredes de jesus of ecuador canonization of the new saint took place may in the basilica of st peters in rome culminating the sanctification process which had been developing in tribunals of the holy see for the past years friar martin was the son of juan de porres a young spanish knight and ana velazquez a mulatto of spanish father there is not much information about the mother but supposition is that she was a mexican slave of african origin juan de porres met ana velazquez in lima fell in love and made a home in a street named the holy spirit for a time ana was able to hide her mulatto background for she could pass as white and this deception was even practiced on her lover but when she was with child a halting confession was made as ana had feared her noble gentleman was highly disgusted or perhaps disillusioned fearing birth of a colored son this was exactly what happened and the newborn infant was taken from the house by a back door to the church of san sebastian where parish priest antonio polanco baptized the baby in the presence of two neighbors as son of an unknown father and ana velazquez with margin of document stating martin a natural son don juan de porres continued his relationships with ana who gave birth again this time to a daughter also black when the viceroy of peru commissioned de porres to a new post in guayaquil the father abandoned mother and children without any provisions for their maintenance however neighbors with more conscience aided the mother in rearing the children instructing them in religion from the start young martin isolated himself from the other children preferring to stay for long periods within the grounds of the parish church from the age of two onward the darkness of martins skin grew more pronounced but the lad did not seem to mind this at all though it drew attention to him at seven he was charged with the care of his sister for whom he invented all sorts of ingenious games one day however de porres returned for his children alleging a great love for them taking them to guayaquil ecuador a key point in the spanish dominion of peru the youngsters were presented to captain diego de miranda chief of the spanish garrison and de porres confessed his alliance with ana and his decision to give a good education to the children as is the duty of a christian gentleman three years later de porres was named governor of panama then a province of peru leaving the young girl with his uncle de porres returned with the young martin to lima sought out his former mistress and delivered his son to her with the recommendation that she arrange for his confirmation and also his continued schooling the father selected the vocation of barber for his illegitimate son ana velazquez took her duties seriously placed her boy in a barber shop run by one known as mateo in the san lazaro district where there was a profusion of homes of negroes huge haciendas and fragrant fruit orchards martins duties were to keep floors seats and mirrors clean and he was soon apprenticed to learn the intricacies of barbering he also acquired some knowledge of surgery and pharmaceuticals professions then allied with the barbers trade his teacher in the arts of medicine and surgery was the selfsame maestro mateo still a youngster in his teens martin began devoting much of his nights to prayer on his knees his arms stretched out face bathed with tears he got a reputation as a queer one in the district and decided to leave one day after mass he crossed the rimac river over a rickety wooden bridge made his way to the santo domingo convent and was granted an audience by the father superior to whom he confessed his desire to be a lay brother the dominican friar heading the convent looked with benevolent eyes on his humble supplicant and despite rulings at that time not permitting acceptance within a monastery even for the choir of indians or mixed breeds to the fourth generation martin was permitted to stay the accepted convert brothers had all the rights of the dominican order whereas the lay brothers were without any rights considered terciaries and were tolerated as servants of honor who also had the advantages of a religious life lay brother martin passed many years doing menial tasks on his own request he sought out the most modest tasks served as a sort of slave of the brothers his devotion to the order was a silent unspoken one but one day when funds for maintenance of the convent were not increased with the prior hardpressed to make ends meet martin who considered himself a slave of religion offered himself to the prior saying sell this poor mulatto who is worth nothing here for he serves so badly those who treat him so well maybe if you sell me to a master who treats me badly i may learn to serve well to which the friar touched by martins offer replied go along friar for we have need of you here and god will provide the remedy for our situation martin served as a barber within the convent waited on table took care of the sick as well as sundry other duties and he always said his best reward was being in the company of the brothers and superiors so that he could sweep the floors over which their feet had tread one day martins father recently deposed from the governorship of panama by a change in viceroys came to the convent felt his pride wounded when he saw the humility in which his son lived the inferiority of his position and the menial tasks he had to perform the friar to calmthe aging father agreed to give martin at least the habits of a fully accredited monk in midmonth of october friar martin was stricken by an intense fever which grew worse daily he asked for the last sacraments which were given to him with all the brothers of the convent surrounding his cot wax tapers in their hands the news of the friars illness spread and throngs from all walks of life came to the convent in a period of improvement friar martin even received the viceroy who prostrating himself before the sick man asked that when he passed on to the next life he should not forget to petition god for aid and to give a sign to the official so he could rule better on november of friar martin who had dedicated his life unselfishly to religion and to the welfare of his fellow man went to his eternal rest and now years after his passing and after long years of sifting of the evidence as well as the ticklish issue of elevating a negro to sainthood his sanctity has been ratified on may of this year blessed martin de porres was canonized by pope john xxiii in historic ceremonies in the vatican a painter of depth and dignity hughie leesmith is that rare specimen of contemporary manthe dedicated artist who is also the urbane wellrounded citizen although his youthful good looks and freshness of style might belie it leesmith has been impressing art connoisseurs and winning art prizes since when he scored with third prize and honorable mention in the annual exhibition for artists and craftsmen at the cleveland museum of art detroit where he spent most of the years between and claims him and is the scene of many of his artistic triumphs and exhibitions as a teacher he is virtually a seasonal fixture in the

winning out over rank boy with tire like much of leesmiths work features a peculiarly haunting quality of loneliness and quiet desolation against an urban backdrop there is in his landscapes a spatial

state university detroit and the lagos museum in nigeria west africa the help of the selfappointed experts jazz has been manufacturing its own mausoleum for twenty years these experts gnashed and grieved at the lack of acceptance for the one true american art form since the acceptance finally came they have denounced it at every step flailing away at the network television shows musical prostitution deriding the major jazz festivals circuses opposing every new attempt to bring the music into a mass medium for twenty years they bemoaned the relegation of jazz to cheap saloons and dance halls today instead of rejoicing at the profusion of national concerts and global tours they whine that too many acts are crowded into the shows and bemoan the low intellectual level of the audiences and the profit motives of the promoters for twenty years they complained that the giants in the field had earned pygmy recognition today the top jazzmen have been so glamourized and oversentimentalized by these same experts that a chorus blown by a nowdead artist while under the influence of sesame seeds taped on a home recorder in the basement of a bordello at am evokes more learned analyses than the most brilliant work of a nationally popular bandleader taped in seventrack stereophonic high fidelity popularity of course is the sure road to excommunication among these solemn seekers after a world they wish they had never found to qualify among the cognoscenti as a jazzman of consequence you need a an active rejection of the publics interest or preferably no public interest at all b a police record preferably for violation of the narcotics laws c an utter lack of concern for beauty of sound d a death certificate andor e a capacity for solemnity and the conviction that jazz is a deadly serious business this narrows the field neatly in a you have miles davis who turns his back on audiences and thelonious monk who seems unaware that they exist we wont go into the unhealthy details of b the constant newspaper headlines though slanted are basically factual chief contenders for c are ornette coleman john coltrane and sonny rollins in d charlie parker and lester young in e john lewis gunther schuller and a handful of other third stream jazzniks adding gerry mulligan and a couple more you find that this minute minority representing five per cent of the top jazz talent gathers more than fifty per cent of the nationalmagazine feature articles on jazz the rest are too popular too witty or too alive when bix beiderbecke flourished jelly roll morton had his red hot peppers venuti and lang their blue four and ellington his original cotton club band there too much for the slick boys from the slick sheets who have been trying for a dozen years to chase him back to canada leonard feather devoting an entire down beat column to fergusons alleged malfeasances summed up his work as a ghastly and unswinging display of bad taste a summation that would serve better as a description of feathers own column ah for the handy duality of a jazz critic not too many years later a ferguson lp appeared with notes written byyou guessed itthe same mr feather it was mr feather too who found sidney bechets vibrato harsh and shrill yet was able to write fifteen hundred warm words on him for blue note records nat hentoff who once wrote in down beat after thirteen years in jazz i know by now that if you say maynard ferguson is the most tasteless overrated trumpet player this side of clyde mccoy somebody is going to get mad is a past master at the art of endorsement endorse of course means to write on the back as well as to give ones name or support to to sanction after notably failing to endorse the clarinetist buddy de franco often dismissing himnot without reasonas cold and unemotional of one de franco album the technique is swift and assured but not only is the playing decidedly chilly even de francos conception is disappointing there are clean almost diagrammatic patterns but what are they say ing hentoff nevertheless succeeded in endorsing him when he hentoff wrote the jacket notes for three of de francos verve lps noted for his gravely earnest dedication as a critic mr hentoff has written wordy endorsements of such major jazz figures as russ morgan for recent albums such as russ morgan at catalina mellow unhurried melodically clear music and morgan time spirited and yet graceful sweeping and tender glowing sensitive rollicking provocative on the other hand he has come out fearlessly against the enemies of the true jazz for instance his constructive blanket statement that he is antiella fitzgerald was quoted in a recent issue of show business illustrated this is in line with his previously stated position reviewing a fitzgerald album for down beat he observed ella is excellent the album is thoroughly recommended because of ellashe floats with superb phrasing through the ballads and rocks the uptempos ella of course deserves five stars if ella today were to team up with russ morgan perhaps hentoff would reverse his antiella fitzgerald position kiss and make up hentoffs soulbrother and coconsultant for the cbstv show the sound of jazz in is whitney balliett currently a purveyor of jazz esoterica to the forty ish commuters who dig the new yorker who suffers from what appears to be a case of advanced onomatopoeia is it because you are a drummer manque whit old boy that you analyze your percussive betters in such terms as knicketyknack ticketythumpticktackthumpthump ping and swoosh or are you simply trying to make the magazines infatuation with sound of own coined words department in either case an english translation would be helpful balliett often is capable of realistic perception he once wrote bohemians law that true art originates only in the garret still operates to an astonishing degree in jazz when an occasional jazz musician breaks into the big time he immediately becomes suspect and often as not is dropped from all rolls of honor yet the same balliett has made this profound observation barring the blues and duke ellington jazz has never bothered its head much about content whether content here means size capacity matter dealt with or material contained to imply that fletcher henderson jelly roll morton eddie sauter sy oliver ralph burns or even pete rugolo ever lacked content is delicious sure and maugham wolfe wells shaw shakespeare and oflaherty never bothered their heads much about plot right another man the critics have done their best to bury since he began to please the public is dave brubeck who represents a deadend pseudomodernism for hentoff while feather confessed to an ambivalent reaction to the flood of publicity that has engulfed brubeck how much closer is the tie between genuine jazz feeling and the modern jazz quartet ira gitler reviewing brubecks ingenious time out album suggested if brubeck wants to experiment with time let him not insult his audiences with such crashingbore devices better still if he wants to experiment let him begin with trying some real jazz listen to any brubeck lp then to one of those third stream music concoctions in which john lewis submerges his modern jazzless quartet in a farrago of pseudocryptoneoquasiclassicalism all right gentlemen which one has the beat ironically this same thirdstream fusion was effected eleven years ago by stan kentons orchestra with writers like bob graettinger bill russo franklyn marks alongside whom the posturings of the john lewisgunther schuller clique are pretentiously pathetic yet hentoff said kentons alleged innovations in jazz are a badly assimilated pastiche of the classical impressionists of a generation and more ago this criticism is more aptly applicable to schuller co in the view of andre previn who observed if somebody were to say that im imitating gunther schuller id quit the business martin williams perhaps the champion nit picker of the whole critical brotherhood he writes articles with titles like the funkyhard bop regression is capable of such a bon mot as thelonious monk is what no jazzman has ever been before him my italics still a legitimate innovator and experimenter after over fifteen years working directly with the materials of jazz take a funkyhardbopregressive bow marty you just wrote ellington gillespie gil evans and lester young out of the party the case history of the aforementioned andre previn is a perfect example of critical hostility toward popularity versatility clean living a sense of humor and a lack of pomp all of which previn is unfortunate enough to claim he has been espoused by only three major critics ralph gleason who like previn is cursed with a sense of humor wilder hobson the level of whose critical values may be gauged by his explanation of the superiority of such bands as basies the answer may lie to some extent in the negro ganglia and leonard feather who can be discounted since he has supervised recording sessions for and has had a couple of his songs recorded by previn previn has all the wrong credentials he is a european white the critics though not antiwhite have a tendency to be suspicious of nonnegro performers a former child prodigy a bestselling record artist a classical pianist who avoids mixing that part of his work with the rest a jazz pianist who enjoys playing a versatile writer who at nineteen was a composerconductor in the despised hollywood studios a producer of popular ugh songs one of which won an academy award nomination and winner of two oscars for the movie scores of gigi and porgy and bess he might have lived down two or three such handicaps but the tout ensemble makes him the persona least likely to be grata in all of jazz critical history why is popularity anathema to the pundits why are les mccann the most successful new pianist since peterson and a hirt the biggest new trumpeter since ferguson not even listed in the latest edition of feathers encyclopedia of jazz why is the immortal concert music of gershwin written off by hentoff as selfconsciously flatulent sentimental instantly dated why does balliett find it trying work to listen to the delightfully unpretentious piano of ahmad jamal whose work is so much more broadly accepted than monks one key answer lies in the trend toward ugliness a factor now a part not merely of jazz but of the whole body of american popular art in which it has become a can cer velma west sykes who conducts the national screen council for box office a trade magazine for theatre exhibitors observed once beauty to the point of perfection was what the sculptor and the painter tried to portray now the grotesque the weird and the repulsively ugly are the rage among art critics once stories were written about successful people now the sharecropper the skidrow alcoholic the call girl the wealthy playboys and playgirls of loose morals are the folks you most often meet in current bestselling novels and plays miss sykess comments have a perfect parallel in jazz where once we heard the exquisite purity of johnny hodges alto we face the cacophony of an ornette coleman who rejects tone chords harmony and melody whose champions equate anarchy with progress coleman hawkins and ben websters tenor sax warmth gets nothing but occasional lip service from the yolktops whose tedious homilies are generally devoted to the rankling racket of john coltrane harry carneys rich full baritone sax has given way to the grainy schoolboy bleatings of gerry mulligan and todays new trumpeters lacking both the pure gold of armstrong and the brash brass of ferguson strive after the thin strained tones of the lesser beboppers as ralph j gleason once odserved john q square is a lot hipper than hes been given credit for good music invariably rises to the surface stravinsky outlived his most virulent antagonists jelly roll mortons memory is unsullied despite the immature tirades of feather gershwins family can laugh off hentoff whose sarcasm can hardly erase the esteem in which the composer has been held for close to forty years lets remember too that cassals heifetz and horowitz were never criticized for paying too much attention to technique similarly the wellorganized creativity of ellington and kenton the genius of peterson the unique facility and versatility of previn and the rest of the reviled major talents of jazz will prevail simply because talent is a form of truth the real truths of jazz have a way of making themselves seen and heard and will continue to do so long after the cackle of the critics has sputtered its way to an inky inglorious coda what you should know about equal job rights what exactly is the purpose of the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity the preamble of executive order issued by president kennedy states the purpose clearly when it declares minus the whereas discrimination because of race creed color or national origin is contrary to the constitutional principles and policies of the united states it is the plain and positive obligation of the united states government to promote and ensure equal opportunity for all qualified persons without regard to race creed color or national origin employed or seeking employment with the federal government and on government contracts it is the policy of the executive branch of the government to encourage by positive measures equal opportunity for all qualified persons within the government it is in the general interest and welfare of the united states to promote its economy security and national defense through the most efficient and effective utilization of all available manpower the presidents committee was established by the president to carry out the above policy who are the members of the committee and how were they chosen the officers and members of the committee were appointed by president kennedy when he signed executive order on march the president appointed vice president lyndon b johnson chairman secretary of labor arthur j goldberg vice chairman and assistant secretary of labor jerry r holleman executive vice chairman

administrator national aeronautics and space administration eugene m zuckert secretary of the air force how does the individual citizen know which firms are oblu gated to abide by the presidents executive order forbidding racial discrimination in hiring there is no sure way for the individual citizen to determine whether a firm is a government contractor such information is a matter of general knowledge in a community insofar as many business firms are concerned but there is understandable lack of certainty as regards other firms particularly subcontractors there is no such thing as a master list of government contractors the number runs into the hundreds of thousands the presidents committee maintains a list of contractors subject to filing compliance reports from this list it can reply to inquiries asking whether specific companies are government contractors but it must be remembered that the list which is not complete at this time consists only of firms holding contracts of or more and employing or more persons since committee jurisdiction applies to contracts of or more the compliance report list is far from a complete listing when a complaint of discrimination is filed with the committee the compliance report listing first is checked if the companys name does not appear on that list other procedures including telegraphic inquiry to the company are followed to determine whether the named company is a contractor locally the following means of identifying government contractors are probably the most certain find out if he displays the we pledge equal employment opportunity poster on his bulletin board look at recruitment advertising to see if he identifies himself as an equal opportunity employer determine if the plant or company is a subsidiary of a company which is a known government contractor put the direct question to the company as to whether it is a government contractor how does the individual citizen go about filing a complaint when he feels he has been refused a job because of race he may file his complaint either with the government agency with which the company is doing business or he may file it directly with the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity washington d c while the complaint may be filed in a letter in most instances a complainant fails to provide all necessary information when he writes a letter in such cases the committee replies to the letter by sending a complaint form with spaces and instructions for the necessary information complaint forms are available from the committee or from the contracting agencies a complaint may be filed by an individuals representative but must be signed by the complainant who determines whether a firm is in fact discriminating against job applicants because of race first it should be pointed out that the committee is interested not only in job applicants but also in employees the equal employment opportunity clause in government contracts declares the contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race creed color or national origin the contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race creed color or national origin such action shall include but not be limited to the following employment upgrading demotion or transfer recruitment or recruitment advertising layoff or termination rates of pay or other forms of compensation and selection for training including apprenticeship the procedure followed by the committee provides for transmittal of the complaint to the contracting agency the agency investigates and reports its findings andor actions to the committee the committee may either accept or reject the agencys report the report may be sent back for further investigation or the committee may conduct a joint investigation with the agency or it may make its own investigation or require a full compliance review on the conclusion of the investigation the agency makes its decision as to whether there was discrimination subject to review of the committee staff and executive vice chairman the agency andor the committee sees to it that necessary corrective action is taken in many parts of the country negroes have never been hired in other than menial jobs in factories and governmentconnected installations are these employers required to end their racial hiring practices each contract signed by the government and a contractor includes the sixpoint equal employment opportunity clause under this clause which is a provision of the contract the contractor is required to provide equal opportunity without regard to race creed color or national origin the mere signing of a contract clause of course does not insure performance each contracting agency in government is charged with responsibility for administration of its own contracts not only insofar as this clause is concerned but in all other areas of performance it goes without saying that there are varying degrees of performance under a contract as rapidly and as widely as possible the contracting agencies and the committee hope to achieve the fullest possible compliance with the equal opportunity contract clause in all sections of the country compliance includes the elimination of hiring policies based on race and treatment of all job applicants on an equal basis does the committee ever step in of its own accord to persuade employers to hire negroes this question must be answered in two parts first the committee has authority to step in of its own accord to insist on equal employment opportunity when the executive order and contract clause are being violated but in general the regular procedure of referring such matters to the contracting agency is followed second it would be in error to say that the committee persuades employers to hire negroes the committee insists on merit employment without regard to race creed color or national origin this means that all qualified applicants must be given equal consideration for employment it also means employees must be given equal consideration for promotion upgrading transfer etc furthermore as required in the executive order and the contract clause the government contractor is required to take affirmative action to insure equal opportunity as a matter of fact of course insistence on equal opportunity results in opening job doors to negroes along with other minority groups who have been the victims of discrimination and experience has shown that affirmative action generally includes active recruitment of negroes and other minority group people by the companies must there always he a case of reported discrimination before the committee steps in no the committee may act on its own motion or on the basis of information received as distinguished from formal complaints but the preferred methodand the most effectiveis on the basis of complaints moreover the caseload of complaints is so heavy that the limited staff and facilities available for investigation negotiation conciliation and review is fully utilized in handling them does filing a complaint entail any fees or expenses for the complaining citizen no a complaint may be filed by letter or preferably on the complaint form provided by the committee while the complaint does not have to be notarized attention is called to the fact that the submission of false or fraudulent information is a federal offense subject to fine andor imprisonment are firms covered hy the presidents executive order required to admit all applicants to their intraining programs they are required to treat all employees equally in all phases of employment including training all qualified applicants for intraining programs must be considered on an equal basis what happens when an employer tells a job applicant that he cannot be hired because the union does not admit negroes by and large the employer who tells a job applicant this is not telling the truth although there are exceptions any applicant so informed is entitled to file a complaint with the committee it will be fully investigated and appropriate action taken it should be pointed out that in most instances management has an absolute hiring prerogative a right it has fought for and retained through the years in many cases the excuse given in the question is merely a means of putting the blame for not hiring on the union when in actual fact the union concerned has no control over hiring does the presidents executive order apply to unions at all yes unions are specifically included in the executive order but it is recognized that the government does not have the same authority over unions that it has over contractors where a contractual obligation is written into the contract the committee is instructed in the executive order to use its best efforts to obtain cooperation of unions and is given authority to hold hearings concerning union policies and practices actually the committee has found national union leadership extremely cooperative as this is written the aflcio executive council is considering a program of union plans for fair practices in which unions will join with the committee in pledging and implementing equal opportunity without regard to race creed color or national origin some unions have insisted on inclusion of nondiscrimination clauses in their collective bargaining contracts and some have included such a provision in their apprenticetraining programs how will the complaining citizen know that the president s committee on equal employment opportunity has taken action on his case the committee advises the complainant that his complaint has been received and that investigation is being undertaken the investigator is required to contact the complainant to verify his complaint and to obtain any additional information he might be able to provide when the case is concluded the complainant is advised of the action taken to date what percentage of complaints have resulted in breaking discriminatory practices by employers as of april the committee had completed action on cases not including complaints in which the committee had no jurisdiction because the companies complained of did not have government contracts of those cases or per cent resulted in corrective action to date has any government contractor been denied further government business because of failure to comply with the presidents order as of april no contractor had been barred from government contracts and no contracts had been cancelled the executive vice chairman of the committee did issue orders requiring the filing of special compliance reports by two companies before they could be awarded additional government contracts upon receipt of the special compliance reports the committee will decide whether additional steps should be taken to insure compliance similar action is pending in connection with other firms has compliance with the presidents executive order opened up a significant number of jobs for negroes across the country there is no way to measure the number of jobs for negroes opened up as a result of the program the compliance report system which is just getting underway will provide some measure but not a compre hensive measure likewise the plans for progress reports from firms cooperating in that program will provide some measure but even taken together the two programs will be far from an accurate measure of what is happening in the employment of negroes what percentage of major businesses in the u s have government contracts there is no accurate figure as to what percentage of businesses have government contracts it is safe to assume however that a big majority probably as many as of the major business firms in the country do business with the government either as contractors or suppliers does the committee have any figures on the number of government contracting firms which hire no negroes in nonmenial jobs the compliance report system which has just been instituted by the committee will provide this information as well as other vital information about employment of negroes and other minority group people insofar as firms with and over contracts and or more employees are concerned has the existence of the presidents executive order substantially increased job opportunities for negroes in the south is there a reason to expect that job opportunities for negroes will increase in the future as a direct consequence of the presidents executive order the word substantially is elastic and might be considered too broad for what has been accomplished to date although job opportunities have been opened to negroes in some plants and some areas of the south where they did not exist before as for the future the answer is a definite yes more and more doors to job opportunities will be opened as the program gathers momentum as more and more companies in more and more areas realize that this committee the agencies and this administration insist upon compliance with the executive order and the contract clause how does the committee go about enforcing the presidents executive order barring discriminatory hiring a full answer to this question would be too lengthy for this occasion listed below are seven steps which were reported by the committee to the president in its report the first nine months which covered the committees work through midjanuary copies of this report as well as committee literature are available without charge from the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity washington d c the seven significant developments reported to the president were every executive agency and some nonexecutive agencies of the federal government have taken affirmative steps to insure equal opportunity for all employees and applicants for employment affirmative steps for insuring equal opportunity have been taken by a sizable number of business firms either through the plans for progress program or as the result of complaints filed with the committee agencies are developing manpower capability for effective operation of affirmative action programs with government contractors the compliance report system of the committee will provide for the first time information on minority group employment necessary for the development of affirmative programs on a broad scale the committee has launched an educational and informational program aimed at developing greater incentive on the part of minority group persons to train for the fields of employment in which the doors are being openedor opened widerand to see to it that the training is available programs of affirmative action in labor unions similar to and patterned after the plans for progress in industry are being developed concrete steps are being taken to insure equal opportunity in apprenticeship and training programs and in government employment services a gift of song first met paul laurence dunbar in a slim volume titled lil gal and read the poems of lowly life with much pleasure memorizing several of them there were tenderness and empathy in them humor and pathos i years later a friend quoted a stanza from a poem of his called when malindy sings fiddlin man jes stop his fiddlin lay his fiddle on de shef mockinbird quit tryin to whistle cause he jes so shamed hissef folks aplayin on de banjo draps dey fingahs on de strings bless yo soulfugits to move em when malindy sings i liked that so much i wanted to find out more about the author who had passed on in and was surprised to find out that he was not from a southern state but had been bom in dayton ohio where then i wondered had he learned to express himself in the correct idiom and situations of his poems it was from his mother matilda dunbar who had been born in slavery and who told him stories in the limpid negro dialect of old kentucky i read his father joshua had also been a slave and the war between the north and the south had been ended only seven years when the baby boy was born lets call him paul said his father the bible says paul was a great man some day this boy will be great and do you honor and so he was named paul laurence dunbar laurence being the name of a family friend one wonders now if pauls father had the gift of prophecy because judging from where he started and what he succeeded in becoming he could be called great and he surely did do his mother honor his father did not live to share it pauls mother had learned to read and write and she taught both father and son when paul was only four years old his lessons began poetry was an especial love of matilda and she soon recognized the poetic gift that paul evidenced in his early boyhood and encouraged it in every way she could in both grammar and high school paul was liked for himself and recognized for his talent by his teachers and classmates in his senior year he was president of the literary society and editor of the school paper at graduation the only negro in his class he wrote the lyrics for the class song paul had high hopes then with his good scholastic record he would get a clerical position and be able to help his widowed mother so that she wouldnt need to work so hard his buoyancy was cruelly deflated because he was a negro nobody would hire him for office work he had to take a job as an elevator boy for four dollars a week he made the best of it continuing to scribble down verses at every opportunity his former classmates and teachers encouraged him in every way they could and his poems began to be printed in various newspapers when he was twenty he was asked to give the address of welcome to a meeting of the western association of writers this was really quite an honor and he made a very favorable impression on the assembled writers one of the members later quoted some of pauls verses in a newspaper article james whitcomb riley whom paul admired read it and wrote him praising the verses paul and his mother began to hope that his published verses might be issued in book form but they knew he would have to pay for the publishing himself how could he do that help came in the form of a loan and the enthusiastic help of his classmates the book oak and ivy appeared just before christmas and within a couple of weeks paul was able to repay the loan now he began giving readings of his poems in different cities as will carleton james whitcomb riley and others were doing he was becoming well known as a poet but he and his mother were nearly penniless friends old and new came to his help again impressed by his courage and perseverance in paul had another book of poems published majors and minors william dean howells the distinguished critic wrote a review of it in harpers weekly the copy containing the review came out on the poets birthday june and as a result of the article orders for the book poured in and paul received over letters of cordial appreciation his next book lyrics of lowly life was issued by a standard publisher and contained an introduction by william dean howells besides when malindy sings this book contained other favorites as ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes and ode to ethiopia a poem exalting his mother race reciting its wrongs praising its virtues and urging continued striving toward better things howells said that so far as he could remember paul dunbar was the only man of pure african blood and of american civilization to feel the negro life aesthetically and express it lyrically a race which had come to this effect in any member of it had attained civilization in him and i permitted myself the imaginative prophecy that the hostilities and the prejudices which had so long constrained his race were destined to vanish in the arts that these were to be the final proof that god had made of one blood all nations of men dinners and receptions were given for him and after a visit to england where he met many distinguished persons paul was offered a position in the library of congress thus relieving him of the financial strain he was always feeling poetry as everyone knows brings in little money he had four novels published but they were inferior to his poetry i read a description of paul as he appeared at this timeof medium height with a lithe wellproportioned figure a resonant mellow voice and an appealing personality gentle and sincere if he had lived longer he might have gone to greater heights be cause he never ceased dreaming and learning some spoke of his writing as the beginning of a tradition others as the end of a regime with more years of personal experience in the slowly changing world as regards the negro race he might well have contributed more forthright expression of his own time but as dr w s scarborough said of him in his song he has helped pave the way for a future for his race he has hewn out a path and what was possible in his case is possible for others his dayton home has been a shrine for over fifty years and in a boy scout troop placed a bronze tablet at the entrance under the name of the poet laureate of his race is inscribed this verse from one of his poems because i had loved so dearly because i had loved so long god in his great compassion gave me a gift of song si short story in the summer of charlie was my best friend we were in the same class in elementary school and we lived right next door to each other he in the first high stoop house from the comer and i in the second by standing on our backyard fire escapes and reaching out we could pass things to one another my mother came home late in the evening and my father never until much later so when i came in from school and my sister wasnt there to tell on me i would climb out on the fire escape and call to charlie to do this we each had a long string with a stone wrapped in cloth tied to it hanging from our fire escapes once when charlie had been mean to the lady under him she cut his string anyway to call to each other we would swing the stones so that they tapped the window the day of graduation from elementary school charlie was so excited when he came home that he almost broke my window when i climbed out on the fire escape he was there all dressed up in his blue suit with a tragic look on his face i thought you were dead he said why didnt you come to school i was sick i answered you dont look sick now how was it i interrupted you didnt get left back did you of course i didnt you know what somebody said he continued they said your mama couldnt afford to buy you a new suit they were right you mean you missed graduation because you didnt have a new suit would you have gone if you didnt have one yeah he answered i guess youre right i probably wouldnt have its all that stupid principals fault if he hadnt announced that everybody had to wear blue suits and all that this wouldnt have happened then as an afterthought he added couldnt your mama afford to buy you a new suit i dont know i replied i guess not but i really didnt know we werent any poorer than charlies family and from the way mama had explained it when i had asked her i had been unable to figure out whether we could afford it or not she had said that the sunday suit i had was good enough for anybodys graduation and that if any of the other kids were getting new ones she hoped it was because they needed them when i tried to explain that it wasnt the other kids that i was thinking of but my teachers she looked at me real hard and said i know you dont want a new suit because the white man says so my principal says we should all your principal huh a hundred boys sitting up there in blue suits may be the most important thing in the world to him but its not to me if how you look is all that counts then maybe youd better stay home but mama i cant stay home i cried then go in what you got i stared at her unable to believe this lack of understanding then turned and walked away i was sitting at the fire escape window indulging in a fantasy of how i would kill myself and she would have to buy the new suit to bury me in when i felt her come up behind me look here she said i want to talk to you i dragged myself around and saw her standing there wiping her hands in her apron honey she began softly a new suit isnt going to change you as far as the white man is concerned to him youll still be a little colored boy that man she continued looking off out of the window is up there on a mountain and hell probably be up there all your life but remember youre as good as he is new suit or no new suit tears began to run down my cheeks but i gave no sign of even noticing them she didnt understand me my own mother here she was talking about mountains and all i wanted was a new suit did you hear what i said the tears came faster and finally unable to ignore them i wiped my shirtsleeve across my face and blurted out all i want is a new suit just then the door opened and daddy came in when mama turned around i ran off i didnt tell charlie any of this that day on the fire escape and it wasnt until august that i realized what she meant in august charlie and i decided to visit columbia university we planned the trip one day in advance and the following morning arose very early and set out through momingside park which separated the valley where we lived from the area where the university lay the park a two block wide strip of trees grass rocks and sand rose steeply from momingside avenue to morningside heights its many planned paths and beaten trails having long since given up their secrets to us we crossed it rapidly pausing only twice once to cautiously inspect a man who was lying in the bushes we thought we had accidentally stumbled onto a murder but it turned out he was a drunk and the other time to throw stones at two dogs to prevent them from doing what we had been told would be injurious to their health at the top we rested in an oval from where we could look out over the whole of harlem it was bunched up it seemed between central park and the yankee stadium its old buildings spilling almost into the east river with cars and people filling the remaining spaces like black lava we tried to count all the parked cars we could see but after reaching two hundred we tired turned and headed toward the university we found ourselves in another world the buildings were tall and immaculate their polished brass fronts opening onto glistening tile floors which beckoned towards cool dark opulent depths awnings everywhere and the streets were large and clean the white granite faces of the buildings meeting the sidewalks in a line unbroken from comer to comer after two blocks we came to a sprawling group of buildings and charlie said this must be it know what i bet if we had been dressed up i bet that woman wouldnt have thought we robbed her yes she would have too i replied it wouldnt have made any difference how do you know it wouldnt have made any difference i almost told him what mama had said but changed my mind i just do thats all i just do we stood looking at each other im sure he knew what i meant then two cats began fighting in the

great good friend silas hamilton died the year was silas was a physician and he had shown an affection for george that was to be reflected throughout the state of illinois for years to come at the bequest of silas a double crypt had been prepared and the vacant space was to be occupied by george who would one day be laid at the side of silas george looked longingly at the double grave when silas passed away he had no real family except silas he would just as soon go too now when silas will was read was to be used for the construction of a primary school in otterville it was to be the first free school in the state of illinoisthree thousand dollars in cash was left to george having been taught the rudiments of book learning by silas george who was forty years younger than silas wanted from the beginning to pass along knowledge to others he realized a limited education could help a person only so far the thought of a school close enough to walk to fired his interest and although he was nearly twenty years old he decided to enroll the first day school opened the day came when he taught on many occasions in the hamilton primary school when the regular teacher was indisposed frugal by nature as well as by the example silas had set george put his into savings with his small earnings as a farm hand he accumulated enough to purchase his own land he began to farm it and realized profits from it every year george became well versed in the bible he kept to himself a great deal studying and pondering when the otterville baptist church which was erected partly with georges funds was not visited by the circuit preacher it was george who stood in the pulpit and delivered the sunday sermon for a long time he had known the value of wholesomeness and as he looked back to the memories of his association with silas hamilton the person he knew best it occurred to him that he would like to imitate silas most outstanding quality that characteristic of being rid of more pesky traits than the average human being the attribute most of all was the ignorance silas was so completely rid of status or social class did not mean anything to silas where his patients friends and neighbors were concerned he was without reluctance to actually love his brother the rid of george never forgot about silas was his definition of learningnot a means to an end unless the student knew the meaning of purpose to this day ottervilles population has not increased beyond the number of several hundred people but from early days of its settlement it was developed into a rich agricultural region george lived as a bachelor in the community honest and shrewd he was known as a good man but there was nothing about his everyday life that attracted attention no it was not when george lived that people gave much consideration to him except as a genial neighbor but when he died in april the townspeople accorded a high tribute to him as they laid him to rest beside silas hamilton then came the reading of georges will and otterville friends realized most certainly now the love he held in his heart for others the community learned that had been set aside for the erection of a monument in the memory of silas its people were privileged to see what is probably the only monument of its kind in the worlderected by a single man in memory of another individual he admired part of the inscription on the stone reads the monument stands today but another stipulation in georges will is the one that after years is a living testimony of his profound feeling for humanity he left the residue or whatever may be left of the estate not otherwise appropriated to the education of qualified persons of jersey county of which otterville was a part the residue amounted to a board of trustees was appointed to administer it it became the george washington educational fund was put in trust under the jurisdiction of the circuit court of jersey county and through its interest earning power increased to within sixty years during the first fifty years so few applicants had come from students in jersey county the board of trustees decided to extend the limits of residence to the whole state of illinois sixtyeight years from the date of probation of george washingtons will students had been helped to a higher education a resident of illinois applying for financial assistance to further his education will be advised by the board of trustees that he must provide references of good character have a good scholastic standing and he or she must indicate what specific course of study he wishes to pursue what the letterhead george washington educational fund or its contents does not say is that the applicant must be a colored person or an american of african descent for george washington of otterville illinois was a negro and a christian freeman it has been mainly by word of mouth that scholars have the unique qualification of his will his legacy to aid others to follow him to be rid of the handicaps of ignorance has been realized in a way he could have hardly visualized r m warner jerseyville illinois present secretary of the fund reports that students have been assisted up to this year reflecting the higher general economic status of illinois negro residents in recent times mr warner points out for the last eight or ten years we have had very few requests for assistance he would not have presumed to substitute riddance as one of the three rs but george would be pleased to know how far his bounty has gone toward providing the substitution le over i am a southerner i was bred in the south where my forefathers were slaveholders and confederate soldiers i was born and raised in southern towns with their rigid racial patterns and their typical southern prejudice i was away from the south for a few years but i returned to live in the south by choice and intend to remain here for the rest of my life i love the south and its people i like having two black arms in my kitchen and two black legs pushing my lawn mower to help take the drudgery out of living for myself and my family and i like having them at a very minimum of cost to me i like choosing my own friends and associates and i like eating in pleasant places with well bred people of my own race class and status i like to worship in a church which is composed of my friends and equals where i will be among my own group racially socially and intellectually i like for my children to go to school with their own kind and with other children of their own racial social and intellectual level i like for them to be shielded against poverty ignorance dirt and disease i like to practice medicine among intelligent cooperative people who understand what i am trying to do for them who are friends as well as patients and who pay their bills i like to live in a neighborhood composed of people of my own group who have pleasant well kept homes and where there is no conflict or strife i do not want my daughter to marry a negro i like the racial status quo i am a southerner but i am also a christian as a christian i must believe that god created all men and that all men are equal in the sight of god i must believe that all men are my brothers and are children of god and that i am my brothers keeper i must believe that jesus meant what he said when he commanded me to love my neighbor as myself and when he commanded me to do unto others as i would have them do unto me i must believe that the church is gods house and that it does not belong to me to the congregation of trinity presbyterian church or to the southern presbyterian church i must be lieve in the fellowship of all believers i am also a scientist and have devoted my life to the pursuit of objective truth therefore i must know that while there are individual differences among people there is no such thing as racial inferiority i must know that within every group there are individuals with different potentialities and that i cannot arbitrarily classify anyone on the basis of his race or color i must know that poverty and ignorance and isolationcall it segregation if you willbreed feelings of inferiority frustration resentment and despair and that these feelings in turn lead to misery to immorality and to crime which in turn not only depress the people and the groups involved but the community as a whole and the whole country therefore as a christian and as a scientist i am obligated to act on the basis of what i know and what i believe and not on the basis of what i like i must live by conviction and by conscience rather than by preference and by prejudice i must therefore regard every man rich or poor black or white as a child of god and as a person not as some kind of subhuman being or animal or even as an inferior i must try to see to it that every individual gets equal rights under the law and in politics this applies particularly to the right of equal justice in the courts and to the right of the exercise of political privilege that is the right to vote i am obligated to pay a living wage to every man who works for me and to do my best to see that others do the same i must accord to every man the right to rise to the limit of his abilities in any job or profession and i must make every attempt to see that no man is blocked because of his race or social status if any individual of any race rises to a position equal to mine then i must accord to him the same privileges that i have and welcome him as an equal i must see to it that everyone has an opportunity for an education as good as my own children have if this means as the social scientists the courts and the negroes themselves believe that that education must be the same education as my children have then i must accept it and encourage it i must try to see to it that no man be humiliated and rejected because of his color if this means that the negro eats where i eat sits next to me in the theater or rides next to me in public transportation then i am obliged to accept it i must see to it that every man has an opportunity for a decent home and decent surroundings and if this means that he will live in my neighborhood or in the house next to mine then that is the way it must be if a negro wants to worship in my church or join my church then i am obligated to see to it that he is not only accepted but welcomed into that church even if it be trinity presbyterian church i must not be led by false pride to try to judge his motives for coming into that church i i must try to overlook the selfish politicians who use the negro for their own ends the communist agitators who delight in stirring up i i racial strife the noisy aggressive negro who abuses his privileges i and who makes life unpleasant for me and even the negroes who exploit their own race i must even overlook such irrelevant questions as which race is the further developed which race pays the most taxes etc and remember the basic principles on which i am trying to act and in which i believe i must not only accept the efforts of the negro to achieve his legitimate aspirations but i must try to help him achieve them and i i believe that the church must do the same if it is a truly christian church i must do this even though it goes against my deepest prejudices and even though it threatens my superior and isolated position in the community and even though it entails the risk of intermarriage basically the problem is not one of what i like but what i know to be right i must not let my wishes determine my attitude toward my associates my school my church or even my own family but if i am true to the principles which i profess then i must act according to those principles this i believe by warren t greenleaf remarkable social experiment is being carried on in chicago these days one of the citys largest merchandising firms is hiring people with black skin for the same reason it hires people with white skin the reason is merit that is the person hired negro or white shows promise of being able to perform the work for which he has applied such a policy is known as fair employment practice and it is not news today any company that does business with the government is required to consider job applicants without respect to race religion or national origin but in the retailing business it is unusual in the first place retailers seldom come under the provisions of the fair employment practices commission legislation in the second place retailing by its nature requires the greatest possible exposure to an unpredictable buying public and relatively few retailers have been willing to risk sales by asking white customers to buy their shoes or gloves from negro sales people even companies that do adhere to the fepc code have been slow to bring negroes and other minority group members into middle and upper management negro girls usually it seems lightskinned have been appearing more and more often as secretaries in the large corporations and negro men sometimes serve as foremen in manufacturing plants but the day when a negro will sit on the board of directors of a white firm still seems remote it is impossible to predict when a negro will be a director of carson pirie scott company in chicago or indeed if a negro ever will however as a result of the companys adoption of a hiring on merit program the opportunity is there carsons is a company that employs people in its retail stores in metropolitan chicago and downstate illinois heading the companys operations as president and director is c virgil martin a fiftyish sixfooter with a firm but friendly manner and a conviction that ideals arent worth much until somebody puts them into action martins ideas on segregation of any kind are strong even though quietly expressed he grew up in bloomington illinois a community in which there were few negroes and few unreasoned fears perhaps this contributed to his easy acceptance of the idea that negroes and whites are basically equal his mother and father impressed that principle upon him and emphasized it by selecting a negro doctor to take care of him in his earliest years martin first encountered segregation when he took a job in another town to help pay his tuition through illinois wesleyan university he was working as assistant boys secretary at a ymca and found that the swimming pool was closed to negroes the boys secretarymy boss didnt even know when the rule had been made we talked about it and decided to break the barrier just by letting the negro boys in it caused a bit of a fuss on the part of a vocal minority but there was no real trouble martins concern with social values continued after his graduation from school he took his ab at illinois wesleyan and a masters degree in business administration from the university of chicago he went into social work as an administrator became executive director of the indianapolis community fund and in the midforties served as executive director of the new york city war fund organization by when he joined carsons as general superintendent martins varied experience had added to his sense of social justice a knowledge of how things were accomplished in the business world the combination has served him well undoubtedly it helped lead to his selection in as chairman of the illinois public aid commission which oversees the administration of million in welfare funds each year in contrast to many business executives who regard public aid programs as throwaways martin views them as investments in people which if properly administered will pay dividends in the economic order as well as the social the story of how martin and carsons have been able to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices suggests that ideals can be a good deal more practical than many selfstyled realists would allow the story begins in it was about that time that the first fepctype legislation was passed in new york state i was opposed to that legislation at first martin recalls it seemed to do nothing but solidify resistance to equal employment opportunities and lead to ingenious ways of avoiding compliance but as time went on without bringing any suggestions from the leaders in the retailing business as to ways of improving hiring policies with respect to negroes and other minority groups carsons decided to design a program of its own before a government model could be forced on the company the first step was to obtain agreement from all members of top management that the act of discrimination was wrong in itself and that carsons should eliminate bias in hiring we debated this in our top management for a year and a half says martin all but one of the top men agreed that we should do something about the problem and we decided that we wouldnt move until he was sold nobody put any pressure on the man but as the months passed he began to feel like a heel now hes one of the most enthusiastic backers of our equal employment policy after the policy had been debated and approved the next question was that of approach sessions with negro and white backers of fair employment practices helped carsons management lay down some guide lines first we decided that there would be no publicity on the program martin says too many people try to make integration a drama next we agreed that we would not hire negroes for the traditional jobs elevator operator porter that sort of thing the purpose of the program wasnt just to put negroes on the payroll but to give them a real chance at positions that were formerly closed to them martha douglas director of personnel activities for the company and one of the planners of the hiring on merit program remembers that management also had to define the nature and goals of the program very clearly some people think integration is running out and hiring lots of negroes that wasnt the point of the program at all hiring on merit meant that there would be no discrimination against minority groups it also meant that there would be no discrimination in their favor the first negro to join carsons under the new program came in as a member of the companys junior executive training team he began work as a tracer in the adjustment bureau within months the bureau manager asked if there were any more negroes available for assignment to his section carsons felt hiring on merit had passed its first test today years after the program began there are very few levels of upper and middle management in which there are no negroes according to martin hiring is just the first step promotion is on merit also negroes serve as assistant department managers stock department supervisors credit and personnel interviewers interviewing both whites and negroes for jobs and charge accounts and as sales people on the floorsthe most sensitive areas of a department store the manager responsible for carsons downtown properties after hoursand that represents many millions of dollars says martinis a negro many negro supervisors have white subordinates i sat in on a discussion yesterday at which a negro was being considered for a department managership hell be responsible for purchases promotions sales and profit on several lines of merchandise hell have a terrific psychological problem because he will be the first negro department manager says martin translating retailing titles into familiar terms id say hell face the same degree of difficulty that jackie robinson faced when he went into the majors there is as yet no negro in top titles into familiar terms id say ceived some nasty letters says management at carsons whether there will be is not a question of tolerance or of brotherhood but simply of business the first negro who serves as an officer will do so because he has more ability than his contemporaries this is one aspect of the thinking behind carsons employment policy the hiring on merit program is regarded by management not as a form of missionary activity but as a business policy from the beginning the successor failure of the program was not to be judged by the percentage of negroes employed by the firm nor by the volume of praise it brought the program would have to meet the same test as that applied to any program undertaken by the company did it help the business attain the end for which it was founded making money in a legitimate way one of the encouraging results of carsons hiring on merit policy is that it has proven to be good business after the first negro sales people appeared on the floor we received some nasty letters says martin all unsigned we also received hundreds of favorable letters signed from white people the favorable results of the program were not limited to expressions of approval from customers another was carsons discovery that it had tapped a pool of excellent workers who had been passed over because of prejudice or fear negro employees have proven themselves equal to whites and predictably more than equal in many cases the program has not been without snags of course carsons had to learn as it went along since the program was in the main a pioneer effort faulty interpretations of the program by supervisors as well as employees called for corrections negro workers were very well accepted by other employees from the beginning martha douglas remembers soon requisitions came to the employment department asking for negroes the requisitions had become discriminatory then we had to explain to department managers that to favor any group defeated the purpose of employment on merit sometime it was negro employees who needed talking to occasionally we had sessions with negro workers to point out the difference between poor business deportment and discrimination a white lady who was rude to a negro sales girl wasnt necessarily a bigot perhaps she was just illmannered we also had to remind some negro associates that they would have to accept correction just as white employees did discipline was not the same as discrimination but despite the problems the company encountered as it enlarged the program carsons considers the hard business advantages alone have justified the work and the planning that went into the hiring on merit policy mrs douglas spoke for carsons management when she summarized the program for a group of midwestern retailers in this way we believe it is economically foolish even unwise business to exclude a large segment of the population from job opportunities the business today that does not employ minority groups cuts itself off from a valuable source of labor supply carsons is benefiting from this valuable source of labor supply but martin draws no comfort from the fact for the existence of such a large number of minds that are going to waste is due in his opinion to discrimination the negro college graduate is the most unemployed man in the country he says he spends time energy and money to develop his mind and talents and then finds that the only jobs open to him are as a truck driver or mechanic but the lack of opportunity resulting from discrimination has a more insidious effect than that of depriving negro college graduates of positions commensurate with their training for martin believes it discourages many young negroes from entering college at all or from improving their abilities in any way its a vicious circle he explains take away from any man worthwhile opportunities and you take away his incentive to develop the talents that would enable him qi to take advantage of opportunity when and if it comes the result martin has found is that the great bulk of negroes lack the basic skills necessary for any employment above the menial level this is not because negroes have less native ability than whites but because their color has forced upon them a future which holds little promise and it is only future hopes that motivate present preparation the effects such a joyless horizon has upon young men and women of a minority group are well known police reports show that the incidence of assaults petty larcenies and the others in the melancholy catalog of melancholy crimes few really big crimes in order to embezzle a million dollars in this country youve got to be white is higher among negroes and puerto ricans than among other racial or national groups yet a recent comparison of the number of juvenile crimes committed in puerto rico and those committed in new york city by puerto ricans showed that delinquency soared among the young migrants to the land of opportunity the effects of discrimination and economic injustice toward the negro show too in current unemployment statistics financial columnist sylvia porter recently cited labor department statistics to back her statement that though our nonwhites make up per cent of our work force they account for per cent in the longterm unemployed group another labor department report showed that in the average negro earned only per cent as much as the average white some commentators felt that this figure was cause for congratulations inasmuch as the figure for was per cent but as michael harrington wrote in commonweal july at this rate the negro will not reach parity with the white man until some time well past the year other indications of the negros attitude toward his white world are not expressed in numbers for example elementary school teachers say that when negro children are asked to draw a man and his family they usually produce a white family this is to be expected advertisers illustrators for the mass media and even doll manufacturers daily teach the children that most attractive people are white what can be done to change an economic system that again in harringtons words keeps the negro down and then uses the fact that the negro is on the bottom of the pile as an argument for keeping him there as a definition for what the negro naturally is there are two parts to this question the first is what can the negro do martin would advise a young negro to acquire professional skills law medicine accounting architectureand then go into industry he believes young negroes would do more to advance the position of their raceand ultimately their ownby entering white corporations rather than negro professional firms this might mean in the case of a young negro lawyer that he would be hidden in a back office preparing briefs for white lawyers to try it is hard advice but solving the problem of economic discrimination will call for real sacrifices the second part of the question is what can the wellmotivated white do to help the negro attain equality in the business world martin has no ready answer for this half of the question which is fitting in a way for he and his company are one audi clam gup aunt clara git g up big toms comp in a terrified voice ggaosji whispered into aunt claras ear as she lay sobbing face down in the dirt you goddamn goodfornothin nigger bellowed big tom the overseer of the plantation giving aunt clara a vicious kick git that swill to the hogs but aunt clara only buried her face deeper into the dirt she was trying desperately to shut out the memories of that terrifying afternoon a slave dealer had arrived at the plantation he had examined her four children richard mar garet elizabeth and palina pinching their firm young flesh and looking at their teeth after assuring himself he was getting his moneys worth he bought them for each and dragged them away aunt clara was bom in january in when she was three years old she was sold with her mother to ambrose smith she was married at eighteen and had four children when ambrose smith died all her children were sold aunt clara was then bought by george brown in kentucky when he died in his children freed aunt clara the law in kentucky required slaves who were freed to leave the state within a year aunt clara was fiftyseven years old when she left the brown plantation for st louis she was a tall woman with a fine carriage sometimes her black eyes were gay sometimes tragic sometimes brooding in st louis she got a job as a cook and washwoman ever since her four children had been sold one dream had filled her life someday somehow she would find them and free them an exorbitant dream for an exslave who could neither read nor write she didnt have the slightest idea how she could accomplish this but with her hand in gods she knew she could do it aunt clara could not read the st louis newspapers but the crowds that jostled her in the streets could hadnt the rocky mountain news in denver got out an extra on brown wrapping paper they had run out of regular print paper headlining the discovery of gold in gregory gulch in colorado thousands were leaving st louis each day for colorado in covered wagons drawn by oxen many of them didnt have the slightest idea of how gold was mined some thought a flat bottom boat with knives on the bottom of the boat was carried to the top of a mountain and then propelled down grade while the knives shaved off the gold as aunt clara listened to the stories of the gold rush she knew there would be plenty of work for her men would pay good wages for cooking and washing and she would save her money always her dream was before her to find her children who had been sold as slaves and to free them she heard of a big caravan leaving for colorado if the boss would take her her stove wash tubs and boards along she would cook for the men on the trip he snapped at her offer the wagons were heavily loaded thirty of them each drawn by six oxen the caravan crawled between the barren windswept peaks of the cruel rocky mountains through terrible gorges and across roaring mountain streams they could only do about two miles an hour naked bones marked a trail of death there were eight terrible weeks of sickness hardships and death they had no meat until they came across a herd of buffalo aunt clara was strong and lithe and as lean as a panther she worked from dawn into the night she comforted the sick and nursed the dying the smell of sweat from the oxen was incense to her suppose she was walking like mike ryan instead of riding in a caravan mike with a companion started out from st louis for colorado with a cart loaded with supplies while one pushed the other one pulled ryans companion gave out but he kept on alone a group of men also bound for the gold camps in colorado overtook ryan who was almost dead from exhaustion some of their oxen had died they offered ryan the job of looking after them he knew nothing whatsoever about oxen but he took the job after weeks of hardship and hunger they reached denver the oxen were almost dead and there was no feed for the starving animals with no time to lose quickwitted mike ryan baked great pones of bread from the flour in the covered wagons when they cooled he fed them to the oxen they devoured the bread and lived the caravan in which aunt clara traveled finally reached auraria colorado now denver after eight terrible weeks auraria was on cherry creek wooden sidewalks were raised a foot above the muddy streets spitsplashed prospectors pushed and jostled from one saloon to another it was a lusty flagrant mining camp with riches pouring into it from central city aunt claras destination was central city she left auraria the same day she arrived the tobacco juice of the driver of the stage coach landed square in the middle of the rump of a pawing grey horse and was the signal for the rearing six horses with a careening stage coach at their heels to start their wild breakneck trip from denver to central city aunt clara wildeyed and fearful clung for hours to the side of the stagecoach as it careened around dangerous hairpin curves and up narrow precipitous virginia canyon whose walls dropped a terrifying thousand feet as the driver of the stagecoach with a mighty flourish of his powerful hairy arms brought it to a sudden stop in central city aunt clara fell sprawled into the mud of eureka street men pushed and jostled each other to get a glimpse of the woman with the black skin where had she come from had she come all the way from africa what was central city coming to when the stage unloaded the likes of her with her old castiron stove and tubs which had been strapped to the top of the stagecoach aunt clara was the first of the colored race to reach the pikes peak region in the gold rush of with her battered old cast iron stove and wash tubs she began to wash for the men hers was the first laundry in the new country now the miners could have their heavy sweaty shirts washed for fifty cents apiece instead of throwing them into the muddy streets to be fought over by mangy hungry dogs aunt clara worked far into the night her little cabin became a hospital and a refuge for the sick and poor she was a good nurse and was always the first on the scene when disaster struck in the mines one night a beautiful young girl in red tights was dancing in the gold dust saloon leathernecked tobaccosplashed prospectors threw gold dust in little bags on to the stage as she stooped to pick them up her red tights split the men howled and stomped and threw more gold dust the girl hadnt always been a dance hall girl in red tights confused and sobbing she ran out of the saloon and down the road to aunt claras cabin there there soothed aunt clara ill sew you up quick as a jiffy so aunt clara sewed up the split in the red tights drying her eyes the girl then went back to the gold dust saloon she was always on the lookout for people who needed help she lived a life of poverty often her meals were only sour dough and cured hog meat she was welcome in every shack whether catholic protestant jew or indian wigwam but she was never too much at home anywhere aunt clara was a friend of columbine lily another dance hall girl one day blacksnake lachut walked into the saloon to order his favorite drink blackberry brandy with his long snake whip he cut off the button that held columbine lilys dress it dropped to the floor and columbine lilv was stark naked there was one place where she could run to in order to get away from blacksnake lachut that was aunt claras cabin down the road he wouldnt dare come there aunt clara wasnt shocked when columbine lily ran into her cabin without a stitch of clothes on she just pulled out her battered old trunk found some red calico and made columbine lily a dress within a year after gold was discovered in gregory gulch men were camped on the sides of the rocky mountains and in the gulches men fought for the privilege of sleeping on the floors of the saloons packed with smelly humanity saloons and gambling houses ran full blast at night men in wide sombreros their woolen shirts open showing hairy chests with little visitors tangled in the hair roared down the dusty mountain trails to central city food was cooked over open fires flour was a sack potatoes a dollar a pound and bad whiskey cents a gulp there were no banks but many of the miners hid their gold dust and nuggets in aunt claras cabin one day a man couldnt get his oxen to cross a bridge over a swollen creek as aunt clara came close she heard him shouting oh lord if yell git me over the goddamn bridge ill never ask ye for another damn favor she helped him get across aunt claras business was prospering and her dream of searching for her children was nearing fulfillment it was aunt claras birthday and mike flaherty her old friend who had struck it rich gave aunt clara a gold watch mike couldnt tell time but neither could aunt clara the old prospectors in central city had a lot of fun asking her what time it was her black eyes would twinkle as she answered see fer yerselfthen yell know i aint lying to ye a young married couple arrived in central city from the eastv the people in the camp wanted to welcome them so they surrounded their cabin and began to serenade them but the bride and groom bolted the door of their cabin for three days and nights the merrymakers besieged the honeymooners the scared bride and bridegroom refused to unbolt their door then someone thought of aunt clara git aunt clara git aunt clara he shouted theyll open their door for her so aunt clara was sent for they unbolted the door for her and she explained to them all the folks wanted to do was to serenade them so then the groom invited the crowd into the cabin to meet his scared bride the serenaders prepared a feast and the merrymaking lasted all night aunt clara who had been quite a dancer in her day danced a jig while the fiddler played good ole turnip greens every sunday morning aunt clara went to church there were a few indians in the congregation the sun was beating down upon the tin roof and it was very hot the young minister talked on and on a young buck dozed off and dropped his gun it went off with visions of an indian uprising every man present jumped to his feet his hand reaching for his gun aunt clara was sitting up in front she stood up drawing her tall body up to its full height holding out her full skirt like it was a big apron she walked down the aisle as cool as a buckberry and demanded that every gun be dropped into it nobody argued with her they were all too glad she had thought so fast and perhaps averted a bloody massacre it hadnt been too long since the last indian uprising the civil war had ended and the slaves had been freed aunt claras face shone with happiness now her dream of finding her children was taking shape she would not have to buy their freedom now she had saved a little more than ten thousand dollars aunt clara left central city colorado and traveled back to her old home in kentucky she located her four children and her childrens children and thirty other relatives she took them to leavenworth by steamboat and then purchased a covered wagon again she crossed the plains and mountains but this time it was a triumphant caravan her children and relatives settled in central city georgetown and denver and not one ever brought sorrow or shame to aunt clara old age was keeping step with her she moved to denver from central city and bought a little home dishonest men cheated her out of the remainder of her savings but aunt clara did not want friends and relatives saw to that her dear old face was lined her black eyes were faded but she had been a gallant figure upright in body and soul inspiring others to hope that they too might achieve a great example was more powerful than much conversation her life visibly lived for humanity was worth more than many sermons she bolstered a tottering faith and renewed the hope of those who were sinking beneath adversity she gave new courage to the tempted not for one instant did aunt clara think she was heroic yet her whole life was one of heroic sacrifice she was the blue columbine that grew wild in the rocky mountains she was the dream of gold come true in the sands of a prospectors battered old pan she was an inspiration to black and white she died at the age of eightytwo central city has honored the memory of this remarkable woman by dedicating one of its chairs in its famous opera house to her where famous people from colorado have been similarly honored do negroes lack courage to move to the suburbs for four months i tried to sell our home in bostons outer suburbs to a negro family i have failed my white neighbors did not stop me i could not find a negro buyer this experience has shattered many of my illusions about negro housing when i began seeking a negro buyer in the spring of i shared with many other whites a vague feeling of common guilt i had never personally discriminated against a negro but somehow i felt partially to blame for their situation deep down in my heart i believed i was at least partially to blame for the very bad housing which they had to live in now i have lost that feeling of guilt i no longer feel responsible for the negroes having to live in what amounts to a slum district in boston it is not the fault of my fellow whites that many negroes are in that district it is the fault of the negroes themselves most of them are afraid to leave the ghetto they know so well and move out into the strange territory that is now the white suburbs even today i find this hard to understand i can appreciate their psychological reasons for not moving out into the suburbs the ghetto is familiar to them in some ways it probably resembles a mothers wombit is warm and comfortableand gives one a feeling of security but in other ways it is very very hard to understand why mothers and fathers do not try harder to move out into the suburbs and give their children a better start in life it is not the lack of guidance or leadership that keeps todays negroes locked into bostons slums such guidance and leadership are present in fact i was amazed when i found out just how talented some of the negro leaders are in boston today take attorney walter c carrington for example this year old boston lawyer graduated from harvard college and harvard law school since he has been a member of the massachusetts commission against discrimination recently he submitted his resignation from this salaried post to accept an appointment as a mission chief in charge of secondary school teachers in the infant african nation of sierra leone attorney carrington has sacrificed what could have been a potentially profitable private law practice to devote his life towards the betterment of his fellow colored people he is not alone in this task ill never forget how many devoted and enthusiastic whites and negroes whom i met during the four months i was trying to sell our home to a negro these devoted and energetic people are courageously trying to find more homes for negroes in bostons suburbs today you would be amazed to learn how many homes they have lined up and i think you would be as bitterly disappointed as i was when you come to realize how few negro families are willing to take advantage of these new opportunities opening up to them today our own home is just one example in the first part of we were able to build a new home just a few miles away from our home of that time that meant we would have to sell our threebedroom ranch house in the suburban community of holliston i think it was the cuban invasion that made me decide to sell our home to a negro family the events during that invasionand the soul searching analysis of events and background motivations that followedcaused me to think deeply about our country i was conscious of the fact that the cuban invasion had failed partially because the world was not yet clear on just what america stands for we have always claimed to be the land of opportunity but deep in my heart i painfully suffered a guilty feeling a feeling that we were denying equal opportunity to negroes in this country together with our three young children my wife and i drove into bostons negro community what we found seemed almost like a new world but it was not the clean bright world of fresh air and sunshine that the puritans found when they first landed in boston in we found instead a dirty noisy crowded worlda world almost exactly the opposite of the clean spacious suburb in which we were raising our children the streets were crowded with trucks automobiles and people we drove down the main street of the negro community block after block of dirty rundown threestory brick tenement buildings loomed up all around us torn weatherbeaten political posters stared down at us from lamp posts dirty brick walls empty store frontsa mocking reminder of bostons oftenmade but never kept political promises we drove past the secondhand furniture stores past the many poorlylit variety stores past the small loan company on the comer with its three discolored brass balls over the door and its big front window crammed with cheap jewelry old clothes and musical instruments and we turned into a side street a woman was leaning out a thirdfloor window shouting at her children playing on the street a push cart was at the curb and a tired little old man was making a sour face at a fat colored lady who insisted on squeezing the tomatoes before buying any a little boya darkskinned curlyhaired youngster about fourstarted to chase his ball onto the street a middleaged woman struggled to raise her bulky frame off the front stairs ran after him as fast as her tired legs would carry her and grabbed him by the ear she pulled him back to the steps clucking excitedly like a mother hen all the while this did not seem like a good place to raise children at the next intersection we turned and headed for home again as we drove back out of the negro section we couldnt help but notice that many of the people were fairly well dressed and quite a few of them seemed to own late model automobiles it seemed to us that there was money in the negro district what seemed to be lacking was opportunity to spend this money on suburban housing somehow this apparent lack of opportunity made our own good fortune seem almost unfair nine years ago we had very little ourselves i had married my childhood sweetheart in june just three weeks after my high school graduation i was making a week we moved into a threeroom second floor apartment this seemed like enough at first but in december of our son was born and it no longer seemed like enough we wanted something better for our children for several months i worked at three jobs we accumulated a small nest egg in september of i used it for my first semesters tuition at boston universitys college of business administrationevening division for seven years i had worked and studied studied and worked we had two daughters we needed more space in we found a fiveroom firstfloor apartment and in we were able to buy our first house a threebedroom ranch home in holliston i found a new job and in a year in which i graduated among the top seven in my classi was promoted to an assistant vice presidency now we were able to build our dream homea nineroom home on a large lot yards wide by yards deep and covered with blueberry bushes and pine trees compared to the negro families we saw crowded into bostons ne gro ghetto we were doing nicely too nicely it seemed i couldnt help wondering could i have enjoyed such success if i had been colored and the answer seemed clearvery unlikely indeed this bitter realization soured the pride that had been growing within me it turned instead to shame and humility all my life i had believed deeply in the american dream i had developed a passionate devotion to the ideals expressed by thomas jefferson and until the cuban invasionand our drive through the negro ghettoi sincerely believed that my own success was a living proof that america was living up to jeffersons ideals what i had just seen seemed to me to be a shocking charge that americas equality of opportunity did not extend to people with colored skin i had read the words of jefferson many times they were burned deeply into my mind and heart and as i drove home that day his words came back to me clearly and sharply we hold these truths to be selfevidentthat all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness i could remember other things jefferson had said too such as no man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights of another in europe the dignity of man is lost in arbitrary distinctions where the human species is classed into several stages of degradation the american example has kindled feelings of right in the people and insurrection has begun of science talents and courage against rank and birth which have fallen into contempt i agree that there is a natural aristocracy among men the grounds of this are virtue and talents work and genius would thus be sought out from every condition of life the natural aristocracy of talents i consider as the most precious gift of nature nobody wishes more than i do to see proofs that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to those of the other colors of men and that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence but we must await with patience the workings of an overruling providence and hope that it is preparing the deliverance of these our suffering brethren when the measure of their tears shall be full coming when their groans shall have involved heaven itself in darkness doubtless a god of justice will awaken to their distress a just god i remembered only too well that abraham lincoln had said that those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under a just god cannot long retain it it seemed clear to me that boston was denying freedom to its negroesfreedom to live in good housingand i felt a shared sense of guilt in this deprivation i was about to taste the fruits of success myself and why had i had the opportunity to attain this success only because of those who in the past had created and preserved this opportunity i myself am only a third generation american but i am proud of my countrys tradition i have adopted its heritage as my heritage and i knew well what a major role boston had played in winning this heritage of freedom for america the mayflower compact was signed by the pilgrims at nearby plymouth this compacta sacred covenant of democracy sworn before godset the tone for the puritan founding at boston in through the years this heritage has burned brightly in boston it was in boston that the first major resistance to the king of england began in the midseventeen hundreds it was the closing of the port of boston by an angry king that rallied the colonists together it was in boston that the colonial army under general george washington had first driven the british back out to sea and it was from boston that swift yankee clippers carried the american ideal to places as far away as the spanish isles of hawaii now americas fiftieth state i myself had benefited from this tradition of equal opportunity as i looked back i could remember clearly the many men who had generously helped me advance in my career with no thought of reward for themselves other than a good feeling that comes from such a brotherly act suddenly it seemed that all the favors that had been done to me had merely been loaned to me now it seemed to be my turn to return these favors to lend a helping hand to some other person driving home from the negro ghetto that day i talked it over with my wife and she agreed that we would make our home in the suburbs available to a family from bostons ghetto the problem of negro segregation was a very large problem it was a social problem a matter of social justice as an individual and a part of societyi felt individually and partially to blame for this problem i could not cure the problem by myself for i am only one man but i can do my part and i sincerely believed that if i did my part as an individual other individuals might be inspired or encouraged to do their part we reached holliston and drove through the center of town but then as we turned onto our own street i began to have doubts about my decision ours was a relatively quiet deadend road of about a dozen almost new low cost ranch homes built on property next to a rolling green dairy farm the houses were inexpensive but well maintained our neighbors were young hardworking families many of them with young children we pulled into our own driveway our three youngsters spotted their playmates and piled out of the car running across our wide front lawn to the house next door as we watched them go it was only natural to wonder what it would be like when young negro children ran across that same front lawn to play with the children next door would they be acceptedor rebuffed they would have fresh air and sunshine and behind them a large rolling space of the dairy farm but would they have friends would the blessings of suburban living be more than offset by the absence of their old friends of the city how does one go about selling ones home to a negro should we go up and down the street ringing doorbells and ask their permission did we owe it to our neighbors to give them a veto over our decision we had decided to sell our home to a negro because of our concern for people we had never metthe negroes crowded into bostons ghetto did we not owe at least equal consideration to our friends and neighbors living on our own street believe me these are disturbing thoughts for a few days we kept our decision to ourselves i felt the need of discussing this matter with someone else before we actually placed our house for sale to a negro hesitantly i turned to our minister for guidance he seemed like the natural person to ask but there was one drawback our minister reverend james e turner of the community christian church was a southerner he was formerly from austin texas i wasnt at all sure of his feelings about negro segregation and thus i was pleasantly surprised by his reaction when i told him about our intention did he approve he most certainly did not only was this young exsoutherner strongly in favor of our intentions he has since become a member of the local fair housing committee himself but he enthusiastically volunteered to help us find a negro family i heard from reverend turner just a few days later he was so excited he couldnt wait until i got home that night he telephoned me at my office he told me he had just been advised by the massachusetts council of churches that the american society of friends would be the best place to find a negro family quickly i looked up the american society of friends in the greater boston telephone book i found their headquarters listed in cambridge appropriately enough the same community in which general george washington had assumed command of americas revolutionary army my hopes were soaring as i dialed the number as i heard the ringing on the line i had visions of learning that hundreds of negro families were waiting in line to find suburban homes in boston i remembered how desperately we had wanted a home in the outer suburbs for our own children and it seemed only natural that most negro parents in bostons colored ghetto would have the same desires for their children a woman answered the telephone i gave her my name and told her why i was calling can you help us find a negro family i asked yes she answered pleasantly she was sure that she could she gave me the name of a fair housing committee leader in framingham a large suburban city near our town she advised me to contact him directly she said that he was sure to have several families lined upjust waiting for homes to become available in our area and so it was with great hope and enthusiasm that i wrote a letter to this man i described our house and explained our motives for wanting to sell our home to a negro to make it absolutely plain that we were not trying to sell to a negro to get an abovethemarket price i suggested that any potential buyer call in an independent professional appraiser to determine the value of our home i said i would sell our house for whatever price this impartial expert decided was fair i also asked specifically if they had a negro family listed with them who had small children who might most benefit from our dairy farm environment and had worked hard to improve themselves like myself several of our neighbors had been combining both work and study what i wanted to offer to an individual boston negro was equality of opportunity in the truest sense i deeply believed that if one individual negro who had worked hard to better himself was rewarded in the same manner that a white man may expect other negroes from the ghetto would see this and be encouraged to try and improve themselves too i wrote that i had no idea how our neighbors would react to a negro family moving into our area but i thought it safest to expect the worst and hope for the best i suggested thatout of respect and deference to our neighborswe would like to sell to a negro family whose moral character had been proven i did not approve of discrimination in regard to negroes either for or against i still do believe that to give a man a special privilege because his skin is colored is just as much an insult as to deny him the same privilege because his skin is colored in short i was applying the same standards to choosing a negro buyer as we would have applied to choosing a white buyer seeking a family that could benefit from our house and fit into the neighborhood with a minimum of disharmony i hoped that an educated hardworking negro family of good character would make such a good impression on our community and on the area that other opportunities would open up for additional individual negroes to buy homes in this area several days went by and i received no answer i began to get impatient work was proceeding rapidly on our new home we planned to move as soon as school closed for the summer and we wanted to line up a negro family immediately to be sure that their own children were able to enjoy a full summer of outer suburban living finally the answer arrived anxiously i ripped open the envelope i expected to find a list of negro buyers instead i found a letter praising our intention and stating that eminent sociologists agreed with our conclusions about the benefits of motivating negroes my blood began to boil i wasnt interested in eminent sociologists i was interested in helping some young negro children gain an opportunity to play in sunshine and fresh air this was the first hint i was to uncover that finding a negro buyer for our home was not to be an easy matter but i did not yet realize that the fault lay not in the white committees in the suburbs but in the city negroes themselves i incorrectly assumed that day that the local committee was inefficient and that dozens if not hundreds of negroes must be waiting anxiously for word of available suburban housing so i began again i drove in town to boston to personally seek a negro family i went to boston universitys housing department i asked them if they had any negro faculty members who were seeking suburban housing they said they did not i asked if they had any graduate students who were seeking suburban housing they said they did not do you have any graduates seeking suburban housing i asked they said they did not they were very friendly and encouraging but they did not have any negro buyers we tried the housing departments at massachusetts institute of technology and harvard universityacross the charles river in cambridgebut we had the same results there i was deeply disappointed i had heard so much about hardships encountered by negro students and instructors trying to find adequate suburban housing all of this wide publicity to the need for a fair housing and yet i could not find a single individual negro actually looking for a suburban home he month of may was drawing to a close soon schools would be closing negro children would be playing again in the crowded slum streets of bostons colored ghetto but what could i do i felt a strong social obligation but it did not extend to ringing every doorbell in the boston negro ghetto and asking the occupants if they would like to buy a house in the suburbs i i had worked hard to make my own way i expected negroesif they wanted equal opportunity to show equal initiative a few days later just as i was about to abandon my effort to find a negro buyer an article in the boston morning paper caught my eye the headline said housing aid vowed to negroes and the article said the eyes of the world are not alone on montgomery alabama or jackson mississippi an assembly of four hundred colored south end and roxbury residents were told last night they are on the cities of new england and boston in particular the article went on to tell of the proposed programs to rehabilitate the negro sections of boston and give that group its greatest opportunity and challenge and it added but this will require community cooperation and some sacrifice to succeed what was this i asked myself were the negroes trying to find suburban housing or werent they were they more interested in fixing up their homes in the ghetto my initial feelings of guilt and shame were now giving way to sorrow and even anger a picture with the article showed three of the leaders of bostons negro community i decided to call one of them up on the telephone i picked walter c carrington identified as a member of the massachusetts commission against discrimination i called him on the telephone i told him of my efforts to locate a negro buyer for my house i also mentioned that i had been specifically trying to find a particular negro family one which had made sincere efforts to improve itself there was a silence on the phone an awkward pause i could almost sense resentment building up in mr carrington he was very polite but he asked if perhaps i was not a bit unfair in trying to restrict the potential buyer to a certain type of negro was i he asked implying that all negroes were not entitled to fair housing i asked him if he had not sacrificed time and effort in his own personal selfdevelopment program if he had not worked hard and studied hard to get through harvard college and harvard law school yes he agreed he had i asked him arent you better able to lead your peoples battle for justice because of the long selfdevelopment program you have gone through his voice noticeably softened yes he answered now growing much more friendly and even enthusiastic i can see what you mean you are not trying to discriminate against some negroes but rather to reward effort on the part of negroes who show greater initiative i agreed and with that the ice was melted between us we had a long conversation he was very encouraging he suggested that since some time had elapsed since i had contacted the society of friends that i try them again he pointed out that with school closing several negro families might have just contacted the society and inquired about suburban housing i thanked him and did contact the society of friends again mr carrington proved to be right there were several families now listed the society gave me the names of several families and also referred me to a local area chairman i contacted that chairman i explained the situation to him he volunteered to contact the negroes on the list to get more personal information on them for me and find out which family might best fill the specifications i had in mind several days later he got in touch with me again he was discouraged families had not wished to commute to my community in the outer suburbs he said it was too far i grew very angry how could it be too far when i was commuting to boston daily myself and when a neighbor on my street commuted daily to revere on bostons north shore even further away i told him that it seemed to me that if any parent wanted his children to have good housing they should be willing to spend a little more time driving each day as i did and as most of my neighbors did he agreed but said it just did not seem to be so in the case of bostons negro families i wanted to make at least one more last try and was given the name of the fulltime coordinator of all twentyfour fair housing committees massachusetts is probably one of the leading states when it comes to legislation forbidding restrictive covenants on real estate i called this coordinator he too enthusiastically and sincerely tried to find a negro buyer for us but he could not there were none i could hardly believe my ears by now it was the middle of june schools were letting out our own new home was ready and we were about to move so far i had not told my neighbors about our twomonthlong effort to find a negro buyer now we decided to come out into the open with the matter i believed too deeply in what i was trying to do not to make at least one open and bald effort to find a negro buyer on the st of june ran a large ad in the newspaper looking for a negro family we described our three bedroom ranch home with its large yard and its neighboring dairy farm and in large type we announced that this offer is open to everyone regardless of race color or creed we got only one telephone call from a person who identified himself as being black we gave this person directions on how to find our house he sounded tremendously interested and said they would be there that night with the down payment deposit we waited he did not come but a delegation of our neighbors did i had expected such action they told me that one of our neighbors who was also moving had turned down a negro buyer at their urging i now understood why the black buyer had not shown up probably he had recognized the street decided he would not be welcome and had kept right ongoing what surprised me most of all though was the very reasonable attitude of my neighbors there was absolutely no emotional reaction on their part they were coldly logical about the situation they explained that they were concerned that if a negro family moved in the value of their own property might drop i told them that studies had shown that negro residents over the longer term had practically no effect on real estate values whatsoever one of my next door neighbors said that he had heard the same thing but that one could never be sure of what might happen in an actual situation we shook hands all around and they left in a generally satisfied manner they told me they understood it was our house to do with as we wished but they had merely wished to make their own thoughts known to us i was really surprised i had expected threats of bricks tossed through the windows of our new home or the windows of our negro buyers this was typical of the surprises i encountered all during my efforts to find a negro buyer the whites were in many cases either enthusiastically for the project or at least reasonable and calm in their acceptance of it there was very little of the excited white agitation that i had been led to expect on the other hand there was apparently almost no initiative being shown by negro families trying to move out into the suburbs their condition seemed to be one of apathy if they wished to live in the ghetto i felt that was their business but i began to grow angry as i reflected on how i had been given such deep feelings of personally shared guilt over keeping them in the ghetto it appeared to me they were there of their own choicenot because whites had sealed them in we spent the summer in our new home i did not list our former home with a real estate broker we kept waiting waitingand hopingthat one of the fair housing groups would find a negro buyer for us the summer ticked away our large yard stood empty on the th of august with department stores beginning to run backtoschool notices our hopes were finally smashed the fair housing committee contacted us and said that they still had no negro buyer lined up summer was gone and so were all our initial hopes and desires reluctantly we listed our house with local real estate brokers and decided to place it on the market we sold it to a white family our experiment in a personal effort to help establish social justice and brotherhood had failed not because of resistance by the whites but because of apathy by negroes it is hard to express the disappointment i feel over this situation i still sincerely believe that negroes should be entitled to equal opportunity and i still sincerely believe they must show equal courage i can understand their reluctance to move out herefor they will not be welcomed with open arms by all of the whites in this area but then the whites who first moved out into this area were not welcomed with open arms by the colored residents who then dominated the area our local history is rich with stories of white families who battled both indians and hunger in putting their roots down here these early new england colonists sought only new opportunity and they were willing to fight for it if the negroes want this opportunity they should be willing to fight for it too the tragedy of teenage marriage a few weeks ago i was a v stopped by a negro man who had just witnessed divorce proceedings involving his yearold son the mans eyes watered as he said to me what a tragedy for that boy god if only i could have convinced him a year and a half ago that marriage is more than one long grand passion this mans son a brilliant student had given up a promising career to marry a dimplecheeked brownette who was the doll of the high school junior class the couple learned after the wedding that her tastes for clothing and entertainment were richer than his income that his idea of the role of sex in marriage was a lot more liberal than hers that religion was a source of constant irritation between them and that his circle of friends and hers were not in the least compatible now the father complained with alimony and child support payments to make my kid hasnt a ghost of a chance of continuing his education it hurts me so because ive spent all my adult years trying to open doors of opportunity for that boy i wanted him to amount to more than i did but this is what its come to its a real tragedy i told my friend that that courtroom drama probably was a tragedy for the girl tooin that she was a mother and a divorcee at i knew that it would be no solace for this father but i added that his unhappiness was being shared by millions of parents educators clergymen judges and others who see the parade of bitterness and misery that is being generated by a recent upsurge in teenage marriages i mentioned also that no one should worry more than negro parents and civic leaders about this rash of youngsters barely across the physical threshold of adulthood who are joining the rush to the altar they should worry because it can be shown in a dozen ways that these marriages constitute one of the major barriers to the negros march to firstclass citizenship i consider it a truism that a people who would be free must destroy the fundamental enemy of freedom ignorance there are far too many negro youngsters of vast leadership potential who today are deserting the war against ignorance for what they assume foolishly are a only the endless ecstasies of marriage we cannot afford to let the gallant efforts of a few students involved in sitin demonstrations and other protests against racism blind us to what is happening to thousands of other negro youngsters former federal education commissioner lawrence derthick said recently that youngsters of high school age will not get their diplomas next june and for many of these the reason is that they have decided to accept a marriage certificate instead derthick adds that of the nations avi million andyearolds a million are not in schooland for at least of these early marriage is the reason school authorities point out as informed negroes already know that a shockingly high percentage of those missing from the nations classrooms are negroes not that this problem of teenage marriages is primarily a negro problem the question why do they marry so young is an agonizing one in every economic racial and cultural segment of the american community it is a fact however that a slightly larger portion of negro marriages are in the teenage category than is the case for white marriages it also can be demonstrated that a disproportionate number of these negro teenagers are exchanging wedding vows without the slightest preparation for with barely a remote under standing of the responsibilities of family life perhaps the primary reason for negro concern is that colored youngsters and the colored community in general are less able to afford the repercussions of these premature marriages than any other group in our society this is illustrated i think by the story about three young aristocrats who were trying to outboast each other with regard to their fathers wealth my father is so rich that im going to groton and yale said the first my father is so rich im going to do my prep work at harvard and then go to the sorbonne cracked the second my father is so rich that i can afford to stay ignorant boasted the third many white youngsters may be able to afford the loss of education the stunted earning power that almost inevitably goes with a teenage marriage but the negro struggling in a hundred ways for equal status in a predominantly white society simply cannot afford the luxury of ignorance and of unexploited potential president howard bowen of grinnell college has said education determines the degree of our capacity for foresight and our ability to plan for the future a mark of primitive people is that they lack this capacity to look ahead they live from hand to mouth the future is for them dim and vague education on the other hand helps people to become aware of the future and prepares them to plan ahead it enables them to carry out longterm projects and to make sacrifices for distant ends the magnitude of the educational deficit among negroes is well known by most negroes and need be stated only briefly here we are turning out fewer than half the high school graduates much less than half the college graduates that we would produce each year if negroes were being educated to the same extent americas white population is there also is no need to detail here the ways in which educational economic and other discriminations have made it extremely difficult for negroes to alter this situation but as dr eli ginzberg professor of economics and director of the conservation of human resources project at columbia university points out in his book the negro potential the negro cannot expect the schools alone desegregated or otherwise to erase the handicaps under which our youngsters labor parents the churches communications media within the negro community all have a role to play in imbuing these youngsters with a deeper understanding of the opportunities and responsibilities that lie before them ginzberg explains better preparation for work involves much more than a formal equalization of education opportunities for negroes as for whites basic preparation for school and for work occurs within the family the neighborhood and the community the habits the values and the goals that the child acquires i provide the basis for his later accomplishments in school and at work because of his history the american negro is not prepared in the same way as the white population to take full advantage of the economic opportunities that exist the negro must alter many of his values before he will be able to cope effectively with his new situation i can think of no better place to begin this alteration of values than with todays teenagers and preteeners what negro homes of tomorrow are will be determined by the success that can be achieved today in convincing able youngsters to delay the rush to what they think are the infinite romantic pleasures of married life in order that they can get the educations essential to the economic moral and general family stability that is so lacking among so many negroes several weeks ago i talked to ellen an yearold negro in chicago who already was the mother of two children separated from her yearold husband and being supported by the aid to dependent children adc program this young woman who had wed during her sophomore year in high school explained how she got into this predicament i was miserable my parents were so old and countrified and our furniture was so horrible that i was ashamed to take my friends home even if i had i was sure my mother would bore them to death talking about the bible all she did was talk about heaven and hell and about how i had to stay home because i might get consumption from the night air or get into some other kind of trouble well davehe was a grade ahead of mewas miserable too his father was drunk all the time i couldnt believe a boy as smooth as dave could have such hicks for parents dave and i felt nobody really cared for us but us and we decided to sort of strike out on our own after months of marriage dave decided to strike out on his own so here i sit with the kids ellensthese are not their real namesstory pinpoints one of the major reasons for the upsurge in teenage marriages many youngsters are running away from unhappy homes fleeing in search of love and affection family experts say that a disproportionate number of negro youngsters are involved in this rather desperate groping for love and happiness one reason the experts say is that unhappiness finds it a bit easier to get inside the door of homes beset by poverty and a lack of education another reason they say is that many negro parents find it virtually impossible to strike that happy medium of firm but loving discipline that leaves enough latitude for teen agers to make the transition from adolescence to adulthood sociologists say that a disturbingly large number of negro parents dont know where their teenagers are from one night to the next and apparently do not care at the other extreme is a group of parents who are so fearful of embarrassment to the family name that they make virtual prisoners of their girls a detroit mother told me recently i was so determined that my children would not contribute to those horrible statistics that the white magazines keep throwing at us negroes that i practically forbade my daughter to take a deep breath in the presence of a boy this created horrible conflict between us but i was certain i was doing the right thing a few months ago my daughter eloped with a boy id never met she lied about her age in order to get married i went to the family service people and they told me i could get the marriage annulled and have her committed to a detention home as an incorrigible but they said they doubted that anybody in the detention home could undo the damage that i had done over the last few years i guess we negroes can try too hard to be perfect parents this detroit mother still had the hope that her yearold soninlaw will turn out to be a good husband more ready to settle down than most teenage boys are but the odds run heavily against this for the bureau of census reports a very high rate of failure for all teenage marriages and an appalling failure rate for nonwhites paul c glick reports in his volume american families based on the census that for every negro teenage girls who marry about will be separated from their husbandsa rate four times as high as for white teenage girls another of the negro girls will get divorces and will have their marriages terminated by the death of their husbands this means that a pitiful of these negro teenage girls will make marriages that are stable and permanent the other face one form of heartbreak or another glick points to one ironic racial difference the divorce rate among white teenagers is actually higher than among negroes the reason for this is that white girls who rush into a mismatch take advantage of legal aid services offered by the community or the courts and get the protection afforded by a legal divorce on the other hand most negro girls wind up like ellen separated or deserted left without even the alimony the child support payments the opportunity to move with honor towards a second marriage that a courtsanctioned divorce would provide negro youngsters who today may be flirting with thoughts of marriage ought to take serious note of one thing that these marriage statistics show quite clearly the girl with the least education usually my lap as i talked to this colored youngster i had to say to myself my little boy has got this kid beat already hes got him beat by a mile i knew from the fathers record in high school that the little lad couldnt be inherently dumb i couldnt assume that my boy had an iota more of native intelligence than he did but i could see that because of the negro lads environment because of his less intellectual surroundings my boy already had him beat when it comes to being able to make your way in our society i believe that one thing most american negroes want passionately is to make sure tomorrows colored children dont get beat by a mile because of poor schooling poor environment poor home life one of the ways that this can be avoided is to convince the teenagers who will produce tomorrows generation of children that they owe it to this coming generation to postpone marriage long enough to get the education the understanding of and respect for family life that will enable them to be adequate parents every negro who really has turned his face against the indignity of racial caste has to realize that eradication of this system involves fighting a thousand kinds of battles on a thousand kinds of fronts the lawyer in the courtroom the man in the voting booth the platform lecturer the novelist at his typewriterall these and many more are soldiers in these battles but none can win any final victory except through the vastly expanded intellectual and moral strength of the negro people as a whole it is imperative therefore that we get more soldiers in the battle to convince our youngsters of their special obligations as husbands and wives mothers and fathers it is essential that our youngsters be convinced that marriage for the new negro cannot be merely a yielding to raw emotions it also must be an intellectual decision made with the realization that the negro family too is a major link in our new chain of freedom by father rollins e lambert tere is an old nurst f ery rhyme about six men of indostan all of them blind who wanted tq jnvestigate he de phant each of them encountered a different part of the animals anatomy and as a result each came to a different conclusion about the creature as a whole in the race question one of the biggest difficultes with most people both white and negro is the number of blind spots in their outlook because of segregation few white people know the american negro but this has not prevented a lot of generalizations about the whole racegeneralizations based on very limited experience or even on what one has read in newspapers and magazines among educated people such things are passing away but one can still hear in some circles sweeping statements such as negroes are dirtythey are criminally inclined they are ignorantthey are oversexed they are musically giftedand so on i have even heard a white person say that all negroes look alike as a matter of fact most of the conclusions are justified if they are restricted to a segment of the negro racejust as the same conclusion can be justified if they are applied to segments of any other race or nationality the first point i want to make then is that the word negro embraces a group of people with differences from each other just as great as in any other similar large group of people the second point is that the negro in america is american and wants to be regarded as such he is not african and until recently regarded himself as having practically no connection with africa there is no reverence for the mothercountry such as one might find in an american of irish or polish or italian ancestry just recently the american negro has begun to express interest in and sympathy for the africans as they struggle for freedom and negroes here are beginning to feel some racial solidarity with negroes there being an american the negro wants to be judged not as a group but like other americans for what he is personally how he lives works raises his family keeps his home participates in civic affairs pays his bills conducts himself in public and in private as a neighbor friend human beingthese are the important things and on these the negro wishes to be judged individually he does not want to have to bear the burden of the crimes and excesses of other negroes nor does he want to ride on the achievements of jesse owens or ralph bunche he is unable to see how the color of his skin demands that he be treated as if he came from another planet most americans are aware i am sure of the rising tide of the negro demand for recognition both in the us and in africa no amount of wishful thinking on the part of white people is going to stop this tide from achieving its goal and the sheer magnitude of the negro population makes it an issue which cannot be ignored experts on population trends for example predict that chicago will probably contain a nonwhite majority within the lifetime of most of us the implications of the negro problem are so wide that no catholic be he priest or layman can excuse himself from being interested on grounds that he or his neighborhood is not affected first of all a person in any urban area can scarcely avoid coming into contact with some negroes at least casually as a priest who is a negro i know that if more priests and white laity were aware of the presence of potential converts on these occasions more converts would be made chances are only one in twenty that the negro in question is already a catholic and secondly areas that have not been touched by the negro migration may be hit suddenly at any time a couple of years ago i gave a talk to a group of catholic women in a chicago suburban area most of them said that they had little contact with negroes and were wondering what they could do to promote interracial justice and charity last year one of the women telephoned me father she said when i heard your talk i thought that the whole thing was pretty remote from me but i live in deerfield what exactly does the american negro want the answer is simple he wants what most other americans want he wants a good job a job which is equal to his ability a job where he can advance if he has the ability a job which will give him and his family some security he wants a chance at decent housing and i do not refer only to public housing projects although these are indispensable for the lowincome groups he wants a house or apartment of a quality and in a location such as white americans of similar income can have he wants to give his children an education comparable to what white children receive so that they can compete on terms of comparative equality a casual observer might say the negro has all these thingsat least in the north what is he complaining about lets admit right away that tremendous progress along these lines has been made in recent years and it is going on constantly but there are still gaps to be filled and the average negro thinks much more about these gaps than about the progress already made it has been nearly a hundred years since lincoln freed the slaves but complete freedom is not yet a reality for the descendants of the slaves up to now the negro has been kept almost completely out of the professional fields and private industry except within the negro community itself he has to depend upon government jobs to give him any real opportunity to display his learning or natural ability even after a considerable amount of education he often has to drive a municipal bus or work in the post office in order to have steady employment in business few executive positions are open to him in a bank he is lucky to be hired as a broompusher even big companies which do tremendous business with negroes will hire negroes only in their lowest ranks of employees this is true even in northern cities among which chicago incidentally is regarded by some as the most segregated city in the nation speaking of job opportunities we would expect that at least in the catholic church a negro man or woman would be given ample opportunity to try a religious vocation or aspire to the priesthood but even here there is sometimes a color bar especially where girls are concerned one superior told a girl i know that the community would pray the holy ghost to guide her somewhere elsealthough the community was desper ately praying for vocations itself and in a certain parish grammar school the sisters still dare not talk about religious vocations for girls for fear that a colored girl might want to join the order that is teaching there the conditions in which many negroes live come in for a lot of criticism from white people it would be a shock to some of the critics to find out that the people most dissatisfied with slum conditions are the people who live in them who are forced by racial segregation to live in them the average negro wants a nice home in a decent neighborhood and is willing to work hard and to pay a lot for it when he has it furthermore he will generally be just as interested as anyone else in maintaining the standards of the neighborhood where he lives as job opportunities have improved the negro has more money to spend on better housing this is why such a tremendous pressure has built up in cities where negroes are confined to a ghetto this is why negroes are trying so hard to escape the segregated housing which can only result in the spread of slum conditions segregation causes slums in several ways in the first place it limits the amount of housing open to the negro and therefore causes overcrowding of houses and apartments overcrowding obviously is directly connected with slum conditions moreover as long as housing is segregated and limited in quantity the seller can demand a higher price for it the buyer or speculator in order to pay off his mortgage or to make a quick profit is inclined to subdivide his property to produce more rents and to neglect upkeep again slums will develop cardinal meyer archbishop of chicago stated last year that it is high time the pattern of segregated housing in chicago be broken down the negro in chicago and elsewhere wants this not so that he can run down a neighborhood but so that he can find decent conditions in which to live and raise his children it is a great scandal when he finds priests or catholic organizations blocking his way all indications are that the negro in america is going to reach his objectiveshousing education work opportunities and that he will achieve a large part of them within the next decade or two he will reach them with or without the help of the catholic church if he reaches them without the church it is easy to imagine what his attitude toward the church will be at present however the church finds itself in what can generally be called a favorable position as far as negroes are concerned most american negroes who belong to a church are protestants either baptists who have the largest share or methodists about six per cent of negroes are catholics the ninetyfour percent remainder is largely in ignorance about the church for most of them it is just a namethe name of one of the white mans churches but the catholic church has two attractions to draw the negros attention its schools and its claim to be the one universal church many negroes are aware of the forthright statements and actions of some of our bishops in racial matters and the elevation of an african to the college of cardinals drew wide favorable notice the reason for the attractiveness of our schools even for the noncatholic negro is mainly that if he is ambitious for his childrenas most parents arehe wants to preserve them from the moral corruption which so often accompanies life in the ghetto if he cannot escape the ghetto he does the next best thing he tries to immunize his children by giving them a religious education even if the negro escapes to a good neighborhood he is still attracted by the superior moral training and discipline which catholic schools offer the reason why the catholicity of the church attracts negroes is obvious it is in harmony with the urgent need of the negro for acceptance by the society in which he lives the church and its members however must practice what they preach otherwise this becomes just another disappointing mirage in the negros struggle arbitrarily dividing negroes into three classes we can detect certain differences in their attitudes toward the catholic church the poorest class often thinks of the church as the church of charity they know that christ was kind they see kindness in catholic priests and sisters who are known to be effectively helpful when someone is in trouble this makes it easy for such negroes to identify the one true church the middleclass negro is satisfied when the local parish fulfills his spiritual needs and educates his children but he is often hurt when he emerges from his own parish into the larger catholic world as an example two colored couples attended a precana conference in a parish in a part of chicago rather far from the negro community the other couples attending treated them with obvious coldness and hostility as a result one of the negro couples dropped out after two sessions the other couple more sophisticated and experienced felt the same hostility but had the courage to complete the conference along the same line many an enthusiastic convert has been stunned and baffled when he discovered that some fraternal organizations have no negro members that he will find difficulty in being accepted as a patient in some catholic hospitals that it is practically impossible for a negro doctor to get on the staff of a catholic hospital that there are catholic high schools which do not have and do not want colored students such a convert was told when he took instructions that he was becoming a member of a universal church a church which regards all men as equally precious before god he sees that the teaching of the church and the performance of its members do not matchand naturally he feels that the white man has betrayed him again the upperclass negroto get back to our threefold divisionis critical of the church and skeptical of its claims he knows that his race is making great progress in many fields he sees that the color line is breaking down rapidly everywhere and he sees that the church which ought to be leading this progress is lagging behind or even fighting it he experiences the racial prejudice of white catholics including sometimes priests he observes that we preach against many kinds of sin but seldom about the sin of hating our neighbors if they happen to be negroes he notices the silence of the catholic church in his struggle in many places and remembers it his conclusion is that the catholic church is lying when it claims to be universal and that it is hypocritical when it tolerates racial prejudice and segregation he will not accept such an unchristian i version of christianity consequently we find among the number of converts fewvery few who are doctors or lawyers or university professors being a priest and a convert to the church myself i am naturally interested in bringing other negroes into the church this does not mean that we catholics should be alert and active in the field of social justice and charity only as means to conversions charity and justice are virtues which make us godlike virtues demanded of us by god if we are to save our own souls but when the negro sees that bishops priests sisters catholic laity understand his problems when they prove by their actions that they are sincerely on his side and are not just reluctantly assuming that position when it is too late to do anything else when he sees that the white catholic laity are given a firm and decisive leadership in the direction of interracial justice and charitythen the negro will begin to see the church in all its beauty as the worldwide society which reaches down into his own city his own neighborhood to raise him up to god by doris e saunders the warm june air was electric with excitement the unbelievable was about to occur for the first time in history an allnegro theatrical troupe had been commanded to appear before the reigning monarch of the british empire bert williams the inimitable and his partner george walker were about to add another first to their lengthening list of achievements they had the previous season opened on broadway for the first time in a hit show in dahomey and now the show which had been appearing in london since midmay at the shaftsbury theatre near piccadilly circus had been selected by king edward vii to highlight the celebration of his favorite grandsons ninth birthday the child who was called david was the eldest son of the prince and princess of wales later king george v and queen mary behind buckingham palace surrounded by high walls and railings the magnificent palace grounds stretched over forty acres and included a private lake for this event a special theatre had been erected on the velvet lawn parquet flooring had been laid for the stage which was perfect in every detail the scenery had been brought out from the shaftsbury and even special lighting had been installed at the foot of the terrace the royal band under the direction of herr gottlieb was in place waiting for the signal to begin the national anthem behind the drawn curtain that covered the stage the members of the cast fidgeted nervously the women patted their hair in place again and again smoothed already smooth skirts and shifted from one foot to another the stage director and the author of the play jesse shipp bustled like a mother hen he had been there since early morning giving last minute instructions to the carpenters and electricians fixing props and adjusting the footlights naturally a meticulous and nervous person jesse was not about to have anything go awry from lack of attention to detail the principalsbert williams george walker and georges wife ada overton walkerhad remained in their dressing rooms until almost the last minute and then like the rest of the company found themselves unable to resist a peek through the curtains to see the royal family bert williams tall handsome even in the burnt cork which darkened his naturally olive colored skin felt that this must in some way be a dream it seemed just a while ago that he and george had been hungry urchins scratching for a roll and a tossed coin from the drunks who made the san francisco barbary coast their hangout those were the days when one unhappy experience followed on the heels of another the list of the failures seemed endless they had worked their way east from san francisco in piecemeal fashion staying in a town only long enough to make enough money or a connection that would enable them to move on to another at this time many of the white stars of the minstrel stage worked in cork or blackface it was when bert finally realized that in cork makeup with a comic costume he could be funnier than any of the blackfaced whites then at the zenith of their popularity that they began to hit their stride as a team george walker was unsurpassed as the dandy dressed to the height of fashion with manners and speech that would do credit to one to the manorbom playing straight man to the somewhat naive and always gullible character that became bert williams trademark unhappy unlucky mournful and melancholy with shambling gait and quizzical expression bert was the epitome of the sucker his song im a jonah man introduced a new word in the american language as a jonah became synonymous with a hardluck character the senegambian carnival and the policy players followed by sons of ham paved the way for their reception on broadway in in dahomey in dahomey written by jesse shipp with music by will marion cook and libretto by paul laurence dunbar was the first broadway show to be written staged and acted by an allnegro group after opening night at the new york theatre when the tumultuous applause of the crowd greeted them bert and george knew that the two minstrel boys who had sung and danced for the amusement of the barbary coast riffraff had made the grade they were in and now suddenly the strains of god save the king filled the air and the royal procession with the king and queen and the young prince of wales in front started moving down the stairs and terrace of the palace to the lawn where chairs had been placed for the king and queen the other members of the royal party found places on the grass still peering through the peep holes in the curtain the female members of the cast let out excited whispers regarding the handsome king edward vii was an impressive figure tall and portly he carried his weight with grace and authority it was no accident that the edwardian era became noted for the glamor of male dress on this occasion the king was attired in grey frock coat and topper as were the other males in attendance the ladies following the lead of queen alexandra were gowned in pastel silks and gauzes with large picture hats and umbrellas alexandra was an extraordinary beauty and though long past middle age she looked many years younger buckingham palace which had not been used for the last forty years of queen victorias reign had come to life with the ascension of the pleasureloving edward to the throne an army of carpenters and painters had moved into buckingham palace and the gloomy rooms which had been jokingly referred to by members of the royal staff as the sepulchre became the scene of splendid court balls and the lovely gardens were often in use for parties during the king and queens residence the world of edward vii was the world of the theatre music horse racing and cards the pleasures of the sensesenormous cigars fine liquors beautiful womenwere the pleasures he demanded widely traveled and extremely sophisticated though not an intellectual edward lacked the prejudices that had characterized the reign of his mother his queen alexandra who idolized him found her pleasure in his pleasure therefore it was not surprising that he had selected the most recent importation from america to entertain the royal family and their guests at davids birthday party that the entertainers happened to be negroes was not as important as the fact that they were new and exciting that he was establishing a precedent concerned him not one whit he had heard about the cakewalk that was done in this show and he wanted to see it he ended up learning how to do it himself with none other than george and bert as his teachers the cakewalk which had swept the united states at the turn of the century was a rollicking and rhythmic strut that had all of the more adventurous londoners talking and trying now the anthem ended the williams and walker orchestra under the direction of will marion cook took over the musical chores and sounded the overture for the act of in dahomey the curtain rose on a scene in dahomey where brightly garbed native dancers twirled to stirring tribal music the main action of the play was laid in a small florida town but the opening scene established the mood for the rest of the action the story dealt with a colonization scheme in which some fast talking operators from boston trade upon the credulity of an unsuspecting old man with lots of money but very little experience in dealing with this kind of chicanery bert a happygolucky fellow was the heir to the old mans fortune and it was he on whom the wily george concentrated his attention the machinations of the unscrupulous george and the resulting dilemma in which bert friendly trusting and unsuspecting finds himself was summed up in one of the final moments of the comedy george as rareback punkerton asked bert as shylock homestead for an additional sum of money to finance the outrageous scheme to colonize dahomey shylock had finally realized that when its all goin out and nothin cornin in he must put an end to the drain and so he refuses rareback the following dialogue then took place shylock i really must have the ten thousand dollars and i say no do you mean to say that you refuse no i dont refuse no and refuse is two diffunt words they dont sound alike you dont even spell em alike i say no noe no with that williams gave walker his inimitably droll look and walked off the stage the songs the dances and the byplay between the two comedians carried the afternoon off with great success champagne and strawberries little sandwiches and tea were served to the cast following the curtain and afterwards the young prince of wales persuaded the kindly bert williams to sing with him im a jonah man it was only after the group had gathered back at their strand hotel rooms that jesse shipp revealed the secret that could have canceled the performance before it was given as he recounted the events of the morning shipp said that during all the hustle and bustle when everyone was tripping over everyone else in an effort to get the show properly launched a stout gentleman in a red vest had strolled down from the palace and inquired from shipp if he had found anything wrong with the english way of doing things shipp exasperated with problems in having things done his way had unleashed all his pent up frustration on the questioner whom shipp took to be a glorified flunky it wasnt until the royal family had put in their appearance that shipp recognized the flunky as his majesty king edward vii the ab ack cab net in acton when the black cabinet swung into action behind the scenes their own bosses and even president franklin d roosevelt seldom knew what hit them like the time that steve early kicked a negro cop in the groin in pennsylvania station just a week before the elections and a few minutes after roosevelt had made one of his most rousing campaign speeches in madison square garden a dismayed white house adviser called weaver frantically at his home in washington and pointed out that the new york herald tribune was already on the street identifying early as white house press secretary and grandson of the confederate general jubal anderson early this could cost us the negro vote the caller bemoaned so get the boys together and turn out a really pronegro speech which the president can give in baltimore next friday weaver demurred and said it might be difficult to get the boys together in the middle of the night although most of them including faire which brought the unprecedented results weaver is now administrator of the federal home finance agency and the first negro in a cabinetrank job william h hastie dean of the howard university law school at that moment were already assembled around the card table in his basement and anyway he said i dont think a mere speech will do it what we need right now is something so dramatic that it will make the negro voters forget all about steve early and the negro cop too and given the green light to find something dramatic weaver and the black cabinet went into action next day the white house adviser almost fainted when he found out what the boys wanted but fdr a consummate tactician approved the plan on the spot so hours later the u s army had the first negro general in its historythe former col benjamin o davis sr whom governor lehman enthusiastically released from the th regiment here in new york the war department had its first negro civilian aide to the secretarythe same bill hastie who once was a federal judge and governor of the virgin islands and is now a federal appeals judge in philadelphia the selective service had its first negro aidecol campbell johnson an army reserve officer who is still a ranking selective service official and if secretary knox and the navy brass hadnt fought so bitterly in the short time remaining before election day the navy department would have had its first negro civilian aide also but the black cabinet was willing to settle for per cent of its original demands and roosevelt never had any reason to regret the ballot box returns on the investment dick gregory the racenik comedian since these are times s g when people tend to r weigh up comedians in carats of social significance it may be said of a young man named dick gregory that he constitutes a highassay vein of meaningful risibility or risible meaningfulness a lode moreover he is peculiarly qualified by birth let alone disposition to mine further you really want to have some fun he sometimes tells a night club audience with the deceptively degage air of a gourmet about to pick apart a squab make out youre colored some day i suggest you do it on a weekend you do it during the week you might get fired it is when life looks whitest however that he rallies hopefully way things are he will add ten years from now youll have to be my color to get a job well beyond the facts that gregory is a negro and very funny or even that the burden of his material which he carries with extraordinary lightness is concerned with the doubtful brotherhood of whites and negroes are a number of circumstances making him unique historically at any rate as unique and historic as a comedian can be for one thing he is the first negro standup comedian in half a century or sosince the late bert williams was in his primeto be so widely accepted by white audiences more important unlike williams or any of his successorsstandup sitdown or walkaroundhe has been so entirely on his own terms he has made his mark without resorting to tomming or being what negroes call a handkerchief head two of the milder terms of opprobrium for those perpetuating the stereotype of the race as laughingly servile sly stupid ignorant improvident untrustworthy in an amusing way and so on williams not only conformed but being light in color obliged by putting on blackface a negro comedian looking for white wages in those days had no alternative there are good negro comics around today with gregorys singlemindedness some bitter or broad others simply so oriented toward negroes that their work takes on the nature of an ironic exclusivity among them redd foxx nipsey russell slappy whitedewey pigmeat markham and timmie rogers from time to time they play for white audiences but they earn their living mostly in negro night clubs and theatres rogers as an instance performed in a white night club in hollywood as long ago as and his experience was pretty much typical of what a nontomming negro funnyman might expect prior to becoming a comedian rogers did a songanddance act with another man the props for which included a greenandred zoot suit costume he got a twoweek engagement at a sunset strip place whose owner had not seen him in anything else on opening night rogers turned up in a dinner jacket wheres that suit the owner asked gone down the drain rogers answered you put that suit back on he was told or you havent got a job rogers refused he was allowed to work a week in the dinner jacket and then fired nor have negroes unanimously endorsed such independence gregory claims that early in his career an influential negro performer with whom he had second billing in a negro night clubits clientele consisted largely of slumming whites warned him his act would not sit well with whites and swung enough weight to have gregory canceled out some less fearful negro comedians feel that talent aside gregorys success is partly the result of a fortunate conjunction of events relatively liberalized racial attitudes rogers could thus be described as prematurely unstereotypedly funny and accident he happened to be the only comic of any complexion available one night in chicago when another irwin corey was taken ill gregory went on for a single performance at the playboy club and was found to be so hilarious that he was reengaged later for a longer period john levy a negro and an important independent talent manager likens gregorys emergence to the advent of jackie robinson a conspicuously unservile man himself in baseball and as redd foxx put it the other day greg opened the door somebody had to be first theres room for all of us he cant work pittsburgh and glocca morra the same night negro comedys untapped if it doesnt happen for me now ill take to driving a truck gregory who is is a dark slender but powerfully put together man of middle height but looks just as phthisical as any of his likeminded white contemporaries in the same shoulderless threebutton suits they wear he was an outstanding track man in college and ran through most of four years on athletic scholarships before running out on a diploma he has round innocent eyes a round ingenuous face mouth and voice and a small crescentshaped mustache nothing in his appearance or delivery is at all in consonance with what he says the result is that at first hearing the effect he creates is as unexpected in its way not to say disarming as might be the spectacle of albert schweitzer rigging the stock market a further result is that he attracts several kinds of audience the comparatively few negroes who can afford him lately are one of course then there are shadings of solvent caucasians a group whose beliefs genuinely square with gregorys a second reasonably wellmeaning whose guilt at harboring prejudices can be temporarily assuaged by laughing with himin the safety of chic night clubs a third that lives by restrictive realestate covenants but is sophisticated enough nevertheless to enjoy what it knows to be gallows humor for it and an odd fourth numbering a high percentage of southerners that nurses the unshakable notion that gregory must be kidding bellicosity is to totally lacking in gregorythe trait seems to be personal as well as professional that to repeat a joke older than he is his victims are unaware their heads have been cut off until they try turning them shouldnt be any race problems he may say guilelessly everybody i meet some of their best friends is colored gregory fires up one cigarette after another at work and his pauses are usually punctuated by great wreathing clouds of violently exhaled smoke behind which he stands like gautama buddha smiling in a joss house now lets face it he continues theres just not that many of us to go around we take over the world though the snows gonna be black try driving home on that at night he also has a sly bottomless capacity for understatement that now and then leaves his audiences behind i dont know he remarked plaintively one night at the blue angel why everybody wants to ask me questions about the congo there was an instant of silence as though he had left something out it was followed by a tremendous prolonged wellingup of laughter gregory waited anxiously for it to subside a man trying only to explain himself i have never been out of the country he pointed out this brought on a thick spatter of appreciative applause people ask me he went on how come they dont send white troops only way i can fig ure it out is they dont want em coming home with those war brides the grin on his face had nothing of the sardonic in it it simply expressed the complicity of goodfellowship his faith in the nation was boundless i can tell we making good in the congo seventythree witch doctors joined blue cross there is something a trifle eerie in watching gregory run on considering that what he is actually doing is a kind of immemorial unchurched racial lament a cataloguing of wrongs a reading of indictments the sterner the indictments the more convulsed are his listeners i was tricked into the army he insists the recruiting sergeant says join the army the armys integrated that meant i had to sleep with puerto ricans a guy comes up to me says im from mobile i sure enjoyed your act you ought to bring it to mobile i need to take my act to mobile like custer needed more indians like the rev martin_luther_king needs a convention of dimestore managers i wont even work the southern part of this room the blue angels tiny stage as it happens is south of the customers he wouldnt mind paying his taxes if i thought they were going to a friendly country and he is wont to tell people on occasion trying to make you laugh is like trying to explain integration to a lynch mob he has an intricate story about a transatlantic plane flight during which it becomes necessary for three passengers to jump to save the rest an englishman goes out the door invoking the name of the queen a frenchman with vive la france on his lips ahm from texas says a third he walks back to that door gregory relates picks up a mexican andwhoosh and the guy really was hawaiian he remembers the day swimming pools were integrated in his home town st louis ah but they were nice to us that day in he says they hired a new lifeguard for us he was blind we got up on the new diving board and jumped they drained the pool riding in the back of buses doesnt bother him next time you get on a bus he points out you notice where that emergency door is located and he has a fine explanation of why so many negroes own cadillacs he himself saves on the country club he cant join and by not taking his family to florida for a winter vacation if he gets hit by a bus he wont be taken to the best hospital where they going to charge me so i go to the city hospital for free pick it up save plus general motors sell me anything some aspects of television annoy him just as they do everybody else i wrote hollywood he says damned if i can see one colored cop on the untouchables they wrote me back theyre mak j ing a picture called stagecoach south they offered me the leading part and i turned it down cause i know the first time they make a negro western the indians gonna win i he is naturally preoccupied with current events having had eight years of piano playing with harry truman and eight of golf with dwight eisenhower he settled for four years of bingo with john f kennedy we put him in he observes voted six or seven times apiece didnt mean we were cheating either just making up for the times we couldnt vote gregory also makes a conscientious effort to remain no more than a few hours behind the news one n piece of his material notes that he volunteered for the outerspace program and that when asked why he responded well i cant go to school down here on the evening of the day the russians announced they had put a man in space gregory was ready with some new lines thing that amused me most he said was when that man reached a state of weightlessness he floated out of his chair and he was able to write but he had to hold on to the pad i get like that every saturday night and it dont cost this country no two billion any night club performer will be afflicted with hecklers gregory has had a surprisingly small number none in new york and has handled them gently but firmly to a woman who stood up and stated flatly i dont like you he replied christ had twelve disciples and two of them welshed on him so what do you expect out of a room of people a drunk who wanted to know what he did for a living was informed that gregorys father was a millionaire if you ever get to little rock he added tell faubus his son says hello very likely the most dangerous situation he has ever been in was set up in an indiana club by a woman who was drunk rather than hostile my god she bawled at gregory youre good looking i sure would like to love you a thunderous quiet filled the place gregory took a deep breath what nationality are you madam he asked im hungarian said the woman take two more drinks gregory raced on and youll say youre colored run up here and kiss me and well both leave town in a hurry the relief felt was nearly as loud as the laughter by richard cox must live for human man beins s anc not jjyl this damned color vl a mans color is no africans equally as much as europeans must realize the falsity of any color bar you cannot base a constitution on wrong w these are the words of an african nationalistperhaps the only politician in east africa to have surmounted the mental obstacle of thinking of independence in terms of blackvswhite he is julius nyerere prime minister of tanganyika since may the selfgoverning trust territory he leads completes the final phase of its transition to full independence this friday nyereres dream of a democratic state in which there is a place for whites as well as blacks goes beyond tanganyika to embrace the east african federation he hopes to see created with neighboring kenya uganda and zanzibar and if these ideas prevail they can hardly fail to influence other parts of emerging africa as well in during a visit to the united states nyerere was given an honorary doctor of laws degree at duquesne university as a statesman and scholar whose vision and determination have given new hope to men long weary of racial strife and unresolved national differences in achieving that status nyerere has been helped enormously by certain factors in tanganyika ever since the british captured it from the germans and it came under league of nations trusteeship after the first world war it has been thought of as a country that would eventually govern itself five years ago this idea was not exactly at the forefront of administrative thinking and nationalist agitators were not welcomed but by the time britain had freed ghana in officials were positively looking out for nationalists they could encourage since there are very few european settlers in tanganyika there were no strong settler voices to obstruct such encouragement it became relatively easy for african leaders to gain recognition of their aspirations and nyerere himself the outstanding leader suffered little that might have embittered him as nationalists go he had it very soft nyerere is a slightiy built man with wideopen friendly eyes and a neatly clipped toothbrush mustache receiving a recent visitor he wore slacks and a gaily patterned beach shirt the clothes he prefers though lately he has felt obliged to wear a suit increasingly often he wears native dress only for public celebrations the air about him was relaxed and amiable he has a way of listening attentively watching closely with his head on one side giving a halfserious laugh as a point is made and then coming back with a deliberate but nonetheless whiplash answer he had been explaining the pitfalls of european patronage in african politics and referring to the idea of federation had said seriously my fear is not of european support in tanganyika europeans are more doubtful of federation than africans asked how europeans who did want to help could best do so he smiled slowly leaned forward resting his head on his hands and looked up eyes twinkling by saying nothing he said this wry and penetrating humor rare in africans is one of his greatest traits it comes out often whether he has just settled down rather shyly to discussion with a small group of strangers or whether he is at his most formal in the legislative assembly he uses humor to cool people down to make a point forcefully without emotion and it is a potent weapon speaking after a heated debate on independence in october of last year he said now i recall more than one member saying of our independence that it is something we must demand i am not sure that the word demand is not too colonial a word for october our independence is no longer a question of demanding but of planning and the planning is really a question of decolonization but i venture to suggest that one of the most difficult things to decolonize is going to be the minds of some honorable members here his audience who had been half expecting a sting of some kind roared with laughter nyereres point was made the ability to turn ideas inside out putting them subtly but clearly into a new perspective is one of his best qualities as an orator it is with his choice of words that he controls a crowd rather than with gestures when he walks into a big rally he will raise one hand lightly in greeting and acknowledgment then sit down on the platform looking rather small and insignificant light a cigarette and wait his moment to speak as kenyas tom mboya justly remarked he is more patient than most of us this applies to nyereres policies as well as his behavior though in his demands for independence he has been patient only by comparison with other african nationalists by normal european or american standards he has moved at revolutionary speed he has wanted freedom for his country just as soon as it could possibly be considered ready he has lobbied and argued for it nonetheless he is different from other east african leaders he may have concluded a speech to the pan african freedom movement for east and central africa with the cry peoples of east africa unite you have nothing to lose but your chains but he lacks the panache of his contemporaries he doesnt even carry a symbol like mboyas flywhisk and he also quoted to the conference behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity from the psalms his trademark is quietness and informality but once nyerere starts to speak he dominates his voice drops to a lower key than normal a burning gleam comes to his eye and he talks slowly and deliberately elaborating and explaining until satisfied that he is understood he is still the same person thoughstill humorous and as one man put it he calls forth a lot of happiness in spite of this geniality he can be tough and unflinching there was a notable occasion last year when he advocated federation before a highly emotional rally of africans he attacked opposition to it telling the crowd bluntly that they were becoming bigheaded and no longer cared about their neighbors then he told them to go home quietly they went and they accepted his ideas another time he heard that provincial leaders of his party the tanganyika african national union t a n u were using their position to extort money from asian traders he called a meeting of the national executive and accused them i see faces here of people who have been known to be corrupt finally he declared that rather than see t a n u corrupt he would end the party when nyerere says the function of leadership is to lead and if necessary to tell the bitter truth he means it it is hardly surprising that this plain speaking has made him enemies opposition in the tradeunion movement is growing the tanganyika federation of labor wants more positive action on hehalf of the workers to them his hardwork and nononsense policy is far too reminiscent of the capitalist colonialists he is supposed to be fighting in recent months the organization has become seriously split on this issue meanwhile groups of young tanganyikans in london and moscow are preparing for political action in the future when the newness of independence has worn off and opposition is really growing their accusations that nyerere is bourgeois and westernoriented are nonetheless threatening for their familiar ring and their elements of truth could convince ordinary tan ganyikans that they were being sold back to the colonialists far though it is from the real truth at the moment there is only a tiny opposition party within the country with only one seat in the assembly but t a n u cannot be expected to keep its allbutabsolute majority forever even thoughor perhaps becauseit is so much nyereres own there might one day be a split in it it was as the leader of t a n u that nyerere came to power born one of the many sons of the chief of the small zanaki tribe he was educated at makerere college and at edinburgh university while studying he became a devout catholic and after graduating in scotland came home to teach at a mission school from this he entered politics creating t a n u out of a modest social organization for africans founded by english civil servants back in as president he gave it a policystill the same todaythat tribal consciousness must be replaced by national consciousness if tanganyika is to become a real nation in and again in he went to new york to address committees of the united nations in he was elected a member of the legislative assembly and in october that year he publicly accepted a new governor sir richard turnbull as the man to guide the country to independence after turnbull had made it clear that he was going to give africans an increasing say in affairs from that moment the struggle of nationalist against colonial administrator began to turn into a classic example of how the two could cooperate previously nyerere had burnt his fingers a number of times becoming involved in cases of sedition being fined though never sent to prison british officials had recognized his potential by and desired to rap him over the knuckles but not to put him away evidently he realized that it would not pay to overstep the bounds for he began to respect them he had learned perhaps from gandhis example that violence is seldom necessary or justifiable and least of all in gaining concessions from the british soon after his acceptance of turnbull nyerere had a european derek bryceson now minister of health as his deputy on the opposition benches later he was to snap up kenyas able minister of finance sir ernest vasey whom kenya europeans had voted out as being too proafrican finally after tanu won the general election of september nyerere was called upon by the governor to form a new government and take office as chief minister the first in east africa he later became prime minister nyerere has set out since then to create an african democracy in which minorities are protected when it seemed likely before the elections that minority communities might be swamped in the african vote minorities of europeans asians and others total only per cent of the populationhe insisted that they should have reserved seats in the assembly and when from a platform beneath the green and black tanu flag he introduced his new cabinet including both european and asian ministers to a wildly cheering crowd he said we will continue to show the world that it is possible for the peoples of different races to live together as one nation not that he wants multiracial government on principle he wants the best people available to take part in his african democracy and he will not let prejudice deny him the abilities of europeans while africans are training nor will it be easy for nonafricans to qualify for citizenship but equality there will be for all who are citizens he is explicit on what independence really involves what is freedom he asked his fellow members in the assembly it is the power we have to decide what is going to happen in tanganyika and when it is going to happen and that power we have all that remains is hard work we are not going to be frightened to tell the truth to our people because building a nation is not merely building roads and hospitals and schools it is building the character of a people and we cannot build the character of a people if we fool them and tell them it is easy because it is not easy life is not easy and we as their leaders reveille in rhode island he tall thin boy wearj rip ing the greasy cap the j k dirty tshirt and the faded suntans slammed a foot down hard in the center of the sagging old porch floor his brown face which needed its first shave twisted up in a scowl he pushed his hands into his rear pockets and swaggered over to the creaky railing he narrowed his eyes and stood there brooding down on prairie avenue in south providence this boy was angry but he was not as angry as he pretended to be he was perhaps the leader of the other rough young negroes on the porch however they did not compose a gang they were not organized there was silence i had asked the boy at the railing a question and he was taking his time about answering the others probably remembering bruises suffered for talking out of turn watched him respectfully and waited he turned slowly and looked at me with the coolness such fellows feel for outsiders you dont want to know what i think about rhode island man he said shaking his head no sir i want to know exactly what you think you cant write what i think in the journal man i dont have to write it i want to know rhode island is a good place for white people its worse than the south for me in some ways let me ask you a question how come negroes in the south stick up for their rights and they dont around here theyre beginning to where man this was just after the trouble police had with a crowd in the area during the summer i had been trying to find out what these fellows thought about policemens use of dogs to disperse the crowd and about things in general they didnt seem to be thinking much but they were feeling plenty running through their talk was a theme of admiration for the southern negro and contempt for the northern one in some vague way too they had been influenced by african leaders although they knew practically nothing about them they had gained a certain amount of information from television shows and glances at captions under black faces in newspaper photos it seemed to me that much of their militancy was a pose they were behaving the way they thought negroes are supposed to behave these daysthat is except for negroes in rhode island they had joined the openly defiant ones but they had joined without direction without leadership and for this reason were potentially dangerous a young negro in the south would find it hard to believe that these boys in providence rhode island have the same feeling of being isolated from the general community that he has and it probably wouldnt occur to the young southern negro that psychologically he is far better off these days than the rhode island boys he is for this reason he can walk downtown and see the most respectable people in his race raising hell with officials about the way he is treated he is an actual witness to a mass assault against racial discrimination and more than likely he is in some measure a participant in the attack he is doing something about his isolation and consequently is less frustrated by it the young providence negro seldom has known the people who were working in his behalf because the most prominent of them have been white people generally of a high intellectual and social standing and they have been few the question raised by the south providence boy covers a multitude of halftruths that have been passed around for years and it makes a joke of the souths contention that the regions negroes are happy until stirred up by agitators from the north if there is truth in the boys argument and there is then how can the northern negro who does not fight much for his own rights lead a southern crusade of course one does not need to resort to abstract logic to answer the southern contention the facts apparent refute it what then is the attitude of the rhode island negro community in a country painfully undergoing vast social change it is of course an attitude shaped by the communitys traditions which are breaking down the fact that the push for racial equality in the state has been directed most effectively by a small number of white citizens is not a criticism of the negro community rather it is a criticism of the community as a whole almost any negro will tell you that for a long time many bright young negroes left this state as fast as they finished college because they could not find here jobs commensurate with their training the state had the worst reputation in new england in race relations says george lima president of the providence branch of the national association for the advancement of colored people i remember when i was a kid in fall river i used to hear the old folks telling each other not to go to providence looking for anything unless they intended to change color with so much of the talent being drawn to other places there was not left here a pool from which much leadership could emerge the smallness of the negro population has had a bearing on these things in the total providence population of almost there are little more than negroeshardly enough to support much of a professional class it is true that some professional negroes here and elsewhere serve white people as well as colored but any young negro who started out in a profession gambling on serving enough white people to support him would be out of his mind even now providence proper has only one negro physician and two dentists there are three or four lawyers and a handful of schoolteachers there are some social workers one or two in executive capacities but the list of providence negroes who have achieved professional success elsewhere is quite impressive the small size of their group also has discouraged negroes from seeking public office as a forum for aiding their grievances and it has worked against their obtaining legislative relief from discrimination for equal rights legislation to get anywhere here an awful lot of white people have to stand up and be counted or at least indicate they dont care one way or the other as they eventually did in a case of fair employment legislation legislators who opposed fair housing could not have been on safer grounds politically and they knew it any negro who has gone househunting in providence knows it too the movement for racial equality here also has been shaped by the subtle form discrimination takes in the north generally it is hard to strike at what you cant see clearly and moreover as long as things arent too bad a man may tend to put off correcting them until tomorrow another possible hindrance to the development of the solidarity negroes need for mass social action has been the pattern of urban redevelopment here it has kept them off balance bogged down in the intensely personal problem of finding individual shelter relocation has undermined the morale of some proud longestablished negroes by throwing them out of their traditional sections and into areas with southern negro migrants whose ways are strange to the new englanders this is not a question of anyones being a snob it is a question of his being human white friends have asked me why the older colored settlers dont do more to help the newcomers from the south the answer i think is that such a sense of group responsibility is rare it is especially rare among people who have all they can do to take care of their own families where it exists it usually is rooted in cultural origins foreign to american negroes i have a friend whose answer is considerably ruder than mine he says they are more the responsibility of the whole society than they are mine after all i didnt make them what they are none of this should be interpreted as discounting the valuable service of individual negroes and negro organizations to their group and to the community as a whole ministers have afforded sound leadership the urban league under the direction of james n williams has been one of the states strongest forces working for equality the league however again points up the contributions of white people who make up most of its members the naacp here has been relatively weak until recently its current operation illustrates one of the changes which i told the south providence boy is taking place thanks largely to the urban league and the states commission against discrimination better jobs gradually have been opening up to negroes and the youngsters who go to college are beginning to come back home to fill them and they come back home to join george lima himself a young man in a kind of protest that sets some of the older leaders teeth on edge a young man like john maddox doesnt waste time worrying about whose official feelings are going to be ruffled when he says flatly that police have brutally used some south providence negroes he lives over there and hes an naacp officer and not even the staunchest opponent of fair housing legislation could have failed to be impressed by alton wiley a young lawyer when he bitterly described his experiences with housing segregation in testimony before a general assembly committee the naacp in the past two years has staged mass demonstrations on the state house lawn and held all kinds of meetings to protest job and housing discrimination if george lima had had his way negroes would have refused to budge from lippitt hill until guaranteed decent housing and ralph allen a field worker for the commission against discrimination doesnt seek the soothing phrase to report injustice that he uncovers if the action of these men is not entirely new in this community then the tone is the tone is impatient and it is determined officials and many of the public often as not shrug these fellows off as hotheads who lack responsibility the way they go about things is not considered very polite it is for some negroes as well as white people somehow not quite respectable but their sound is the sound of the students who demonstrate at the lunch counters in the south and it will grow louder if rhode island gets annoyed by the noise were going to make then let rhode island give us a reason to keep quiet says george lima perhaps by now the south providence boy knows that some young men from his area have formed an organization called the south providence athletic association the idea for the association came from south providence without any prompting from outside although the charter was written by ralph allen but ralph allen didnt write the bylaws which among other things take the trouble to ban drinking and the use of profane language during any activity sponsored by the association this is no insignificant development considering recent relations between police and south providence residents it is also interesting to note that the fee for the organizations charter was contributed by the fraternal order of police the members say they intend to work in fields far broader than their organizational name indicates they are interested in the guidance of youth and in working with agencies that try to offset the special social deprivations to which negroes are subjected there are other signs of increasing social awareness in the negro community for example scitamard dramatics spelled backwards is a popular negro play group they are preparing to produce raisin in the sun a highly successful broadway play that did not depend on racial protest for its impact however scitamard says that the plays strong plea for equality in housing was a main consideration in the decision to produce it in some ways the rhode island negro has been like ralph ellisons invisible man kept off the community stage by a complexity of historical and sociological circumstances what we are beginning to hear is his cry for a leading role negro subculture the white mans problem a few months ago i a heard a distinguished r f anthropologist refer to the community life of the american negro as a subculture within but quite apart from the main cultural life of the american people this was quite shocking to me and at first evoked feelings of resentment on my part as a negro however when one surveys life in the united states and particularly in the southern and border states one must admit the existence of this subculture the framework of living to which most negroes must submit one notices for instance although legal standards of marriage and family are established for the entire community departures from these standards such as common law sex relationships childbirth out of wedlock and the like frequently find acceptance and respectability among segments of the negro community by reason of residential social and even religious ramparts which shield them from the light and censure of the community at large in economic development the motive and drive for selfimprovement and achievement among negroes are largely squelched by these same racial barriers which prevent employment of negroes on selfrespecting levels or advancement to higher positions in education the segregation barrier permits application and acceptance by the community of false standards of accreditation to substandard negro schools furnishing substandard negro education which is seldom openly and honestly recognized as substandard until the unfortunate negro graduate attempts to compete on an equal basis in an unsegregated educational institution or until some local board finds it expedient to use a twograde differential in achievement between negro and white children as an argument for continuing segregated schools in recreation and culture the negro subculture develops most negro children and adults in segregated churches a few segregated playgrounds and in loitering around segregated bars nightclubs and street corners the main community on the other hand develops its white children and adults in wellfitted ymcas ywcas clubs and playhouses school scientific fairs symphony concerts in park and school sports competition mock state governments and other such activities sometimes attempted by negro schools as training in citizenship are almost completely emasculated of reality or educational value by a segregated environment with segregated characters far removed from real life for many years the fact of this substandard subculture has been usually either ignored or rationalized along lines critical of the negro as an ethnic group not only by the white population but indeed by probably the greater portion of negroes likewise its consequences upon the whole life and development of the community have been largely ignored except in accusations attempting to stereotype the negro group on the basis of these consequences thus our politicians and others frequently decry an alleged disproportionate amount of crime births out of wedlock social diseases tuberculosis and other symptoms of social maladjustment said to be prevalent in the negro community seldom discussed however are the more basic problems of the extent to which racial segregation helps to create and perpetuate these conditions and the adverse effect of such conditions when allowed in one segment of the community not only upon the people comprising that unfortunate segment but also upon the community as a whole aside from the general contagiousness of social disorder and maladjustments the symptoms may have even more direct and practical effects breakdown of the family usually results in increased public expenditures for aid to unmarried mothers and dependent children as well as in greater juvenile delinquency and crime unemployment or low income from employment based solely on racial discrimination clearly adds to the social and economic burden of a community loss of manpower and brainpower through restrictive and inadequate training and education of any portion of our educable population is loss of one of our most valuable resources when the southland is competing for industrial and cultural development in the nation and the nation is competing for survival in the world the main thrust of the relatively few negroes who have escaped to some extent the crippling effects of the negro subculture upon their initiative and intelligence has been mostly toward elimination by lawful means of the legal bases by which the segregated subculture was imposed and maintained with the help of many enlightened dedicated white people who recognized the dangerous impact of enforced racial segregation and its concomitant negro subculture upon our society these efforts of negro leaders largely through the courts and more recently through the sitin demonstrations have met with some success in recent years but the experience of the last few years has demonstrated acutely that the efforts of a few leaders negro and white are not enough a man can remain in a dungeon for so long that he is reluctant fearful and momentarily unprepared to meet the beauty of the sunlight our enlightened leaders went and are therefore confronted with two major problems first the attitudes and habits of fear timidity indifference selfdeprecation deference to a mythical white superiority and lack of civic and community responsibility engendered among a tremendously large portion of the negro people by thiir continuous subjection for decades to the negro subculture and to the white supremacy propaganda superimposed thereon second the tendency of probably the majority of the white population to view the situation as a negro problem wherein the negroes as a sort of unwanted poor relation are seeking to enter schools parks and other community facilities which really belong only to white people seeking to acquire jobs that really belong only to white people and seeking to live in residential areas and in a social climate which is owned solely and exclusively by white people these twin attitude obstructions are illustrated on the one hand by negroes who refuse to accept the advantage of sending their children to a desegregated school and on the other hand by decent law abiding white people who look the other way in large numbers in implied approval when public officials spend thousands of dollars in public tax funds contributed by both negro and white citizens solely to prevent one negro child from enjoying his legal rights i submit that this is a community problem rather than a negro problem its likewise apparent that although negro leaders in the time that is left from fighting in the courtrooms and at the lunch counters can and should do much by persuading and educating the negro people to accept the duties and responsibilities of full citizenship in a free democratic society nevertheless even with the assistance of the white people who have helped them in the past these few negro leaders should not be asked to solve the white mans share of the problem when negroes demand the right to accept the responsibilities of and participate in the life of the community it seems a poor answer to say the majority of the white people of our community are prejudiced and selfish they do not want you to enjoy citizenship on the same basis as other citizens they do not want your dollar to be earned as easily or to buy exactly the same merchandise or privileges if community progress means having you participate in community life the same as they do then they do not want community progress its up to you to convince them that they are wrong the time has come when responsible political civic business church and social leaders in the white community can no longer continue condoning or participating in either expressly or by implication such attitudes and habits even though they themselves may be privately victims of the arbitrary racial prejudice which nurtures and sustains such group attitudes i sincerely believe that these many white leaders who have for so long held back must now come forward and take an open affirmative stand for truth and for total community progress whatever the personal consequence may be they must work to change the attitudes and habits of their white brethren which are inimical to progress and the betterment of our community they must attack with all their hearts the white mans side of the problem in so doing they will help immeasurably in the solution of the whole community problem if they miss this golden opportunity we shall not be their judges but history may the sunburned soldiers was one of those late summer afterp noons that would have d been pleasant ordinar jicssw a r ily as it was our unit of the nd infantry division negro had been tramping fullpack plus over the tuscany mountains since dawn and the sun bore down hot and merciless suddenly as is common in the italian hills our path opened upon a little village snugly stuck between the hills a small island of ancient stones stucco huts and narrow winding alleyways in the ocean of endless mountain peaks our spirits rose for in these tiny villages there was always cool spring water and shade for restingand sometimes even a few bottles of wine but as our column moved into the village square we found we had been beaten to the punch sprawled out wearily in the shade of the gray crumbling buildings were white u s infantrymen who had apparently just settled there for a break in their long trek to or from the front at the head of the column of white soldiers eager little italian children were collect ing and filling canteens from the village springs those soldiers toward the end of the column were waiting impatiently calling the chattering group of boys and girls and offering bribes of chocolate and cigarettes to get water in a hurry then the bustling youngsters sighted the column of colored soldiers moving into the square they stared at us in astonishment much to our bewilderment they quit the white soldiers and came screaming and howling to us collecting our canteens and rushing off to fill them with precious water we were stupefied and so were the white soldiersand resenting the injustice of the whole thing several of them cornered the busy little deserters as they hurried past and demanded to know why the newcomers should be given preferential treatment but paisanos we heard the peasant children explain surely you do not mind these are your comrades soldati americani like youbut see they have been walking in the sun so long it has burned them black there was no persuading the children against serving us first it was the firstand onlytime i had known being colored to be of special advantage sun sea and sonnets west indian literature y tstkt yin the making is the vv name given to writing g in english by writers native to the british colonies in the caribbean which include besides the island units forming the present federation of the west indies the two mainland territories that have opted to stay outside the federation namely british guiana and british honduras west indian literature born of a region surrounded by french and spanishspeaking peoples is historically very much the result of english education and british institutions however comprising as it does numerous races and religions and having been influenced by centuries of european imperialist rivalries in the caribbean the west indies bears many marks in its physical and mental life of its divers origins and the historical events it has witnessed the west indies had been written about from the outside for many generations before the first upsurge of local writing at the beginning of this century it is a popular fallacy that west indian writing sprang suddenly into existence during the last decade or so jamaican writers like herbert de lisser and tom red cam were active at the beginning of the century and in the thirties c l r james and alfred mendes were prominent figures in trinidad jamess black jacobins is still the most moving account of the haitian revolution under toussaint louverture and alfred mendes black fauns can hold its own beside more recent novels on west indian backyard life aldous huxley wrote a preface to the first novel of mendes in pointing out that the mixed population of trinidad was a gift to any novelist after these writers there was apparently a dormant period but in fact west indians continued to write and publish locally although the seal of quality and acceptability was not set on their efforts by uk publishing houses until the postwar resurgence of west indian writing with several names of novelists well known to many readers of english today this resurgence of west indian writing was due principally to the effects of world war ii when the caribbean was brought directly into world affairs with lendlease agreements between britain and the usa almost overnight tracts of tropical jungle were transformed by bulldozers into army and air bases and sleepy little villages were rudely awakened to the presence of british and american troops in their midst samuel selvons first novel a brighter sun gives an authentic account of this awakening and transformation of the mental life of trinidad peasants several west indians went abroad to america canada and the united kingdom to support the war effort by joining the armed forces or working in munition factories these west indians men and women were kept in touch with one another and their homeland by the bbc programme calling the west indies a sense of solidarity of being west indians instead of natives of rival islands and territories of the caribbean began to emerge and it was in that the bbc caribbean voices a literary programme was started with miss una marson a jamaican as producer this programme more than anything else helped to discover and encourage west indian writers after its inception and to stimulate the growth of west indian literature as it is known today contributors to caribbean voices began to feel a sense of community through the weekly broadcasts which stimulated further creative effort and selfcriticism in this way too the little magazines in the caribbean were given a fillip and two which started then are still in existence bim in barbados and kykoveral in british guiana short stories and poems which were originally broadcast by the bbc were occasionally printed in bim recent collections of short stories like selvons ways of sunlight and the one edited by andrew salkeywest indian stories contain some that were first published in barbados the verse broadcast in caribbean voices is to be found in bim and the university college of the west indies caribbean quarterly also in england during the war years were cricket ambassadors like the great allrounder learie constantine who was ostensibly reading law but was soon drawn into welfare work among west indians in england he contributed two books on the history of west indian cricket though not in the same class as neville carduss books they deserve a notice in any survey of west indian writing for their breezy quality like the irrepressible gaiety of learies performance with bat and ball and when one recalls the apocryphal match in which jingle of the pickwick papers took part in more than years ago it seems proper to include constantines books on cricket in the corpus of west indian literature like cricket literary activity had been going on for some time and finding an outlet in local sunday papers and ephemeral magazines and little reviews side by side with printed matter there was folk poetry in the form of the calypso but there was no stationery office in trinidad the orig inal home of these extemporaneous ballad compositions to keep a record of even the titles the corpus of these oral ballads often composed on the spot in carnival competition would serve as a social commentary on west indian life combining the topicality of the elizabethan broadsheet and the piquancy of the continental fabliaux bold bawdy satirical and sententious these compositions were generally in the idiom of trinidad english though they may have originated as ballads in the french patois of the island similar to the st lucia patois in parts of derek walcotts play the sea at dauphin there is no doubt that the calypso has been grossly neglected by the official purveyors of west indian literature there has also been a tradition of local drama but no serious attention was paid to west indian drama until the founding of the university college of the west indies the extramural department tutors stationed in the various territories advise in the production of local drama and at the college itself in jamaica the poet and dramatist derek walcott has had his playsthe sea at dauphin and henri christopheproduced in he was commissioned to write the festival play drums and colours for the inauguration of the federation the university college has also published plays by walcott and other west indian dramatists nothing however has appeared in print in the united kingdom except errol johns prizewinning observer play moon on a rainbow shawl which was produced in the west end other west indian and west african plays have of course been produced at the british council centre in london but it seems necessary for one to be on the spot to follow the progress of the work being done in drama by west indians and west africans in the caribbean africa or the united kingdom it is easier to keep in touch with developments in the novel on both sides of the atlantic since writers have caught the eye of united kingdom publishers and critics with the advent of such writers as selvon lamming and mittelholzer from the west indies and amos tutuola chinua achebe and d o fagunwa from nigeria the west indian novel starting out as mainly descriptive and autobiographical has tended especially of late to move towards the sociopolitical and satirical lammings four novels move along this line from the largely autobiographical in the castle of my skin and the emigrants to the more introspective and politically biased of age and innocence and season of adventure naipauls mystic masseur and suffrage of elvira are unmistakably satirical and the work of john hearne combines the purely descriptive with sociopolitical analysis in such novels as a stranger at the gate and the faces of love bearing in mind the political emphasis of the recent novel from sierra leonewilliam contons the africanand the more detailed analysis of achebes no longer a t ease as compared with his first novel it is quite reasonable to suppose that the novel in west africa will follow a trend similar to that of the west indian a comparison between west indian and west african writing reveals that of recent years similar influences have been at work the great difference of course is that in a country tike nigeria there have been compositions in several languages whereas in the west indies writing has been almost entirely in english french and english writers in contiguous countries both in the caribbean and west africa are only now beginning to exchange ideas this literary dialogue between french and englishspeaking peoples and the establishment of a west africacaribbean cultural liaison is likely to produce very interesting results already african themes are emerging in west indian poetry but the french antilles haiti and cuba have been quicker to explore the literary possibilities of cultural affinities between africa and the caribbean it is difficult to estimate the influence of such french writers as aime cesaire leopold senghor and camara laye on readers of english but there has doubtless been a leavening of the intellectual life in west africa generally since the appearance of black orpheus the literary journal that has done more than anything else in english to establish cultural contact between french and english writing in west africa and the west indies there are also signs of a growing vernacular literature especially in nigeria and ghana drama in twi fiction in yoruba notably the stories and novels of fagunwa the publication of olokun a literary periodical in yoruba new translations of the bible in mende and twi the oxford press projected series of african literature texts with translations all these are clear indication of a vigorous literary life beginning to blossom in this part of the world a crossfertilisation of vernacular and englishfrench writing will ensure the uniqueness of west african literature the existence and growth of a west african literature owes a great deal to the work of pioneers who tend to be forgotten in the present upsurge of creative writing in nigeria ghana and sierra leone henry swanzys voices of ghana is a good sample of writing that has been going on for longer than most people imagine short stories translations essays dramatic pieces sketches of everyday lifeexamples of these are to be found not only in swanzys anthology but also in the files of newspapers and magazines throughout the west coast from nigeria to the gambia and as in the case of the west indies although little has been published in the way of plays there is a strong tradition of indigenous drama in nigeria and ghana at least the university college ibadan has been encouraging with great vigour the writing and production of plays and the presence of the young nigerian playwright wole soyinka as rockefeller research fellow in drama attached to the english department of the university college ibadan is helping to give nigeria a living theatre his own plays produced in the arts theatre and oneact plays written by students and produced by themselves on improvised stages in the various halls of residence are exciting events at ibadan some interesting work in comedy is being done with the pidgin english of nigeria but to return to the earlier writers of english and west africa there was gladys caselyhayford of sierra leone whose poems sketches and short stories some of these are to be found in back numbers of west african review must have influenced such compatriots of hers as william conton the novelist and abioseh nicol short story writer and manofletters dedicated to the idea of a west african literature tutuola ekwensi and achebe were preceded by denis osadebay whose prince of utete seems completely forgotten and by the ghanain r e obeng whose eighteen pence was once hailed as a classic verse in krio by thomas decker and gladys caselyhayford and osadebays use of pidgin in africa sings were antecedent to present experiments with pidgin english in verse and prose finally this is the moment to pay tribute to henry swanzy who for many years as editor of african affairs in which he published several pieces broadcast in calling west africa and as producer for the bbc caribbean services and for radio ghana has done more than any other single individual to foster the growth of west african and west indian literature during the last two decades andfuls of lemon it it colored leaves clung ifni p to the blackening limbs and twig s of the bos mjrcem cage along the road near the house a dull tuft smoked from the cabins chimney fallwillie lee was getting restless the mill was about due to reopen and mary kates maidmoney from mrs rice had stopped coming

way around willie lee walked to the steps in front of the porch it careened like an overloaded skiff and willie grabbed the banister to keep from falling he decided to fix that thing this year for sure he turned around and went back out the yard pulling his pants up and tucking in his shirt tails he was very tall and he wore a set of long bushy sideburns once hed seen a picture of frederick douglass and had thought about wearing a beard like douglass but hed changed his mind and settled for sideburns abraham his stubtailed hound got up when willie walked back into the yard he wagged his stub and followed willie to the big persimmon tree willie sat on the ground and started to play with the dogs long flappy ears what to do what to do the screen door slammed and a screaming little girl tumbled onto the porch it slammed again and a little boy hurried after her the girl dark and very skinny jumped off the porch and fled squealing to willie the boy stopped tucked his plaid shirt in exactly the same way willie did and pursued the girl again diving at her and crashing into willies chest willie stood and slapped his i thighs and started to cough in the brown fog that rose from his overalls now you little scounds just quit it make somebody break his nake the girl lifted a circle of dust around willie and the boy followed in her wake making growling noises and screwing up his face abraham yapped into the battle and willie slapped his thighs again dadblast it stop that commotion its too hot its too hot youheah florida hit me daddy i did not abraham yapped willie walked away grumbling and the children streaked into a path that bent through a plot of strong black trees and fallen leaves with orange edges willie watched them run dont youall go too far your motherll be after me if you go too far they zigzagged through the shadows and branches abraham yelping and scrambling to keep up and they did not answer willie lee got up he started back into the house he stopped something very bad hit him in the chest this was the second time the first time was last spring in the plant he was unloading a bale of cotton for the mattress fillers hed thought at first that it was indigestion but the pain went from bad to worse and before he knew anything he had dropped the hand truck with the bale of cotton on it and stood there heaving and gasping for breath hurting in the chest like the devil the foreman noticed him and ran up and started hitting him on the back it seemed to help and he caught his breath and sat down for a minute the foreman was a signifying old something youd better take it easy with them young girls willie lee you look like you was goin on away from here willie lee tried to smile but he couldnt do it the pain was still filling his chest and he felt weak verlee the foreman watched him for a moment then called luther sammy yall come and do something with this cotton i think willie lees had too much of that young stuff he caint get his breath willie lee started to reach for the cotton im all right i can make it okay sammy and luther hesitated willie lee stooped to the cotton and started to lift it back to the hand truck sammy and luther quickly put hands to the bale and willie lee grabbed the handles of the hand truck and took the cotton to the bathead machine that was the first time now it was happening again willie stood near the great tree weaving and gasping for breath the pounding in his chest beat against his ears and in the thick of his tongue he called bubba but his voice was too weak to carry he sat down the pain was back again and it was getting bad he called his daughter florida still no more than a croak from his throat he lay on his back but that hurt even more he lay on his side it was no good he sat up and another pain screamed out of the old one this was worse than any of the others he pulled his shirt open at the neck his stomach started doing something funny it didnt feel so hot he tried to scream but this time nothing came the sky began to move the trees turned baby blue and the house wobbled and rippled and went gray he thought about mary kate he heard the childrens voices abraham barked voices came near him then they washed away the barking grew louder he felt m another pain and the sky and the trees and the house went real light blue and melted into the voices and the barking he felt something rough and wet slide across his hand now a barking again he heard some squeals and somebody called his name he tried to answer when mary kate reached him he was dead he was buried the next friday on the following monday the plant called the men back to work the south african underground it was oclock at t night when the telephone jangled in my johannesburg hotel room an unfamiliar you came here to study apartheid you should meet the people who are fighting itthe voice said underground then came an order to be outside my hotel at am i waited nervously outside the hotel fingering my homburg and stick this had not been the first mysterious telephone call i had receivednor would it be the last a small car drew up and a well dressed indian held the door open for me with him were two afri cans we were going i was told to an anniversary ceremony for the seventyone africans who were shot down at sharpeville a year before we drove mostly along bumpy unpaved roads beyond the vast beigecoloured slagheaps of the goldmines that surround johannesburg it was nearly am when we reached an isolated group of houses and stopped beside a dilapidated stuccofinished cottage i was led down to a basement surprisingly large and jammed with more than men and women they were nearly all africans in native dress the women barebreasted squatting on the floor they fell silent when they saw me in chairs at the far end of the room a dozen white men sat obviously in charge of the meeting on one otherwise bare wall hung a portrait of nikita khrushchev draped with red flags on another a picture of one of the leaders of the bloody sharpeville gathering a tall fairhaired white man about forty appeared to be the leader he wore a smart brown suit he told me quietly dont be afraid were not going to hurt you we have brought you here to show you that our movement is the only hope for africa you have been talking about communism and your hatred of it but after seeing this meeting we believe you will change your mind and will tell your people the true facts the meeting then continued in an african tongue there were pauses to translate into other native dialects i gathered it was a discussion of plans for unified action for some future time when not taking part in the discussion the tall man explained that this was a group of freedom fighters who were working to unite all parties in a common struggle for an allblack africa how i asked do you propose to oust verwoerds government he smiled thought for a moment then said ill show you something but first you must swear in the name of black africa not to reveal to a soul in africa what you will see his voice hardened and his entire countenance changed as he added if you do we will track you down and kill you at one end of the cellar was a wooden partition the tall man leaned over pressed a short steel rod into a small hole on the floor and a section of the partition swung open inside i could see a large room he rose took my arm and led me inside while the others watched the inside of the partition including the door was faced with steel stacked against the walls were wooden cases made of pine he lifted the lid on one and inside it were riflessomewhat like the leeenfields i had handled during the warin one corner stood two barrels like rum kegs and in them were hand grenades wrapped like apples in foil when i lifted one and unwrapped it the tall man recoiled and shouted a warning i reminded him that i had used many of them during the war and that i had not removed the release pin im afraid i spoke scornfully when i asked if this armament was intended to free africa the tall man smiled and said there are many places like this one day we will use them all back in the meeting room the gathering had begun chanting the welldressed indian who had brought me said its time to go as i left the tall man said someone would contact me later no matter how much you may hate communism he told me we are the only hope of africa next evening i heard another voice on the phone it was an african voice it said our leader told me to contact you you will say nothing of what you saw when you return to canada you will be reached again goodbye i tell this story not because it indicates the intent of all black africans but to show the ends to which a desperate and hopeless people can be driven my second story begins at the railway station in johannesburg i bought a ticket at the nonwhites wicket entered a whites only coach and took a seat in a moment the conductor appeared and with a sneer demanded cant you read you know your kind belongs back there he pointed along the train to the noneuropean coaches i said im staying here im a canadian a dozen white passengers watched quietly some sympathetically as he barked the sign says this coach is for white passengers only when youre in south africa youll have to learn to read i sat tight and told him in my country i may sit in any coach for which i paid my fare i thought this was a commonwealth country too i pointed to my war veterans british commonwealth service league badge but the conductor ordered me off the train at the next station to walk back to the coloured coaches so i wouldnt pass through other white coaches when i refused the train superintendent appeared they talked about me in afrikaans then they left from every side white passengers spoke up they smiled and several shook hands an afrikaner said ive been trying to get my houseboy to do this for years but hes too frightened an english woman said if more of you would do that you could break apartheid thus i began to learn of black africas white friends when i applied for a visa to visit south africa it was granted on condition that i agreed to be met by government officials and visit the places they selected the south african high commissioners letter to me granting the visa explained this was necessary in order to enable you to obtain a complete picture of south africa at jan smuts airport outside i johannesburg i was met by white representatives of the south african governments information bui reau i was greeted warmly and courteously in a motorcar with a white driver i was taken to the carlton hotel where my registration caused considerable excitement but it was apparent they expected me i was ushered to an excellent room but was requested not to enter any lounges bars or other public rooms i would eat in my room i was soon interviewed by reporters i told them i had been impressed by the south african governments programme for the education of africans for the establishment of their own communities for a form of local selfgovernment i had said and repeated that these things should be seen and evaluated fairly with guides and escorts provided by the government i toured the townships or locationsthe vast sprawling native communities in which south africas nonwhite populations must live my first visits were to the johannesburg townships of orlando and meadowlands these are comparatively new some townships in the very shadow of huge power developments had no electricity children scurried everywhere ragged yet surprisingly clean on every hand were pathetic evidences of pride tiny patches of struggling lawn flowers in windows spotless washing hanging above the pitifullysmall backyards and despite my realisation that i was seeing the best my horror grew in the knowledge that these were prisons camps of captive and subject people here was obvious deprivation malnutrition poverty in the rags clinging to the clotheslines but still pride in the carefullypainted doors and bits of salvaged furniture the worst slums of the western world fall far short of conditions in many of the native townships in many there are only a few central points where water may be obtained it must be carried in buckets a great distance open privies are a source of infection no one can question that south africa has spent vast sums in an attempt to provide housing and other necessities for its native populationpoor though these remain but one has only to talk with the people to realise that the governments proposals for gradual development of the native peoples their education and eventual local selfgovernment and so on are starkly and cruelly reactionary here is an example we were to attend the opening of the new native agricultural college in zululand mr m d c de wet nel minister of bantu native administration and development was made to frame me on trumpedup morality charges and i was threatened with injury or death once i walked down the street with the wife of a white lawyer i was stopped by a policeman and threatened with a criminal charge when her husband who was to meet us arrived his intervention prevented my arrest many times my taxis were stopped and i was threatened with a search for liquor or weapons if i ate with a white personexcept those officially approved by the government guide it had to be done secretly one sunday evening i was called to the telephone in my hotel a woman said she wished to meet me she was anxious to go to canada and hoped i could advise her how to seek permission would i come to the following address puzzled i was on the point of going when caution stopped me instead i called a friend a clergyman he asked me to remain in my room an hour later he arrived with his wife and my caller the latter was a white woman he explained that he had gone to the address sought the woman who had given me her name and brought her to talk to me we talked for a long while when suddenly she broke down and confessed she had no interest in coming to canada was an employee of an hotel where i had stayed once and had agreed to lure me to her place where police would rush in to hear her accuse me of an attempted assault i was amazed but i was also terrified when i remembered a minister of the government had said in the assembly in capetown that not one black man has raped a woman in this country and avoided the gallows i had known discrimination at home no one can say it does not exist in north america but what i saw and felt in south africa was something far more horrible after a month i came away frightened and disappointed i was frightened by what obviously lies ahead further betrayal of democracy and if something is not donecommunism by dr broadus n butler although an image is q a only a surface phenom enon which merely a outlines how one is t seen by himself or by another person and images may fail to reflect the true character of the person images are powerful social determinants because they condition the way a person behaves toward himself and how others respond to him the same behavior evokes different responses depending upon the image of the person engaged in the behavior eating watermelon is an example imagery is one of the most powerful social factors in these united states and how images are manipulated is of significance to the whole world in these serious times a social image then is an appearance or set of appearances which is imputed to a person or group and becomes so ingrained in the social setting as to command acceptance whether or not it truly characterizes the person or group racial images in the united states have taken on a character of sacredness and inviolability in a very short period of less than years the myths underlying these images have given coherence to a highly elaborate and institutionalized system of prejudicial attitudes and behaviors all of these myths have economic reasons for being and they support an economic arrangement of which we are a part during years americans of african heritage have been successfully subdued humiliated enslaved exploited degraded freed segregated and now discriminated against the last two racial segregation and racial discrimination are not the same there is a distinct difference segregation is overt physical separation which is subject to legal and economic control discrimination is covert subjective and deceptive so it is more difficult to isolate and more elusive of control by regular legal and economic measures it is in the area of racial discrimination that imagery is of pivotal importance because the image which supports discriminatory attitudes operates with equal detriment upon the victim and the perpetrator of discriminatory practices in the united states the awesome fact is that the survival of this nation and the peace of the world may largely depend upon the elimination of discrimination in the united states moreover it is quite conceivable that segregation may be eliminated without discrimination being eliminated witness many northern states but it is inconceivable that discrimination could be eliminated without segregation going by the board this makes discrimination much more important to us than segregation the ingrained attitude patterns of racial discrimination historically worked interchangeably with a whole framework of myths to justify the establishment and perpetuation of racial segregation racial segregation has worked reciprocally to condition and reinforce attitudes of racial discrimination the three main image myths which have been most damaging to the american negros selfimage and have done most to deprive him of the opportunity and capacity to conceive of himself as an equal of other americans and to live as a free equal american are the following the myth that american negroes have no cultural past the myth of negro biological and social inferiority and the myth of negro poverty i shall not address myself directly to an analysis of these myths but the mention of them constitutes a necessary background for any discussion of the negro selfimage today to use a biblical metaphor which has a genuine appropriateness for those who are imageconscious we are in the second millennium of the development of a democratic american life the first millennium was introduced by a violent raid on harpers ferry in and lasted ninetyfive years to the supreme court school desegregation decision of the main character of the first millennium was that it started with the painful sixyear process of emancipation of africans by now called negroes and forged back together a divided nation the war that eventuated in the emancipation brought on segregation in the wake of that emancipation only eight years later the signal for the end of that period came with the legal decision to eliminate segregation the supreme court decision of which introduced the second millennium pointed to the damage visited upon its victims by the inherent evil in the reciprocal relationship between segregation and discrimination the court addressed itself directly to the question of racial discrimination when it declared that segregation is inherently unequal and that equal physical appearances of school buildings and equipment do not constitute equality for the human constituency the important thing about these two junctures in american history is that the survival of the nation rested then and does now rest upon the resolution of a national problem in which negroes were and are of key importance moreover what negroes did during the first millennium was pivotal to the survival of the nation but what negroes do in consequence of the beginning of the second millennium may very well determine the survival of the world as we know it this is a tremendous responsibility and i think that not enough negroes are aware of the enormity of the task or the meaning of their historic role although we talk about it daily to each other let me begin the heart of the discussion by saying that these are hard and crucial times this is the first time in the history of mankind that the prospect of freedom and the concept of universal freedom have been treated on a world wide basis the freedom of mankind in africa in asia in south america in latin america and indeed in europe is for the first time treated in one universal context of approach to mankinds problem such hard and crucial times require that we negroes take a crucial look at ourselves for we may be the midwives of freedoms birth or the nurses of her maturation provided we do not permit her to arrive crippled and become warped at an early age as we did in because of our incapacity to utilize a historical opportunity to nurture freedom to her full maturity incidentally the old adage goes that opportunity knocks but once but this is the second time within a century that the opportunity to be free has clearly knocked upon our doors what happened during the first millennium why did not emancipation eventuate in real freedom the plain fact is that negroes were so consumed by the burdensome effort to carve out a bare subsistence and to gain relief from physical degradation that they had neither time nor energy nor courage to respond to frederick douglass call to continue to struggle until they were completely free they could not hear his warning that physical survival was being paid for at the cost of human dignity and that the loss of dignity would usher a regression to a condition of being not less than half slave nor more than half free we even now talk about dignity without realizing that dignity must be undergirded with some kind of power or else it becomes a weak and surface sham douglass described the ironical social process of the relationship between dignity and discrimination about a hundred years ago in a remarkable parable which i can only paraphrase this parable also pointed up the main distinction between his philosophical approach to the achievement of freedom and the approach of those who advocated conciliation gradualism and obsequiousness under the duress of the necessity to eke out a bare physical and economic survival frederick douglass put it this way injustice can become so firmly established that the perpetrator cannot distinguish it from justice consider that you the peer of another pass him on the sidewalk and you yield in courtesy as befits your gentility he thanks you you yield the second time and he thanks you but with less enthusiasm you yield the third time and he begins to think that you do this either in consciousness of his superiority or in awareness of your inferiority you yield a fourth time and he begins to think it is his right to your part of the sidewalk about the eighth time your inferiority and his superiority become laws of nature and your claim to access to sidewalks becomes an affront to his rights and violation of the laws of nature he paralleled this message with a ringing philosophical observation that went unheard then and has continued to go unheard by the majority of negroes even in the wake of the sitins and freedom rides of the past months of listen to douglass speaking in response to urgings by negroes to go slow and not rock the boat because it made a bad image for negroes and it disturbed race relations if there is no struggle there is no progress those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground this struggle may be a moral one or it may be a physical one or it may be both moral and physical but it must be a struggle power concedes nothing without a demand it never did and it never will so here we stand again on the threshold of a second great opportunity we stand here with only a partial realization that if we had had the resources during the first millennium to get beyond the quest for physical relief to demand that we be really free the institution of segregation would not have emerged in the s nor would it have been crystallized in the supreme court decision of i say partial realization because now segregation has become so imbedded in our own thinking that for the most part we ourselves contribute to its perpetuation and do not distinguish it from discrimination and worse we do not realize that segregation initially adopted in the s as a political expediency in the short time of eighty years has come to be treated as if it were a law of god and nature by exactly the process that frederick douglass described indeed this is how it is projected by segregationists both negro and white how do we get beyond segregation in this second millennium and at the same time avoid regression into the pitfall of discrimination which depends upon the perpetuation of an inferior image negroes of a century ago got beyond slavery only to fall into the trap of segregation we must deal with both segregation and discrimination the legal and the attitude and get beyond both we must frankly begin by remaking remolding recreating and reevaluating our own selfimage the greatest need that we negroes have at the moment is for cultural mirrors that will magnify ourselves to ourselves in such wise as to enable us to stand foursquare before ourselves clearly and reflectively this cannot be just a legal mirror because we must come up with profound social and moral answers about our own selfimage before we can use the image to demand equal equality in dignity instead of mere legal equality we must literally transform our j own myths which have supported the image of the american negro j as a spontaneously generated in minority group which has no past and whose members are by i nature inferior in behavior in j ferior in mentality inferior in culture inferior in value standards and inferior in biological station where do we start we must obviously begin by removing the ingrained mote that segregation has placed in our own eyes and has made us look confusedly upon ourselves this is no easy task because to many of us the occasional irri tation of the mote is not nearly so troublesome as the awesome prospect of the responsibility of freedom many of us have adjusted quite well to the blurred image because we have not allowed it to deter our pleasures nor disturb our pocketbooks but for the few who must bear the mantle and the armor of the next generation there must be a threefold look into the mirror of this day the first look must disturb us perturb us and make us restless to do something i mean something much more than scholarships and freedom fund dinners and something on a continuing organized coordinated scale which looks beyond the piecemeal year to year campaigns otherwise we will not be seeing the truth about our responsibility the second look must encourage us or we are not geared to the reality about the real impact of the legal and political work of the naacp the educational and employment pioneering of the national urban league and the charismatic inspired moral and social demonstrations of the sitins and freedom ride movements of core the third look must sober us to our opportunity and discipline us to the responsibility that the survival of this nation and maybe western civilization has placed in our charge let us review these three reflections in some detail the look that disturbs presents us the oldnegro selfimage and the painful necessity that is upon us to divest ourselves of it i do not mean old in the chronological sense of age i mean old as a designation for the product of the segregation period that image has the following content it begins with the baffling falsehood that negroes are a minority race even in full knowledge that twothirds of the people of the world are colored and that no other group of people in the united states has as many members as that group which is classified as negroes this is just the beginning the oldnegro selfimage looks upon the american negro in exactly the same way that whites look upon the negroas inferior the oldnegro believes that he is inferior and all of his social actions and responses start from that assumption there are interesting behavioral byproducts of this selfimage which have been detrimental to himself first he has elected to grow in the shadow of and mainly in imitation of nonnegro european cultural values instead of cultivating and preserving his own african and american cultural values he has been very contented to be the main supporter of the myth that negroes have no past because he in his ignorance about african culture did not maintain our historical continuity now as we view the tremendous resurgence of african culture we occasionally pause to regret that he did not maintain our historical identity and occasionally we even get angry with africans when they say that they are not negroes there is more here to disturb us as we look at the oldnegro he always believes that the next generation will be a little better off and he will think about making efforts towards that end but he does not really believe in his own capacity to live as a free equal unsegregated undiscriminatedagainst american who can be proud to be both a negro and an american moreover although he wishfully believes that the next generation will be better off he does not devote his attention to preparing an economic base and a historical or cultural image which are the necessary foundations for the freedom of that next generation american jews bought back their past when they invested billions in israel bonds and millions in the revival of hebrew and near eastern studies in the united states negroes have not yet seen fit to invest more than token conscience fees either in the independence of african countries or the revival of negro culture studies the economic picture is the most paradoxical here his selfimage is that of poverty and deprivation there are three interesting facets of this economic image first he thinks that he is poor yet he spent billion last year he is spending billion this year and his spending is rising toward billion at the rate of better than billion increase per year this billion is mainly earmarked for consumer products and for companies which do most to discriminate economically and socially against negroes moreover it is simply amazing that negroes who cling to the poverty claim whenever they are asked to give for group improvement or for investment in the necessary economic foundation for future freedom are most conspicuous users of luxury consumer products of these companies the same man who cannot afford for a freedom fund dinner for the united negro college fund for the tom mboya scholarship fund or even for a patrons of the arts membership will spend extra for a golf bag to carry his new set of golf clubs simply because his three or fouryear old bag does not look good enough for his new clubs and if the salesman is the least alert the man will toss in another for a new cart when he buys a new car he thinks nothing of adding a accessory which may be more decorative than efficient moreover he will pay to more for a sports car or a luxury model and consider this a social necessity but he would not consider it a social responsibility to buy a good comfortably equipped car and use the difference to invest in the consolidation of his own freedom the most damaging byproduct of this poverty image is that the only economic right that the oldnegro guards zealously is the right to appear wealthier and freer on the outside to hide what he feels on the inside oldnegroes are as dutifully concerned about this as whites are concerned about the right to appear superior the main problem is that the oldnegro has no real drive to earn the wealth and to be free so that the appearance will be unnecessary we do not yet realize that a cadillac does not dignify the man if the man does not dignify the cadillac we have not become fully aware that such luxuries can make us look absurd when we depreciate among ourselves the value of investment in the struggle for the very freedoms which will gain that measure of dignity that will make the luxury trappings unnecessary to prop us up it makes us look even more absurd when we can spend so much for so many costly things and then have to go begging others to support our students our educational institutions our civil_rights campaigns and our cultural enterprises the second byproduct of the economic image is that we genuinely perceive ourselves as mass consumers not as producers we do not produce in any large measure we do not support producing negro enterprises we believe negro products and services are somehow inferior and we will not organize subsidiary enterprises to support our main enterprises we would not buy an investment interest in a single negro production enterprise with any degree of confidence there is not a single bond drive for any negro or african country which is producing we will not organize a single country club or combination business and social club where foreign and domestic dignitaries can be entertained contracts can be consummated and invitations that we get from comparable organizations can be reciprocated on a basis of equal dignity this is because we think we are poor not because we are poor this is a heavy indictment of the oldnegro but it is a social reality which we must face up to quite frankly in order to purge ourselves of its insidious effect upon our social and economic welfare the third and equally devastating byproduct of the economic image is that negroes have produced some of the greatest artists scholars statesmen scientists professional men entertainers and athletes as individuals but negroes as a group have not supported them neither have they supported the educational institutions and cultural enterprises in which they received their own education and professional training moreover where there have emerged great negro imagemakers the negro community has ridden upon them in the glory of their achievements but failed miserably to sustain their images when they were over the hill ironically when the joe louises and the ethel waters and the e frederick morrows are at their peak we are all with them but when they lose their lustre we find some way to blame them as individuals for their decline the lonely wait of andy razaf andy razafs name is a distinguished one in the history of american p pular music admired his lyrics long before my own songwriting career began and have known him as a friend for years perhaps my indignation in his behalf is personal bias but i doubt it razaf who wrote dozens of globally known hits was stricken in by a still unexplained form of paralysis since then he has lived mainly on faith hope and the merciful security provided by the ascap and royalty income from his early successes recently i visited him in the quiet los angeles house where alone except for a nurse he spends hours a day bedridden and four hours strapped to a wheelchair meeting him is not a cheerful thing for one who knew him when he was a lithe and busy figure around tin pan alley but if it is not pleasant to see him wracked by the pain spasms that hit him a dozen times a day it is a great deal less pleasant for him to endure them pain and loneliness are his constant companions as we talked andy showed me how he occupies his time answering mail from penfriends all over the world writing letters to newspaper editors dreaming up an occasional poem he writes few songs nowadays disgust with the rock n roll fad and the physical restrictions that keep him from promoting new works are the chief deterrents bom andreamenentania paul razafinkeriefo a grandson of the united states consul in madagascar andy was born in washington d c the shows for which he wrote were those that made broadway and harlem glamorous in the ebbing years of prohibition blackbirds keep shufflin connies hot chocolates fats waller was his most frequent collaborator incredibly while the major record companies chum out album after album of joe doakes sings cole porter annie zilch salutes irving berlin and heaven knows who sings jimmy mchugh not one company not one single artist has bothered to assemble an album of hits by the man who gave us to name a few at random sposin honeysuckle rose memories of you aint misbehavin my fate is in your hands massachusetts in the mood keepin out of mischief now gee baby aint i good to you youre lucky to me how can you face me christopher columbus and on revival day the reason i suppose is that andy has no big publishing house backing him no highpriced promotion men to arrange such dedications and is physically incapable of meeting the right people in the right places to the countless artists who owe at least part of their success to the razaf songs they have sung and to the record companies that needed men like andy when good songs represented a growing rather than a dying art i say what the hell are you waiting for for andy to die so that you can start the mad rat race to see who can come out fastest with a memorial album give the man a tribute while hes around to enjoy it though andy cant help feeling a trifle bitter about old friends who have deserted him and about a couple of famous and very wealthy singers who live nearby but have never taken the time to drop by and relieve his solitude he is a man of deep religious faith and contents himself by thanking god that he has been spared the great contribution that andy razaf has made will be a little more permanently remembered and his morale immeasurably lifted if and when somebody gets around to a commemorative lp the ugly face of hypocrisy when negroes were displaced by a chicago hotel fire the last week in june the red cross called the rev albert h constien of holy cross lutheran church with a request for hospitality mr constien immediately agreed his church stands in one of the numerous white islands on chicagos south side not far from the residence of mayor richard j daley when he found that his churchs supper guests were negroes mr constien continued to act in a hospitable manner but much of the neighborhood particularly its teenage element did not soon a crowd of indeterminate size gathered threatening to vandalize the newly decorated church in the ensuing confusion all parties agreed that for the safety of hosts guests and church building it would be wiser to move the negroes all chicagoans were not villains in this incidentjust as all the citizens of little rock or jackson are not villains the villains were the toughs who gathered around the church the silent many who create the climate in which the mob unrest is produced andmost of allthe chicago police of the deering district who resorted to that frustrating inventiveness police can show when they want to evade responsibility chicago is shamed its police are being investigated the parable of christian hospitality has been lived out once more the ugly face of northern hypocrisy has again been unmasked as a nation we are learning that we cannot play around with the racial issue without coming upon its ill effects everywhere a passing note conservative lutherans who pride themselves on their customary distance from the social gospel and the days issues officially and unanimously backed up mr constien not long ago a lutheran vicar in alabama was beaten up by the ku klux klan after he had invited negroes to attend an affair at his church from such incidents all denominations are learning that the gospel is very much related to all life and that non involvement is its own kind of dangerous involvement does integration doom negro colleges the supreme v court decision outlaw ing segregation in the public schools made the negro colleges shockingly aware of the fact that they will soon be in open competition with white institutions what will happen then to the predominantly negro college does it have a future will it be needed what role will it play in american education and what will become of negro professors some people have assumed that when integration comes into full force these colleges will not be needed because negro students will flock to white institutions i believe that this assumption is false college enrollments will double in the next decade and this fact alone will assure the need for all existing institutions plus additional ones but quite apart from the enrollment increase it would be unrealistic to expect the white colleges in the south when they open their doors to negroes to recruit and welcome them in large numbers they will continue to select them very carefully and the great majority of negro students in the south must continue to look to the desegregated negro colleges for their education if these colleges do not perform the task it will not be done negro colleges however can adapt themselves to integration more easily than white colleges because they have no prejudices to overcome and no fears to subdue they are not bound by the customs and traditions of yesteryear they are free to become experimental centers for democratic education and living in the heart of the south and if negro colleges do not play this role it will not be performed any time in the near future certain centers of negro education will become the main source of interracial intercultural and international education in the south with a faculty and student body composed of teachers and students from all over the world representing every culture race religion and nationality atlanta for example might well be one of these centers the six institutions atlanta clark the interdenominational theological center morehouse morris brown and spelmanthat make up the atlanta university center are by practice and tradition a natural for developing this kind of education for decades these colleges have been building bridges of interracial understanding and good will a score or more interracial gatherings meet on these campuses annually and this has been true for decades it cannot happen anywhere else in atlanta on such a wide scale the faculties have been integrated from the beginning speakers of all races and cultures have always been free to speak to students and faculties of these colleges white people are not segregated when they attend cultural and educational programs it seems clear that negroes are not rushing to attend the formerly allwhite colleges that have desegregated some of these were open to negroes long before berea which began as a college open to students of all races and later became segregated opened its doors to negroes for the second time in thirty negroes are enrolled in berea this semester st johns college in maryland began admitting negroes in but only one is now enrolled the university of virginia began accepting negroes as undergraduates in but only six are enrolled today meanwhile the negro colleges in these same areas are crowded with students recently we wrote to a large number of white colleges that have been reported to have desegregated since the supreme court decision of asking two questions what year did your college decide to admit negroes to your undergraduate college and how many are now enrolled we received replies from of this number thirtythree colleges keep no records on the race of students and sixteen accept negroes but have none enrolled eight said they do not accept negroes the remaining institutions reported that they enrolled negroes in the second semester of the academic year this is a start toward desegregation but the total number is small in proportion to the thousands of negro students desiring higher educaiion i believe that for some time to come the negro enrollment in the white colleges will be relatively small negroes will not go to an institution merely because it was formerly all whitethey will seek good institutions we also sent questionnaires to the presidents of the thirtythree colleges that make up the united negro college fund and the presidents of the ten largest taxsupported colleges for negroes the dominant question was what effect did the may decision of the united states supreme court have upon your college of the thirtyeight that replied twentynine said the courts decision did not cause a change in their charters many said in effect our charter has always forbidden discrimination based upon race three said their charters had been revised to permit integration prior to six institutions reported however that the courts decision did result in a revision of their charters to make it possible for them to admit students irrespective of race we also asked about the enrollment of white students in these colleges both before and after may we found that nine of them had enrolled a total of twentyseven white students immediately prior to that date and that since then twenty of the thirtyeight colleges have enrolled a total of in six years sixty of these white students have graduated these negro colleges expect more white students in the future but so far the numbers are not impressive these figures however do not include howard university which has a long record of admitting and graduating white students or lincoln university in missouri where hundreds have enrolled since in many of the colleges for negro students the faculties have been integrated for a long time white colleges however will accept negro students more readily than they will hire negro professors and for a long time faculty integration in southern white colleges will be token of the many southern colleges and universities that have token integration in the student body i do not know a single one that has added negro professors even the few that have gone beyond token integration have no negro professors i believe that the institutions now designated negro colleges will become colleges without designationcolleges serving all the peoplebut they will not go out of existence their enrollments will grow if their future is precarious it will not be because of desegregation but because of difficulty in financing their programs if for some reason all negro colleges were abolished at the end of this academic year i believe that per cent of all negro students now in college would have nowhere to go and the number entering college in the immediate future would be greatly reduced it will take a long time for most negroes to overcome the disabilities imposed upon them by years of slavery and segregation regardless of his inherent ability a child cannot escape being handicapped if he is born and reared in an environment of semipoverty and semiliteracy and in homes and communities where he is culturally restricted such an environment is the lot of the vast majority of negro boys and girls now enrolled in our schools the encouragement and motivation they need to make them aspire nobly must come mainly from teachers who themselves have experienced what it means to be a negro in an integrated situation where negro and white teachers work side by side the needs of the negro student are more likely to be understood than in one where the student body is integrated but all the professors are white no college whatever its origin has a right to survive unless it is needed and unless it is willing to strive for educational excellence but many of the negro colleges are better than some white ones and the best negro colleges compare favorably with the best white colleges in their areas these will compete and will survive colleges with a long tradition of providing higher education for negroes can play two unique and necessary roles they can administer to the spiritual social economic and cultural needs of the majority of negro students and they can at the same time provide a truly integrated education that rises above the barriers of race culture nationality and faith greatest craftsman of them all if movies of the i oldtime heavyweight champions prove nothvy emg else they would seem to indicate beyond even a reasonable doubt that the most superlative craftsman of them all was jack johnson a rare opportunity for inspection was given when sam himmell tossed a luncheon for harry hershfisld and several writers they watched film shots from the private collection of jimmy jacobs some that had never before been seen in this country jim corbett bob fitzsimmons jim jeffries tommy bums and jess willard failed to impress but johnson stole the show it wasnt just that he was big fast clever and a deadly hitter it was the way he performed his chores he talked to the customers at ringside he laughed he clowned at the end of one round of his bout with burns in australia for the title johnson was so disdainful of his smaller foe that he pushed tommy away as the bell sounded then he broke out in a big grin good bye tommy said jack waving farewell so sharp was the clarity of the film that even inexpert lipreaders could get the message tommy got it too he was on the verge of a knockout when the police swarmed into the ring and stopped the fight with johnson the champion the film record of this fight was only recently uncovered because the two battlers could not agree on sharing the loot for the movie rights no camerasor so they thoughtcaught the action however hugh mcintosh the promoter bootlegged it he put men on a platform to hide the peeking eye of the camera it got it all in the jacobs collection is the first showing of the highly controversial bout between johnson and willard at havana in the only still picture that received widespread use in this country is the famous one of johnson flat on his back and presumably shielding his eyes from the sun that proves i threw the fight said johnson afterwards a man whose scruples and morals were not of a high order but the segments of the fight that were shown yesterday gave emphasis to several points the huge willard was not the grossly inflated goon who was slashed to ribbons by jack dempsey four years later he was a trim giant who moved well johnson was then years old not quite the magnificent physical specimen he once had been if he threw the fight however why did he go brutal rounds under a blazing havana sun in degree heat why did he launch assaults particularly in the th and th rounds that came perilously close to toppling willard the eyeshielding episode has been publicized to such an extent that the natural assumption was that johnson took the count and then escaped from the glare of the sun it didnt happen that way at all when willard belted johnson the elderly champion crashed down on his back by some peculiar reflex action his arms came to rest across his face when he was counted out they still were across his face into the ring stormed wellwishers to greet the new heavyweight king leaping across the still prostrate body of johnson with his arms in the same position that knockout was no phony it was for real yet johnson in his prime was a magnificent animal when he fought fireman jim flynn the man who later knocked out dempsey in one round johnson so frustrated his foe by his cleverness that flynn actually engaged in the most flagrant butting ever seen this side of a pasture filled with billy goats big jack didnt complain to the referee he pulled back his grinning face completely unruffled frank moran a topranking heavyweight found the johnson defense so impenetrable when they fought in paris that a strange thing happened when a moran punch finally landed frank stepped back and laughed in an irresistible show of delight what did johnson do he clapped gloved hands together in applause the film gave a brief glimpse of sam langford famed boston tar baby this was the first movies ever seen in this country of this uncrowned champion he too was a superb craftsman so were george dixon and george gans the fellow who came out with escutcheon most smudged was philadelphia jack obrien supposedly the paragon of boxing masters if his bout with burns is any indication the reason no one ever could put a glove on philadelphia jack was because no one could catch him he ran like a thief all the time glimpses of the collection provided a rare treat it even showed the first exhibition ever captured on film an exhibition between corbett and peter courtney on september the cameraman was a fellow named thomas alva edison york the slave explorer unbelievable and mighty it lay before him the thing that had been their one netic objective through months of danger and hardship and excitement stretched away to a western horizon as unlimited and unmeasured as the vast power that came pounding and surging towards their feet while the small thrilled group of white companions watched the young man stripped off his elkskin mag shirt kicked off his pants and shoes and stood ready in his nudeness powerful arm and chest muscles lay exposed under his black skin the loins and legs were like those of some adonis sculptured in ebony he pushed his hands through close kinky hair and with a whoop of joy dashed into the breakers of the blue whitecapped sea when he came out shivering for it was novemberthere were hurrahs and resounding slaps on his back york boomed a gleeful explorer do you know you are the first black man to do it the first negro to start traveling west overland from st louisand wind up wetting his feet in the pacific there was more laughter more congratulative shouts while the shivering young athlete pulled on his clothes no one knows if he realized at that moment he was also the very first negro to a have his name recorded as part of an official u s frontier exploration in our west b be seen and known by many important north american indians c become a skilled hunter of our western buffalo elk and other big game also a rocky mountain fisherman d introduce typical negro dancing jigging buckandwing tapping and folkdancing beyond st louis e act as a trader with the indians for a governmental agency f discover species of wild life in our west g have his act of heroism recorded in an official army account of westernfrontier action who was this man york he was a man whose fantastic and colorful life began as a slave and ended in our history books he was the slave and traveling companion of captain william clark usa of the famous lewis and clark expedition to the pacific northwest in to being a slave only the skimpiest of records exist today on his life most are mere notations on capt clarks logs or in clark family papers apparently capt clark inherited york he had no other recorded name in from his fathers estate clark also inherited five old negroes seven above years three under and three children in this group were old york his wife rose and another man named york it was the latter that became clarks invaluable aide on his explorations and a historic personage young york was beautifull v built athletic and comical records indicate he may have been born in kentucky or possibly in virginia historians say he was worth upwards of his rather remarkable linguistic abilities remember he was an uneducated slave were acquired around st louis then the jumping off place of adventurers and furtraders york spoke french and several indian dialects only estevanico the acamor arabia negro slave of explorer narvaez who was shipwrecked in off florida had exploring adventures to compare with york estevanico incidentally became a medicine man and linguist with coronados southwest expeditions in the s and a big dealer in turquoise and women but york was a nativeborn american before we get into yorks adventures perhaps it is advisable to recap briefly the lewis clark expedition studied in grammar school president thomas jefferson commissioned army captains meriwether lewis and william clark to explore certain lands of the louisiana purchase the man expedition left st louis on may they ascended the missouri river to the mandan indian villages wintering around presentday bismarck north dakota in april they pushed into todays montana thence into the flathead mountains of the rockies striking the snake river they reached the pacific coast near the mouth of the columbia river in november wintering there they explored their way back to civilization in the autumn of though a slave york was fond of his master clark treated him like a trusted companion admiring his skills york could when asked do everything from cook to hunt he had a diplomatic gift with the indians when the chips were down he was a shrewd and welcome indian trader expedition logs repeatedly prove young squaws delighted in his companionship conversational and amorous an early log entry october highlights yorks personality it was so windy rainy and cold in the mandan country that the two captains suspended conferences with indian chiefs nevertheless bucking the weather three great chiefs and many others came from two indian villages to watch in amazement my black servant who did not lose the opportunity to display his powers and strength this nation never saw a black man before york put on a oneman show of calisthenics fast dancing and caricature that gave big bellylaughs to the soberest chiefs the york charm over the comely maidens is logged on the october visit to the lodges of recaras capt lewis and myself went with a chief to visit several of the huts people were kind and much pleased with my black servant their women were very fond of caressing him using yorks drawing power many of the gros ventres or big bellies came to see my black man who entertained several curious chiefs during the councils of october in the future york would cash in on his publicity indian chiefs would return his hospitality with choicest indian maidens even their own squaws to enjoy within tribal tents for example there is the affair with the recaras whose chiefs proffered young handsome squaws for the explorers pleasure one historian says the black man york participated largely in their favors explaining that instead of inspiring any prejudices his color seemed to procure him additional advantages from the indian girls who desired to preserve among them some memorial of their wonderful stranger one recara invited york into his lodge presented his squaw to york then retired outside the door just then clark came looking for york but the gallant husband forbade molestation until his squaw signalled she had entertained york to her satisfaction then there is the meeting with the nez perces their first sight of a negro terrified them so much that they fled into the woods abandoning a papoose strapped to a board york was told to approach them cautiously then to put on his marvelous exhibition of a huge friendly man dancing and laughing with mad abandon this enticed the indians from hiding to talk to the explorers again york was rewarded with the company of a comely temporary wife months later on returning from the pacific york discovered his offspring one historian reported several kinkyhaired nez perces resulted from yorks visit indeed legend is that chiefs tried to borrow york for mating purposes to preserve his attributes of wonderfully lustrous skin great strength and fascinating agility any virile young man can appreciate then the neartragedy that overtook the southernbred york when he endured his first northwest winter records clark on december this day being so cold several men returned a little frost bit my servants york feet also frosted and his ps a little however future quixotic entries prove york lost none of his manpower although his genitals were exposed to temperatures lower than degrees below zero few negroes would have remained undamaged in more academic realms york may have been one of the most important expedition members despite the oversighting historians in order to understand this it must be recalled that important guidework was done by the youthful indian wife sacajawea she and her foreign husband frenchcanadian voyageur charbonneau were hired at the mandan villages bright sacajawea with a good speaking knowledge of indian languages also was skilled in universal indian sign language her husband a wandering furtrader had taught his wife his frontier french too charles mackenzie of the thenpowerful northwest fur company explains yorks role a single word to be understood by the party of explorers meeting indian stran gers was required to pass from the natives to the woman sacajawea from the woman to the husband charbonneau from the husband to the negro york from the negro to the captains in the process indian frenchcanadian and english languages were used actually as is seen much of what lewis and clark recorded in their priceless logs was the interpretation of a negro slave when food supplies ran short the expedition cashed in on yorks appeal to indians moreover york was a shrewd and resourceful swapper the log entry of may is typical york and squaw sacajawea proceeded to the indian village on upper kooskookie to get some roots for our party two days later they were home with several bags of roots and indian bread gotten in trades on the second of june york and private mcneal fetched home three bushels of roots and bread when all else failed york had swapped uniform buttons for food his foodgetting ingenuity did not fail even when afloat on the missouri as clark explains york dived off the deck and swam out to a sandbar to gather greens for our dinner and returned with a sufficient quantity of wild cresses or tung grass while doing this york discovered some sauk indians preparing to go on the warpath against the osages not a soldier york nevertheless was given a gun and shot for food use buffalo elk and deer geese ducks and speckled broats he fished oregons winter streams successfully during the pacific layover when meat was hard to get it was during such food forages that york as clark records discovered new wildlife species york would risk his life to rescue companions once on a june day capt clark with charbonneau sacajawea and her infant son were exploring a deep rockbound ravine york was scouting brim areas suddenly a tornadic wind with violent hail and rain struck a flash flood came roaring down the ravine charbonneau always selfish started to scramble up the rocky banks clark shouted for him to give a hand with his wife and backborne baby charbonneau only yelled back for them to hurry up and come along clark managed to get sacajawea atop his shoulder and with the churning waters at his feet began to boost her ahead of himself up the rockfaced banks the commotion had alerted york he dashed through the downpour to the rim and saw the predicament immediately he began slipping down the treacherous face of the ravine until he got alongside the endangered people then in drenching rain york used his powerful physique as a human hoist and a block against slippage soon he was literally dragging the two over the rim saving the indispensable people along with important and historic materials york the log says revived sacajawea with spirits administered from his canteen at other times york had swum mightily alongside improvised craft in treacherous mountain streams he helped with dangerous portages he was a skilled aide with an elkskin line in towing craft or helping others in hazardous alpine climbing when a homemade canoe pirogue or bullboat capsized he was the first in the water to rescue irreplaceable gear and records the warmth of yorks personality is shown by his funmaking with indian kids he spoofed that he was once a wild monster until capt clark caught me and tamed me whereupon he would start stalking off the kids swarming after him suddenly he would whirl bare his teeth and roar terrifically the kids scattered screaming in mock fear then pied piperfashion they would regroup and trail york until he would pull the same frightening gag often he would let kids wet a finger and try to rub off the black paint from a white man or dance endlessly for them when the explorers returned to st louis capt clark gave york his freedom what happened thereafter is vague and unproven one historian says clark provided his former slave with a freighting business near louisville so he could be near his slave wife zenas leonard furtrader and adventurer of says york became a negro chieftain of the crow indians near todays yellowstone park york returned he says to this frontier from missouri about knowing white mans ways and many languages chief york has four wives with whom he lives alternately and enjoys he says perfect peace and satisfaction he became skilled in furtrading yorks death some say occurred in albemarle county virginia by freezing others say he died of cholera in tennessee en route to st louis to see capt clark one date given is late december since his death no one up to this day has fittingly memorialized yorks contribution to our countrys history but on the record there is a wonderful tribute by the nez perce indians who invested him with the name tsemooktsemook totokean black indian they said simply that of all the men in the famous expedition york was the man with the biggest medicine why racism hurts law enforcement the police officer should not be guided by public sentiment in the performance of duty he should be guided by firmness fairness and impartiality it is certain that if duty is performed in a manner commensurate with these standards it will meet with public approval and commendation firmness does not mean belligerence the former is characteristic of good policing and the latter is characteristic of bad policing it is essential that the police officer act with such firmness and resolution as is necessary to deal with any given situation unless he does so it is impossible for him to command the respect that is essential to keeping the peace however he should avoid assuming an attitude that would create hostility in the minds of either those involved or onlookers the police are only one source among several that must be utilized if we would master the problem of human relations and minimize the consequences of minoritygroup tension often the police are unjustly accused of aggravating and promoting tension this arises out of their crucial and necessary constant involvement in incidents threatening public order it is likely that the police will continue to be the butt of much undeserved criticism and attack they will be damned both for what they do and what they do not do they are like minority groups a convenient scapegoat for those who have failed to accept their responsibilities in coping with major social problems they will attempt as do frustrated and insecure groups generally to deny their own failures and shortcomings by blaming the police we have noted that the police can do much to avoid this criticism however their central role in the protection and securing of civil liberties makes them a rallying point in the mobilization of all the forces of the community the police can do much to indicate the responsibility of related community elements and at the same time to bring about more public support in times of crisis the mobilization of constructive community elements to deal with tension is first an informal task the police department is in an unusual position to spot those localities where tension is rising and to make known the fact in responsible circles here it would be well to utilize the vast network and coverage of the police force in reporting the state of mind of the community every patrolman should be required to record all incidents involving minoritygroup relations in his experience these should be reported as a matter of form and cleared in the central offices of the police department such a record might include the following items what took place what appears to have set off the incident where did it take place who were the parties to the dispute and what others were involved other details this information should be carefully examined by supervisory personnel these supervisors should in turn alert their subordinate officer the same type of report could be made available from other strategic agencies with a similar citywide coverage such strategically located persons as school teachers community workers ministers transportation employees housing directors and social workers with officials of the police department would offer comprehensive and important information on tensions and possible developments informed contacts make possible a complete and rounded picture of the communitys condition incidents nearly always occur in public and quasipublic places the police officer who has established friendly contacts with key individuals in his locality local business men tavern owners pool room operators etc can be constantly informed by them as to incidents of this kind it is absolutely essential that police officers keep close tab on the activities of juvenile gangs since it is out of the predatory acts of such groups that many of the most serious incidents of racial friction arise the experience of minority groups with police authorities has not always been a happy one indeed the negro has had good reason to look with suspicion and fear upon the uniformed officer the police authorities should not be lawenforcement officials as we know them only with reference to the white community the police officer must treat negroes in such a manner that they will be aware of the law as an agent of the entire community the effect of wrongful treatment will cause negroes to carry over the memories of their past experience to the detriment of the whole community the only manner in which the confidence of all groups can be won is by impartial and rigorous enforcement of the law absolute impartiality requires that the law be enforced against all violators the idea that race creed or nationality are extenuating factors permitting different applications of the law must be abandoned equal justice is not merely a term the police officer who is tempted to vary his role according to personal notions as to the worth of various groups is himself in violation of the law an officer has a capacity for delivering equal justice only to the extent that he has this problem under control an unwitting evidence of an officers inadequacy is the persistent use of insulting terms such as jig nigger kike or wop an individual may insist that such a usage is not meant to be offensive such an explanation is lacking in insight for such terms are the symbols of offense and they are violently resented by the persons so labeledprotestations of impartiality mean nothing to an individual who has been so addressed to the injured person the very process of labeling means that the victims right to be treated as an individual has been violated he has been classified in terms to suggest that he enjoys only an inferior or secondclass status the use of such terms must be scrupulously avoided unequal law enforcement also has the effect of encouraging a concentration of questionable activities in certain areas these in turn become associated with the minority groups among whom they become lodged much of the commercialized vice is foisted upon the colored community by virtue of the larger communitys willingness to permit such activities to flourish there to deliberately permit questionable activities to become concentrated among certain minority groups is not only to invite the corruption of that group but it further aggravates the problem of the police in dealing with that group a good standard of fairness would be treatment of the individual in the same manner as the police officer would desire to be treated if he were the individual and the other party the police officer a good reputation for fairness in dealing with the public is an invaluable asset to a police department because it instills public confidence making police work more pleasant and effective acts of partiality are likely to result from excitement excitement in turn may be caused by any happening that would shock a normal individual he must remember that he is not a participant and must refrain from taking sides he is a law enforcement officer and must remain cool and deliberate he is interested in facts and causes which he proceeds to ascertain being very careful to follow the facts wherever they lead him and to treat everyone just the same there is no more important element in disturbing the confidence of minority groups in the enforcement of the law and building up resentment against the police authority than reports of brutality modem police science has long abandoned extreme and repressive measures in dealing with law violators furthermore it is a fundamental tenet of american law that a citizen is to be regarded as innocent until proven guilty correspondingly brutal police methods are especially disturbing since they presume the guilt of persons who may be innocent it is a mistake for a police officer to conceive of his relationship with a member of a minority group as an affair which concerns only himself and an individual minority group members invariably recite their experiences with the police in the community it follows that an instance of police brutality becomes identified with the entire police force and the whole minority group becomes hostile to all policemen each police officer as the uniformed symbol of the law is constantly shaping the attitudes and opinions of minority groups toward the apparatus of law enforcement hence while police brutality may subdue a given individual it at the same time creates hostility in the rest of the community toward the entire police force in some police circles there exists the mistaken notion that the most effective police officers for minority group communities are those who know how to handle the negro this usually connotes the use of forceful and repressive measures by an individual police officer concerning which no questions will be asked experience has proven how mistaken this is the entire police force suffers as a result of the brutal measures of an individual officer the true victims of police brutality are the police themselves since it develops widespread hostility and disrespect for law among the members of the minority group the power that men are permitted to exercise over their fellow men is rigidly limited by the laws of the community nevertheless men desire power and it is nowhere more obvious than in the unbridled actions of a mob it is incredible but true that a mob can derive a kind of satisfac tion out of beating up members of a minority group burning their homes and pillaging their places of business the members of a mob receive from these acts a sense of personal satisfaction this is related to their ordinary helplessness and feelings of unimportance in their everyday lives for the one fleeting moment of a mobs existence its members gain a false sense of personal power they have a passing chance to exercise control and take things into their own hands anyone who has seen a mob in action is well aware that it overrides reason its sense of power is like a tidal wave that sweeps over all who would resist it in addition to the adult insecurities and frustrations there are more intimate and personal experiences of childhood which affect men children often carry into adulthood the effects of damaging childhood experience the alarming amounts of adult insanity and general neurotic and unstable behavior have been partly attributed to unfortunate childhood experiences psychiatrists have pointed out that much hostile behavior in the form of race hatred and prejudice can be traced directly to childhood difficulties it is these highly emotional and excitable individuals who play a large part in crowd and mob behavior they communicate their own personal excitement to others and thus help to organize itthere are always available at any moment and in any gathering a large number of individuals such as we have described they are ready at the slightest provocation to vent their own feeling in the form of aggressive and hostile acts toward the scapegoat minority groups frustrated and insecure individuals numerous as they are are ready and willing to search out others who can be blamed for their shortcomings and failures incitement to racial tension and disturbance comes not only from the extreme right but from the extreme left as well it is important to recognize the sense in which race has become a weapon in mobilizing groups against one another in the interest of other issues which may be concealed from the minority or majority groups themselves hence the police must always be prepared to deal with artificially created incidents as well as those which develop naturally the police must here be doubly cautious since the moods and sympathies of the contending groups are played upon by persons who are calculating and deliberate if the police do not act carefully in the protection of individual rights and in complete impartiality they may become the goat in the situation and play directly into the hands of those who are deliberately fomenting racial antagonisms impartial enforcement of the law and impartial treatment of the public are essential in our society operation roadblock committee y yi the citizens commit ml mv j s o tee for employment has been getting jobs for men leaving the cook county illinois jail for the past four years some five years ago the chaplain of the jail spoke at our pta meeting his description of the conditions within the jail and of the plight of the men was so moving that john and i volunteered our services at first we began by collecting books and clothing for the men this of course was easy to do and required no involvement on our part then one day the chaplain told us that if we really wanted to help the men we should try to get jobs for them the beginnings were haphazard the chaplain called us frequently about men whom he wanted to help our mail and telephone calls were filled with requests from men in penal institutions all over the country we had many visitors at the door the need was unquestionably established but we were only two we realized almost immediately the need for a formalized program and a committee of coworkers the committee was organized and the operation formalized in order to let us concentrate on employable men who really wanted and needed a job this meant screening men who were poor employment risks or who had problems too serious to take their places immediately in society with the exception of warden jack johnson and thensheriff joseph lohman who were both extremely cooperative and willing to let us try just about anything we ran into a whole corps of unbelievers the professionals to a man said that we were not trained to work with prisoners the sociologists psychiatrists psychologists did everything but refuse outright to work with us it was true that we could not work in their fields but on the other hand we could see no reason why if we limited ourselves to those men who were good employment risks we couldnt obtain job interviews for them undaunted we began the classification office agreed to select each month men of those being released the ones they felt were the best job risks this selection was based on men who were not psychotic narcotic addicts or alcoholics men who wanted and needed a job we decided our first step would be to get some idea of each persons capabilities we wanted to test them using a test that could be scored by laymen and could be given to the inmates in a group thus facilitating the jails moving of the men from their cells to the testing room we settled on the army beta and the otis and tests as well as elementary and high school tests depending upon the amount of education of the man these tests are noninterpretative and can be scored by anyone the tests are given to the group by one of the members of our committee later they are scored by other members then a group of men from our committee go to the jail and interview individually each of the men the volunteer interviewers are men who are bankers lawyers writers personnel men after a lengthy interview these men ask themselves the question would i hire this man if i were able why or why not our interviewers become very discerning in a short while and we all know we can depend on their judgment this careful processing helps to eliminate our placing any man in a job which he is unable to handle it also protects our program for if a company were to have a bad experience with just one of our men it would be reluctant to take a chance on another now comes the most difficult work obtaining appointments for job interviews for each man these appointments are obtained by women by telephone jobs themselves are hard to find women to locate job openings and then to do the work of persuading employers to interview the men are even hard er to find the time required can often be quite lengthy but so far we have always managed to get an appointment for every man recommended to us and if he can qualify for the job he is hired there are many disappointments sometimes the men dont show up for their interviews sometimes they cant qualify in the type of work they had said they could do but percentagewise and we are working with very small numbers our successes are better than most employment agencies participation in our program is advantageous to the employer too we know so much about our men we can give potential employers more information than they learn from their standard interviewing of men at the gate thus they take less risk than with average applicants we also claim to have opened up a new labor field because we confined ourselves to one area where we knew we could produce results we have been able to establish ourselves securely in this institution this brings results beyond the jobs we have found for a couple of hundred exprisoners let me give two instances of these further results we have persuaded a few companies to revise their hiring policies toward exprisoners and of course this is a continuing effort with other companies our effectiveness on this is in indirect relationship to the experience we have as to the workableness of hiring properly screened exprisoners experience we can draw on in discussions with personnel executivesand their top management without experience we would have little effect on these men a recent specific instance of further results is a justcompleted study it is an important study that will be very valuable to us in our future work and to others in the field too we had become interested in job training for the prisoners before their release in order to discover accurately what the potential for this is a university sociologist developed for us an intensive sevenhourlong test to be given to a large group of men at the time they are admitted to the jail we were able to do this test because we had the cooperation of jail officials my point is we could have interested these officials in the study if we had not already been established in the institution known to them and having their confidence because we had been working with them for years and performing a service helpful to them and the men for whom they are responsible the main thing our work has taught us is that ordinary citizens can definitely change institutions in their community when this becomes necessary however there are a few rules of thumb to follow ones that fit the seejudgeact formula see when people begin to study the needs of a local institution such as the jail many areas needing improvement and correc tion come into focus the institution must be observed closely to see exactly what these areas are judge then an evaluation should be made as to how and in what area these people can best serve the institution act concentrated successful effort in one area however small produces far more results than scattered efforts on several or all areas that need correction a person or a committee trying to address itself to all the needs becomes a research committee which still leaves the actual correctional work undone reprinted from community white house story not since mary todd lincolns dressmaker caused a national uproar almost years ago have the published memoirs of a former white house staffer created the kind of furore stirred up by the bestselling tidbits of the little washington d c seamstress lillian rogers parks published early last spring mrs parks my thirty years backstairs at the white house parted the backdoor curtains on a view of life at pennsylvania avenue which the important guests who enter by the front door could never expect to know the publics enthusiastic reception of mrs parks newsy white house gossip swept the book onto national best seller lists and kept it there for several months it was one of the five best selling books published in the best seller of all books published by the fleet publishing company and still a good seller in the bookshops a year after its initial publication fleet editor oscar collier said that excerpts from my thirty years backstairs at the white house have appeared in some newspapers in the united states and in france switzerland finland belgium and holland portions of the book also were published in negro digest july paperback rights to the book were sold to avon books for because of the rash of similar books appearing on the heels of mrs parks reminiscences fleet agreed for the paperback edition to come out in november rather than three months later both versions of the book are selling well mrs parks success far outstripped that of her th century predecessor elizabeth hobbs keckley whose behind the scenes or thirty years a slave and four years in the white house was published in because mrs keckleys book revealed intimate details of the life of president and mrs lincoln the book was suppressed temporarily by the murdered presidents son robert although no effort was made to suppress mrs parks memoirs steps were taken to make such future publications less likely the white house issued a directive that domestic personnel would be forbidden from publishing such books in the future there is nothing particularly scandalous in my thirty years backstairs at the white house but the glimpses the book gives of some of the tenants of the white house are not always flattering for instance after applauding bess trumans relationship with the servants the former maidseamstress takes a polite slap at two other former first ladies she mrs truman didnt keep looking over her shoulder as mrs eisenhower did mrs parks wrote and she didnt ignore the work that was done as mrs roosevelt did mrs truman was the most considerate first lady in recent decades the strange customs of some foreign visitors and some particularly amusing diplomatic booboos are described by mrs parks as well as some of the more dangerous hazardssuch as assassination attemptsof life in the nations number one household even the fabled white house ghosts come in for some considered attention in mrs parks light and frothy book the author of this runaway best seller is not a professional author and it was with the able assistance of collaborator frances spatz leighton a veteran washington correspondent that the book was written however mrs parks had been encouraged by her mother who before her death also was a white house maid for thirty years to jot down notes toward a view of someday developing them into a book the book is dedicated to her mother maggie rogers now that the book is a fact mrs parks is busy compiling notes for a possible second try at authoring i see so many changes here in my city she said i think there is much to tell recently i was two blocks from the white house and it was amazing to see the large mansions coming down all the old landmarks will soon be gone it makes me feel very sad because it is taking some of my best memories away in the year since her book first appeared lillian rogers parks has been almost constantly in the public spotlight in the process of promoting the book she has made trips to new york two to the west coastwith stops in cleveland chicago and new mexico she has made almost television appearances about the same number of radio shows and has been featured at a number of autograph parties and lectures when it is considered that little lillianas she was affectionately known at the white house is a whole inch under five feet tall and has to use crutches to get about she was crippled by polio while a child her schedule over the past year has been truly remarkable despite all the feverish activity and a continuing flood of mail and phone calls from readers mrs parks insists that her life has not really been changed substantially i still cook my own meals wash iron press clothes and clean she said i dont have time to make my clothes but i do alterations on all that i buy perhaps her new routine seems less revolutionary than it is because keeping busy is natural with her i read as much as possible even when i watch tv she explained i just must be doing two or three things at the same time i have very little social life i visit old friends on the phone or we see each other for lunch or dinner occasionally what has she missed most since the end of her tour of duty as white house seamstress for such a demure little lady the answer is surprising all the races that i intended to see when i retired she smiles shyly i simply love horses by bernice davis a man who goes to bed a y drunk begets a daughr tershakespeare there is little dispute that the bard of avon m l or the victims of his thievery possessed a keen perception of human behavior and apparently a very poor knowledge of human biology sex predetermination has long been a favorite topic for oracles sorcerers and old wivesoh yes and parents too with the feudal and medieval laws of inheritance and particularly with respect to the enthroned royalties the question of the sex of an unborn often unconceived child was of prime importance even today the emphasis upon a male heir has been noted in some regal bed chambers the pride in the continuation of the family name is the basis for many fathers quest for a son the mendelian laws of hereditary distribution were not known until the past century and as does often happen in the absence of scientific fact and knowledge old wives tales became widely known and accepted although most of these superstitions are merely fancies of the imagination some have been scientifically investigated and a few have been found to have some logical basis preference surveys indicate most couples would like to have a boy as their first child and these same people are just as anxious that the second child be a girl in the days of aristotle they could have their druthersfor everyone knew the first egg produced a boy and the second a girl the ancient biologists neglected to specify whether the first egg to which they referred was the first egg produced or the first egg fertilized here we have what is perhaps the grand daddy of the origin of the ovum theories which have received some serious scientific attention since this theory states that the sex of a child is determined by the origin left or right ovary of the egg on the other hand some contended it was the origin of the sperm and they were on the right track which con trolled the sex factor confusion reigned when the wrong ovary and testicle were matched but boys and girls were born all the same in the literature and legends of the world many folklore superstitions regarding sex predetermination are recorded a prospective bride of palau island has often been admonished to wear mens clothing to bed the night before her wedding in order to present her husband with a son as the first born in sweden a baby boy was taken to bed by the bride if she wished her first child to be male other tales warn that if a brides garter hurts on her wedding day she will bear only girls should the newlywed couple upon leaving the church be greeted first by a male their first child would be male too according to new england folklore a man could help determine the sex of a child by taking a doll for a girl to bed or for a boy wearing his boots or hat during coitus which brings to mind an old georgia legend that if you want a hen to hatch pullets put the eggs from the hen under a young girls bonnet the koreans believed that by turning a certain stone around once a boy would be born into the family many knew when a mother gave birth to a child on the waxing moon her next child would be of the same sex there were theories which insisted the younger the mother the greater the chances of begetting a son and in the same vein if the husband were older than his wife the possibility of a son was increased some thought the intensity of relations during conception affected the sex of the fetus while others maintained that the child would acquire the sex of the parent who had most ardently desired the baby it is very characteristic to find similar folktales in which requisites or results are reversed this last theory is a contradictory variation of starkweathers law of crossheredity the sex of the child conceived will be the opposite of the sex of the stronger parent the hypothesis does not seek to define the form of strengthmuscular virility character longevity desire before the universalor almost soacceptance of the idea that sex as all traits was determined at conception people believed the sex of the unborn child could be influenced by the diet of the mother undernourished women naturally gave birth to young tadpoles eating lots of meat and other protein foods would insure a male heir while mother gooses sugar n spice would produce a girl a news items from iran called attention to the fact that the shahs wife farah had included many nuts and herbs in her diet during her pregnancy it would seem to have had some coincidental bearing upon the recent birth of the long awaited heir to the thronea french physician dr drelincourt published in text in in which he described over common superstitions about sex predetermination these the good doctor held to be pure bunk and proceeded to expound a theory of his own whereupon someone was wont to note that the number of foolish ideas regarding the regulation of the sex of unborn children had now been increased by one not entirely in the realm of folklore are the interesting figures collected by statisticians regarding certain conditions which seemingly are more conducive to the conception of either sex perhaps the idea that if a man spends much time in the sun he will beget a daughter can be traced to a survey of children born to greenhouse workers figures indicate the number of male births increases and supersedes the number of girls immediately after wars insufficient feeding breeds more male tadpoles than female frogs were told according to one figure finder who did his research in buenos aires argentina around parents of mixed racial strains produced more boys than girls many undoubtedly in disgust finally gave up any hope of choosing the sex of unborn children and were content with early determination of the sex of the fetus once it was thought pains on the left or right side indicated a female child obviously an offshoot of the ovarian folklore more of this idea is carried over in some of the french folk medicine if the right breast of the woman were larger than the left or if she threw her right leg forward in walking a boy was to be born it is said some doctors suspended rocks by string or used their pocket watch to determine sex if the object were noted to swing in a pendulum arc or clockwise the mother could expect a boy contrary wise a circular or counterclockwise motion indicated a girl one person currently engaged in medical research claims a similar method is used with a great deal of success the motion or nonmotion of a suspended magnet determines the sex of newly born mice a cornwall legend determined sex by using a shoulder of mutton but pig has been reported from other areas one was to clean all the meat from the shoulder at the evening meal then the blade was held to the fire until scorched using the thumbs a hole was made through which cord was passed the bone was then hung over the kitchen door accordingly the child would be the same sex as the first person exclusive of family members to come through the door if the number of letters in the proper names of the parents and those in the month of conception were added and then divided by seven an odd quotient indicated the child was male some thought the father would be sick the first three months of his wifes pregnancy if the child were a boy during the fourth month one could determine sex by grabbing a cat by the tail and flinging it into the air if the cat landed on its feet the fetus was male even suetonius records that livia mother of the emperor tiberius took an egg from a brood hen and warming it successively in her hands and those of her servants successfully prophesied a male heir when she hatched a finecombed chick in this area too old superstitions have been displaced by modern techniques chemical tests and biological assay methods are helpful in determining fetal sex as early as two weeks after conception a few folktales have found some justification through scientific investigation although in some cases these hypotheses are rejected altogether and in others not widely accepted experimentation of the effect of body temperature the time of mating the time of ovulation the origin of the ovum or sperm and the alkalinity of the vagina have some logical basismore so than stones and phases of the moon couples who have not been successful in childbearing are sometimes advised to try the temperature method based primarily upon investigations with rats this method suggests a definite body temperature pattern which is repeated at regular intervals when the body is at its highest temperature or the female is in heat ovulation occurs this hypothesis of the correlation between body temperature and ovulation serves as the experimental basis for the effects of temperature time of mating and time of ovulation theories regarding sex determination but if you are nonplussed by science and newfangled ideas and that first child or the sixth after five girls must be a boy then furnish the bride with a baby boy and a complete outfit of mens clothing on her prewedding night time coitus to occur about one and a half to two hours following maximum body temperature present the husband with a fine pair of riding boots insure the sobriety and strength of the maleand keep him out of the sunthen take what nature gives you altruism is certainly f fashionable in present dealings with the un derdeveloped world however when they are approached with a plan to help them africans and asians are just as likely to wonder whats in the deal for the other party one small business firmoverseas regional surveys associatesis having a run of success in africa by having ready a somewhat disarming answer to the question money it is owned and managed by two young men howard imbrey forty a former u s foreignservice officer who served in india and ethiopia and thomas goodman thirtysix a onetime explorer in southeast asia for a u s museum from a small office suite in manhattan they have initiated more than two dozen americanafrican enterprises with profitable results for both sides the modus operandi is deceptively simple an african with or a substantial sum in much of africa is advised by these americans to start a small local manufacturing or processing business preferably making a product that heretofore had to be imported readymade the americans match the africans capital purchase the necessary equipment teach him how to operate it and get in return per cent of the ventures shares the african businessman is then left in complete control of his own operation getting advice only when he asks for it and selling his product in the manner traditional to the area in which he is doing business typical of the operation is overseas regionals arrangement with the unegbe brothers in ibadan nigeria learning that the unegbes had a few thousand dollars they wanted to invest in securities imbrey and goodman convinced the two african brothers that they should put their money in a local manufacturing business of their own they suggested it should have something to do with bicycles easily the no form of transportation in urbanized africa after a week of research howard imbrey asked the unegbe brothers what they thought of making rearend carriers for bicycles these parts were then being imported from europe and japan a little pencil work showed that would have to be raised to get the whole project under way the unegbes put up and overseas regional furnished the other meanwhile goodman was busy on the phone to japan ordering thin iron rods the only raw material the new project needed in order to start production a secondhand machine for bending and shaping the rods was located in west germany and a welder from england was hired to teach local help how to operate and maintain the machine in november unegbe brothers ltd went into production its bicycle carriers won immediate acceptance because of their low price made possible at imbreys suggestion by replacing chrome with paint and by doing away with packaging altogether another of the carriers charms was that it was designed to fit both the back and front of the bicycle after less than six months of operation the company was showing a profit at that point the nigerian brothers got in touch with imbrey to ask for advice about expansion into other products his advice stay with bicycle accessories but make a greater variety once more the initial equipment was purchased by the new yorkers a short training period was arranged and unegbe took it from there today the unegbes who own per cent of the stock and are per cent in charge of their companys management arrange deonly this time with wax candles between us we founded congolon co on he bought the bulk wax and we bought the dipping equipment n goodman and imbrey are now running into competition as other small firms similarly delve into africa at the same time the experience of such small operations is bound to encourage larger u s firms to look to manufacturing opportunities in the area but the two men are little worried about such competition says imbrey by the time a major american company gets through making surveys calling in consultants who have never heard of africa negotiating bank loans analyzing their market potential and i dont know what else well have been there and gone leaving an african company making or adapting their product bebehind us has organized labor failed the negro worker n the late nineteen thirties and early forties during the phenomenal rise of the congress of industrial organizations there was a great hope for negroes within organized labor with the rapid growth of industrial unions in the basic mass production sectors of the economy where tens of thousands of colored workers in steel automobile rubber and packinghouse plants joined cio unions on the basis of equality there was reason to hope that the old line afl craft union tradition of racial exclusion and segregation would be thrust aside in the forward surge of the new industrial unions but unfortunately the course of events i n the past decade and especially since the merger clearly indicates that the social consciousness of the industrial unions with their sensitivity to the problems of the negro wage earner have now all but totally vanished instead trade unions are responding like other conservative institutions in american society to the new demands of the negro for full equality and recognition of individual ability in the early years of the s the leadership of the cio repeatedly joined with the negro community in publicly condemning the vicious racism of several major afl unions when they abused negro workers this occurred for example when the international brotherhood of electrical workers upon becoming the collective bargaining agent at the bauer electric company in hartford connecticut demanded that all negro electricians be dismissed from their jobs as negroes could not be admitted into membership when the boilermakers union forced negro workers out of their jobs in several shipyards and the similar action of the international association of machinists at the boeing aircraft company plant in seattle in its time the national cio filed amicus curiae briefs in support of litigation initiated by negroes and assisted in a variety of ways the protests of colored workers against the operating railroad brotherhoods and other discriminatory labor organizations but this has long since come to an end the industrial union bloc in the aflcio hardly differentiates itself from meany and the building trades council on racial issues the leadership of the industrial union department remained silent when randolph as the spokesman for negro trade unionists was repeatedly attacked by meany and they voted with the rest of the aflcio executive council in denouncing randolph and in rejecting proposals to eliminate discrimination and segregation in affiliated unions in addition many of the former cio unions have themselves compromised especially in the south with antinegro practices it appears that on racial issues the industrial unions have made their peace with the narrow and bigoted afl craft tradition there was a time when they challenged that tradition but today they remain silent and acquiesce as organized labor becomes more conservative and rigid unable to organize vast new industries and basing itself upon an increasingly small and limited section of the work force in the united states the aflcio has greatly compromised the social objectives declared at the time of the merger in and in addition has not realized the basic collective bargaining goals it set for itself at that time thus today the militant negro worker is confronted not with a trade union movement that is a force for social change but on the contrary with a national labor organization that has become a very conservative and highly bureaucratized institution closely allied in many cities and states to reactionary political forces and defending that status quo which is now directly attacked by the negro in virtually every area of american life a significant manifestation of organized labors conservatism on noneconomic issues is the rigidity of antinegro practices in many important unions the refusal to yield on racial matters to bitterly resist change in the status of negroes is responsible for the fact that today many trade unions lag behind the progress made by other institutions in the community in east st louis illinois and tulsa oklahoma for example negro children attend integrated schools during the day but their parents attend segregated union meetings at night if they are admitted into labor unions at all recently a philip randolph called for a crusade to desgregate the southern aflcio state conventions and city central bodies and stated that this is a problem probably not less significant or difficult than the desegregation of public schools in the south there is a deep distrust among many negro wage earners and others within the negro community toward trade unions it is a distrust well founded on experience for today as in the past there is a profound disparity between the public image presented by the national aflcio and the daytoday realities as experienced by many negro workers this is true in the north as well as in the south there are some few exceptions especially in the mass production industries where historically there has been a large concentration of negro workers and in some unions such as the united automobile workers uaw and the united packing house workers upw where there is an ideological sensitivity to the negro question but for the negro in major areas of the economy in the building and construction trades the railroad industry among the boilermakers oil and chemical workers and machinists in pulp tobacco and paper manufacturing in metal working in the printing trades and in many other industries highly unionized for a long period of time trade union practices are characterized by a broad pattern of discrimination and segregation the pattern of union responsibility for job discrimination against negroes is not limited to any one area of the country or to some few industries or union jurisdictions but involves many unions in a wide variety of occupations in manufacturing industries skilled crafts railroads and in maritime trades as for example the seafarers international union which operates union controlled hiring halls on great lakes ports such as duluth chicago detroit buffalo and cleveland over the years negro members of the seafarers international union have repeatedly protested the systematic practice of dispatching negroes for menial jobs only as mess boys in the galley but to no avail as the union continues discriminatory job assignments in its hiring halls on occasion after much protest one or two negroes have been admitted into an allwhite local union as token compliance with a state or municipal fair employment practices law as with the international brotherhood of electrical workers in cleveland the bricklayers in milwaukee the railway clerks in minneapolis but this is essentially a limited and strategic adjustment to community pressure and represents very dubious progress after six years of protest and the threat of legal action by the attorney general ibew local in washington d c gave one negro a temporary work permit the ibew in most cases excludes negroes from membership in the key local unions having jurisdiction in construction installation thus because ibew local in washington refuses membership to nonwhite persons negroes were prevented from working on the construction of the aflcio national headquarters building the new house of representatives office building and other public and private construction in the nations capital local remains a lilywhite union there are also many instances where unions have removed the lilywhite exclusion clause from their constitution as a public relations gesture but continue to exclude negroes from membership by tacit consent as long as union membership remains a condition of employment in many trades and crafts and qualified negroes are barred from union membership solely because of their color then trade union discrimination is the decisive factor in determining whether negro workers in a given industry shall have an op portunity to earn a living for themselves and their families this is especially true in the construction industry where aflcio building trades unions exercise a high degree of control over access to employment in the south and especially in alabama and georgia this situation is further compounded by the fact that white citizens councils and the ku klux klan began taking control of some important aflcio affiliates soon after the supreme court school segregation decision in following the federations practice of avoiding internal conflict on racial issues these local unions have been permitted to become virtual extensions of segregationist organizations white citizens councils kkk and other racist organizations make no secret of their recruitment activities among union members negro members have only to read the local newspapers in montgomery and savannah the ku klux klan advertises its meetings in the carpenters union hall and in these two cities as well as in others officials of several building trades unions are known klansmen newspapers have also printed reports and pictures of union officials speaking at white citizens councils and klan meetings and the point has hardly been lost on the negro worker during the yearlong negro bus boycott in montgomery alabama leaders of the montgomery building trades council and of the montgomery bus drivers union repeatedly led the attacks against the negro community and on several occasions were identified as klansmen in macon georgia the klan meets in a local union hall and has repeatedly intervened on behalf of white workers where there have been grievances filed by negroes alleging violation of seniority and other rights by white workers in savannah the carpenters union hall is the central headquarters for the white citizens council and is so listed in newspaper ads placed by the council the same situation obtains in lithonia georgia where the kkk and the stonecutters union share the same meeting hall no wonder then that negro workers throughout the south feel increasingly alienated from organized labor recently they have shown this by voting against union certification in several significant elections conducted by the national labor relations board aflcio affiliated unions engage in four categories of discriminatory racial practices these are outright exclusion of negroes segregated locals separate racial seniority lines in collective bargaining agreements exclusion of negroes from apprenticeship training programs controlled by unions the brotherhood of railway and steamship clerks which operates many segregated local lodges in northern as well as southern cities is among the important international unions responsible for a i broad national pattern of segregation in the brotherhood the existence of more than segregated allnegro locals with separate racial seniority rosters limits job mobility and violates the seniority rights of thousands of negro union members this union has persisted in its racist practices despite repeated protests from negro workers and community organizations on april the new york state commission against discrimination ordered the merger of the lilywhite george m harrison lodge and the allnegro friendship lodge the white union refused to comply and the local lodges remain segregated to this day similar situations exist in chicago where negro workers are in segregated local lodge and in tulsa oklahoma where they are in local lodge in east st louis and st louis there are allcolored lodges and allwhite lodges which function through segregated joint councils ironically the president of the brotherhood of railway and steamship clerks george m harrison is a member of the civil_rights committee of the aflcio and a federation vice president soon after the merger of the afl and cio in two international unions were admitted into the federation with lilywhite exclusion clauses in their constitutions although this action was clearly in violation of the policies an nounced at the time of the merger agreement they were the brotherhood of railroad trainmen which later removed the clause and the international brotherhood of locomotive firemen and enginemen which did not in november the brotherhood of locomotive firemen and enginemen successfully defended its exclusion of negroes from union membership in a suit brought by negro firemen against the union in the federal district court in cincinnati ohio oliphant vs brotherhood of locomotive firemen and enginemen despite many appeals the national aflcio refused to intervene or make any public comment and this union continues to exclude all negroes from membership on october negro workers in st petersburg florida and memphis tennessee filed affidavits with the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity against the brotherhood of railway trainmen aflcio in these complaints it was charged that the trainmens union conspired with the atlantic coast line railroad and with the st louissan francisco railroad company as well as with other railroads to have all negro brakemen classified as porters that competent negro railway workers are consistently denied opportunities for promotion and advancement that because of improper job classification they are discrimi nated against in wages and that the brotherhood of railroad trainmen a union that is authorized and recognized by the atlantic coast line railroad is a lilywhite union and that said union accepts only white employees as members obviously when the brothererhood of railroad trainmen removed the caucasian only clause from its constitution in this was done mainly for public relations purposes since the union continues in most cities to exclude qualified negro railroad employees separate lines of seniority promotion constitute yet another injustice to the negro worker these are negotiated into collective bargaining agreements effectively denying negroes equal seniority rights with white workers and preventing them from developing skills the result is that negroes are unable to rise from unskilled and menial jobs into more desirable classifications negro workers employed at the sheffield steel company in houston texas were forced to initiate litigation against the united steelworkers of america and the company and as a result succeeded in eliminating the most extreme features of the separate seniority lines in the union contract very slow and isolated progress has been made in a few other instances as a result of protest by negro workers and action by the naacp nevertheless the fact remains that the pattern of such discrimination remains practically intact in southern industrial operations where trade unions hold collective bargaining agreements many thousands of negro workers who are members of aflcio unions in southern paper mills chemical plants pulp works oil refineries steel plants and in tobacco factories suffer the acute disadvantage of separate lines of progression in lake charles louisiana for example the metal trades department of the aflcio is directly responsible for negotiating such clauses in its union contracts with several major oil and chemical refineries collusion with management in regard to unequal seniority rights is common typical offenders in the rapidly growing paper manufacturing and pulp and sulphite industry in the south are to be found at the huge union bagcamp paper corporation savannah georgia where all the negro workers are limited to membership in two segregated locals local and affiliated to the international brotherhood of pulp sulphite and paper mill workers all white workers hold membership in local and of the same union and local of the united papermakers and paperworkers union similar conditions exist at and in virtually every plant organized in the south by the united papermakers and paperworkers union and the international brotherhood of pulp sulphite and paper mill workers in these and many other paper mills throughout the south these two unions hold joint collective bargaining agreements and maintain a rigid pattern of racially segregated local unions with separate seniority lines limiting negro employment to laborer classifications the harmful consequences of rapid technological change and automation upon the unskilled negro wage earner is compounded by the exclusion of negroes from apprenticeship training programs because there exists a disproportionate number of negroes in the unskilled labor force a disproportionate number of negroes are being permanently dismissed from jobs as a result of automation and other technological change it follows that the plight of these unskilled negroes can become an economic disaster for the entire negro community where these workers are not permitted to learn new skills ie where they are excluded from apprenticeship programs and other forms of technical training such exclusion is widespread in the north as well as in the south according to recent studies no significant breakthrough has been made by negroes in those craft unions in the building trades or in the railroad operating brotherhood which have traditionally excluded nonwhites in the tenyear period from in the state of new york the increase of negro participation in building trades apprenticeship training programs rose only from to in most of these programs the role of the labor union is decisive because the trade union usually determines who is admitted into the training programs and therefore who is admitted into the union almost equally exclusive are the printing trades unions with exceptions being found in some areas of the assistant printing pressmens union and the lithographers union open access to plumbing and pipe fitting apprenticeships controlled by the plumbers union is a rare experience for a young negro in the north as well as in the south similarly negro youth are almost completely excluded from apprenticeship programs operated by the sheet metal workers union the ornamental and structural iron workers the glass workers the tile setters the machinists and the bricklayers union the exclusion of negroes from apprenticeship programs controlled by aflcio craft unions prevents thousands of young people from realizing their full potential and dooms them and their families to a marginal existence it is in this area of apprenticeship training that the disparity between the public relations pronouncements of the aflcio on civil_rights and the daytoday reality for negro workers is most sharply delineated many traditional sources of negro employment the nations railroads and massproduction in dustries for example are rapidly disappearing as a result of automation and other technological changes in the economy today the status of the negro wage earner is characterized by drastic change and crisis thus the virtual exclusion of negroes from apprenticeship and other training programs forces them to remain as marginal employees in the economy they are the ones who are hired last and who can be dispensed with easily with the added advantage that their displacement can be rationalized in terms of lower attainments in craft skills the concentration of unskilled lowpaying jobs with a lack of employment stability together with other income limitations such as denial of access to union hiring halls in the building trades and separate racial lines of seniority promotion in collective bargaining agreements all contribute to an explanation of why negroes constitute a permanently depressed economic group in american society in the dramatic and historic conflicts in little rock in front royal virginia in tuscaloosa in montgomery and elsewhere organized labor did not meaningfully intervene on the side of the embattled negroes all too often local labor groups were involved with the white citizens council or the ku klux klan this fact has not been overlooked by the negro leadership and by the entire negro community whose views on organized labor are not based on any theoretical assumptions about a mythical trade union movement but are rooted in the painful realities of daytoday trade union practices of course pious resolutions proclaiming shock and dismay were adopted at labor gatherings in washington miami and new york but no action of any consequence was taken where it really mattered instead when confronted with their conservative and donothing record by negroes the labor leadership invariably responds with hostility or crass paternalism as they privately explain that these negroes are going too fast and after all they should appreciate what we are doing for them the negro is now making the same demands upon organized labor that are being made upon all other institutions and it is certain that the attacks upon racism within trade unions will proceed with the same intensity as against other groups in the community the negro struggle is emerging as the really important and decisive issue of conflict and confrontation throughout the united states and it may be well that the fight of negroes for equal treatment and leadership responsibility within trade unions will become the basis of a renewed effort for internal union democracy and for a halt to further stagnation and decay the protest against racism within organized labor may become the rallying point for the regeneration of the american labor movement if this is to occur it will be the responsibility of the best elements among white trade unionists to join with negroes and vigorously support their demands but for the moment it is evident that the aflcio and all other institutions will be judged by the negro on the basis of their actual daytoday performance and not on the exercise of empty ritual the black anglosaxons to any large j tjtjjtt l city in the united vv states and look for that section where more than per cent of the population is nativeborn when once you have found that section you may safely assume that you are smack dab in the negro ghetto ask the names of the people you meet and you will note that the anglosaxon names now extantjackson brown and johnsonare pretty much the property of the negro inhabitants this is just one of the cues to the identity of a curious but littleknown classblack anglosaxonsnow flourishing in american society if you now proceed until you come to the better negro dwellings known as the homes of the high class or the biggity you will find yourself at last amid the black anglosaxons proper though not all of the high class belong to this tribe black anglosaxons are such chiefly in that in their natural struggle to throw off the smothering blanket of social inferiority they exaggeratedly seek to sever their own historical and social past in order better to assume that of the biological descendants of the anglosaxons they relate to and long to be a part of the elusive and hostile white world whose norms are taken as models of emulation likewise the white world is to them a looking glass for taking stock of their personal behavior they acquire in this way what sociologists call a looking glass self an image they must keep on grooming to make what they think the white society thinks they are accord with what they themselves would like to be more and more like whites for several years now in diverse localities throughout the country i have been subjecting members of this group to casual but intensive observation i have watched them close up in their private lives for many were and are close friends relatives and neighbors as well as in public places from both the private and the public perspective i discovered that black anglosaxons fall into typical categories the imagemakers imagemakers are dithered by their belief that all negroes have to do to break down discrimination is impress the white community with proper public manners and the sincerity of the negroes quest for integration they are constantly fearful lest whites think they are prejudiced against whites or have a preference for negro companionship thus it is more or less mandatory for negroes to spread out when in an integrated gathering to keep whites present from thinking we segregate ourselves points of worry for imagemakers may crop up in many facets of their lives while such groups as italians boast of their spaghetti and meatballs for example negro imagemakers may privately consume huge quantities of lowincome southern foods but disown the practice in public many imagemakers will never buy watermelons when white persons are in sight and i have seen them sit in restaurants mouths watering at unsuspecting whites seated before large red slices of melon which the imagemakers long for but cant bring themselves to buy chitterlings likewise are a basis for hypocrisy although some of the best chitterlings still are to be found in negro kitchens the black anglosaxon housewife typically seeks to hide her appetite for them most take extreme pains to safeguard knowledge of their menu from neighbors this is especially so in integrated apartment dwellings such other staples as mustard greens and blackeyed peas also are privately enjoyed but publicly shunned before whites the mimics or copycats close kin of the imagemakers mimics are especially prevalent among school teachers and white collar workers they chronically mimic white mannerisms in the quest for a feeling of similarity or closeness to their white ideal a white accent for example is to them honorific because it is taken to represent a high degree of association with the better class of whites in the effort to talk like a white person mimics effect a snarl or twang imitative of whites when talking publicly or to strangers though if you listen long enough you are likely to hear an i pronounced ah plus other telltale signs of their lowly southern origins this enthusiasm for aping white behavior pervades the most personal intimacies of their lives married mimics for example are prone to hold up white men or white women as ideals to their mates when a male mimics wife does something that bothers him he is likely to tell her wouldnt nothing do that but a colored woman by the same token when a female mimic is peeved by her spouse she also talks about his heredity or makes the declaration that his type is no account in general anyway the cultured with the increasing value of education in society and the rising educational attainment of negroes the importance of the college degree has soared to the highest some social scientists detect a degree class those individuals who derive their prestige from the sole fact that they hold degrees but inasmuch as such persons typically are employed as school teachers social workers and church pastors their salaries are often lower than such uneducated negroes as the steel mill hands this leads to some dilemmas and resentments every janitor for example has found it necessary at some time or another to tell off some of the high class tenants for trying to boss him around the degree class is seldom interested in scholarly matters however except superficially books in fact would seldom enter their homes were it not for bookofthemonth clubs even this is no guarantee that the books will be read yet those of the homeowning variety are beginning to acquire studies usually equipped with plush bar facilities relaxing couch and a small book stand conspicuously placed and containing a couple of shelves of textbooks salvaged from college days the chief activities performed in these studies are drinking cat naps and lounging called relaxing in that order at a typical house party of educators a budding discussion will quickly disperse the inhabitants of one room into another where they may resume their efforts to learn the latest teenage dance crazes such as the madison the twist and the chachacha it is true that the twist has demonstrated some capacity for arousing the energies of most negro and white adults but its acceptance by the whites is taken by the black anglosaxon as an irreproachable justification for his own enthusiasm was she a negro or an old white man really made me mad today thus many are able to grow up and take pleasure in the boast that they never knew there was a difference made between negroes and whites until they got grown or reached the age of say or was going on in general the secluded seem to think that the sooner they forget they are negroes the sooner whites will too the foregoing are by no means all of the categories but all have in common an almost pathetic clamor to gain acceptance in the general american society perhaps subsequent to the day when this has been accomplished the black anglosaxon too will disappear from the north american scene the secret storm as she looked at the y magnificent peace roses which centered the speakers table dr gale claren guest of honor fought down an impulse to reach out and pull off a leaf just

words longern my arm longern my arm galey and dont you never quit learnin other people neither dont never quit inborn love of learning indeed gale smiled thinking inborn love of showing off inborn love of being called a great woman a flash bulb went off and there was her smile ready for the morning newspapers thunder shook through the room and echoed sickeningly in gales heart we aint poor white trash grannie used to say course we aint quality white folks neither but we aint white trash and we aint black trashhow fiercely she used to add thatwe aint black trash what goes to lying and cheating and stealing galey not never recollections of her aged grandmother were no longer steadying like tearing winds thought of the picture which would be in the morning newspapers and of the caption which would appear under it shattered gale almost moaned aloud oh grannie grannie there are ways of lying and cheating that you never even dreamed of and i can not bear it i can not bear it seeking shelter in her program gale saw that the next speaker was dr everson harvey head of the psychology department at rogers junior college she knew what he would say he would stress the fact that dr claren had built her whole approach to the handling of problem children on love that she had built it on love when this was considered a new approach the storms within her quieted gale found a moments peace in thinking of the many magazine articles and books she had written on love of the speeches she had made and the tv and radio programs on which she had appeared all giving love as the answer the only answer to interpersonal relationships to interpersonal conflict and because dr claren has so firmly established her own life on love said dr harvey because hers has been so deeprooted so outwardreaching so abounding a love this amazing woman has overcome almost insurmountable obstacles dr harveys words slashed through gales broken defenses so well she knew that the love on which her life had been built was a limited loveif indeed it could be called love at all she wondered when did i turn into poor lying black trash when did i lose grannie and grannies teachings andgrannies god when did i starthating she could not remember any hatred within her until after grannie died and the family had come north then over her parents vigorous protests gale had begun walking four miles to attend the nearest high school that first fall a civic group had sponsored an essay contest subject democracy and she had won gale had won first prize five dollars gale now wondered could a little halfstarved colored girl have meant prizewinning words on democracy at any rate she had received the five dollars and along with it a bitter piece of knowledge no mention of the prize was made at the high school convocation no mention of it later in the school paper no mention at all this gale now realized must have been the beginning of her hate the smiles she saw that next saturday as she spent her incredible fortune at the methodist rummage sale must have added something to that hate amused smiles followed her about as she picked out a purple sweater for her mother a plaid wool suspender outfit for her threeyearold sister a white shirtgood all but the cuffsfor her father to wear on sundays shoes for her two brothers measured so carefully by paper patterns she had made by tracing their wornthrough soles and for herself a cerise silk blouse amazingly like the sleazy silk dress which tonights young singer was wearing so very faint were these beginnings of hate that they might never have grown at all if it had not been for the drama festival gale had been chosen for the cast of a play written and directed by a prominent society matron of the town after several private presentations of the play the authordirectors friends persuaded her to try entering her prodigies in the city drama festival gale felt tears sting her eyes as she remembered those wonderful weeks of rehearsal and the final tea given for their allnegro cast by what her grandmother would have called quality white folks pink candles in silver candelabra bluebells and heather and pink roses in a silver bowl a tablecloth with lace squares set into it and knights in armour worked right into the lace sandwiches with the crusts cut clear off arranged on silver trays and the quality white folks treating five young negroes treating little galey morton in her rummage sale blouselike equals she remembered the applause as the curtain had gone down on their play at the drama festival the festival was now wholly superimposed on the present banquet scene gale once more heard the judge who was her high school civics teacher commenting briefly on each of the ten competing plays this play with its allnegro cast she said of theirs this play is the best example i have ever seen of stage presence under difficult circumstances i am sure none of you realized that the babys crying and having to be taken off stage was not in the script or that all four ad libbed until cynthia gales name in the play could return with the quieted baby or that cynthia herself ad libbed the team work and the stage presence of the entire cast was amazing to say nothing of their acting i think we all recognize that this play was of professional not amateur standing and the people those white people had clapped until it seemed they would never stop is it that remembered burst of applause or this present clapping which now hurts my ears gale wondered and is it that remembered hate or what that hate has grown into which now engulfs me for after the intermission when the winning play was to be announced a man came out to report that the judge had taken suddenly ill and that honors would have to be announced through the newspapers the toastmaster of the banquetthe young ymca leader with the yellow crewcut scraped back his chair as he rose gale welcomed his bringing her back to the present occasion after all nothing said here could hurt like these memories he was speaking again about race prejudice saying it was time for all americans to wake up and see the writing on the wall gales sick thoughts flooded back to the past little galey morton at fourteen for all that she looked scarcely ten saw the morning newspapers writing on the wall their play was not first not second but honorable mention the paper went on to say that the first prize would represent the city in the state finals the second serve as alternate gale remembered the two plays she remembered the small amount of applause they had called forth she remembered hate hate over being pushed back into place unfairly hate over knowing why hate centering on her teacher who tried next day to explain that a baby in the cast made their play too risky to represent the city in the state finals hate that made a little colored girl gather up her school books and take them home hate that made her burn them in the rusty potbellied stove hate that kept her from eating from sleeping hate that finally sent her back to school determined to show them hate that grew and grew on to the day when after crying a long night through over a telegram which regretted young lieutenant clarens death in combat gale had gone to take her senior college examinationsgone on a city bus where two women were loudly objecting to niggers being allowed gale clarens life built on love oh no she thought sickly built on hate for anyone and for anything and for everything which hurts my people and if my life has been built on hateas it has then it means that all these speeches and awards are false and that i myself am nothing but a lie personified soon this evening this unbearable evening which has been so much worse than i could have dreamed will be over soon can stop smiling and pretending to listen soon i can go home and put my yellow orchids in the refrigerator lay away my lace dinner gown get into bed and maybemaybe sleep but first she must listen to the old baptist preacher of the small church which still held her membership her nominal membership he had seemed to her an old man a very old man all those years ago when she had first come north stooped shoulders and wisps of kinky white hair making him into a caricature of the uncle tom in the stowe novel he came slowly and painfully to stand before the microphone will he be able to live through a speech gale wondered and will i be able to live through whatever he may say he he used to know me so well the good book the old man began in his quavering voice the good book talks about folks who are fruitless trees and waterless clouds and wild waves of the sea it says they walk in the way of cain brother jude tells all about them and he knew he knew them fruitless trees wouldnt never go to bearing any fruits of the spirit he knew that gale had forgotten the dramatic force of the man if she had ever thought about him at all it was with the sentimental nostalgia that looks back to remembered pleasures of early adolescence now with profound shock she realized that this aged man held in his hands the poetry and the dramayes and the wisdomwhich could move her as no other speaker of the evening had almost too late it came to her that she scarcely dared to listen and be torn anew by the things he might say but the old preacher was now saying nothing a strange silence made the room tense something tightened in gale something of fear which was greater than the dread of what this kindly man might say in alarm she lifted her eyes and looked into his face for a long moment they studied each other then he began speaking his voice slightly stronger the room was so quiet that every syllable could be heard plainly jesus talked about folks just like brother jude did in his little new testament book only jesus called them fruitless waterlesscloud folks serpents and vipers he said woe to you right to them might of sounded to them like hate but it werent it werent hate it were love love what plumb broke jesus heart cause he ended up all them woe to yous by wanting to gather them dumb deaf blind clucks right up under his own wings like a mama hen gathers her chickies together again the old man stopped someone handed him a glass of water slowly his hand trembling he took a few sips the storm outside had quieted quietly the crowded ballroom waited until the man who had so long ministered to the church which dr claren had attended as a child could again minister to the banquet guests setting the glass down gently close to the magnificent peace roses the old minister smiled his black face radiant as he again started to speak his voice rang out strong it were love all right it were jesus own kind of loving and its love when you hate meanness what treats folks mean its love when you hates injustice what treats folks unjust you aint hating folks you is just hating what keeps folks from being fruitfullike in this hungry starvin world and we in this room has to go out and love all the folks who dont agree with what we been saying here we has to do it we has to love them most powerfully cause they dont know they is waterless clouds and fruitless trees and wandering stars they dont know so we just got to love em the old mans voice strengthened but it cant be any weak soft love what darent even think up a woe to you its got to be a big love cause god wants all them wrongthinkin folks gathered up under his own loving wings till they grow up and get a mite bigger and learn how to be fruitfullike tears came into gale clarens eyes she made no effort to brush them away though she saw a photographer turning his camera toward her this aged preacher had probably never seen a psychology book how gale wondered could he know that she was one of the millions who despite their learning have never learned that hatred of injustice is love she reached for her goblet the water was no longer cold not even cool not cool and refreshing like the water her grandmother used to draw from the old well when she saw little galey morton come running from school if grannie were here gale thought she would be whispering to me loudly she would be saying what you been so feared about galey you aint never been no lying cheating trash child you just been learning so many words longern my arm that you has plumb forgot the rightsome meaning of some of the short words like lovei thats all you done the young y secretary was help ing the aged preacher back to his seat the things gale knew her grandmother would be saying if she were there rushed on youre a smart woman galey a powerful smart woman but you aint fooled god none cant nobody fool god all this time all this long time gods knowed you was nothing but a mixedup child hes knowed you was turning from him cause you hated what some of his childruns was doing to some of his other childruns but you aint a hating woman galey you couldnt never be a hating woman you listen and mind what that preacher just got done saying child and youll get along all right gale leaned forward so that she could smile down the table smile into the eyes of the aged minister then she smiled into the eyes of the girl whose singing had been balm a quieted rain touched the long windows of the ballroom as the words of the song came back blind unbelief is sure to err and scan his work in vain god is his own interpreter and he will make it plain gale reached out and gently snipped a leaf from one of the lovely peace roses which centered the speakers table for fun and profit i like nutty nifties because and for just words or less on that why you could be set for life a fortune a dream house a luxury car or maybe a trip around the world may be waiting for just a little effort on your part are you one of the people who enter contests every year a slogan a statement a name for a new product the last line to a jingle or the solution of a puzzle these are gateways to a possible good fortune and pleasant surprise each year there are hundreds of new contests each year millions of ordinary people enter and keep an enthusiastic eye out for the mail man chances are that even if you havent entered any contests lately that you have sometime in the past or will in the future contesting is truly americas leading hobby and its followers are increasing daily some of these hobbyists are just dreamers but others are hardworking sticktoit hopefuls who study plan and prepare entries that have a betterthanaverage chance of success in which class are you or maybe youre one of the scoffers you think no judge could possibly read so many entries its just a matter of chance and you were never lucky anyway its all a lot of bunk you dont believe they really give away all that money and so on well let the choice of whether youll enjoy the great american pastime contesting be yours but rest your mind on one point the contests except a very few tried by getrichquick smalltimers that are soon caught are honest they have to be the united states postal service is used in most of these and its a dangerous business to use the mails to defraud naturally the sponsor expects to profit far more than the cost of the contest by increasing his business volume with the contest publicity the box tops that accompany each entry calls for new sales of his product he also hopes to discover new ideas in your entries that will give him a direction for his future advertising as he learns what facts about his merchandise is making the greatest hit with his consumers so business firms and charities have found that contests are a paying form of advertising from to million dollars is spent each year on commercial contests to the mutual satisfaction of the sponsors and contestants contests are a definite part of our great give away system and have many supporters who judges these contests some few commercial firms and charities judge their own but most of the big contests are judged by professional judging agencies such as advertising distributors of america spotts mailing corporation reuben h donnelley corporation r l polk company bruce richards corporation and lloyd herrold company of course each judging agency has its own preferences and own tabus for winning and losing entries but in general they all have somewhat the same standards rules must be obeyed or the entry is automatically disqualified some reasons for disqualifying are no address given not mailed within the time limit too many words failure to include box top or other qualifier no rhyme when required following the rules eliminates at least half your competition fancy decorated entries are disliked and considered a form of bribery originality is prized after all if most entries are alike all cannot win so all must be eliminated aptness and sincerity are words that are usually included in all judging requirements what do they mean actually they mean that you sincerely gave the product a trial then truthfully describe its benefits to you one box of cake mix may seem the same as another but if you try the sponsors product you may discover that the result is a finer texture the taste richer and more buttery by trying the product you wont risk insincerity by describing qualities that are not true aptness and sincerity can be guided by reading the sponsors ads and wording on the label and then trying the merchandise and reporting the benefit these values have to you personally dont be a phony just be you the result will be the originality and individuality that the sponsor is looking for many contestants become discouraged when they do not win immediately so they do not try more than once or twice then quit they tend to slap off an entry carelessly inviting failure to win with such a haphazard sort of preparation would be like a sweepstakes chance however people do win who are they they are the small percentage who love the pastime keep enthusiastic in spite of failures they try as many contests as they can constantly working to improve contesting techniques attitude is a big factor in whether you will enjoy contesting as a hobby and also whether you will win believe in each entry and in yourself make each entry the best you can do mail it forget it and try some more bitterness discouragement or resentment of others good luck in winning will only block your thinking processes and make you bog down and quit keep your hope and courage up for high creativity by realizing that its a waste of time to be resentful for something you cannot help use that energy to improve your future entries by studying them for weaknesses and comparing them with the winners every winner after years of discouragement invariably declares im glad i kept trying if you give up youve got nothing for sure but if you keep trying youre sure to win eventually one contest fan in tampa florida never owned a television until she won two in contests walked for her groceries until she won a bicycle then rode the bike till she won an automobile now she says shes dreaming of air transportation and is just waiting for some sponsor to stage a contest with a helicopter as a prize dont ever give up says one prize winner recently after she was awarded a total of her first win after three years of contesttrying one woman in massachusetts won a trip for two to florida just after her husband was recovering from pneumonia it couldnt have come at a better time and to think i was almost too busy and discouraged to even try that contest im sure glad i did you too can be a winner some helpful suggestions gleaned from the writers own experience and that of others are given here perhaps the most important thing is to fall in love with words words can make you laugh cry buy or reject they can paint a bright picture or draw a blank get the dictionary habit just browse through and read word definitions when you read maga zines or newspapers read the ads and underscore picture words try to see what the advertiser is trying to do can you forget buywords like happy go lucky dont let your hands tell time selling hand lotion thick and tired of a bad fit foundation garments bewitching stitching swim suits strong legs run that weak legs may walk football game benefiting crippled children words and phrases like these did not come with careless thinking they came from a love of words and a study of wordcombinations words are keys to emotion and emotion is the key to prizewinning entries and forceful advertising wilfred funk suggests the following as the most beautiful words in the english language chimes dawn golden hush lullaby luminous melody mist murmuring tranquil starting with these make a list of your own list hopeful words fear words bouncing action words glad words sad words from advertising list picture phrases that may spark your own mind into more original directions familiar phrases and famous quotations can be used by changing them to suit the sponsors product or to create an entirely new meaning start such a list now of all these you can recall such as home is where the heart is honesty is the best policy make hay while the sun shines seeing is believing etc im sure you can recognize clever reversals of these old sayings in many ads today you can do the same or use them to start other ideas of your own in statement and name contests try making up words by using two or more words fused together like applelicious from apple and delicious in naming a pie or pudding a winning flower name was coined by fusing the words memory and florescent into memorescent in one contest entrants were required to name a bicycle that came equipped with a radio some of the winning names were chattercycle airolympic and audioflyer a winner of a statement contest in describing the whitening advantages of a detergent wrote gone are the ghosts of yestergray this was legitimate borrowing that made an original expression of the sponsors product finally to sum up try many contests all you can find time for then forget each one and go on to others newspapers magazines radio tv and special contest publications all announce current contests obey all rules strictly work hard over all entries if it comes too easy then reject it as ordinary and rework it into something different and outstanding use strong picture words and action verbs use the sponsors product read his advertising be honest be yourself slanted to his needs and yours keep copies of all entries you might be able to rework a loser into a winner in another direction keep an idea file or notebook include unique ads titles pictures sayings phrases anything that may put a spark into a sluggish brain wake it up and start the ideas flowing get a good dictionary a rhyming dictionary a volume of familiar quotations and a thesaurus there are books on contesting techniques you may find at your local library contesting magazines on the newsstands and several schools that teach the subject by mail its a big business for many people no one of course should or could plan on making a living wholly by contesting but as a hobby few fields are more challenging so heres to you come on in the funs fine keep hopeful keep trying keep enthusiastic youll make it the odds are with you but if you fail youve had a lot of fun who did you say you were it was a miserable day for flying cold windy and the threat of rain xhe whole trip had been a flop my business had gone badly even though i had spent the entire weekend away from home in order to get it

had the good sense to stay aground i wouldnt have to worry but then i was pretty anxious to get home anyway i was just raising my glass for the third sip when a voice came booming in my ear so loudly that it was paralyzing i sat arm upraised glass frozen in midair hey i know you the southern accented voice said as the blue eyes studied me carefully youre the fellow that sings those songs in a

came to me jimmy durante huh no oh ive got it nowdr cary middlecoff no no he protested my name is garry moore fatty arbuckle i called louder as i was heading out the door prince ranier dwight d eisenhower by thomas fuller she was the unlikeliest s of heroes there she jj was young and comese a ly as trim and chic as a model in a magazine advertisement at the most prosaic it was easy to picture her as a youthful matron dainty and decorative waiting in her wellappointed home for the man who adored her to come in from his labors when the little rock crisis reached fever pitch in the fall of and people across the world were wondering about the woman called daisy bates writers were turning out reams of copy in an effort to describe her in her native arkansas of course she was pictured as a firebreathing redlining witch and called every vile name printable and a few names which in a truly civilized society are not printable at all but other writers were more objective seeking to satisfy the curiosity about the woman who had turned the nation upside down a united press correspondent described daisy bates as a businesslike woman of and went on in a kind of awe to list the measurements of her slim figure she wears her black hair in a casual bob sometimes covering part of her forehead he wrote adding newsmen find little trouble talking to her for readers of the minneapolis tribune the famed negro journalist carl t rowan was more to the point actually she is a typical negro housewifedifferent from the average american woman perhaps primarily in that she prefers poker to bridge and has become expert with a rifle inherent in rowans description is the suggestion that had the wanton finger of fate pointed at many another negro woman the results would have been pretty much the same there is nothing in this suggestion to detract from the extraordinary achievement of daisy lee bates rather there is something in it of commendation for all the millions of negro women who have borne with uncommon fortitude the burden of their cultures cruelty and of their mens helpless despair if daisy bates is typical of her kind then she proved a splendid example never once in her long and barbarous ordeal was there a public moment of faltering or retreat if there had not been private ones then she would have been more than human and daisy bates is very human indeed on september the day the segregationists refer to as black monday mrs bates came closest to losing her extraordinary calm the vicious mobs had forced the nine negro children from central high school state police had just intercepted a caravan of some cars loaded with enough explosives to dynamite half the city as it neared the bates home and the threat of violence hung like a living thing over the whole state in the tense stillness of the night the phone rang in the bates home and when she answered it an obscene voice spoke in her ear we have just had our first killing in little rock and you are responsible there will be more before day my heart stood still mrs bates recalls i thought of mr eckford the father of elizabeth one of the nine children returning home from his night job i could envision him being shot down and at the same time i pictured governor faubus gloating in his illfamed glory faith deserted her in that moment i became bitter for the first time i hated everything for which america stood i hated these people who had as much as burned the u s constitution when they put fiery crosses on our lawn i hated the socalled liberals who were too afraid of their social positions to speak out clearly and firmly most of all i hated the frightened and complacent negro of the south and the contented negro of the north i walked into my bedroom and cried how much can a people stand i think that in that moment if i could have lifted the cotton curtain and walked through it to the iron curtain that i would have done so without looking back as these things were going through my mind was praying then something seemed to say to me you cannot spend your time hating you must work and have faith when the report of murder was finally checked and proved to be false i felt like a person who had been given a new lease on life daisy bates did not ask for fame what she sought was indeed what millions of other negro women seekthe freedom for their loved ones which is their birthright as americans simply that specifically as president of the arkansas branches of the naacp she asked that the negro children of her community be permitted to attend without stigma the public schools of the city of little rock and for this she found herself in the eye of a racist hurricane the lady from little rock was first catapulted into the international spotlight on the terrible morning in september when supported by nothing but her courageshe shepherded the nine teenagers through a howling mob of whites to confront a contingent of hostile national guardsmen with orders to bar the children from the white high school it was an incredible and beautiful thing that procession here were nine children scarcely into puberty facing in their tender youth all the ugly madness of rampant racism and facing it with a dignity that was as old and as proud as the human race and here was the woman who had inspired them who had shown them by her example that a human being is not a beast that there is something in a man stronger and more meaningful than the bombs in his hands and the hatred in his heart but though the outside world first heard of daisy bates after that day she had long been a familiar personage in her native state she had arrived in little rock a very young bride with her newspaper publishing husband back in and from the beginning from her vantage point on the weekly state press she had waged war on bigotry with her husband she had worked to inform the negro people of their rights and to urge the white people to respect these rights the state press had been active in prodding the city of little rock to hire negro policemen the paper had been in the forefront of the movement for peaceful integration of the state university law and medical schools long before the supreme courts desegregation ruling and it was inevitable that the weekly would urge speedy compliance with the supreme courts edict daisy bates had long been active in the naacp and a year before the desegregation ruling she was named president of all the branches in the state had there been willing and capable local leadership she would have left the job to others but there was none she stepped in requested compliance of the school boards counselled the parents of the negro children and filed suits against public officials when all else failed it was obvious that the white people of little rock had no wish to obey the national law and it was equally obvious that the courts had no alternative but to compel compliance the final clash was between the power of orval faubus the defiant governor and that of the federal courts on the morning when daisy bates and the nine children walked up to central high school faubus had called out the national guard to turn them back nearly three weeks later acting at last president eisenhower inducted the guardsmen into federal service and sent officers and men of the st airborne division into the city to enforce the courts decision when the children the next day marched off once more to central high school things had changed the mobs were still there spitting and cursing but the danger was gone the children were escorted by paratroopers who made it very clear that they were on the side of the law and that the law was on the side of the negro children for everyone concerned the first stage of the battle was over the negro children did not have to fear the white hoodlums who jeered at them along the streets but they still had to exercise superhuman care and restraint inside the school the racist mobs knew that they had lost but they are poor losers and they shifted their tactics to boycott harassment and terror it did not matter that there were so many others who agreed with the mobs or that they were in high places their numbers and their eminence served only to illustrate how widespread was their affliction and to what tragic extent their disease had been indulged by the nation of course the children were too young to understand this they knew only that they were in the right and that those who abused them were somehow more in need of help than they but daisy bates knew she had after a fashion experienced it all before and she would more than likely experience it all again in the year that followed the morning that the nine children safely went off to school without her daisy bates knew peace only on those occasions when she was away from little rock her phone rang incessantly crosses were burned on her lawn torches were tossed on her roof shots were fired through her house and the big picture window in her living room was broken so often that she finally gave up having it repaired she endured it she also endured the gradual but steady economic pressure on her husbands newspaper that drove the paper out of business and her husband to financial ruin advertisers withdrew and circulation dropped and finally the publisher was forced to vacate the building that housed his plant there were times when mr and mrs l c for lucius christopher bates felt they had been licked at last that those who had schemed to drive them out of little rock had won then for a while sympathetic people from all over the country rallied to their side renewing their hope during those frantic months daisy bates received the avid applause of negroes everywhere and the moral support of people all over the world including some white people among her numerous citations and tokens of recognition is the coveted spingarn medal awarded jointly to her and the nine brave children whom she served as mentor but as so often happens the public soon forgot school integration was an accomplished fact in little rock andbecause of little rockin many other southern cities and daisy bates was no longer news she remains president of the arkansas naacp it is a fulltime job offering no financial reward at all after the demise of the arkansas state press publisher bates was hired as arkansas field secretary of the naacp a job that utilizes his special talents as a journalist and his keen knowledge of the locality but which cannot pay him the money to which he was accustomed needless to say there is hardly any other place in arkansas where he can find a decent job during much of and mrs bates was in new york city working on a book recording her experiences in the drama of little rock the book tentatively titled the daisy bates story is scheduled for publication this summer by the david mckay company in the book she will detail for the first time the behindthescenes incidents which the national press dared notor was reluctant to report she will reveal what happened to the nine children and to their parents she will name the white people of little rock who out of christian principle sided with the negro children and who paid for their religious faith with financial disaster and social ruin but most important of all she will tell what she felt herself in those grim and dangerous days when she struggled with superhuman effort against the specter of bitterness and defeat before returning to little rock this spring mrs bates sat in her comfortable suite in the brittany hotel in new yorks greenwich village and discussed her impending return home i admit that the idea of returning to little rock is frightening when i recall the intense hatred that has been generated against me by the politicians she said this hatred has been manifested in many ways by the bombing of our home death threats to me and my family and the loss of our paper some people have said to me that progress has been made because a limited number of negro students are attending classes in the senior and junior high schools i recognize the fact that this could be considered progress i am also cognizant of the fact that the students are not permitted to participate in any extracurricular activities and that the restaurants theatres hotels and recreational facilities in little rock are still segregated i would like to continue to be a part of the revolution that will surely one day write finish to the vicious practice of segregation in arkansas that is why i am returning to little rock it may very well be dangerous for daisy bates to return home but it also would seem that her return bodes no comfort for those who are not willing to make freedom a reality for all the people of arkansas do negroes and africans really dig each other accompanying the v recent emergence of j independent african e nations has come a great deal of interest in the dark continent as more and more africans come to the united states there are many very intriguing and revealing developments there has naturally been an intensification of interest centered about the black africanblack american relationship the obvious similarities between the two ethnic groups have often led to misconceptions and fallacies concerning the relationship between the two groups a recent article inthe afroamerican newspaper and the all too apparent misinformation therein dramatically demonstrates this point the fact that the article was written by a negro for a negro newspaper to be primarily read by a negro audience merely makes the situation more acutely embarrassing the fact that afroamerican happens to be the name of a publication adds a touch of irony and ludicrousness that is almost too biting to those somewhat informed on the subject the article appeared in a column called a stones throw by editor chuck stone and was entitled we dig our african brothers but most whites dont after reading the article i was reminded of the old adage he that lives in a glass house should not throw stones the author of the article in his inadequate attempt at proving that africans are accepted by american negroes as brothers builds himself a hothouse inside a gravel pit insults the intelligence of his readers and generously supplies his adversary with slingshots approximately a year ago a newspaper article that had appeared in the pittsburgh courier came to my attention it carried a very interesting informative message unlike mr stone the writer of the courier article spoke of and frompersonal experience the gentleman a high ranking nigerian dignitary had this to say about the contact he had had with american negroes they are cold and unfriendly i was not surprised by this the theme of many discussions i have had with africans coming into my office on state department tours has been the irregular response of negroes to africans african students are often surprised and shocked to see and experience the indifferent and almost hostile attitude of the american negro toward them at times they naively assume as many other uninitiated that because of the common color characteristics common ancestry and some common problems there should exist a close bond of brotherhood between them and the negro perhaps this should be the case but unfortunately it is not before the mau mau uprisings probably the most popular conception of africans held by negroes was based on tarzan movies or some other equally enlightening source most negroes were willing to allow the matter to rest right there figuring no doubt that the less said the better for to get involved in such a question would invariably lead back to the painful fact that they were descendants from such people it was only after ghana gained her independence and the triumphant tour of america by kwame nkrumah that most american negroes became aware that africans were more than an ancient race of people from which they had to grudgingly admit descent even today much of the token acceptance of africans by negroes is based on the fact that having african interests and guests is now socially the thing to do ten years ago there were only a few negroes who evidenced any real interest in africa individuals like st clair drake claude barnett w e b du bois and pitifully few others were the only negroes to meaningfully manifest any genuine interest and concern in africa since the founding of liberia i have been too impressed with hearing dr drake and others speak of the difficult often impossible task of getting negroes fired up about african affairs and culture to believe that there has been a wholesale change in the attitude and action of the negro regarding his image of the african it must be a rather embarrassing thing and due to his apparent void of information on the subject astonishing for the author of the afroamerican article to discover that very few negro colleges have quality programs in african studies this remains the case despite the fact that a number of african leaders received their education at these schools it must be a distressing discovery for him to find out that the leading program of african studies is at northwestern university a white institution it must be exceptionally painful for him to realize that the person nationally and internationally accepted as the leading africanist in the united states is a white anthropologist dr melville herskovits dr herskovits gave up the very prestigious position as head of the department of anthropology at northwestern university to direct his brainchild the program of african studies at northwestern since its embryonic and almost esoteric inception sixteen years ago its growth in size and stature has caused it to be considered the most outstanding such program in america it must be known to the author in question that the naacp the urban league and other such organizations have had to depend to a great extent on white support for existence this has been the case despite the type of fight these groups have been waging but if negroes twentyone million strong spending in excess of twenty billion dollars a year dont demonstrate a sufficient concern for their brothers right here in america through sufficient support of these agencies then is it reasonable to assume that they are better prepared to show a special affinity for a people even further removed as desirable as it may be to propose that the american negro generally views the african as brother with all the inherent and indigenous fraternal feeling implied by the term borders on being preposterous nothing happens in a vacuum there are many reasonable and plausible explanations for the apathetic attitude of the negro toward the african for centuries the negro has been trying to deny lose and eradicate his african heritage and characteristics fortunes based on hair preparations and skin bleaches are indicting testimony to this very soon after he reached the shores of america the african became aware of the importance that color apparently played he reasoned that the only real difference between him and the massa was color and the accompanying african features he ignored the importance of economics and its vital role in the scheme of things he naively wrapped all his frustrations problems and aspirations into one big white pill and swallowed it thereafter he saw the world in terms of black white and varying shades of brown and assumed if you white you all right if you brown you can hang around but if you black then you got to git way back having established color as the criterion for his own evaluating scheme the negro set in motion a type of ethnic thinking that plagues us even today premiums were placed on possessing white features light skin keen nose thin lips good hair anything african was allocated a negative value and had to be altered hidden or minimized whenever possible jealousies and discriminations within the race itself often paralyzed and prevented action in concert among the various factions of negroes color neuroses and psychoses retarded a realistic acceptance and appreciation of africanness and thwarted much progress toward finding the real basis for the negros inferior position in america that basis was and is economics color is a very convenient rationalization and disguise behind which the operations necessary to subjugation have been carried on the negros rejection of the african image is further encouraged and molded by various aspects of his everyday existence in the educational system the negro first meets the african in the little black sambo tale later in geography he sees the african as a noble savage at best and often as some scantily clothed uncivilized creature whose biggest claim to progress is that he doesnt eat people in as large quantities as he did formerly for better or worse neeroes are americans as such they are effectively reached and influenced by madison avenue and hollywood for years the negro has been exposed to the same symbols as white america he has been just as effectively influenced by them he regards the gregory peck betty grable rock hudson jane russell type as the ultimate in male and female attractiveness after this brainwashing process he is in no mood to settle for the aunt jemimas and uncle bens not to mention the african with the masses of negroes being conditioned and controlled in his thinking along the same lines as other americans with the gross ignorance that remains about africa with his historic repugnance at africanness there is little cause to wonder at the attitude of the american negro toward the african there has been however some progress made negroes are slowly beginning to feel that there is no inherent shame in being born black but that it is inherently shameful to be ashamed of being born that color many negroes are looking to the accomplishments of the new african nations with pride admiration hope and respect but despite these steps forward there has not been enough progress for most negroes to accept the african as his brother americas forgotten people despite certain limited d improvementson jf paperin the laws americas forgotten people by dale wright reprinted by permission from the new york world telegram sun protecting the migrant farm worker he continues to be americas forgotten manforced to work long tortured hours at substandard wages cheated and exploited at every turn and compelled to live in filth and squalor and danger i know this because for six months on and off from april to october i worked as a migrant laborer along the atlantic seaboard from florida to new york i saw it with my eyes i felt it in my blistered hands i smelled it with my nose and i rebelled at it in my conscience i labored with slept with ate with and more than once suffered with the members of this vast army of men and women and children most of them negroes like myself who stoop and lift and grub from natures earth a great part of the nations food crop these are some of the things i found many migrant workers are forced to work as many as hours a day at a backbreaking task the rewards of which are in most cases a string of broken promises they are grossly underpaid and many times not paid at all by conniving labor contractors who have them at their mercy they are cheated and exploited all along the line by profiteers in the roles of growers shippers packers labor contractors crew bosses landlords and merchants thousands of them live in shabby unkempt hovels and shacks usually hidden behind a clump of trees out of public view without sanitary or plumbing facilities and despite laws enacted to protect them their children starting at age are worked long hours under a searing sun for less than the prevailingor promisedpay under conditions inferior to those afforded cattle and freight migrant laborers are transported from one work area to another in dilapidated hazardous vehicles and at the end of the line when all the crops are worked out hundreds of the migrant workers wind up on relief at public expense in the northern seaboard states the man who sits next to me in this newspaper office allan keller has done much to improve the lot of migrant laborers mainly through his efforts and the campaigns by this newspaper over a period of years a new york state legislative committee was named to look into the migrant labor problem and recommend changes in the laws belatedly teeth were put into regulations to provide better treatment for the migrant the state department of health was empowered to license labor camps and require that minimum sanitary and health standards be maintained other states took stepsalso on paper to help and protect the forgotten man of america the changes in the laws havent helped much the miserable migrants virtually without hope for a brighter tomorrow are still hidden behind those clumps of trees at this moment the migrant labor problem is being investigated anew by asubcommittee of the house labor and education committee with a view toward drafting new remedial legislation its another step in the long investigation of the stoop laborer who has been studied surveyed microscoped and diagnosed over the years as perhaps the sickest segment of the nations economy but i saw little improvement in the condition of the patient the working and housing conditions were bad enough but it was the way hes cheated that outraged me hes overcharged for his squalid shack his food his clothing his bottle of wine at the end of a hard week of work and hes gouged on just about every other item he purchases i found workers in central new jersey who were charged cents for a breakfast of one chicken wing a spoonful of watery rice and a slice of bread an extra slice cost them cents more in the long island potato belt where four migrant workers perished in flames recently i found a large crew of men and women being charged by a labor contractor with weekly dues to a union which didnt exist they also were being charged another for social security far out of proportion to the paltry pay they had received in many cases i discovered workers forced to pay for social security had no ss numbers at all the payments obviously going wholly to profiteers operating at their labor camp in hastings fla the heart of the states potato belt i bunked for two days in a nearcollapsed insectinfested shanty for which i was compelled to pay a night next door in an even more dilapidated hovel lived a married couple whose monthold baby had been bom there they paid a week the infant wailed endlessly from dawn to darkness in its makeshift crib a cardboard cabbage carton as flies and potato bugs crawled in and out of its mouth and nostrils a ragged burlap potato sack served as the babys blanket but florida has no comer on squalor near hightstown n j less than miles from trenton the state capital i found seven men and women tomato pickersnone of them relatedliving in filth in a foot square tar paper shack for which they were charged a week for rent everywhere i traveled i found the itinerant laborer getting a wretched deal and being inarticulate and always on the move he is least able among americas working men to have his cries heard on a warm humid morning last april a rickety old bus jolted along at its top speed between rows of carefully manicured estates along route from miami south to homestead fla although the vehicle had seats for persons it was crammed with passengers i was one of them i was on my way to my first day of work as a migrant farm laborer in the lush tomato fields of southern dade county i had shaped up reported for assignment earlier that morning on a miami street corner and was hiredwith no questions askedby a fat character known as a labor contractor in the south labor contractors round up crews of workers for transport and assignment to farms where crops are to be harvested everybody that gets on this bus he promised reassuringly makes today if you want to work theres plenty of tomatoes to pick and there will be no cheating nothin taken out of your pay and it will be clean work his pitch sounded good but i wanted to see for myself the smirks on the faces of the seasoned migrant workers around me raised my doubts in a vast patch of ground outside homestead our crew joined about other farm workers they were busy when we arrived gathering a crop of red ripes tomatoes ready that day for shipment to the markets and canneries it was just after daybreak and a bright sun already had begun to broil the pickers as they stooped in the long rows the job was to pick and pack the tomatoes into baskets that contained fiveeighths of a bushel each loaded basket weighed pounds when we had them filled we lugged them to the end of the row where they were loaded onto trucks pay promised was cents a basket in the row next to mine an emaciated man of about coughed and spat incessantly as he bent to his task when i noticed the blood and spoke to him about it he muttered yeah they say its consumption it dont make no difference i gotta keep working the doctor he cant do nothing for me i got no money for medicine i got a woman and a lotta kids i gotta keep pickin tomatoes obviously the man was seriously ill and belonged in a hospital but he was trapped by the need to work for his family in the only job he knew how to do later when we stood up to smoke a cigaret he said to me been doin farm work all my life dont know nothin else i cant go to a hospital kids gotta eat he said his name was alonzo and that he lived in a tin and tar paper shack near goulds fla for which he paid a week rent he added that three of his children the small oneshad dry hacking coughs and probably had caught the misery he had in his chest medical treatment no none of the youngsters had ever seen a doctor despite his illness alonzo was a hard worker as we worked along the endless rows of tomato plants he loaded basket after basket of tomatoes and was soon far down the field from me later that day alonzo told me he soon would be moving north from homestead because the harvest was going down to keep living he explained hed have to load his family and his belongings onto a truck or bus going north where other crops were ripening its the same he said this job is just like the last one next be just like this one never no different never will be this sick frustrated laborer doomed long before his time was summing up the lot of todays migrant farm worker the backbreaking labor of stooping close to the orangetinted florida earth begins as soon as a picker can distinguish red tomatoes from green ones in the grey dawn of an endless day his work ends when he no longer can see the tomatoes to pick them at the promised rate of cents a basket a good picker can fill to baskets a day and earn it says therefrom to a day as bad as that kind of pay is it generally worked out that the man in the fields received considerably less than the promised rate often the rate dropped on payday to cents a basket and the field hand who actually took home a day for his work considered himself lucky on my first day in the fields i worked hours with only a minute break for what they called lunch it was the hardest most punishing work had ever done in the first hours of that miserable day my hands became grimy and encrusted with the green insecticide they spray on tomatoes it covered my khaki pants and ate its way into my legs it collected under my finger nails covered my shoes and socks and festered in the scratches i received from the tomato vines but picking the tomatoes was the easy part of the job the hard part was lugging the heavy baskets to the end of the rowsoften as far as feetto be loaded onto the trucks all around me were men and womenall agesdragging themselves along the rows on their hands and knees in the near degree heat toilet facilities there were none the pickers male and female used the field whenever they found it necessary it was more than a mile to the nearest clump of trees that lunch i spoke of a little before noon a battered pickup truck drove into the fields the meal consisted of greasy sausage sandwiches and warm soft drinks the sandwiches cost cents and the drinks cents drinking water was dispensed from a wooden barrel we dipped our water with a sawedoff tomato can shared by some other migrant laborers toiling in the fields because the barrel was in the middle of the field thirsty workers had to walk as much as a half mile for a drink of water as i figured it that first day we picked more than baskets of tomatoes after hours of stooping squatting crawling picking and loading id earned just many of the men and women working with me had earned less the transportation of migrant workers within a state such as florida is a horror story i was in florida last spring riding with and working with the thousands of migrant laborers who follow the harvest of crops for their miserable livelihood travel for a migrant and his family is a nightmare anywhere in florida and other states which dont regulate migrant transportation its worse itemthe federal statutes decree that drivers of interstate migrant carriers must pass physical fitness tests i rode in a bus with a labor crew of including a young couple with a monthold infant the trip from homestead to ruskin fla covered miles the driver in a moment of sleepy candor told me he was subject to violent epileptic seizures itemfederal laws say that rest and meal stops must be made at least every six hours our crew traveled hours before the first stop was made the driver stopped for gas but not for people the infant had to use for toilet purposes a filthy rag salvaged from the bus floor as for men and women their experiences must go undescribed itemevery state requires that bus and truck drivers be properly licensed the driver of the arklike vehicle i rode in admitted that his license had been lifted because of a conviction for drunken driving itemmost state laws require that migrant carriers be maintained in reasonably safe and operable condition but on our antique bus windows were cracked or broken seats had collapsed floorboards had long since broken away from mountings and been removed both rear wheels with their smooth whirring tires were visible from inside the bus the owner admitted to me later that the bus had not been inspected in the five years he had owned it baggage and trash barred access to the rear emergency exit door and because the door catch was broken it had been bound firmly shut with baling wire and thus we migrantsi was one of them by nowrolled along floridas roads we passedand were passed byseveral state troopers and local police patrol cars not once were we stopped our destination was ruskin next stop on our journey to the nevernever land of plenty wed all been promised top wages good food a real nice place to live the crew boss name was david tuten jr of st petersburg fla he made it sound real good every man and woman of you will make a day and nobody takes nothin out of your pay an old man sitting next to me muttered amen which gave me a pretty fair idea what was coming when we arrived at the camp outside a big farm about three miles from ruskin we had been travelingwith just one stopfor hours everybody was tired dirty hungry and then we got the bad news the tomatoes were still green and not anywhere near being ready for harvest sorry to tell you this said the grower but therell be no work for at least days this i learned from friends i had made on the bus often pens when that land of plenty is just around the comer of the winding road it meant just one thing that the workers were there on their own to wait until green tomatoes turned red it also meant that at the mercy of the tomato farmer and the crew contractor they would run up big debts for food and lodging to be paid for later when they trudged out into the fields there were a few shouts of protests but not many this had happened too often before just as it will happen too often again i looked around the camp there were no toilet facilities whatsoever there was no kitchen equipment in the barrackslike living quarters there was no food that i could see the only available water came from an irrigation pump adequate provisions had been made to water the tomatoesbut not the people some of the migrants washed themselves and their clothes in a muddy irrigation ditch the crew boss explained without apology that he hadnt known the crop was late or that the grower hadnt installed facilities for his workers nobody said anything we were all too tired a man who had brought his wife and child along finally broke the silence we got here broke he said mournfully everything we got is tied up in this bundle he pointed to a tattered bedspread tied up by its four corners and now were even worse off than before cause we got to start borrowing money to live on the man then walked away with his family and slowly dug a hole in the ground then he set up a makeshift stove by placing a piece of sheet metal on four empty cans and built a fire under it i watched as he tramped off into the fields in a few minutes he was back with a small cabbage and a can of waterfrom the irrigation ditch he and his wife boiled the cabbage over the can stove it was the first meal that they and their child had eaten since leaving homestead hours before a migrant farm worker expects exploitation as one of the grim facts of his miserable life he knows hell be cheated and he learns to live with it he knows hell be underpaid for his labor and overcharged for many of the things he has to buy for himself and his family because many migrants never get to schoolor have to leave during the early elementary school years to go to work in the fields they are uneducated and illiterate for this reason they are easy marks for sharp operators while driving along a country road through the fertile north shore potato area near peconic l i last august i picked up two hitchhiking farmhands who spelled out some of the gimmicks the sharpies use to separate a migrant worker from his hardwon wages james taylor and evon washington both from polk county fla had been taken to peconic fla last july to work as potato graders they had joined a traveling farm crew headed by a virginia man earlier in the summer on a promise that they would be paid an hour the worldtelegram is withholding the virginia mans name at this time because of an investigation now under way both farmhands agreed that in nearly three months of work with the crew of graders and loaders they had never earned more than cents hourly at the time i gave the two men a lift they were headed on foot for new york city miles away between the two they had cents in cash and only the clothes they wore they had left their camp the night before they said because there was no chance of earning enough money to subsist the stories they told were so typical of the cruel swindles i had heard many times before in other farm areas north and south that i brought them into new york staked them to a room at a ymca and taperecorded their stories two days later i rounded up some shirts and underwear and helped get them jobs at an upstate new york fruit cannery through the state employment service here are some of the things they told meon two hours of tape their crew leader deducted weekly for union dues for a union that doesnt exist the men had not signed any union membership cards they did not know the name of the union to which they paid dues the two said they were told that the deductions would be made for weeks i already knew the reason it was one of the gimmicks frequently used by labor contractors to write off the expense of transporting migrants from one stop to another in their recruiting pitches in the south contractors promise to bus or truck migrants up the road at no cost but they get back the money in hidden charges mr taylor and mr washington also declared that their crew leader deducted weekly for social security benefits mr washington emphasized that although he had lost his ss card he knew his number neither the contractor nor the timekeeper knew my number he said they never asked me the deductions were illegal even if the crew leader had known the number the maximum legal deduction is per cent of gross salary up to annually for the deductions to have been legal the crew leader workers would have to be paid at least weekly the two hitchhikers insisted that they had never grossed more than a week with the crew on paydays the men declared the crew boss charged his workers a pint for wine which retails for cents though state law requires that migrant farm workers be furnished with written statements of hours worked and wages received both men asserted they had never received such records another state law requires that farm labor contractors post in conspicuous places either in living quarters or at grading houses copies of labor contracts detailing wages and hours and charges for food and housing mr taylor who has completed years of public school education said he had never seen a labor contract posted and did not know the procedure was required these are just some of the many complaints of shoddy recordkeeping and questionable payroll operation that both men gave in their interviews mr washington said he had been paid nothing for his first week of work and that at the end of the second week he received for well over hours of work this was after the deduction of for meals weekly and for room rent sometimes the boss would pay us whatever he felt like mr washington explained no matter how many hours we worked mr taylor said that for his best week of work he received after union dues social security and food and lodging both men charged that there were many others at the camp who had been bilked by illegal charges the two men estimated they had been cheated out of a minimum of each one of their biggest gripes concerned what they called waiting time as mr taylor explained it if were loading potatoes off the grader and into trucks and the trucks are late we dont get paid for waiting but we have to work around the shed anyway stacking sacks of potatoes for the next trucks or just moving things around theres sometimes two or three hours between trucks were working but were not getting paid the time stops when the truck is loaded and it dont start until the next one comes in an intense serious young man mr taylors summation of the exploitation of migrant farm workers mirrors the feelings of the essential laborers about come into new york state every year who harvest the nations crops were getting cheated and we know it you gotta take it or leave we left i later made another visit to the camp tucked away in the trees to see for myself what the two men had left behind there glistening in the bright long island sun i found an explanation an expensive sedan was parked in front of the shabby quarters alongside a luxury car i had been told earlier by mr taylor and mr washington that they were owned by the crew leader and his wife by s carter mcmorris in this time of national insecurity and perhaps because of it the status of the negro in american life is improving at a far faster rate than ever before integration even in t the notsosolid south is becoming a reality while political and economic and racial realism has resulted in greater acceptance of the negro by the majority american the problem of negro acceptance of himself has been neglected at the expense of full psychic benefit from his progress social scientists speak of a cultural lag between material and social progress by this is meant that man has devoted much attention to physical development with out the evolution of a philosophy to cope with the problems which yet remain and are in part a product of industrialization and scientific achievement in the same way there has been a lag between the advance of the minority american and his own selfimage so that as he reaches near equality with the majority american he continues to be the victim of his slaverybegun secondclasscitizenshipperpetuated feeling of physical and mental inferiority this ingrained inbred selfimage manifests itself daily in what i term the negros inhumanity to the negro his lack of confidence in and unwillingness to support and develop his own institutions and businesses and professions resulting in economic dependence to a greater extent than necessary upon the already established majority american the negros rejection of his business and professional class is rationalized in many ways that we must not ourselves discriminate against the majority group is the most popular we hear too that negro physicians for instance are not equally schooled that negro merchants charge more than white ones negro teachers cannot compete and negro lawyers are not respected in the courts all such expressions are only rationalizations and excuses to cover up the real motivating factor the deepseated feelings of inferiority and lack of confidence in themselves which plague the americans of color from the illiterate to the educated during the years of struggle between my graduation from high school and the time when i was able to begin the typically american unsubsidized and unaided college training i was an insurance salesman in various ohio and michigan cities nothing in my life has been more traumatic than this dawning realization of a sensitive young man not yet of majority of the strange loneliness occasioned by my own people literally slamming the door in my face because i was selling nigger insurance perhaps the psychology of the race is well summed up in the reputed statement of a negro woman asked why she did not buy her ice from a negro the white mans ice is colder i like to think that i have come a long way since those depressed years just before world war ii however i still suffer the same pain as a member of the legal profession at the rejection of colored members of my colleagues in preference to the man downtown when you know that the negro attorney has gone to the same schools passed the same examinations often specialized in school or practice and has successfully championed the civil_rights fight of his race from restrictive covenants to the school integration and sitin decisions you wonder what one has to do to convince the negro that his professional men are equal in ability with those of any other race if this race is ever going to find economic security full interracial acceptance and above all selfrespect we are going to have to change our philosophy straighten out our thinking in the first place we must not expect our business men to start out with the corporate capital now in the hands of the white business we must not for the purpose of discrimination but for that of equalization erect a kind of community tariff wall preferring goods and services of others of our race in much the same way that congress has had to erect tariffs to protect infant industries particularly at the beginning of this countrys industrial life when we could not compete with europes already developed economy any other policy is to make jobs with negro spending power for those of other races at a time when the latter have not adopted a policy of equality so that we are victims of a twoedged sword discrimination from within and from without even more important is the psychic effect the acceptance of racial inferiority status which selfrejection implies it is a little difficult to sell the idea of acceptance of the negro by others when he has not fully accepted himself this selfrejection is perhaps a natural consequence of living in a whiteoriented society a natural progression from childhoods white dolls a white santa claus even a white god to a belief that white is right generally but we must not surrender to this selfdefeating and not inevitable reaction the problem is one of racial selfeducation it is no justification to say that i feel inferior because the white man has taught me that i am we must mature become adults as a race and institute our own thinking on so vital a matter as racial equality we have spent so much time on converting the white man that we have closed our eyes to the fact that we have ourselves almost completely accepted white standards and prejudices even of physical attributes which distinguish race from race we must spend more time selling the negro to the negro we need a massed concerted effort which can include classroom discussions lectures editorials books magazine and newspaper articles sermons stories and plays to elevate our selfconception from the slough of inferiority and thus to see an end to the negros inhumanity to the negro the father of negro history mrcarter g j ir r woodson closed the m s book with a snap and threw it on the desk his dark eyes were the father of negro history by agnes behling o wmb stormy and his thin lips more compressed than usual as he arose strode over to the window and stared out over the college campus it is always the same he muttered to himself it is the white man who writes the history books to show that all major contributions to civilization have been made by various branches of the white race through the open window came the voices of negro students on their way to classes what incentive do these young people have to overcome their feelings of inferiority to rise above their handicaps to struggle to attain their rightful place in modem society it was the question to which for many years he had tried to find the answer for a time he stood in deep thought then with the clenched fist of his right hand he smartly struck the palm of his left and exclaimed i will do it today with that he hurriedly left the room to his associates it was inconceivable that at the height of his educational career dr woodson deliberately should decide to resign from his position as dean in order to devote the rest of his life if need be to help put the negro back into the history books to carter g woodson it was only another step in the long climb to rise above the limitations of his birth and early environment and in that struggle to lead the underprivileged to a realization of their hopes and ambitions to james and anne eliza woodson former slaves on december was born a son whom they named carter godwin as a member of a large family he grew accustomed to the many privations due to poverty but only one seriously mattered to him the inability to attend even the poor schools provided when the little farm could no longer provide a living carter went to work in a coal mine in west virginia the work was hard the hours long the pay poor but through sheer determination he forced himself to master the fundamental subjects until at the age of twenty he entered his first school the douglass high school in huntington west virginia so intense was his interest and so untiring his efforts that he finished the four year course in less than two between he earned the degree of litt b at berea college in kentucky just six years from the time he had entered douglass high school as a student he became its principal in the years which followed he served as supervisor of schools in the philippines a teacher of language and history in high schools in washington d c a dean of the school of liberal arts at howard university and finally at the college of west virginia in spite of heavy teaching duties and financial difficulties his relentless quest for more knowledge drove him on to earn the b a and m a degrees from the university of chicago to study abroad and at length in to receive his ph d from harvard during the years of study teaching travel and other personal contacts he learned much that was of interest about his own people but little of it was to be found in books research convinced him that writers of history often distorted facts and either consciously or unconsciously misrepresented information about the contributions of his people to human progress history as it was taught gave the young negro an inferiority complex and left him restless and depressed not to know the stirring and significant events of the past which described his peoples continual struggle for improved living conditions better education and equal opportunities had left youth without a sense of appreciation for past achievements and thus had failed to provide incentive toward which to work for the future more than anything else in life carter g woodson wanted youngsters to grow up with this appreciation of their own possibilities which could be gained only through a knowledge of the contributions which black folk had made to history to this end by he almost singlehandedly founded the association for the study of negro life and history whose objective was to fortify racial pride by supporting facts and knowledge concerning racial heritage this undertaking was soon followed by the journal of negro history which aimed to furnish the factual background necessary for the interpretation of problems related to the education of the negro occasionally dr woodson obtained small grants from foundations but usually he paid from his own modest salaries to support his research projects and the publication and circulation of valuable books about the negro negro history week february with its emphasis on the proud american was initiated by dr woodson because he believed that history is a record of the progress of mankind and in that sense negro history is a necessary part of both national and world history many admired carter g woodsons achievements but few became close friends for his singlemindedness of purpose and missionary zeal frequently did not attract the sympathetic understanding of those about him those who knew him best often described him as stubborn formidable and independent he seemed to begrudge the time and effort necessary to cultivate those personality traits and personal habits which might have drawn others to him and given him wider public acclaim to him these things were unimportant for there was so much to be done and he had begun so late in life when asked why he had no home of his own or had never married dr woodson would explain my work is my only wife modest circumstances necessitated his living in lodging houses and eating his meals in restaurants at times he could be genial but usually he was less at home with adults than children his associates described his life as spartan in its simplicity for he did not smoke or drink tennis was his only sport and about his only pastimes were the theater and the long soltary walks during which he planned future activities mary mcleod bethune a contemporary characterized him as living for decades among his books constantly searching collecting studying writing and editing when he died on april there was no need to erect a memorial in his honor for during his busy lifetime he had built his own as tangible evidence of his achievements he left a legacy of sixteen books about the negro hundreds of articles and monographs in his chosen field and many reviews of books written about the negroes of other lands his journal of negro history and negro history bulletin still are an invaluable source of information for those research students who would study or write about the negro the negro in our history now in its eighth edition still is used by colleges throughout the nation and the story of the negro retold is read as eagerly by high school students as elementary school children learn about their heroes from the negro makers of history death came before he could complete his most ambitious undertaking a six volume encyclopedia africana however any such encyclopedia when published undoubtedly will contain many of the articles edited and published by dr woodson as well as the materials from those whom he inspired to help in his resurrection of the lost history of his people as a living if less tangible legacy he left behind the inspired leadership of those whose minds had become imbued with his principles and ideas perhaps even more significantly by his example dr carter woodson taught the youth of his own and of the present time not to give in or give up but to rise in spite of all handicaps to their highest potential by convincing them that neither the intelligence nor the capacity is lacking once their possibilities are realized in the national association for the advancement of colored people awarded dr woodson the spingarn medal for outstanding achievements in he received an honorary degree from virginia state college and a similar degree from howard university in after his death his people showed the high esteem in which they held the father of negro history by naming him the third distinguished american in the ebony hall of fame the american dilemma e v i s i d as we can now look back over the era of reconstruction with the wisdom of hindsight we see clearly that the reason so much went wrong and why so little permanent improvement of the lot of the negroes in the south resulted was this that the political revolution was not backed up by economic and social reform as usual the leaders of that time tried to do great things too cheaply without paying the costs the slogan six acres and a mule was never taken seriously by those in powerjust as in most of the underdeveloped countries of the world today where land and tenancy reforms are proposed as programs and sometimes even enacted into law but frustrated and nullified by the resistance of the vested interests i draw this parallel between the fate of the negro people in america during reconstruction and that of the downtrodden masses in underdeveloped countries at the present time because i believe it has a lesson to teach us if we want to avert disaster today too a radical revolution has been carried out the liquidation of colonial domination but vicious economic and social systems which colonial governments had found it to their advantage not to disturb have largely been left intact in some countries inequalities are in fact increasing now history is repeating itself on a much bigger scale it is not now a matter of a small minority of a few millions in one single country as it was in post civil war time in america today huge majorities of many hundreds of millions in the greater part of the world outside the soviet orbit are affected the stage is international and not merely national and the problems it presents are immensely dangerous in the present tense state of international relations dominated by the cold war in america this type of reconstruction led to the great national compromise worked out in the late s the negro people were left again to the mercy of the white upper caste in the south now embittered by all that had followed their military defeat economically the south deteriorated to a colonial status in its relation to the north and as late as the thirties franklin roosevelt could still characterize the south as the nations problem number one in the north there was instead exceedingly rapid economic expansion though under rugged individualism and rampant corruption of government from which america as we know has still not entirely freed itself thereafter for more than half a centuryindeed until the end of the thirtiesthe status of the negro people remained on the whole about unchanged there were advances on some fronts but retreats on others twenty years ago this era of relative stagnation so far as the negroes position is concerned had so impressed itself on american thinking that even the social scientists had generally come to believe that it was the natural order of things progress was foredoomed to be very gradual and slow they believed and nothing very much could be done to speed it up in my study of the negro problem in america at that time i came to the contrary conclusion however that this period of stagnation was only a temporary balancing of forces which were just on the verge of being broken i saw big changes in the offing and as we know this actually happened these last twenty years have been filled with advances on all fronts in the labor market in education in the fields of social welfare and housing in the structure of law and law observance and generally in the enjoyment of more equal opportunities to do things to move in society to work produce and consume without meeting segregation and discrimination no historical trend of social change is a straight line and there have been occasional setbacks prejudice itself is also slow to disappear though its legal and institutional retaining walls are crumbling there is still a long road to travel before america becomes in fact the egalitarian country of its creed but in historical perspective the rapidity of progress is astonishing let us remember that practically all of this progress has taken place in the short period of the last twenty years following six decades of stagnationand that its coming was not anticipated by most students of the american scene i have found it not inappropriate to use this occasion for reminding us of some broad traits of the history of the negro people over the past century just as an individual for the sake of his sanity needs to maintain continuity with his earliest memories so also groups of people need to be clear about where they came from and how they have fared if they are to understand where they stand today and the direction in which they are moving the progressive achievements of recent years have not been won without efforts every individual advance on the whole broad front has had to be fought for sometimes against fierce resistance in the general advance unfortunate in cidents occur which deeply disturb the participants but we should not expect the uprooting of racial inequality in the face of inherited and emotionladen prejudices to be frictionless in a sense unpleasant incidents even have a function to fulfill in this process of advance in the last chapter of an american dilemma i quoted a remark once made to me by a prominent and conservative negro social scientist in the south i can now reveal that the man i characterized in this way was my late friend charles s johnson the great sociologist and the first negro president of fisk university he stated as his considered opinion that tensions are not necessarily bad and that under certain conditions even race riots may have wholesome effects in the long run he continued in about the following way they stir up peoples conscience people will have to think matters over they prevent things from becoming settled if the race situation should ever become fixed if the negro were really accommodated then and only then would i despair about a continued great improvement for negroes as long as there is friction and fighting there is hope in this light the little rock disturbances and the many other unfortunate incidents reported daily in the american press have their positive role to play in giving momentum to social advance i realize that it is much easier for an outsider to take this lofty philosophical view than it is for the american citizen who has a duty to take a part in pressing social advance as rapidly as possible and it must be particularly difficult for the young negro intellectual who bears scars in his soul from all that yet remains of segregation and discrimination in american life nevertheless i maintain that it is important to see clearly that the trend moves steeply upwards in order to avoid discouragement and to sustain the determination required in the skirmishing that may still be necessary in this new epoch the negro cause is a winning one i have not the slightest doubt that we shall continuously see great improvement in the negros status in american society and i even foresee that the rising trend of the past two decades will accelerate it would take me too far afield to explain all my reasons for this conviction but among them on the material side is the growing affluence of society which provides more elbow room for everybody and has little interest in pushing anybody into the ditch on the spiritual side there is the reality of the ideals enshrined in your constitution and rooted in the hearts of the american people with rising levels of education the hold of these ideals in america is continuously strengthened increasingly the false and derogatory be liefs about negroes whiih have filled the function of rationalizing prejudices can be expressed only by those willing to betray their own lack of culture as the white and negro people are increasingly mingling in work and pleasure all are discovering that they are the same sort of people with the same cultural moorings the same likes and dislikes and the same aspirations and ambitions for themselves and for america just as until women are completely emancipated every ambitious woman has also to stand for womens rights so even today every negro intellectual must feel called upon to supplement his work in his chosen vocation by being a race man this situation will remain until negroes are generally accepted everywhere on par with the whites it is for this reason that we find my friend and former collaborator ralph bunche who is working with so much distinction in the united nations peacebuilding efforts in the world taking off time now and then to speak out for the negroes but increasingly the spokesmen for negroes are finding that there are white people championing the same cause the changes now underway have important implications and they will require more radical adjustments than earlier generations were called upon to make what we shall see happening and what has already happened to considerable extent is that the negro intellectual increasingly steps out of his spiritual isolation and becomes simply an american amongst other americans and a human being amongst us all the negro social scientist will less and less be preoccupied with research on the negro community and will strike out in other and broader fields the negro doctor and dentist and lawyer will increasingly serve white patients and clients this implies however that negroes also will go to white doctors dentists and lawyers similar changes in the activities of negro clergymen and teachers can also be expected i should not be fully candid with you if at this point i did not stress another implication of the integration of the negroes in the wider american society namely that the negro professional middle and upper class will have to surrender economic monopolies which they have held and are still holding on the basis of prejudice the future society of equality is a society of free competition and you will have to face it and prepare yourselves to deal with it successfully you cannot cry for the breaking down of the walls of segregation and discrimination while at the same time hoping to retain petty monopoly preserves among a negro clientele to give you a comfortable and uncontested economic safety you must have the courage to choose a harder life in which your abilities will be tested against the norms established in the wider american society and indeed in the whole world in the future america of our dreams not only all schools but also all institutions for higher education will stand open to all according to personal merit and independent of race and color this will ultimately happen also in the south in such an america there will be no place for a negro university i am therefore confidently looking forward to a day even if it is not tomorrow when howard and fisk and atlanta universities are not dissimilar in the composition of their faculties and student bodies from other universities in this country this of course impliesand indeed requires as a conditionthat all the other universities will have negro professors and negro students as a normal thing as the integration process proceeds the problems of the negroes will gradually tend to disappear as separate problems for a long time yet there will undoubtedly be problems of breaking down segregation and discrimination against negro families in housing but the general problem of slum clearance in american cities is the bigger and more important one and the negros stake in that bigger problem is the greater as there is no hope for a satisfactory separate solution to the housing problems of negroes as long as slums remain a blot on american citiesthe schools most negro children attend are bad in the south and often in some parts of the north but many other schools are also bad and the best hope for negroes particularly in this period of desegregation is a campaign for improving the schools generally likewise negroes as members of the group still most disadvantaged in american society have a particular interest in the extention of social security an area in which america is still rather backward particularly in the field of health and hospitalization by comparison with the most advanced countries in this situation it is both natural and necessary that negroes should support and join those forces in american society which stand for general social and economic progress when narrower group interests are submerged and the pursuit of social advance for the whole community is brought to the fore a major step towards the complete integration of negroes in american society will have been taken it probably still is broadly true though less now than twenty or thirty years ago that the negroes are the last hired and the first fired and the incidence of unemployment on negro workers is disproportionately heavy the state of full employment created by the war and preserved in the immediate postwar years was of great importance on the economic side in supporting the rising trend of the negros status the relative economic stagnation in america and the high level of unemployment in the fifties is for the same reason particularly menacing for negro advance if continued stagnation should be the lasting condition for the american economy in the decades to come it will for america spell frustration internally and externally and it might even slow down the upward trend of negro advance i have talked about to fight discrimination against negroes in the labor market remains naturally a task that cannot be relaxed but much more important is the recreation of the conditions for american economic progress as nothing is more effective in liquidating discrimination than full employment and a rising trend of incomes to all in this way the cause of raising the status of the negroes in america and stamping out the remnants of segregation and discrimination is bound up more closely than ever before with all the progressive causes in the country as american negroes you have no reason to have a split personality the integration of the negroes in american society has already proceeded so far that without any hesitation you can feel that what is good for america is good for the negroesand equally you can feel that what is good for the negroes is good for america by peter pan all this week i have y felt very conspicuous everyone i have met s has seen the pearl primus show the smart cocktail party set the bright intellectuals the very important socialites theyve all been to the j k randle memorial hall in lagos who is miss primus if you havent heard of her i wouldnt blame you although if you take my advice you shouldnt say it because she is publicized as the world famous exponent of african traditional dances and the smart sophisticated thing these days is to know all the world famous exponents of this or that miss primus is an american her nationality is a priceless asset in nigeria today as far as cultural art goes especially as her skin happens to be black i havent seen miss primus dance how unsophisticated and thats what makes me so selfconscious yet if miss primus spent the rest of her life dancing in lagos there is one citizen shell never see at her showme if she packed out of nigeria tomorrow there is one citizen who and me would sing a song of joy breathe a great sigh of relief miss primus and the whole lot of them who are coming to sell african culture to the africans should get out of the continent we are fed up with being treated as children who must be humored and then the condescension the hypocrisy and the amateurishness sickens me i sent a reporter to interviewmiss primus when she arrived the reporter wrote a caption to the picture saying that miss primus had come to teach nigerians how african traditional dances can be adapted to the modem stage afterwards she will return to the united states and dance for her degree i completely lost my temper with the reporter who i asked furiously is miss primus to teach africans their own dances well said the reporter she has been in africa four times now so what i raved miss primus can spend the rest of her life in africa it still doesnt make an exponent of her i made a solemn pledge a few months ago never again to see people like miss primus it was after the ams ac american society of african culture festival in lagos during which some leading american negro showbusiness people were invited from the united states my criticism of their performance did not go down too well with certain people who are only too ready to gloss and gush over anything foreign i was told that i didnt know a thing i was talking about besides the people concerned were worldfamous so who was i to so much as raise a query well you get that kind of people otherwise psychiatrists would be out of business what makes miss primus world famous it is the fact that she has done on broadway what few others have doneape african dances and anyway anyone who is known on broadway automatically is worldfamous even though you and i never heard of her what makes michael olatunji famous in america he started something new on broadway he brought a hoarse african voice to a showbusiness world used to the smooth and cultured voices of the bing crosbys the paul robesons olatunji combined his act with rowdy boisterous drumming and then of course at least the words he sang were authentic african he quickly became a curiosity and a star was born the other day amsac had the effrontery to bring olatunji over here and try to play him up lets face it olatunjis drumming is tenth grade stuff any pennyatune drummer in the streets of lagos given the same opportunity would humiliate him there was that fellow too at the amsac festivala man called geoffrey holder he was billed to do some voodoo dance or some other rubbish like that i felt sorry for him as this giant tried to writhe like a boa constrictor back and forth on the stage as far as he was concerned african dances were all writhing and crying hoa as the mood took him there was nothing african in his dance except the rafia kilt and the commercial beads oh yes the clowns jangling belts too then the message that constantly rings in our ears now that you are independent we will do all we can to help you develop your culture how many times have i heard that since october no one can help us develop our culture our culture exists if anyone wants to exploit it he is welcome provided he is man enough to admit his own limitations the culture of africa may yet suffer the same fate as our history we didnt have the education to write our own history and it fell to british officers to write inaccurate histories it is the same now with our culture we do not have the money to exploit it ourselves but there are people who have instead of them helping to exploit it by cooperation they are steadily imposing their own amateurish standards on us and like the mugs we are we turn out by the thousands to cheer them the underlining philosophy is so fundamentally wrong wrong for the sponsors of these visits and wrong for us who patronize the shows i would gladly go and see a jazz concert tomorrow by any american showman visiting lagos i wouldnt mind sitting for three hours listening to odetta singing negro spirituals the people who infuriate me are the pearl primus kind and the geoffrey holders who have the nerve to come out to africa and bamboozle people and of course the other group of people who drive me crazy are the soppy intellectuals and socialites in our midst twice now samuel akpabot has organized a variety show in lagos were those knowalls who are supposed to love african art there not on your life ask them their impression on felix idubors latest carving and they will ask you if idubor is a russian ask them about emokpae and they turn up their noses and start a learned treatise on rembrandt if the people who imported the geoffrey holders and pearl primuses persist there is one nigerian who wont be buying their ticketme by rev charles h king after a number of years observing shouters i have come to the conclusion that todays shouters lack artistic means of utilizing to their best adother vantage movements that are calculated to bring the desired results shouting is an art it should not be undertaken without the basic understanding that unlike arts the spotlight is forever on the performer during its execution bad shouts attract just as much attention as good shouts a performance is only as good as the performer works to make it shouting is slowly passing off the scene and the reason for its demise is that those who presently engage in this ecstatic spiritual pleasure of our forefathers or more accurately foremothers lack the inspirational techniques that would attract potential adherents to the shouting profession this should be corrected our churches are becoming dry there are times in which no verbal assent is forthcoming even when the minister boards the gravy train this has a tendency to make the minister look foolish while frankly he longs for others to share in his foolishness head shaking nodding and weak amens do little to compensate for his sweating statistics reveal that in times past every drop of sweat during the course of the gravy would produce a minimum of three shouts per hundred pew fillers the tragic consequence of this is that many churches are losing consecrated sweating clergymen to mass churches which guarantee shouts for every explosive truth this exodus on the part of the clergy has left many of our churches high and dry many of them finding that mere tears are not adequate expressions of mixing with the gravy are seeking other avenues of expressionssuch as rapidfanning neighbornudging approvals spikedheel tappings and quick snaps of the head in an up and down fashion consequently running the risk of a broken neck to accompany their broken spirits this will never do and many delta raised chicken lovers have voiced their dissatisfaction at annual state and national conventions where such matters between factional electional squabbles are the main order of the day integration has not helped matters shouters are guilty of appraising the level of listeners and responding in like manner many shouters have been seen cautiously peering behind them to view the ethnic makeup on given sundays and upon noticing the invasion of the service by others then refus to shout even though its mothers day such hypocrisy is unforgivable are honest welltrained shouters the only answer it is obvious that something should be done ministers are growing weak in their efforts to produce calculated calamity it has been discovered that climatic utterances such as early early early one sunday morning even when accompanied by pulling off of coats and throwing of the handkerchief produce only mild ejaculations from sleepy deacons the shouters have failed us aunt jane would turn over in her grave if she realized that our churches are depending upon the badly played organ to give us our shakes and quakes we must remember our heritage and arouse ourselves to the task of shouting integration or no integration our spirits must visibly express themselves on top of pews and up and down the aisles the times demand it somehow we must stir up the gifts that once put clapping in our hands and running in our feet the time is now we are fast losing our young people who find enjoyment in attending episcopalian book review services they are attending churches where the minister instead of praying please suh let love run from heart to heart and breast to breast is praying for such intangible commodities as world peace what is preventing this spirit from running from heart to heart and breast to breast could it be that the spirit is tired of running a heart to heart and breast to breast journey does not on the surface appear to be unnecessarily fatiguing the inability of aunt jane to fill her pulsating breast has left her high and dry in an extensive effort to get to the bottom of this problemthe demise of the artistic shouti have discovered several contributing factors that make for silent pews first of all shouts the few that remain are oftimes completely unplanned and illtimed the hate shout which at one time was as efficient as the atomic bomb has through the progression of love or some other inconsiderate shout preventerlost its delicate touch the hate shout as i recall had its beginning early in the service the hate shouting sister arriving at the door at oclock would completely ignore the seating suggestion of the usher running her eyes over the congregation until she found sister petunia with her head bowed down as the deacon prayed silently tipping down the aisle with a respectfully bowed head she counted the pews until she arrived at her destination with a quick move to the right she gracefully plopped beside sister petunia sister petunia interrupting her meditation sneaked a quick glance to her left she viewed with consternation the hate shouting sister whom she had succeeded as president of the chitterling dinner committee it was not petunias fault that the members of the committee found out that the hate shouting sister had been taking more chitterlings home to her twelve children and lazy husband than the church law allowed it had been an honest election and petunia had won although now viewing the shouting muscles of the expresident she prayerfully wished she had lost as the deacon finished his prayer asking for a place somewhere in the kingdom all upraised heads quickly appraised the situation and from the pulpit to the pews it was silently concurred that some good shouting would take place this morning it was no accident that the hate shouting sister had chosen this morning to wear an outlandish charm bracelet this bracelet had large gilded gold links mementoes of her husbands days on the chain gang lethal perhaps but one had to admit they were pretty even though they were hanging looser than usual sister petunia seeking some avenue of escape from the shout that was sure to come was dismayed to discover that to her right sat big lucy pounds of contrary obstinancy clasping in her arms a sniveling yearold infant resigning herself to the inevitable she sat back to await her thrashing her only hope it appeared was that the preacher would not board the gravy train her hopes were in vain at the conclusion of his message he boarded that train it was between the stations of closing up hymnbooks and bibles and one of these ole days that the hate shouting sister got happy today sister petunia unhappily displays a face that has been marked by the spirit of course loving ones neighbor in spite of chitterling misunderstanding would have prevented the above from occurring but it can be plainly seen that more love would eliminate the hate shout entirely we must refine this type of shout to workable and acceptable proportions let us examine a few artistic means of accomplishing this worthwhile aim first why does not the hate shouter combine her strategy with the art of the running shout the running shout allows its executor more freedom more targets and less chance of being churched this packaged bargain in shouting must not be overlooked let us examine its highlights the execution is simple it allows the shouter to sit where she pleases and at the appropriate moment dash out into the aisle and traverse at will will of course moves out of her way for he knows what is forthcoming with a running start the hate shouter could have flung her arms with deadly aim petunia and the entire committee would have fallen before her happiness what glorious opportunities the hate shouter misses when she fails to utilize the running shout think also of the shouts that will take place the following sunday the prospects of such a high time in the spirit will fill the pews to capacity i think it of sufficient import however to sound a warning there is a danger in the running shout that should be pointed out the direction traversed should be in the direction of pulpittorear and not from walltowall walltowall runners have discovered that the shortened distance can be miscalculated while in the throes of happy hate and the walls can be formidable obstacles that refuse to yield to the runner testimonials are on record that walltowall hate shouters would rather be hate shout receivers than to meet a hard cold unchristian wall admittedly some have not survived to testify at all building committees should bear this in mind when planning the new church many churches have eliminated walls altogether illtimed shouts are those that occur sometimes during offeringthe solemnity of the moment does not lend itself to the dignity of the shouter falling out at a time like this only increases suspicions of dodging of dues likewise during the announcements granted that some church announcements should cause us to fall out we should save these shouts for when they are able to create the most distraction at the most opportune time the meditation period has been experimented on by manyand reports are very effectively those who would desire more and better shouting would do well to learn a few of the techniques and responsive chords that must be struck prior to the eruption one principle that must never be forgotten is that of selfprotection the shouter should not rock from sidetoside while building up emotions such movements only give forewarning to innocent bysitters they do not deserve such warning neither should one slide down the pews church pews are more than often made of solid oak and splinters of this type are difficult to extract glasses should unobtrusively be removed as soon as the shouting target is spotted unless of course you yearn to attract more attention in the future by being known as the blind shouting sister admittedly it might enhance your shouting prestige but all shouters should intelligently weigh the pros and cons of the issues involved now that we have dealt with self protection let us move on to key words that will allow us to shout with trained proficiency shouting requires the utmost discipline and we must train ourselves to this end what are these key words first you must choose the words that fit your makeup good shouts vary j with the tastes and the moods of the i shouter since new words are be i ing discovered every sunday that i bring about emotional responses let us deal only with those words that we know are tried and true mother is effective only if she is gone normally permission is granted for unusual shouting on mothers day born again a word of caution here do not shout on this word unless you really are really born again again a word of caution shouting on really bom again is normally reserved for members of the mothers board jesus shout here only if the word is repeated ten times in succession and the preacher is sweating it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the minister is appealing to your intellect or your emotions be certain which one you respond todont mix them up hes all right there are no restrictions here this has been a timetested shoutgetting expression shout as often as you like on this one heaven statistical analysis has discovered that heaven today is entitled only to a short grunt do not exert yourself to reach this goal for you probably wont the susceptibility of any given shouter to the key words mentioned unfortunately depend upon the hard times and tribulations experienced during the week and herein lies the answer to the dilemma of the vanishing shouter if a really hard time has been experienced one may safely shout after hearing the word jesus one time if a really hard time has been experienced during the week this same word should authenticate a screaming yell upon its second rendition let us face facts because of the lack of hard times shouting is disappearing from our churches we can blame this on the welfare poor relief and reciprocal child support laws prosperity has left the shouter speechless miracle drugs have taken us off our beds of affliction consequently taking away good shouting material penicillin vitamins and other enemies have invaded the sacred territory of our once happily decaying bodies divorces are freeing us from unhappy shouting gems of trouble those who shout now must be really sick the emergence of negro college stars and teams in integrated competition is one of the great but unheralded sports stories of our times there are several aspects of significance the success of the ralph bostons willie galimores wilma rudolphs tennessee states and florida a m universities prove that negro coaches too are talented it proves that when trained properly and properlyequipped negro athletes can overcome the vast handicaps imposed upon them in southern states to compete on even terms with others who are more fortunate it proves that segregated white schools make themselves appear ludicrous when they go chasing white athletes all over the country in a mad quest of wins when right there in their own territories are to be found untapped goldmines of athletic talent it proves that slowly but surely times are changing everybody agrees that times are changing for the better everybody that is except the segregationist soreheads and people who would like to see the clock run counterclockwise for a while the only basic reason why the allnegro college exists is racial prejudice and racial segregation which is perhaps being attacked by a slowlycreeping death in the south which is not to say however that the nowallnegro college will soon disappear except such schools as lincoln university in pennsylvania lincoln university in missouri possibly west virginia state central state college in wilberforce ohio and howard university in washington no major allnegro or once allnegro college exists outside the south a certain amount of integration principally involving children of caucasian teachers and exchange students has existed in a few of the allnegro schools for years in recent years the two lincolns howard central state and west virginia state have increased their own integration process and to some extent this has been reflected on their athletic squads pennsylvanias lincoln university listed a caucasian lineman on its football team roster in the late s or early s but the original purpose of these schools dating back to miners teachers college washington d c and lincoln university pennsylvania was to provide college or university education for negro students who otherwise never would have been beneficiaries of this vastlyimportant privilege booker t washington and his students at tuskegee institute in alabama founded were so hungry and thirsty for knowledge that they built their own college up from the ground with their own hands manufacturing bricks mortar cement beds chairs benches mattresses raising their own food making their own clothes in each case where men were enrolled in sufficient numbers in these schools sports entered the picture as a part of an aimedfor wellrounded educational program often there was but one coachin some cases a volunteer in others a graduate of the big white northern universitiesand he taught classes coached all sports set up schedules laid out athletic fields scrounged for equipment handled his own secretarial affairs and was just about it and all on the job working for a pittance but determined to do a job and dedicated to an ideal those negro college coaches were heroesas heroic as any fullback or guard or homerun hitter they ever developed into stardom and fan adulation this obtains even until this day in the south for a s jake gaither is no less a heroic figure in florida a m university annuals than is their prided football graduate willie galimore of the chicago bears no amount of praise is too lavish for the early negro college coaches or for that matter for the jake gaithers over the years they have developed more outstanding negro athletesthough many of them were never heard of outside the negro press and negro communitiesthan any other agency they provided an opportunity for healthy competition for play for athletic development in the face of common official disinterest and lethargy one famed negro college president whose school received hundreds of thousands of dollars annually was so callous to football that he refused to provide a training table for the athletes and other difficulties which would have broken the strength of a fullhaired samson one scans the negro college coaching ranks and finds supercoaches among them coaches whose records match or surpass those of rockne rupp leahy brown among those supercoaches were or are little eddie hurt of morgan state college baltimore cleve abbott of tuskegee henry kean of tennessee state harry jefferson of virginia state and other schools jake gaither of florida a m and johnny mclendon of tennessee state north carolina college hampton et al in this context it is interesting to note that william h lewis and w t s jackson attended a negro schoolvirginia normal and collegiate institutebefore migrating to amherst johnson c smith university and livingstone college played the first negro college football game on thanksgiving day j c smiththen called biddle collegewon the game to lincoln howard tuskegee began playing football with hampton shaw of north carolina and virginia union football quickly spread to negro colleges throughout the south and the fables told about the roughandtough roc em sockem negro stars of that era are no less fantastic and bloodcurdling and unbelievable today than similar feats credited to fielding yosts pointaminute boys bronko nagurski pudge heffelfinger et al football of course was merely one sport the negro colleges played all of the popular games baseball basketball boxing track and field adding as time passed tennis swimming a bit of golf but no known polo often particularly in the early days equipment was inferior and the depth of onfield talent and coaching was no match for that of the caucasian schools but the zeal was there the players had a ball and so did the fans arkansas baptist college and tuskegee were early greats in baseball arkansas baptist was undefeated during the season during tuskegee won games and lost only three not a few negro baseball as well as football and basketball stars moved from college into semiprofessional and professional games satchel paige claims to have matriculated at tuskegee a few weeks he is also credited with having attended knoxville college or months wherehe has saidhe sang with the quartet tuskegee also pioneered a good grade of tennis in the early days and the negro colleges even in our time play an important role in the development of this game althea gibson attended florida a m university as financial conditions improved negro colleges built gymnasiums football stadiums tennis courts baseball diamonds and a few installed swimming facilities hampton students were blessed with a waterfront campus in recent years particularly since when the supreme court outlawed segregation in southern education statesupported negro colleges have built physical education plants equal or superior to those of similarsized caucasian colleges of the south and north grambling in louisiana tennessee state florida a mto cite threeare excellent examples of this trend negro colleges

wilma rudolph and the tigerbelles of tennessee state the tuskegee team won the national aau womens track and field championship in the athletic world was just beginning to become accustomed to the onslaught of male negro athletes on records and to negro champions in sports says edwin henderson when the tuskegee girls bolted up from the south it is conservative to say that press dispatches created a sensation the first athletic association among negro schools was organized in in washington d c it was called the interscholastic athletic association of the middle atlantic states members were an unusual combination of colleges and high schools their first event a track and field meetwas held at howard university on may a few years later several negro college conferences sprouted among them the colored intercollegiate athletic association southern intercollegiate athletic conference midwestern athletic association and southwestern athletic conference these conferences established rules of control and conduct arranged schedules and in other ways gave the negro college athletic programs a form of organization never before evident among the leading organizers of negro college conferences were charles h williams of hampton ciaa e m walker of haven miss teachers college south central athletic conference organized in j c williams of cheyney pa teachers college middle atlantic athletic association r b atwood of kentucky state college mwaa w b metcalf and e c silsby of talladega in alabama and b t harvey of morehouse si a a and d c fowler of texas college swaa these organizations inaugurated and stimulated interconference competition as well as increased intraconference competition established a system of maintaining records and sparked the citing of national champions americas second oldest postseason football bowl gamethe prairie view bowl game started by prairie view college of texas was first played in but the biggest bowl game in the history of negro colleges is the orange blossom classic sponsored each year by florida a m and played annually in miamis orange bowl stadium the organization of conferences brought another important development tournaments and championships both regional and national public interest in negro college play was whetted by negro newspapers the first permanent negro newspaper sports section was founded by frank a fay young and the chicago defender through the years all substantial negro newspapers have developed sports sections among the most sportsconscious publications were or are the defender pittsburgh

progressive wrong fan club and the los angeles sentinel prominent negro magazinesparticularly ebony and jethave devoted much space to the reporting or featuring of negro sports activities during the s jet magazine became the first negro publication to promote an interracial allamerica team including the best negro and white players in both negro and caucasian schools without regard to race or region among the most appreciative athletes honored by jet were caucasian gridders from southern schools in order to develop relations with the press negro colleges too have hired sports publicists fewif any college sports publicists in the nation surpass the talent or production of florida a ms charles j smith gramblings collie nicholson and tennessee states earl s clanton in negro america of late many racial organizations have formed the habit of removing the words negro or colored from their organizational titlesthe controversial theory being that racialtagging lessens the worth and effectiveness of these groups in democratic society the colored intercollegiate athletic association following this trend became the central intercollegiate athletic association from the ciaas th anniversary brochure one learns a great deal about how sports began and grew not only in ciaa schools but in all negro colleges the early history of the central intercollegiate athletic association was tempered by a conscious effort to control athletics and intercollegiate competition says frank w render ii in an article allen washington and c h williams of hampton institute earnest j marshall of howard university george johnson of lincoln university w e atkins charles r fraser and h p hargrave of shaw university and j w barco and j w pierce of virginia union university met at hampton in creating the genesis of the association which was then known as the colored intercollegiate athletic association in addition to the original colleges virginia seminary and college lynchburg and virginia normal and industrial institute now virginia state college at petersburg joined the ciaa during its first decade as late as the conference had an annual expenditure of less than but the conference was tightknit had firm resolute leadership in the founders and w a rogers va normal w r brown hampton l l watson howard f j rogers shaw and t l puryear va normal athletic buffs of the midtwenties will not forget the realization of the firm unquestionable establishment of the ciaa when the conference proved that it was stronger than any one member institution and would not fold the howardlincoln controversy with the ciaa which resulted in the withdrawal of howard from the league until gave evidence to the strength of the association which by this time had admitted st pauls a t and j s smith to membership virginia seminary and livingstone college salisbury n c resigned from the conference in the latter having been admitted only a year earlier north carolina state now north carolina college at durham bluefield w va state teachers college and morgan state baltimore were admitted during this period when the country was troubled with the beginnings of farreaching financial problems creating the great depression the ciaa survived the nationwide monetary decline and before it was over st augustines college had come into the fold the bitter mixed with the sweet a historic session of ciaa officials meeting at virginia state college voted for the suspension of lincoln university pa in february for violating a conference regulation the institution was reinstated in september of the same year the field of sports broadened for ciaa schools although football basketball and track have almost unwavering popularity baseball and tennis were in their heyday while boxing and wrestling were relatively new sports the conference became affiliated with the american olympic association in having joined the national collegiate athletic association in still the ciaa exercised its aim to keep its members in line and when in morgan state was found guilty of not honoring a league regulation the college was suspended war was the issue in the early forties when west virginia state was admitted as the ciaa extended to its western limit the second great worldencompassing conflict depleted the athletic ranks of all colleges and particularly some of the colleges with limited enrollment a special meeting of ciaa representatives convened at morgan in may and september after which league rules were modified so that colleges could use all available men in their respective athletic programs after the war ended in the original regulations were again enforced delaware state and winstonsalem entered the ciaa and athletes became more plentiful during the postwar period in current history racial integration helped the west virginia members move into their state college league west virginia state left the ciaa in after producing nearlyunbeatable basketball teams and bluefield slipped out in leaving a history of rockhewn football powerhouses but not before fayetteville n c state and maryland state entered in to give the ciaa its greatest number of members extending miles northsouth from and just west of philadelphia almost to south carolina and miles eastwest from the atlantic coast to the heart of the west virginia coal region lincoln one of the original five dropped intercollegiate football and resigned from the conference in with the most recent addition elizabeth n c city the ciaa sustains a membership of colleges and universities the conference is operated through its officers and the newlyestablished office of the commissioner former coaching great harry jefferson located at hampton institute as founder williams stated probably the ciaas greatest contribution has been its pioneer work in promoting clean vigorous amateur athletics and high standards of sportsmanship this work has been in a field fraught with wonderful possibilities not only has it helped to give the public a finer appreciation of young men and women giving them some elementary conception of the fundamental truth that the great results in this world are attained only when men work loyally and heartily together for the attainment of a common end the history of the ciaafirst and oldest of the major college athletic conferences among negroesspans a most significant eraof sports development among negroes at the beginning this conference or association and all others like it experienced hunger pangs as it sought to survive it overcame personality and political problems as it sought to build soundly it worked without the advantages of unlimited budgets great press mills in all the handicaps of discrimination andor segregation yet today the ciaa like virtually all the negro conferencesboasts notable success in integrated competition including olympic games and ciaa officials watch proudly as negro college athletes star in professional sports among the ciaa graduates are johnny sample of maryland state college and the pittsburgh steelers roosevelt brown of morgan state college and the new york giants and john baker of north carolina college and the philadelphia eagles these athletes and fellow graduates and many more like them from other negro college campuses have perhaps done more than any other group to familiarize the general american public with the basic existence at least of the negro schools some schoolssuch as morgan state tennessee state florida a m have achieved general public recognition on the strength of their performance within purely conference competition but more important these three schools and many more are today recognized and respected throughout the nation if not the world because of their notable athletic achievements outside the restricted world of jim crow competition grambling college which rode to popular recognition on the sturdy shoulders of former los angeles rams fullback paul tank younger is now a must stop on the itinerary of many professional scouts the college baseball squadscoached by the president himself dr r w e jones have sent many players into organized professional competition in the summer of three grambling players signed bonus contracts totaling more than grambling football and basketball teams also are quite productive of starring pros florida a m is another negro school productive of great pros no longer do caucasian daily newspaper writers blink their puzzled eyes and ask wheres that when a negro athlete says he hails from famu or grambling or prairie view or morgan or maryland state or any one of the other schools which are today prominent in athletics negro college athletes are getting around and theyre making their presence felt all the way from the naia to rome and on to tokyo im glad im not color crazy anyone who has t f been aware of color all his life in one way or another the idea of living without knowledge that color other than ones own exists no doubt is difficult to imagine yet that is how my life started until well into my school years i was unaware that all humans were not more or less the same color as myself before i went to school i learned to believe the bible including that wonderful piece god who made of one blood all peoples of the earth although my schooling was designed to instill the supremacy of the british race whatever that is it was not very successful according to that schooling niggers or natives were the inhabitants of far countries that worked at a lower living standard than we did and helped maintain ours when white men first landed in africa the natives called them paleface but all this was like learning the battle of hastings it didnt convey anything very real we had never seen niggers the most i could gather was that they were people with black faces nigger meant black and we were whiteskinned that puzzled me because i thought we looked more pink but when color was discussed we were always white how black is black i always wondered to us black man nigger or negro all meant the same nigger was derived from nigerthe river where most niggers originatedor thats how we learned it negro was the spanish form we were english so we said nigger as simple as that sometimes we saw nigger minstrel shows but these were mostly white men made up with theatrical grease paint to look like negroes wed never heard them called negro minstrels we enjoyed the music though any one who knew real negro music would have thought the imitation rather poor but to us it was good occasionally we glimpsed colored people but never had any close acquaintance with them our first real contact was when we made our first trip to america we needed someone to look after our house while we were gone and my wife met a colored woman just arrived from jamaica who was looking for somewhere to live she was grateful to accept the opportunity of living in our home until we came back while she could look for permanent living quarters for herself and her family and it solved our problem she seemed a nice enough person and she looked after the house very well but shortly after we got back i mentioned that my only previous knowledge of people with color different from my own had been nigger minstrel shows to have said negro minstrel would have seemed quite unnatural but because i said nigger minstrel that was the end of what could have continued a happy relationship to her the word nigger could only be coupled with the word hate we could not convince her that we dont hate anyone least of all because of their skin color that taught us one important lesson avoid the word nigger not everyone learned it the way we did the next contact was much happier theodore had married a white girl my wife was talking to his wife about religion and it came out that theodore believed that god was going to use communism to work out his will for mankind my wife talked to him without much success so she took me to see them all the communists i had ever talked to had no place for god theodore was on the wrong track if he thought god would use godless communism to serve him not only was theodore mixed up about this he had been reading literature put out by an african in britain league purporting to protest against color discrimination true color discrimination did exist but this literature had to trump up some situations that werent discrimination just to make colored people mad which annoyed me cases like the railway worker who came from jamaica and couldnt get a job because he didnt have the right union ticket when i pointed this out theodore realized that a white man could not have gotten the job either without the ticket it had nothing to do with color there were many more cases quite similar union rules werent formulated to keep colored people out they were formulated to keep anyone out who wasnt a union member on the communism issue theodore had views more difficult to dislodge in a very short time both of us had forgotten there was any color difference between us i am sure each of us recognized in the other an earnestness born of wanting to know the truth we argued strongly at times because each of us felt he was right and had to convince the other but each of us was also prepared to back down if really proven wrong the battle went on for weeks during which we developed quite an affection for one another sincere people can appreciate one another even if they differ and even if their skins have different colors theodore was a handsome man as dark a brown as ive ever seen i remember thinking that whites who are antinegro must be that way because theyre jealous i still think that is a big part of it deep down theodore conceded point after point first that god didnt need to use communism and finally that communism is antigod and a force that is out to exploit the masses of people in a way far worse than any capitalist system has ever done i was no capitalist supporter i know capitalism has its faults but these are nothing compared to what a totalitarian state can bring in the way of exploitation today many years later theodore is the worst enemy communism has he can smell out communists he knows all the arguments he snatches the rug right from under he must turn away more members from communism than ten communists working full time can convert not long before my wife and i emigrated to america we volunteered our home to accommodate a family of colored missionaries who had been working in nigeria for over twenty years they brought messages from many people back in nigeria who had relatives and friends in london working or going through college they asked our permission to invite all these people to our home one evening quite a party it wasone well never forget as long as we live our own friends in the same situation would have got on with delivering messages exchanging gossip and forgotten all about their hostsit was none of their business anyway these people were not just courteous because they met in our home they didnt want us to feel left out with every piece of news they took time to explain all the details so we would know what it was all about just as if we had known them all their lives that evening we got a picture of the life and the people in nigeria that i wish many of our neighbors could have hada warm living picture that made us feel it was part of our world not something strange and remote everyone present except my wife and i had skin some shade of brown but this was quickly forgotten in the interest of the conversation some had musical instruments with them and we were treated to some real african music we quickly realized how phony were the whiteman imitationsand these people werent even professionals the strangest moment for me that evening was when i went to the bathroom and caught sight of my own face in the mirror after talking to people all with skins some shade of brown my own face suddenly seemed so pale i remember leaning toward my reflection and muttering paleface later the neighborhood had quite an argument among themselves about us some even wanted to make representations to the town hall about us entertainingniggers we solved the matter for themand made their lives dull again by emigrating with white people we often get into a discussion about the segregationintegration issue we meet a proportion who think the nigger needs keeping in his place when a man has expressed himself that way i keep him in his placeout of my company i have no ambition to travel in the south i would not trust myself not to start something by getting mad at those idiotic whites down there who believe niggers are an inferior race there are so many decent people that weve come to hate segregation of any sortnot only of color but of religion nationality or anything else whenever i have to fill in a form with a space to check white or colored i wince i do whats expected check white but i hate it im not a lepermy skin is pink pale but pink im not proud of its color and i dont think it matters but that word white looks as if a segregationist prepared the form when i tell people im not for integration because i dont think there should ever have been segregation to want integrating they often dont get my point theyll go on to ask what i think about intermarriages if there never had been segregation there never would have been an intermarriage question naturally men marry women and women marry menif this is intermarriage im in favor of it but since there is segregation the question of intermarriage does arise i think its a personal one i happened to marry a pinkskinned girl before id met one of darker color that i liked well enough to give it a thought so i dont have to answer the question for myself but i know this if i had met a girl who was what i expect of the girl who would be my wife and she had dark skin it wouldnt bother me in the least id have to know my pink skin didnt bother her either then if we were married and some people wanted to exclude me from their circle of friends or wanted to accept me without my wife that would suit me fine it would save me the trouble of excluding them from my circle of friends there are enough decent people in the world that i dont have to bother about the friendship of the other kind in fact we have in our circle of acquaintance quite a few mixed couples theres nothing mixed about them to us how about working with colored people well my work has brought me in contact with many over recent years the ones i like best are the ones who do a good days work and forget about skin color and let me do the same i hope they get the same pay anyone would get for the job if they dont ill do anything to help put that matter right it was in new york i saw another side to this a colored man who couldnt let me forget his color he was a good tool maker and i needed a tool made i knew because he made tools for me before that he could do a good precision fast dependable job but this time we were depending on him and like the transport workers union when people are depending on transport to do their christmas shopping this man chose just that time to make an issue pay wasnt the issue the job was urgent and we would have met any reasonable demand that would have gotten the job done no we needed the job done and that was his reason to highjack us because of his color he wanted to prove we couldnt fire him new york city has an ordinance to prevent discrimination of any kind so he was right about that and nobody wanted to argue it with him anyway but he lost the job his tardiness lost the company an important contract and all of us were out of a job he called me discriminatory because i would not give him a reference conscientiously i could have recommended himhis work was good when hed do it but he refused to see that his action had not only cost him his job but ours as well if hed conceded that and given me hope that he might have learned his lesson id have given him a reference with a clear conscience color had nothing to do with itexcept as he made it another colored man who worked with me felt his color was against him he was no slower at learning than anyone who is just beginning a new job my boss wanted me to let him go i knew the main trouble was that the man was discouraged with himself let him go and hed stay that way for life most likely you dont have to be colored for that to happen he stayed and became another good worker he learned to forget about skin colorin his work anyway but at the beginning there he was convinced his color made him slow he had done what many doaccepted the false evaluation that a few whites put on coloreds often i encounter this a colored person talks to me as if because im white i think myself superior then hes out to show me hes as good as i am he doesnt have to this whole business of superior and inferior makes me sick everyone is different men are different from women thank goodnesshow dull it would be otherwise lets accept it that way without having to try and prove women are equal to men men will never have the babies they are neither superior nor inferior just different people are different and there are certain racial traits or tendencies that mark a general difference between people with pink or brown skins the negro race has a culture that many whites would give their eye teeth for but they just werent born to it so were different why cant we just enjoy one another patriarch undaunted last spring bulldozers l g and other heavy equip ment approached an l d universi y camp us like a small army marching out to meet a foe but this was a march of progress a part of the kansas city kansas urban renewal plan western university buildings are coming down and a much needed old folks home will rise in its place something of the schools history i walked about its grounds last fall the wind made an eerie sound blowing through the windowless dormitories but the scarlet oaks and the statue of john brown seemed as undaunted as john walker the little snowyhaired man who planted them years ago on the porch of walkers home across the street he rested momentarily then went back to raking leaves with his usual vigor despite the fact that he is years old here almost in the shadow of the school john walker has spent most of his life always seeking improvements for quindaro community and its people a son of former slaves he came to kansas city from mississippi in then a child of nine barefooted and hungry but with visions of real freedom he came with his father and cousin traveling up the mississippi by steamboat to st louis and by freight to kansas slavery had ended but its memories were fresh johns father had been a shoe maker on a large plantation a trade that proved very useful he opened a repair shop in old quindaro and prospered preceding the war in its proximity to the missouri river and parkville old quindaro was a well known link in the underground railroad which slaves traveled to freedom at about the time john arrived eban blachley a presbyterian minister came also with the farseeing wisdom that recognized the need to educate the recently freed negro john at tended this oneroom stone school some eighty years ago when blachley died the rev w t vernon took his place rev vernon was afterwards registrar of the u s treasury and bishop of the ame church in a political campaign in he rendered valiant service on the stump for governor w e standley and it was decided that something should be done for vernons school out of this came western university fifteen acres were deeded to the state on which to construct buildings for the operation of a state industrial school the cornerstone was laid by the colored masonic lodge where john then a postman was a member hundreds of students poured in from every state in the union aside from a liberal education they were trained in wood work mechanics carpentry stenography tailoring music theology and cooking and sewing john walker kept a close eye on the school when he delivered mail he was pleased with the curriculum but it bothered him that the grounds surrounding the school continued to have a look of squalor not green and wellkept like other campuses one day he told his wife and children it will mean a cut in salary but i am going to work for the school i am going to teach our people the value of beauty and orderliness and he told me that was but one of the reasons i wanted to work at the school my own schooling was very limited in my youth it wasnt unusual to see grown men and women learning to read and cipher but i have always had a hunger for learning and the greatest respect for schools where ever i was employed i tried to learn as much as possible for instance at swift packing co i persuaded an engineer to teach me to read blueprints from my father i learned to repair shoes and to cut hair and i figured i could learn a lot more at western i am sure john was right about this for during the years between and when the institution thrived with an enrollment of students he rose from caretaker to general overseer and advisor and according to many of the students this man used all his accumulated knowledge for the betterment of the school flowers and trees were planted and grass and scrubs took shape said mrs kanzetta burnell former student and principal of the public school which finally replaced the university but he taught us more important things than this most of the students were poor and the school had to get by on insufficient funds to offset some of this john cut the students hair repaired shoes and raised vegetables for our tables on part of the land when it became necessary that a new wing be added to the girls dormitory he went to topeka for additional funds and when it was granted he laid the brick with the help of the young men after awhile no matter what one was looking for or what one wanted to know all inquiries led to the same answer see john walker no wonder he is dear to the heart of this woman for it was john that brought her to the attention of dean alexander jones when she arrived to attend western in desiring to complete my schooling she said i worked and saved for three years prior to my coming here at the end of those three years i had saved the unbelievable sum of and some change with the encouragement of two friends who promised me free room and board near the school i mustered up the nerve to go out to western with trembling fingers i laid my seven dollars before the principal for a few minutes he was so shocked he couldnt speak then he said dear heart is this what you plan to pay your tuition with if so i must inform you that this wouldnt keep you here a week just when my knees felt as though they had turned to butter john walker appeared now dont you worry he told me hurrying off to find dean jones the dean then arranged tutoring jobs that enabled me to graduate with certificates for completion of high school normal school and one in domestic arts john watched these young men and women going out into every state to teach and become all sorts of leaders in their communities this and with the schools background it seemed fitting to him thatif a monument to john brown were to be erected anywhereit should be on the grounds of western under his leadership the members of the ame church where john was a member collected for the statue and it was sculptured in italy according to many people including one county commissioner john has been responsible for many of quindaros paved streets and utilities many citizens in and around kansas city still remember the walker military band a school band that became so popular under johns leadership that the musicians federation local made him an honorary lifetime member johns son played the saxophone and the clarinet in this band and today has a band of his own his daughter shares her fathers love for schools and is a teacher in the kansas city missouri school system despite his age john still keeps the ground around the statue trimmed and neat in december the city of quindaro set aside one day known as john walker day to honor this man who has given so much of himself and the hundreds of cards and letters received through the years from almost every state is testimony that he is remembered elsewhere as well tress past the window the white chrysler given him by his congregation bushnells first car with power steering and it handled beautifully a splen np l i did token of recognition to commemorate ten smoothly running was dr years during which under his leadership the church mortgage had been burned the new car responded readily to his touch like the power of god he thought instantly available to all who call upon it dr bushnell remembered the first car he had driven it was sold for junk he remembered his first church and the stamping of feet on the rough oiled boards as the congregation filed in now his welldressed congregation glided in soundlessly reverently over the thick pile of carpeting he had a nice home too at his first church he and mary were treated like natives on a mission field their home furnished with handmedown odds and ends from the attics of all the church members he remembered how bravely mary thanked the ladies aid society for the living room curtains exactly what i would have chosen myself she said as trees flying past the window indicated speed so did fleeting recollections give dr bushnell a sense of progress a feeling that he had come a long way he did not relish the call he was to make now but the service of the lord sometimes includes distasteful details dr bushnell had always managed to dispose of them quickly and move on to more constructive things he could still see peter randolph redfaced as he came banging into the ministers study just before the morning service it was just like peter who once had the audacity the complete lack of taste to get up at a meeting of the deacons and offer to pay for a year of church bulletins in return for a small commercial announcement on the bottom of page three then when one of the deacons objected peter randolph went ahead goodnaturedly and donated the cost of a years church bulletins anyway no strings attached you had to respect a man like that it would have to be peter randolph who would come bursting into the ministers study others may have whispered anxiously to each other but only peter acted standing there feet well apart as though bracing himself for a fight peter demanded did you know there are two colored boys in the sunday school somehow the subtler points of religion had always been lost on peter but he was a loyal and hardworking member for all that a fine fund raiser they are gods children too dr bushnell pointed out gods children or not either you get them out of the sunday school or ill leave mr randolph threatened and dont think ill go alone when i go ill take half the congregation with me this church will be split apart as youve never seen it split before as shepherd i will protect my flock from harm dr bushnell replied when a lion threatened his fathers flocks young david rose up and slew the lion the comparison was a bit melodramatic dr bushnell realized why did peter have to get so excited everything could be handled simply its just a little detail ive smoothed out other awkward situations dr bushnell reminded him self as he turned his car off the main road and down a narrow lane hedged by a thick growth of untrimmed trees they made him think of other trees the tree in the garden of eden the great oak on whose branches the vain absaloms hair became entangled the fig tree that would not bear fruit and was cursed the tree from which the cross was hewn though near his church the area was unfamiliar to him and he slowed the car twice before he found haddock road a lean dog roused itself from the middle of the road as the car approached dr bushnell stopped in front of a shack just like a big box he thought he checked his watch placing his bible inconspicuously under one arm he started up a dirt path through a lawn that was mostly weeds then he paused retraced his steps and locked the car doors in front of the small house he hesitated a moment there was no doorbell and he wondered where to knock before he could decide a young negro woman opened the door for him her appearance slight and frail was somehow not at all what he had anticipated and he felt vaguely resentful at having been surprised reverend bushnell we did not expect you to visit us she said he sat on a chair and she sat on an upholstered crate opposite him she did the upholstering herself he thought and wondered if he should compliment her on her ingenuity he decided it was safer not to notice the furnishings he ran his fingers over the gilt edges of his bible there were marked passages in it he could read if the conversation became too awkward but most of all the worn wellread bible gave him something to do with his nervous restless hands your two boys have been at my sunday school he began and was surprised that his voice sounded sharp yes they liked it so much and they already have their memory work completed they told me i am very glad to hear that they profited from their visit dr bushnell said at divinity school he had always gotten along well with the cook he was the one the other students picked to wheedle betweenthemeal snacks there was a formula for getting along with such people treat them very politely put them at ease and they will be forever grateful but this woman seemed already at ease and his courteous manner did not impress her the cook had averted her eyes from his this woman sat her slender body very straight her eyes focused directly on his incidentally how did you happen to send your boys to our sunday school he asked i dont know reverend bushnell i guess its just that its so close they can walk walk it seems a long way to walk much too far they should trips to the colored church with your boys and may god bless you the mother of the two boys sat motionless her face showing no expression he held the paper money out at arms length obviously the woman needed money badly the poorly furnished room was evidence of this surely she would soon lift one of those limp hands and accept it the whole room spun about the ten dollar bill was its vortex he did not mean to be waving the money in front of her nose but his hand was unsteady she did not stir i insist he said we will call it a scholarship a reward for the outstanding work your two fine sons have completed in our sunday school the woman shook her head slowly i cannot accept it rev bushnell i just couldnt cannot accept dr bushnell did not see how she could possibly refuse if your prefer instead of the money we could arrange for passes on the local bus the woman still shook her head dr bushnell had preached on false pride now he saw it before his eyes a woman who put her own pride before the needs of her children you should consider your boys he said their spiritual welfare i do she said i sent them to sunday school for a long moment dr bushnell could say nothing he searched his mind for some note of conciliation i do admire your spirit he said finally and was surprised to realize that this was true for a horrible instant he had a fantastic image of himself standing up to peter randolph and saying i cannot accept your money he put his wallet away and fumbled for his bible let us close this meeting with a prayer he said it was his custom to pray before leaving any home a custom he had not broken for years this time the familiar words that had flowed forth freely so often simply did not come he saw himself as he must look to this woman the glimpse vanished and could not be recalled but suddenly it was desperately important to be understood he wanted to cry out im not what i seem to be he had to explain instead he found himself saying its later than i realized i have another call to make he was outside the door if there is anything i can ever do to help he turned to say more but the door had closed he raised a fist to knock on the door to call back the moment his hand dropped he knew there was nothing he could say he walked to his car unlocked the door and slid into the seat his hands trembled at first on the wheel but as the new car sped away he had a sense of power and wellbeing while trees like sudden insights flashed past the window and were gone forever the night of the senior ball graduation of course i remember how i felt it was thirty years ago ive made thirty million dollars since then but graduating from highschool is the big one sonny and i remember it all there is something tragic and magnificent about a highschool graduation do you know that youth balancing upon the brink of the abyss of maturity all of them eager some of them afraid and you and i know that growing up is a hard scuffle at best and the ones who will acquire all of the lovely and beautiful things that they have always dreamed about will be few and oh god you want to warn them just because you are older and watching them is like reliving ancient pain do you remember when the old folks tried to tell us but living is a substance that must be handled daily and alone and none of us ever realize how heroic we have been did you ever lay down your life flat and try to see the entire flatness with the little hills of pain and love and pleasure and joy buttoning it all together seeing it with wonder and a funny kind of amused dismay you think why did i ever want this so badly and how did i ever stand up under that but you did and you face the rest of it quietly a bit warily with your inner emotions more firmly established but i digress you are not interested in my philosophical whimseys you were sent up here to ask me what i remembered about my own graduation graduation it was we had had our picnic we had been given our legal cut day we had paid our dues we wandered about look ing nonchalant we clad in somber robes and wearing clipboard caps formed that fantastic line and walked forth into the lighted ritual of graduation night and afterward we had our ball when i got out of college i was a man grown with four years of hard work behind me both in the social and the academic fields and i was merely impatient to go on with what i had started but when i was seventeen it was all so new do you know what i mean i was new gallant shining cleareyed neither my body nor my soul had picked up fat i was a boy wonder my god i was on the board of control i was a rally boy i was busy with track and a little baseball i knew the pretty girls i was the boy that one reads about in adolescent novels i remember feeling very very capable and it was easy to move about in those days i felt in control of everything i never gave war and panic and death a thought my world was limited you see and my parents happily married the senior ball the girls who looked so different in their flimsy gowns with their hair all up and their ears all decorated and those delicate slippers on their feet the boys on their best behavior in bladelike black and starched white with slickered hair and new watchbands gleaming the feel of the evening air and the lights and the muted music and the sound of frailly slender smelling of soap and appleblossoms we danced so formally i could hear the voices i could feel the eyes i had brought something to life in the room and when cora and i finished dancing i knew that this act was an impetus there was nothing that i could not do when i call my wife and tell her that i will not be home for dinner on our anniversary or if i must manipulate the market a bit in order to sweeten a stock or if i intend to enrage the president of the united states or if i thumbdown a twentymillion dollar deal well then i simply recall that intimate important lovely occurrence and i realize that nothing in this world has ever proved to be as difficult to perform as the dance that i danced with cora cora herself why shes a writer she has six great strapping sons you fool dont you realize that it took just as much guts for her to get up and dance with me do american negroes have what africa needs slnce world war ii there has been much talk about the contributions which american negroes could or might make to the social development of africa this is natural since though american negroes were stripped of their african cultural heritage and have become a biologically mixed group the fact of their african origin has not been erased from their minds american negroes have been sent to africa as missionaries especially by negro churches to help in the christianization of the african moreover negro religious organizations have established and helped to support schools in africa many of the africans who have come to the united states to receive an education have studied in negro schools in fact two of the outstanding african leaderskwame nkrumah and nnamdi azikiwereceived most of their advanced education in negro institutions in the united states more recently american negroes have been sent to africa by the american government as technical assistants and as members of commissions concerned with economic and social reconstruction in africa nevertheless much of the talk about the contributions of american negroes to the development of africa rests upon sentimental grounds or represents a type of wishful thinking it is for this reason that i shall undertake a critical analysis and an evaluation of the potential contributions which american negroes could or might make to the social development of africa i let us begin with the contributions which american negroes could or might make within the general field of economics the various territories of africa like the other nonindustrialized countries of the world need capital in order to lay the foundation for modern states in order to secure the necessary capital africa must turn to the industrialized european nations or to the united nations if a fund is ever set up to aid the industrialization of the noneuropean areas of the world to what extent one may ask are the american negroes able to provide any capital for the development of africa the answer is negative and the reasons why this is true are clear the negroes of the united states are poor and they do not occupy positions of influence in the financial institutions which could supply the capital which africa needs during the past decade or so there has been much fanfare about the economic wellbeing of american negroes and the wealth which they have accumulated but upon examination it turns out that the claim that negroes are economically welloff or have accumulated wealth is a myth cherished by negroes and fostered as a part of the propaganda designed to show that negroes have not fared badly in the united states only during the past two decades has a class of negroes emerged in the united states with incomes sufficient to maintain middle class standards of living the new negro middle class is composed almost entirely of professional and technical workers who are selfemployed or salaried whitecollar workers and the more highly paid skilled workers this class includes also a sprinkling of persons engaged for the most part in small businesses in the south about an eighth of the negro population is able to maintain middle class standards while in the north and west where negroes enjoy greater economic and social freedom a fourth of the negro population can be included in the middle class although in the north the average income of negroes is per cent higher than the average income of negroes in the south their average income in the north is only twothirds that of whites moreover negro business enterprises both in the north and in the south are on the whole oneman businesses conducted with a small amount of capital in fact negro businesses are no more important in the american economy and to the employment and income of negroes than they were in when the myth of negro business as a means to economic and social salvation was institutionalized in the national negro business league negroes are neither captains of industry nor holders of any important positions in the management of the industrial and the financial institutions in the united states they are not even owners of stocks and bonds of the great american enterprises therefore negroes as a group are poor and unable to provide africa with the capital which is needed there although all this is true it still may be asked can american negroes provide the managerial ability and the technical skills which africa needs in building a modem economy the answer to this question has been partly given in what was said about the negros position in the american economy the managerial experience of negroes has been limited almost entirely to small negro businesses this experience has been narrow and restricted even in the largest negro enterprises the negro insurance companies and negro newspapers at the present time negroes are beginning to get some experience for example in the sales division of corporations which manufacture and distribute cigarettes and whiskey but this experience has been too brief and restricted to make any contribution to the problem of management which africans are facing in assuming control of their economical life in fact the africans themselves have gained a larger experience with their marketing boards and cooperatives on the west coast of africa than american negroes have had in their small businesses with reference to technical skill the answer to the question posed above requires more attention especially if scientific methods of agriculture are included in technical skills american negroes have been engaged in teaching scientific methods of agriculture in some parts of africa they have succeeded very well in making available to africans new techniques of agriculture and in helping africans to solve some of their agricultural problems on the other hand their contribution in providing and teaching industrial skills has not been of much consequence there are a number of reasons for this first american negroes have only recently begun to acquire technical skills required by modern industry they have been excluded from working in many industries from becoming members of the labor unions and from attending technical schools where they could acquire technical skills for example even today negroes do not have access to any technical schoofs in the south comparable to those provided for whites moreover negroes are as completely excluded from working in the textile industry in the south today as they were when the textile industry was first established in the south in fact in tropical africa the africans are employed in more of the skilled occupations than negroes are in the united states in the united states there are practically no negroes employed as engineers conductors and brakemen on trains and the employment of negroes as firemen on locomotives has been increasingly restricted it is a rare sight to see a negro employed as a telegrapher in the united states it appears therefore that during the process of industrialization of africa africans have outstripped the american negro in the acquisition of industrial skills ii we turn next to consider the contributions which american negroes may make to the political development of africa here again one must evaluate the potential contribution of american negroes in terms of their knowledge experience and skills despite the fact that negroes have lived in a socalled democratic society their experience with political matters has been extremely limited during the short reconstruction period in the south negroes gained considerable experience from participation in politics and produced some astute political leaders twentytwo negro congressmen and two senators were elected to the congress of the united states but after less than a decade of participation in southern politics negroes were largely eliminated from politics and beginning in they were completely disfranchised participation on the part of negroes in american politics was not resumed on a large scale until after the mass migrations to northern cities during and following the first world war as the result of the new political position of negroes in the north there are three negro members of the national congress not to mention the negro judges members of city councils and northern state legislatures moreover since the supreme court of the united states has outlawed the white democratic primary in the south the number of registered negro voters has more than doubled during the past decade primarily however in the nonplantation areas even during their greatest participation in american politics negroes did not sit in the highest councils of the nation where policies are determined booker t washington was consulted by the presidents and other high officials of the united states but this was a sort of system of indirect rule since the negroes were politically disfranchised even under the new deal when many negroes were brought into the government they were simply advisers to whites who formulated the policies concerning negroes even today when negroes are playing an increasingly important role in politics especially in northern cities they do not occupy seats in the highest councils of the nation thus it becomes clear that american negroes do not have the experience and contacts which the african members of the french parliament have what is even more important is that american negroes have not had the experience of africans in those territories where africans have struggled to gain political power moreover american negroes have never had to assume the responsibilities which west african leaders are assuming as heads of new states the lack of education in political leadership has been due to the fact that negroes have been segregated in american life and have lacked real political power negroes have been regarded and treated as wards of the nation sometimes under the control of private philanthropic organizations and at other times under governmental agencies most of their political activities have been within the segregated negro communities and in such institutions and associations as the independent negro church organizations and the fraternal organizations as negroes have migrated to the cities of the north and have begun to participate in the political life of the american community they have become a part of the political machines which are dominated by white politicians thus they have become very adept in the devious ways of local politics in the united states but this experience has not prepared them for the statesmanship which is needed in africa today moreover negroes lack any political philosophy except a narrow opportunism which is more or less effective in local situations where they exercise a limited power this will be considered in more detail in the next section where the question of the contribution of intellectual leadership by american negroes to the social development of africa will be analyzed ill under the heading of intellectual leadership we shall consider american negroes with professional and scientific training as well as leaders of thought in the arts philosophy and the social sciences in dealing with this subject it is necessary to consider first the nature of the education of the socalled intellectual class after emancipation was the result of missionary efforts on the part of whites principally from new england who were fired by an idealistic faith in the intellectual capacity of negroes they met with stubborn opposition on the part of southern whites but through the support of northern philanthropy which represented the triumphant industrial capitalism of the north they were able to carry on their work northern philanthropy was not however inspired by the same idealistic fervor which inspired many of the missionaries who set up schools for negroes in the south they were more concerned with coming to terms with southern whites and having a peaceful environment for their investments within the ranks of the whites who were interested in the education of negroes there developed a sharp cleavage between those who advocated industrial education and those who stood for higher education for the negro the conflict between the two schools of thought was not simply over the question of negro education the conflict went deeper because it was really concerned with conflicting ideas over the status of the negro in the new south booker t washington who built tuskegee institute and became the chief proponent of industrial education was supported by most of the white philanthropists of the north the program of industrial education for negroes involved much more than technical education as a matter of fact the socalled industrial education of negroes was never designed to equip them to compete with white workers in the industrial south the opposition of w e b du bois the foremost champion of the higher education of negroes to the socalled industrial education of the negro was based upon the fact that this industrial education was only a symbolic expression of a policy of racial segregation and subordination of the negro in the south negro schools that continued to offer higher education were generally denied support by northern white philanthropists and foundations until the second decade of the twentieth century when the northward migration of negroes changed their relation to american life nevertheless the majority of negro intellectuals received their college education in the negro schools that were devoted to higher education this is still largely true despite the increasing numbers of negroes who are attending colleges and universities in the north the fact that the majority of negro intellectuals have received their college education in the segregated schools of the south has not failed to leave its mark upon the outlook of negro intellectuals it is only since negroes have been attending northern colleges and universities in large numbers that they have acquired the type of scientific knowledge and professional competence that could be of service in the social development of africa for example one highly trained american negro in the field of tropical medicine dr hildrus poindexter has rendered distinguished service in africa but the number of such trained men is smaller than africans of similar training then too american negroes with firstrate scientific training are being utilized by the united states besides being academically inferior to the colleges and universities of the north the segregated negro college has been dominated by a narrow religious tradition and a puritanical outlook that have restricted the intellectual development of negroes moreover these schools have tended to foster a type of respectability and snobbishness that has alienated negro intellectuals from the masses the emphasis has been upon the uncritical imitation of white standards of behavior and the surviving values of the slaveholding aristocracy and more recently upon the values of the white middle classes however since the negro intellectuals are rejected by the white middle classes and are forced to share many of the disabilities of the negro masses they have developed an ambivalent attitude towards negroes even negro intellectuals who have received a broader education in the north and have gained a more cosmopolitan outlook exhibit the same ambivalent attitude towards negroes in the united states and towards africans negro intellectuals are extremely sensitive to any disparagement of negroes or africans but on the other hand they are eager to claim that they themselves are not africans or negroes but americans they place great value upon being accepted by white americans especially when the latter claim that they are unconscious that negro intellectuals are negroes or of african origin the ambivalence of the negro intellectual is intensified by the fact that a large proportion of them are of mixed blood and enjoy passing for white or being accepted as nearwhite during the negro renaissance in the s it appeared that negro intellectuals had achieved a new orientation towards their negro or african origin the negro renaissance was supposed to hail the emergence of the new negro in the literary and artistic creations of negro artists and intellectuals the new negro was new in the sense that he accepted his racial identification without apologies that he accepted the culture of the negro folk in the united states and that he faced the world with the confidence that the negro or african had the right to a role in creating a new world but as the new negro and negro intellectual were swallowed up by the new middle classes which were growing in size and importance the new orientation of the negro was lost and negro intellectuals sought only acceptance by the white world the ambivalent attitude of negro intellectuals and artists towards their negro or african background is revealed by the question which they constantly pose for themselves should the negro scientists or scholar study the negro should the negro write novels or short stories about negroes should negro painters use negro subjects after all is there any such person as a negro poet or painter generally the answers to these questions are in the negative and negro writers and artists generally protest that they are only american writers and artists and that they have no special concern with negroes there are a few exceptions of course such as langston hughes and richard wright as a result on the whole the negro intellectual and artist is sterilized by the dilemma in which he finds himself by cutting himself off from his negro or african background the negro intellectuals in the united states have never developed a philosophy as to the meaning of human existence or a social philosophy concerning the world they have naturally rejected the philosophy of resignation and submission implicit in the spirituals of the negro folk but they have failed to develop any new philosophy or meaning of existence this has been due partly to the inferior education of negro intellectuals and partly to their mental and social isolation in american life they are touched only in a superficial way by the philosophical currents in the modern world these various philosophies and schools of thought which stir men in the modem world have little or no meaning for the negro intellectual who lives in a world where the exigencies of daily living absorb his energies negro intellectuals have developed a crude philosophy of opportunism which seems to satisfy their segregated existence in the white mans world they seem to have scarcely reflected upon the great revolution which is occurring in the modem world except as it may affect their social status in the united states when one african intellectual was asked what he thought of a group of american negro intellectuals he answered that he thought they were asleep iv we come finally to the question what spiritual or moral leadership can american negroes provide africans or what cultural contributions can they make to the social development of africa the answer to this question is crucial because it conditions the possibility and quality of all other contributions any contribution which american negroes may make in the field of economics or politics is conditioned by their orientation in regard to the changes which are occurring in the modem world likewise any intellectual or professional leadership which they might provide africans is conditioned by their own interests and identification with certain systems of values it is for this reason that in our attempt to answer the questions proposed above we come to the heart of the subject of the possible contribution of american negroes to the social development of africa at the outset it was pointed out that although american negroes had been stripped of their african cultural heritage and had become a biologically mixed group the fact of their african origin had never been erased from their minds the latter part of this statement needs to be qualified for two reasons first it implies that historical memories of africa have been transmitted in the traditions of negroes and their families but this is not true the meaning intended here is that the negro has never been permitted to forget his african origin this leads us to the second reason why this statement at the beginning needs qualification one must take into account the manner in which the fact of their african origin has been communicated to negroes the first fact of importance in the heritage of the american negro is that he has never been taken seriously he has been treated as member of a child race this has been evident not only in american literature but in serious studies of negroes since as it is said negroes are a childlike race they have been shunted from the main currents of american life even the education that was provided them except as we have seen that of some idealistic missionaries was designed for an inferior human being these conditions have influenced the character of american negroes they have not been permitted to become dignified human beings and in the south especially they were expected to play the role of a fool or clown the whites would tolerate them only in this role and negroes played this role in order to surviveone might even go so far as to say that in the united states especially in the south there has been a process of dysgenesic selection from the standpoint of character building the negro who was dignified and courageous and possessed integrity was eliminated in favor of the negro who was sly cowardly and clownish foreign observers and some more thoughtful white americans who did not expect negroes to play clownish and childish roles have been puzzled by the playfulness and immaturity of negroes they have often contrasted the dignified and mature behavior of africans with the immature and childish behavior of american negroes how then would one expect american negroes to contribute to the spiritual or moral development of africans the truth of the matter is that american negroes have never been free physically or psychologically despite all the fanfare over the new status of negroes in american life they are still far from enjoying the freedom which other americans enjoy in the united states it is not necessary to recount all the limitations upon their freedom in the south where they are still segregated and where they are still the objects of physical violence there is an even more important lack of freedom which affects the contribution of american negroes to the social development of africa i refer to the lack of intellectual or spiritual freedom the schooling negroes have received in american civilization has prevented them from developing the spiritual freedom that would enable them to contribute to the social development of africans the entire separate institutional life under which negroes have lived has discouraged or prevented the development of a free and independent spiritual life the intellectual leaders of the negroes as i have pointed out have been the beneficiaries of the philanthropy of the whites but there have been other important reasons which have discouraged a free and independent spirit the two chief separate institutions in the negro community the church and the school have been organized on an authoritarian basis even the baptist churches with their local autonomy have been dominated by strong leaders of groups that have permitted little selfdirection and selfexpression on the part of their members the methodist churches with their hierarchical organizations have been dominated by bishops who were more autocratic than the russian czars the negro colleges have likewise been dominated by presidents who were backed by the absolute authority of the white community or by the autocratic authority of negro church leaders the rise of the new negro middle classes to power and importance has brought into sharp relief the conflict and confusion which result from the anomalous position of negroes in american society and seriously limit the possibility of contributions by american negroes to the social development of africa the new negro middle classes as we have already seen have a small stake in the american economy this class is composed of salaried white collar workers and professionals nevertheless the new negro middle classes have taken over the values of the wealthy white propertied classes in the united states they indulge in all forms of conspicuous consumptionexpensive homes and automobiles and luxurious forms of entertainmentall beyond their economic resources the negro press which provides a mirror of the outlook and values of the new negro middle classes has helped to create the world of makebelieve in which the middle class seeks to escape from its feeling of inferiority this feeling of inferiority is intensified because of their attempt to make themselves over into the image of whites by insisting that they are only americans while rejecting identification with negroes or africans although the negro middle classes would not openly admit their rejection of negro or african identification it is nevertheless true it was revealed for example when the editor of a leading negro newspaper stated patronizingly that negroes could now be proud of africa since ghana had become free it is also revealed when all other ethnic and racial groups in the united states on parade identify themselves with their racial or ethnic backgrounds through dress insignia etc but american negroes object to a comparable identification as negroes or as descendants of africans thus by insisting upon being only americans they become nobody there are reasons of course why american negroes insist upon being considered only americans some of these reasons have been suggested in the discussion so far we have seen for example the manner in which the negro or african has been represented in america moreover the important fact can not be overlooked that negroes in american society are a sort of ethnic wastebasket into which all persons who are not white and have no other racial or ethnic identification are dumped the census report of the united states has a category nonwhite into which all persons who are not white are placed american negroes who are largely a mixed race constitute about per cent of this negatively designated group but instead of seeking a positive identification in the traditional culture of the negro folk in the united states or in their african origin the middle classes seek to escape from their negative identification by becoming pure american the middle class intellectuals can not deceive themselves so easily as the middle classes generally therefore they exhibit considerable ambivalence in coming to terms with the world about them we have already noted how the ambivalence of the american negro has tended to sterilize him as a thinker and as an artist it is interesting to note in this connection that it is more often the white man than the negro who digs up the negros past and interprets the negros experience in the united states in a new frame of reference or in a new artistic dimension on the other hand as the result of his psychological and social isolation and his acceptance of the smugness and cheap values of the middle classes american negro intellectuals and artists seem to be ignorant or unconscious of the cultural problems which concern artists and intellectuals in the modem world they have become mere parrots or phonograph records repeating the ideas of reactionary and conservative white people there are rare exceptions like w e b du bois and paul robeson but they are considered dangerous by white people therefore middle class negroes regard them as dangerous africa is demanding an intellectual and spiritual leadership that has caught a vision of a new worlda world freed from racism colonialism and human exploitation but the new negro middle classes in the united states appear only to seek an opportunity to share in the exploitation from which they have been excluded and continue to be excluded except on an insignificant scale therefore it becomes evident that the aims and aspirations of africans in creating a new world can not be limited by the narrow aims and aspirations of the leaders of american negroes who are merely seeking acceptance in the white mans world as it is the american negro is willing to pay the terrific price of the most servile conformity to the ideas and values of white americans in order to be accepted by them but of course there is no assurance that negroes will be completely accepted in american society even if they conform with every new advance they make towards integration into american society they feel more keenly the frustration and insecurity which result from incomplete acceptance and restricted social mobility it is conceivable that in an attempt to escape from their frustration and the emptiness which they experience upon the attainment of middle class status they will turn to africa for spiritual and cultural roots the publication of this volume might be interpreted as evidence of a new orientation towards africa however there are economic and social forces which are transforming american society and the negros relation to it and which render this unlikely the integration of the negro into american society results in the increasing disintegration of the negro community and its institutions thus the very basis of a really effective cultural awakening in which negroes would find identification with africans is being destroyed an increasing number of american negroes may go to africa as advisers and specialists but they will go as americans representing american interests not african interests in fact there is evidence that middle class negroes in such positions are deriving great satisfaction from what they regard as a new status and acceptance in american society conclusion in concluding this essay i shall attempt to bring together the main points i have attempted to formulate in analyzing the factors involved in a realistic appraisal of the possible contributions of american negroes to the social development of africa first it seems clear that american negroes can not make any contribution to the economic development of africa because they lack the necessary capital and do not have positions of influence in the large financial institutions that could provide capital american negroes lack the managerial experience and skills needed in the modernization of the african economy moreover american negroes are only beginning to acquire the technical skills required in modem industry a fact which places them behind the africans in those industries dependent almost entirely upon skilled african workers likewise in the field of politics american negroes have scarcely anything to contribute to africans who have a long experience of political struggle and are assuming positions of responsibility not open to negroes in the united states but can american negroes make a contribution in the field of intellectual and professional leadership here again if one looks at the facts of the situation one must conclude that american negro intellectuals have been limited in their education and in their general outlook and therefore they have nothing to contribute to the intellectual leadership needed in the development of africa although some prefessionally trained american negroes could offer a type of knowledge which africa needs they are needed in the united states where there is an increasing demand for their skills and services the limitations of american negro intellectuals and professionals become apparent when one considers them from the standpoint of their possible contribution to the spiritual and cultural needs of africa their general outlook is dominated by the provincial and spurious values of the new negro middle classes they live in a world of makebelieve and reject identification with the cultural traditions of american negroes as well as with their african origin they seek acceptance by white americans at the price of losing all their racial and cultural identity and of being swallowed up in white america their attitude towards the future is that of the gladiators and slaves in the roman arena who cried hail caesar we who are about to die salute you on the other hand the african has a future in this world and has a place in shaping a new world as an african perhaps dr e franky lin fraziers position that there is nothing of importance which american negroes can contribute to social development in africa can be attributed to his genuine concern for africa and his chagrin that american negroes cannot contribute more be that as it may his paper while serving to bring the claims of the overzealous into focus represents a considerable overstatement of his case inadvertently it also gives support to those officials in america who for so long refused to use negroes in the foreign missions of the united states on the grounds that negroes had nothing to contribute it is true as frazier says that negroes in america are not a major source of investment either in terms of the management or possession of large amounts of capital the fact is however that one of the major sources of capital in america for investment both at home and abroad is the united states government negroes who have considerable political power in the election of the president in the united states can certainly expect that government capital will flow to the countries of their origin just as it has flowed to the countries from which other americans originated provided the national interest of the united states is involved there is moreover a growing though small negro experience in big corporations in america in the new york area alone one can name negroes who hold important positions with the leading corporations in the fields of electronics communications atomic physics chemistry mathematics publishing investment drugs engineering of many types etc the united states has changed more rapidly than frazier has realized moreover it cannot be said that such men as bunche hastie wilkins white brown weaver lloyd knox aggrey dawson wharton and wright are without political skills of a high order it should be remembered that another social scientist said in his an american dilemma that he was impressed with the political and diplomatic skills of a considerable number of trained negroes whom he met in the united states he specifically said that america was wasting a good amount of talent by not utilizing such skills in its government service and specifically in its diplomatic service in spite of what frazier says the negro college in america has produced its share of distinguished intellectuals although white northern schools have taken only those negroes with the highest secondary achievement who in addition had the resources to pay for expensive education the negro colleges have produced more negro scholars than white northern institutions frazier himself a leading american human ecologist and a past president of the american sociological association received his ab from howard university poindexter re ceived his undergraduate degree from lincoln university other distinguished scholars from similar origins include john hope franklin abram l harris kenneth clark horace mann bond leroy williams william fontaine and a host of others some of whom can be noted in the biographical data provided in this volume what is more important is that these negro colleges have produced practically all of the fighting and effective negro leadership in america w e b dubois walter white thurgood marshall robert l carter martin_luther_king ben azikiwe kwame nkrumah to name only a few frazier is of the opinion that american negro artists and writers generally protest that they are only american writers and have no special concern with negroes without exception all of the important american negro writers and artists are greatly concerned with negroes an attitude which frazier also quixotically objects to as for example augusta savage richmond barthe langston hughes richard wright ama bontemps claude mckay sterling brown bruce wright gwendolyn brooks saunders redding james baldwin ralph ellison w e b du bois ann petry and chester himes in sculpture painting poetry the novel and the essay these artists have told all humanity what it means to live under a caste system because one is black two other assertions of frazier deserve comment his statement that american negroes are of mixed descent and therefore not negroes ignores the reality of being a negro in america as well as the obvious negroid appearance of practically all negroamericans it also assumes that all the mixing occurred in america and not any of it in africa his position that american negroes have no expertness to give africa has already been refuted we have already sent engineers dieticians doctors teachers economists sociologists accountants public administrators parisitologists atomic scientists and other experts not only to africa and southeast asia but on occasion even to europe in this volume dr poindexters careful description of the nature and cause of tropical diseases and delineation of the methods of treatment and control are in part an answer to dr fraziers contention dr poindexter has served the people of the world in africa and southeast asia and is at present serving them in latin america e franklin frazier is a distinguished american sociologist but his position in this volume is certainly more personal opinion than it is objective science since there is no paper in this issue that gives a different view of the picture frazier presents i have used a portion of this introduction to challenge him similar sociological changes between the two world wars was the presence of the automobile industry the early negro migrants from the south had been among the first ford employees and they had made good use of their aday and upwards wages at a time when that much money seemed lucrative to other workers they bought homes and property started businesses and most important educated their children there existed in detroit then a very large group of educated negroes with an appetite for the cultural contacts which were not always open to them they early took up the practice of journeying to less restricted citiessuch as montreal and new yorkto enjoy facilities closed to them at home and more important they began to create within their own community the climate of culture for which they hungered the communitys reputation for refinement spread over the nation in the years before and after world war ii detroit attracted an uncommon number of brilliant and talented young people who together with the nativebred raised the level of civic political and social awareness to a level unmatched by any other major city many of these young people now occupy positions of local state and national authority posts they were more than ready to fill when the barriers finally fell locally they include damon keith william patrick and broadus n butler statewide they include otis smith and wade mccree and nationally they include hobart taylor jr charles wartman and eddie sylvester racial separation remainsfar too frequentlyan integral part of the detroit scene and therefore it is not very surprising that a white reporter writing for a white magazine did not bother to look outside the establishment for evidence of cultural activity and leadership this is an inescapable aspect of the racial realities and yet by any objective standards it is apparent that there is an extraordinary level of cultural activity and awareness in the detroit negro community on page there appear three photographs of detroiters whoover the past yearshave figured importantly in the cultural development of the community they are top to bottom dr broadus n butler assistant dean of the college of liberal arts wayne state university and chairman of the research committee of the association for the study of negro life and history nellie watts retired schoolteacher and founder of the nellie watts concert series and the patrons of the arts and the late fred hart williams initiator of the e azalea hackley memorial collection in the main library and a mainspring of cultural interest until his death in in the following pages a general survey of the arts in detroitpast and presentwill shed some light on some of the principal organizations activities and individuals who make the pursuit of art and excellence a vital part of life in detroit art in terms of ascendancy painting is the newest of the arts in detroit in the old days of course there were painters of talent and some renown but none ever attained the repute and possibly the technical brilliance of the current crop of artists fifty years ago there were no leroy mitchells ernest hardmans or leroy fosters no arts extended group nor any plans to build a permanent gallery and studio as the contemporary studio group is determined to do by paintings rise to preeminence may be said to have begun with the old pen and palette art club which flourished under john dancys patronage at the urban league back in the forties most of the painters in this group were quite young then and some of them are stilunder perhaps the most representative artist of this group is henri king a driving force of the dynamic contemporary studio and director of the groups gallery one of the most outstanding artists of that period was myrtle hall who doubled as star model at both cranbrook academy and the society of arts and crafts after winning prizes and considerable acclaim mrs hall deserted painting for ceramics in the late forties and now is one of the most accomplished ceramists in the midwest her studio and workshop on erskine are among the most professional in the city some of the former members of the old pen and palette art club reorganized as the arts extended groupe in the late forties among them were mrs hall architectpainter rodney warren teacherpainters charles and leverne finger mae morris alice lightfoot james wilson cledie taylor and richard kenny in the group opened a studiogallery on warren just east of woodward in the heart of the rapidly expanding university center it marked the first time a local group of negro artists had undertaken the task of maintaining a gallery the group had been holding regular exhibitions in such places as the federated womens clubhouse but now it had its own center in due course classes were added and a sustained effort was made to interest the community at large in the artists work the gallery flourished with immediate beneficial results one of which was the organization of the second negrooperated gallery it was perhaps inevitable that the success of the arts extended groupes gallery would lead to the opening of at least another one in the first place there were far too many exceptional artists to be absorbed as members in the arts extended groupe and in the second place the first gallery was too small to service all the artists who deserved exposure and now were sure to demand it in henri king and harold neal conceived the idea of the contemporary studio becausein kings wordsit was felt that detroit had no cohesive art movement headquarters or location offering unlimited opportunity for local artists to show their work meet the public and gain recognition the artists who met to draw up plans for the studio included some of the bestknown and most talented detroit artists names long familiar to art patrons and connoisseurs these included leroy foster charles mcgee and ernest hardman all veterans of the annual michigan artists exhibitions at art institute and all former students at the highly respected society of arts and crafts the group leased a secondfloor fiveroom flat on the john c lodge expressway and converted the apartment into a studiogallery in the succeeding four years more than shows have been held at the gallery along with art auctions art discussion programs art classes and seminars all the detroit newspapers and critics have heaped praise on the group and its work and the visitors to the gallery have included persons from europe africa and south america the contemporary studio currently is searching for larger quarters in order to expand its program and provide more exhibition space the advent of this group signaled the beginning of a revolutionary era for art in detroit the detroit negro artist with farthest reaching famehughie leesmithis a detroiter only during the summers now having moved his permanent address to the washington square neighborhood of new yorks greenwich village several years ago leesmith a painter of surpassing grace and lyricism remains the darling of art enthusiasts in the wealthy suburbs and he returns each season to teach in bloomfield hills and birmingham during the past summer leesmiths star pupil was mrs henry ford ii wife of the auto magnate and the one cultural leader singled out by show magazines chronicler of the detroit cultural scene prior to his departure to new york leesmith maintained his own studio and was one of the few local artists of any race who earned a living solely from his work like leesmith painter leroy foster supports himself through his art foster is a brilliant portraitist and one of several artists who have studied abroadat the academie de la grande chaumiere in paris and at the heatherly school of art in london he has won four prizes in the annual art institute competition and sold more than paintings in the past years no mention of art in detroit would be complete unless the names of sarkis sarkisian and guy palozzola were included for these two excellent artists exerted great influence on most detroit negro artists indeed only a few of the topranking artists did not study under sarkisian and palozzola at the society of arts and crafts theater the local theatrical tradition is closely allied with the musical arts which have a very long history in detroit two uncles of the late fred hart williams back in the s regularly held amateur and professional shows in the old merrill hall fred hart ball one of these enterprising gentlemen also was the grandfather of herb jeffries the detroitborn balladeer such oldtime favorites as sisseretta black patti jones and zoe ball fred hart williams aunt enlivened the local theatrical scene with their performances in creole belles some time later from the sarnia area richard harrison emerged as an actor of power and he eventually won immortality as de lawd in marc connellys allegory green pastures in the thirties and forties a series of paradise valleycentered theatrical groups briefly flourished and then perished some of them succeeding in inspiring local actors to go on to new york or hollywood of these perhaps bill walker is the best known after world war ii the paul robeson theatre group provided a showcase for young people of talent it was succeeded by the detroit actors guild which was sparked by alma forrest parks one of the several anna lucastas and a youthful veteran of the old american negro theatre in harlem the actress came to detroit as the bride of singer benjamin parks from this group anna whitsitt english went on to broadway as the saucy zarita in langston hughes simply heavenly perhaps the most successful product of local theatre is lloyd richards the actordirector who is a teacher at the paul mann workshop in new york and the director of a raisin in the sun like richards walter mason and karl farrar received early training with the wayne state university theatre and went on to roles in the professional theatre in new york although there have been the usual number of small theatre groups in the fifties and early sixties the new emphasis on raciallyintegrated theatrical groupssuch as the unstabled make it unlikely that negro theatre as such will achieve much more of a record in the future than it did in the past while none of the local theatrical groups racked up any outstanding accomplishment a detroit playwright scored great personal success in the forties demonstrating more guts and ability than any local writer before him and since arthur coar both wrote and produced two plays which drew nearcapacity audiences to the art institute auditorium the first dual flame which also was the better of the two remains a challenge for young playwrights of the present or future in young ron milner winner of a john hay whitney fellowship and woodie king jr there is considerable promise milners life agony recently was performed before a coffee house audience by actors sylvia king and woodie king jr the dance as is true with the theatre the dance was always closely tied to music in detroit and perhaps subordinated to it detroit has produced no great dancers in the mold of dunham or primus or ailey but it consistently develops extraordinarily good ones scores of exceptional dancers have been turned out under the aegis of laclair knox the dance teacher who was responsible for much of the vitality of the old delta sigma theta jabberwock extravaganzas under the direction of gladys mills johnson and clem mills mrs knoxs school still holds its own in competition with the schools of such relative newcomers as joe ziggy johnson and toni lewis the beautiful clemons sisters gained brief fame in the fifties but the most successful detroit dancer is eddie robinson a former dunham dancer who now operates a school in paris and trains stars for movie and tv roles bernard johnson who was discovered by josephine baker on the fox theatre stage works on broadway and clifford fears is in las vegas and hollywood the two dancers now holding local laurels are vera embree and jimi hunt the latter a dunham alumnus who also works in ceramics literature the literary scene in the detroit negro community is at its brightest currently a total of three john hay whitney fellowship winners are working on projects and generally generating literary enthusiasm the youngest of the three yearold ron milner has produced a play life agony and is writing a novel rogie clark who is a music teacher and folklorist as well as a writer is polishing a series of articles on negro folklore margaret danner a chicagoan transplanted to detroit is in the process of publishing her first book of poems the resurgence of local literary interest has had the effect of arousing to action poet dudley randall poetscuptor oliver legrone and playwright arthur coar the renaissance also has turned the spotlight on poet edward simpkins poethistorian harold lawrence and the previously mentioned woodie king jr for many years in detroit the mainspring of creative writing was fred hart williams the genial and lovable community leader who contributed so much to the citys cultural life williams concentrated his efforts on negro history and over the years wrote for every local negro newspaper and for many white dailies throughout michigan when williams died in detroit lost a great and beloved leader but fortunately he left behind a fully capable heir the mantle of leadership fell to dr broadus n butler who has indicated that he might undertake to complete the book on the history of negroes in detroit which williams left unpublished this fall appropriately under the direction of dr butler detroit writers will be represented in a special issue of the negro history bulletin dedicated to the memory of fred hart williams sculpture one of the most promising of detroits sculptors abandoned her studies in midcareer and focused her energies on the one of her several talents which most interested her florence pate sampson a poet actress and singer as well as sculptor gave up all her other interests for concert singing a pursuit she shares with her pianist composer husband leroy however several of mrs sampsons worksincluding the stunning yom and the poetic les enfantsremain highpoints in creativity the exquisite work of cledie taylor deserves far more attention than it has ever received possibly because her sculpture has taken a back seat to her jewelry oliver legrone fashioned busts of great power during his most creative period at the same time incidentally that his first book of poems was published locally of the current sculptors perhaps the two most prominent are robert weil and oscar graves weil a member of the arts extended groupe is a former john hay whitney fellow and a winner of the albert kahn prize in the annual michigan artists exhibition he is a sculpture instructor at michigan state university at lansing graves a member of the contemporary studio studied at the famed cranbrook academy in bloomfield hills and at wayne state university he has been employed for the past eight years with marshall fredericks the internationally known sculptor and producer of the spirit of detroit sculpture adorning the citycounty building and the opening page of this feature music if painting can be said to be the newest of the creative arts in detroit then music must be termed the oldest in the years when slavery still was an accepted institution in the south music played an important cultural role in the life of the detroit negro community the lambert family one of the citys first negro families made musical performances the principal form of entertainment during the prewar social functions the family sponsored in later years henry and fred hart ball made their barber shop at gratiot and beaubien the center of musical interest and activity they sponsored amateur and professional musical events in the old merrill hall and played hosts to visiting minstrels the most important musical performers of that period the names of zoe ball and sisseretta jones already have been mentioned and these singers were followed by e azalea hackley and the worldfamous maggie porter coles the advent of the automobile revolutionized the total structure of detroit life in the years before world war i and correspondingly profound changes occurred in the negro community as thousands of negroes arrived from the south there were inevitable dislocations and transformations in community leadership for a number of years new leadership was slow in evolving partly because of the serious economic crises of the postworld war i era then during the height of the depression a new leader emerged in the person of a schoolteacher named nellie watts despairing of waiting for the es tablished impresarios to bring in top musical talent to masonic temple miss watts undertook to do so herself in using her own funds miss watts initiated a concert series with the contralto marian anderson the first concert proved an overwhelming success and the annual nellie watts concert series became a detroit tradition in its years of existence the series has presented virtually every topranking negro musical personality from miss anderson to detroits own metropolitan opera star george shirley in in an effort to broaden the participation of the community in her concerts and to cut her frequent financial losses miss watts organized the patrons of the arts apart from helping to assure a larger audience for the concerts patrons of the arts was designed to offer encouragement to young artists singers and musicians significantly miss watts was one of the newcomers to detroit being a native of atlanta ga most of the cultural leaders who followed miss watts had their roots in other localities but were quick to recognize the wealth of possibility in the community and to seize upon it celeste cole a texasborn soprano who studied in russia helped to make excellence a standard of musicality in detroit a singer of extraordinary precision and power she instilled in her many students the drive for perfec tion among her students were florence pate sampson soprano vivian martin pianist leroy sampson and contralto ollie macfarland miss coles opera workshop is unique in its quality and conception last year her presentation of the pearl fishers at art institute employed members of the detroit symphony orchestra for accompaniment this season in commemoration of the centennial of the emancipation proclamation the opera workshop will do excerpts from hiawatha and the kubla khan by the english negro composer samuel taylor coleridge and also excerpts from boris godunov an opera based on a story by the russian negro poet alexandre pushkin miss cole is an instructor in applied music at wayne state university as well as one of the most soughtafter independent music teachers like miss cole robert nolan served as instructor in applied music at wayne state university and is a teacher who has launched some of the citys ablest musicians on professional careers a native of cleveland ohio nolan has spent more than years in detroit and his name is virtually synonymous with local musical activity his school of music sponsors annual musical scholarships and arranges recitals for promising young musicians graduates of the robert nolan school of music include charles coleman founder and director of the northwestern school of music and dance brazeal dennard and concert pianist arthur lebrew winner of a scholarship to the mozarteum in vienna austria nolan is music critic for the michigan chronicle a pioneer in detroits music circles is jerene macklin a graduate of the detroit conservatory of music and founder of the detroit civic opera mrs macklin has worked diligently and quietly for decades to discover and develop musical talent in the community and she was among those promoting opera long before negroes broke through into the ranks of international opera the names of cole nolan and macklin are best known in the field of music but there are many others whose talent and efforts help to make detroit a leading musical center in the nation among those who should be mentioned are carlotta franzell canadianbom concert singer who first scored as cindy lou in the broadway production of carmen jones composer rogie clark whose opera ti yette was performed by celeste coles opera workshop last season and whose new opera the stranger is scheduled for the coming season teachers ollie macfarland louise sargent and katherine ellis baritone james harkless jr bassist russell greene and pianistcomposer william mann christening of an african baby is observed with an equal excitement and joy as the birth itself the ceremony is one of many reunions in an african society that seal strong family ties an african family means more than the parents and their issues it implies the patriarch and his descendants the patriarch is the symbol of the familys pride tradition and customs families of a ghanaian clan have two main sets of traditional names for their issues the names are meaningful they identify the clans of the children easily and give a synoptic background information of the children themselves mere names can inform one for example of a childs seniority in the family whether a child is the only one with a particular name in the family whether the child is the second or third son or daughter in the family or even reveal the circumstances of the childs birth christening of an african child falls on the seventh day after birth the long wait is traditional to determine the chances of survival of the newlyborn baby at dawn of the seventh day members of the family assemble in the courtyard a senior member with an exemplary reputation is nominated godfather great importance is attached to the nomination because of the role the godfather plays in the father or godmother officiating at the initiation has a powerful spiritual influence on the baby a godmothershe is a likely choice usually for her known sensitivity to spiritual forcefaces the east holding the baby in her arms thrice she raises it high to the heavens and down to the earth thrice she feeds it drops of water and liquor while performing these acts she invokes the blessings guidance and guardianship of the universal mind for the baby the baby is then christened and corn beverage is served the guests as a token for witnessing the ceremonyceremony the reunion is ceremonial to hail the new born it also has an esoteric significance to initiate the baby into society it is therefore assumed that a virtuous goda birthday name can be added to a formal family name to help differentiate first cousins with the same name tettey born on tuesday will be tettey kwabla and the other tettey born on friday will be tettey kofi strong family pride is attached to these names grandfathers granduncles and grandaunts look forward with anxiety to the christening of their grandchildren grandnephews and grandnieces respectively after them a fathers failure to follow tradition in naming his baby because of enmity or obvious reasons could spark a lifelong quarrel between the offended grandparent and the babys father the father under such circumstances has two choices one is to name his baby after the day on which it was born or to give it a proverbial name these proverbial names narrate family history or refer to wise sayings of the society a child born out of wedlock whose father has disclaimed it is named obetsebi fatherless a father who continuously loses his babies can name a new born baby obaya i will lose you soon or esefuo there is an end the beauty in these meaningful names is another example in african culture to enshrine knowledge of the secrets of nature in symbols festivals music and songs names of africans are therefore something more than mere proper names they are microscopic biographies which are recalled to mind whenever their names are pronounced the desegregationintegration issue is clearly one of the most delicate and serious problems confronting society in the latter century it has been one of the most discussed analyzed and illuminated controversies to be carried by the media of public communication yet in spite of this mass coverage one aspect of the desegregationintegration crisis has almost completely escaped the f spotlight that of integration as a threat to negro culture perhaps one of the major reasons for silence on this question is because it is a question on which it is extremely difficult to commu nicate without being misunderstood mislabeled or maliciously libeled it is a discussion that lies along a path paved with pitfalls of potential misunderstanding v given this state of affairs it would seem unwise to plunge into such a discussion without prefacing it by a short explanation of the barrier to effective communication on the topic hopefully this will re duce the inherent tendencies toward misunderstanding and clear the way for a reasonable and rational dissertation on the issue how to be misunderstood without really trying one of the most potent barriers to effective communication on any aspect of the desegregationintegration issue is the failure of too many communicators to clearly distinguish between the concepts of desegregation and integration segregation means to cut off from others to isolate and collect together in a concentration at a particular placehence desegregation signifies a freeing of such compulsory isolation and restricted concentration integration on the other hand means to unite parts so as to form one whole integration therefore signifies an obliteration of differences and a forging of all distinguishable parts into one monotonous mass integration and segregation are the two extremes of a continuum of which the center portions can best be represented by the concept of freedomfreedom to integrate or segregate according to the wishes of each individual the primary objective of the current legal litigation is or should be to take this crucial decision out of the hands of the state and give it back to the individual its objective is not or should not be aimed at merely removing this decisionmaking power from one inappropriate place which happens to favor segregation only to lodge it in another equally inappropriate place which happens to favor integration desegregation and integration are separate and distinct courses of behavior and each individual who chooses to exercise a choice must recognize these differences and should he choose to communicate his decision to others he is sure to encounter some awful barriers to communication unless he and his listeners keep the two terms distinctly apart another significant barrier to intelligent communication on such an issue as integration as a threat to negro culture is the suspicious atmosphere that has been created by the loud and rowdy voices of the extremists and extreme antiextremists of various political shades while most of this has centered around the pro and con john birch society protagonists the desegregationintegration controversy has been similarly involved the extremists in this case however have been the rabid white segregationists on one hand and the rabid black muslims on the other he who openly and publicly identifies integration as a threat to negro culture runs grave risks of being lumped with one or the other of these groups perfectly reasonable pleas for the preservation of one of the countrys major cultural assets may and likely will be simultaneously construed as supporting the cause of the segregationists and voicing the chauvinistic sentiments of the black muslims the only safe position between the extremes nowadays it seems is the extreme middle which may be as harmful to a growing democracy as the other extremes a third though less serious barrier to communication on integration as a threat to negro culture is the strain and minor discomfort such public utterances may cause for negrowhite interpersonal relationships negroes who want to integrate into the mainstream of predominantly white american society pay a certain tribute to the latter this is a form of flattery that most of the flattered secretly enjoy negroes who deny any ini terests in entering the mainkl streams are frequently viewed with suspicion by white associates as if not being for their mainstream automatically means that one is against it the last barrier to be mentioned here is identical to the one above except that it occurs as a strain on negronegro interpersonal relationships among negroes the we want integration position has become such a powerful partyline that one of that group who dares to publicly buck it may be in for a hard time from his negro associates instead of accepting dissent as a healthy sign of political and intellectual maturity a majority of ones negro associates would interpret deviation from the partyline as a form of race treason and a threat to the unity of the group the net result of this is the relegation of such heartfelt opinions to the intimate interactions between very close friendsnever openly vented in the free market of ideas these then are some of the barriers that prevent effective and open communication on the question of whether integration is a threat to negro culture after presenting such a catalog of potential barriers it is hoped that the way has been cleared for honest consideration of an admittedly unpopular view namely that integration does present a clear and present danger or threat to the preservation and growth of negro culture the contention here however is not that integration per se presents such a threat but that the pattern or model that the process follows when negroes enter the mainstream is one that is inherently destructive to that complex of distinctive attainments that constitutes the background of the american negro we propose to develop this thesis by describing the dynamics of the integration process which we dubbed the integration model and by pointing out those of its features that account for the conclusion claimed above the integration model it is said that we are forced to think in terms of models willingly or not whenever we wish to think systematically about anything a decade ago karl deutsch brilliantly described a model as a structure of symbols and operating rules which is supposed to match a set of relevant points in an existing structure or process a major disagreement between model theorists however centers around the question to what extent does a model perfectly correlate with the reality it represents the claim made here is that these descriptions of the integration model do not match their reality in every single case but that they are what the social scientists calls significant at the level meaning that they are valid in cases out of the integration model consists of the following system of interrelated propositions proposition i negroes ini tial interest in integration is accompanied by feelings of cultural selfdenial proposition ii negroes initial experience with integration is accompanied by reduced esteem for their own cultural background proposition iii negroes continued interest in integration and prolonged experience with integration results in further emotional and psychological detachment from their own culture and extreme imitation of what is perceived as mainstream values and behaviors the discussion and support of each of these propositions comprises the main argument of this dissertation it follows negroes interest in integration cultural self denial proposition i is supported mainly by the following crucial observation those negroes who are publicly associated with the integration struggle are seldom active in the promotion and preservation of negro culture those whose major purpose is to integrate this or integrate that give no evidence of being equally interested in gaining recognition for the distinctive cultural contributions of american negroes they base their arguments for integration not on a conviction that the negro has made certain contributions that deserve to be made a more integral part of the national cultural fabric but merely on their conviction that negroes are equal and therefore ought to be admitted to the mainstream of american society if the charters of the discriminationfighting integration organizations make any provisions for the development and preservation of the negros cultural contribution such pronouncements serve only as window dressing judging from the public concerns of the civil_rights group negro culture is a thing that is of no major importance or does not exist at all while it is true that negroes who are interested in integration deemphasize the significance of negro culture it is also true that negroes who are active in racial uplift are not particularly vocal on the merits of integration the nation is dotted with small little known study groups of negroes which are devoted to the study and preservation of negro history and culture if the charters of these bodies make any provisions for supporting the integration fight these pronouncements receive little if any program emphasis in summary integration and cultural uplift are two goals that appear to be incompatible as far as negro organizations are concerned the inverse relationship that is found to exist between the two guarantees that negroes interest in integration inevitably leads to deemphasis or denial of negro culture negroes initial experiences with integration reduced esteem for their own cultural background proposition ii is supported mainly by skilled observations of the interactions of negroes and whites in newly formed integrative situations usually when negroes become part of a predominantly white group the most interesting characteristic of the vast majority of these newly formed mixed groups is that discussion or even mere mentioning of any racial differences in the conversations between negroes and whites introduces a certain amount of strain into the relationship in almost all cases taik about race and race differences is more distressing to the negro conversationalists than to whites the net result is that all talk about race becomes taboo and this includes talk about negro culture these circumstances are responsible for some ironic interactions such as when whites who sincerely admire negro spirituals express this admiration and suddenly become suspect in the eyes of their negro associates the explanation for such behavior on the part of negroes in mixed groups results in the main from their attitudes toward the value of their own culture negroes initial contact with mainstream culture results in reducing their esteem for their own to a point where they are embarrassed by its mentioning in mixed company they seem convinced that what they have to offer culturally is so inferior that any evaluation of it in mixed groups jeopardizes their chances for full acceptance iii negroes continued experience with integration detachment from own culture extreme imitation of main stream value and behaviors the observations that support proposition iii grow out of the occurrences noted in support of propositions i and ii only by now the process is so far gone that any chances of reversing it are all but nonexistent at this point integrated negroes detachment from their cultural background becomes so complete that they begin to resent being called negroes im not a negro im an american to remind them of their old environment of negro spirituals race music and rhythm and blues the forerunners to the integrated rock and roll and gumbo and chitterling dinners would do serious injury to the new image they have of themselves besides becoming fully detached from their own culture negroes with prolonged experience with integration begin to imitate what they perceive to be mainstream cultural values and behaviors to a degree that is ridiculous they in effect become whiter than the whitest white more american and more conformist than anyone else in the group they come to the integrative situation culturally naked feigning a clean empty slate and grasping for traits of the new way some negroes become such convincing imitators that their white associates secretly refer to them as white niggers a term and concept familiar to remarkably few negroes in summary the integration model describes what is claimed to be the reactions of negroes to negro culture as they seek integration and experience various degrees of integration the outstanding fact of life of this process is that the distinctive attainments of negro culture get lost in the shuffle but need this be the case does it follow from what has been said that any significant change in the existing social order comprises an inherent threat to the preservation and further development of negro culture the answer is no absolutely not the current pattern of integration as described by the integration model is not the solution to what is wrong with negrowhite relations in america a much superior and more desirable pattern of change which does not destroy but fosters greater growth for negro culture is summarized below dubbed the desegregation model an alternative the desegregation model the desegregation model consists of the following phased events phase i negroes recognition and acceptance of the fact that americas greatness grew out of and is dependent on individual creativity and cultural diversity not conformity and cultural sameness phase ii negroes recognition and acceptance of the fact that negro culture is uniquely american and played a giant role in the building of this nation phase iii negroes recognition and acceptance of the fact that their becoming like whites culturally is not and should not be a requirement or price they must pay in order to receive the rights and privileges due them as americans phase iv negroes recognition and acceptance of the fact that the beauty and richness of negro culture is deserving of their maximal pride and efforts toward further development phase v negroes and whites recognition and acceptance of negro culture as a major national asset and of the desirability of its continued growth as a distinctive form on the american scene peacefully coexisting so to speak with the predominant mainstream culture the desegregation model offers a more fruitful pattern of change than that which is being pursued in addition to preserving a major cultural asset it also points toward the solution of a more basic problem for american negroes the quest for identity after all there are no rational reasons why this tenth of the population should sacrifice its cultural contributions as a prerequisite for first class citizenship there are no rational reasons why they cannot live in the nonsegregated communities of their choice and dine from tables of gumbo and other culinary specialties attend any public educational institution for which they qualify and maintain the rhythmic splendor of negro spirituals and jazz be employed strictly on the basis of merit and create the dissimilar dance forms of the texas hop the mashed potato or scotch the question of whether or not the american dilemma is solved on this basis is not only closely related to the survival of negro culture but equally related to the survival of the whole american culture and way of life as well dear mr jennett every time that you see your blackness mirrored in the blankness of a white mans stare you are glad that you can go away from him and everything that he stands for away from him and back to your own kind where you can relax and lick your wounds and listen to the comforting sounds of frying fat dialect easy laughter and race music coming over a radio you sit there wherever it is you go to seek your solaceat home in a beerjoint in a real estate office or on a comer bus bench and you deplore the way that your blackness restricts your life you find many agreeable listeners they tell you about all of the distressing occurrences that they have had to face and you understand each others dismay you feel that you are in this country only on sufferance and you go armed with wariness every day of your life and smiling yet sure ignore it sure consider the source sure be bigger than they are sure keep on striving for a better world for your kids you know that you shall do all of these things but nothing alters the truth most negroes are afraid they suck in this fear with their mothers milk they hear the fear voiced while they are growing up the fear is masked by bravado or antagonism or cynicism or laughter the kids hear ol mista charlies got it and i got to get it they hear i cant quit ill just have to take his abuse and keep my mouth shut they hear she wants all of the floors waxed on your hands and knees what the dickens you expect me to do you know the baby needs a pair of shoes they hear the bastard called me a nigger i hit him thats all they hear i hate em hate all of emno there aint no good ones they hear he loves colored peoplehe was raised with em and as you grow up you absorb the resentment and the anger that is based on the fear the fear isnt a physical fear mr jennett it is a sapping wasting wearying wariness that has kept an entire race of people apathetic and incapable it is a most complex emotion perhaps it began when the negroes discovered that they really had no emancipation to proclaim and when the white people began to forge the chains of their own slavery because as long as they stifle us they are emotionally imprisoned themselves it is true that there are more and more educated and effective negroes such as you sought to buy your home but they have not yet channelled their growing power it is a confusing time for them when they go gaily down from their hillside homes to buy gas for their cadillacs it must hurt to have a white attendant slap you with a hatestare while he signs the esti mable credit card you hand him fl negroes who do live in the sub i urbs bend over backwards trying to behave themselves ive heard them say this we have to be so careful no matter what we do somebody looks at us askance often however they find a cau f your letter has a ring of real truth to it i can sympathize with all that you say i wish to god it were in my power to do something about it but apparently it is not those of us who were bom white can never really know what it feels like to be black but i can tell you this there are lots of white people more every daywho believe that color like beauty is only skin deep and that all the really important qualities about a person such as character and compassion lie beneath the surface in the heart and mind and soul i think the phrase color blind best describes those of us who feel that way but once we become color blind we still have our human feelings about individuals i dont care a hoot about a persons race or creed but i will continue to judge each person as an individual when a person white black red yellow or brown lives in such a way as to command my love and respect i will grant such love and respect to this person negroes must learn to live good solid lives as individuals i dont mean perfect lives none of us is perfect and those of us who try become so stiff that we are dull i mean just normal and average i suppose lots of negroes feel it isnt worth the effort white people resent you for the effort and claim you dont know your place negroes who refuse to improve themselves resent you for it feeling that you are by your actions implying that they are not as good as you all i can say in encouragement is that white people suffer the same problems they are problems involved in climbing they have little to do with your color although that makes you a special target i was bom in a charity ward myself my life has been a long climb and i dont plan to stop climbing until i die i ran into opposition from those around and above me but i also ran into people who helped with no thought of reward for themselves at first some friends resented my climbing i finally made them see that i didnt believe i was superior to them i was just trying out the wings god gave me to see how high i can fly i still have most of the friends we had before our climb began they understand now that all i want to do is meet the challenge of life and serve my fellow man as much as i can im scared sure ive been scared every day since i stuck my neck out and tried to be different but ive found that everyone else is scared too thats why were all voting ourselves into the new form of slavery called the welfare state and i find that by meeting my fears head on they dont bother me as much this is the attitude taken by our pioneer forefathers including the negro who was the first man to give his life for freedom in americas revolution your battle will be a long one but you will win it i know you will this story comes to me i think because it is spring and it comes in silence from the far edge of yesterdays as easter time approaches with reminiscences of old lang syne when much of what i recall was told me by my ancestors perhaps only the old can tell of onceonatime when in africa all slaves of whatever trend in religion made special celebration of whitsuntide or as it was called by the natives pingster perhaps it was the original of rock and roll the season was passed in what we today term wild dances with unusual contortions and complete lack of restraint however untamed or uncultured the natives the affairs seemed to prove a respite from their labor as they were not obliged to work during that season frederick douglass who with a great heart and great talents devoted much time in attempts to improve his downtrodden race once said from what i know of the effect of these holidays on the slaves i believe them to be the most effective means in the hands of the slave holders in keeping down the spirit of insurrection were they to abandon the practice i would not have the slightest doubt it would lead to immediate uprising among the slaves the holidays act as safetyvalves to the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity but for them they would be thrown into the wildest desperation and woe betide those who remove these operations or hinder their conduct i warn you that in such an event a spirit will go forth in their midst more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake in the following story i have paid reverence to dead fame which i have drawn from shadowflocks of memories i quote the words often repeated by sojourner truth and he moved from there and digged another well for the lord has made room for usuns and he says to usuns to be fruitful in the land sometmes human features come to mind from almost fors gotten concealment in clouds of memory ralph w emert son once said that in the culminating hours of life memory is associated with certain books which one has read and laid away for years and so it happened as i picked up a little volume given me many years ago as i opened it the picture of isabella looked out from a page at close range i recalled the admonition given me by the donor dont ever lose this for you know it is very rare she might have added in the language of the street you cant hardly ever get them no more the life of isabella will not be found in any story book today the title page of the little fifth edition reads as follows the book was first published from stereotype plates in and was entered recorded by act of congress in for the author mrs frances titus who lived in washington she intended her manuscript for postscript only the narrative itself was written by olive gilbert an amanuensis isabella could we be transported to africa in the late or early period we would find but few white settlements apart from the north and western sections the natives were of the darkest type with characteristic high cheek bones thick lips and flat noses many natives of the egyptian sudan in the east had migrated to the westward and the family of whom i write came from upper guinea to liberia a colony on the west coast and there isabellas parents james and bettsey bomfree with their ten children were driven aboard a slave ship with a full quota of other negroes under command of white men to be taken to america to be sold into slavery upon arrival and they were sold to the highest bidders history relates that ships used for the purpose were returned to africa laden with indians for the same treatment it is reported in some accounts that isabella may have been born in ulster county n y but her age was never known nor were the ages of her parents and the other children the bomfrees were like other negroes of their day they could neither read nor write and their only language was the low dutch of their natal land upon arrival in new york the bomfrees and all their family were placed as a group on the auction block they were immediately sold to one col ardenburgh of ulster county who was of dutch descent and could understand some of their lingo isabella remembered nothing of the circumstances of their first master however he was considered to be in the main kind and considerate when he died all his slaves became the chattels of his son charles all the older bomfree children had by then been sold and taken away they were never again seen by the parents isabella could recall that charles built a new house and she and her parents were moved there the cellar under the building was assigned as sleeping quarters for all the slaves some twenty in number of all sexes ages and sizes their beds consisted of planks laid over the rough dirt base where surface water seeped in and settled adding offensive odors and dampness conducive to rheumatism and ill health tobacco quids and human excrements also added to the foul atmosphere isabellas mother died when she was perhaps eight or nine years old her father lived for many years but seldom saw his daughter as she had been sold many times and lived at far distances she was first sold to one nealy for that experience she said was like being driven like dumb animals being condemned to death she was obliged to suffer every pain and indignity which her race at that time had to bear she was flogged while her hands were tied in front of her until her back was lacerated and bleeding and once she said she was whipped because she herself was cruel to a cat again she was sent to the scullery to bring a skillet and returned with a kettle and trammels her penalty was a terrible beating years dragged on and eventually brought romance to isabella she was to marry a young slave who came from a nearby estate but learning of their tryst his master forbade him to see her however he persisted in seeing her and was followed on his last trip by a gang sent by his master he was caught flogged into unconsciousness tied with ropes and hauled away isabella never saw him again time which is said by some to be a cureall went on crutches so to speak until ultimately love came again and in due time she married and became mother of a large family however the joy of motherhood was not hers for long her babes were seized forcibly and given into slavery while white babies were given places at her breasts designed for her own and she was forced under threat of dire penalty if she refused for one reason or another her freedom from slavery was not granted until some ten to twenty years after she might have claimed it had she known her age when freed she had been working for a gentleman who had paid seventy pounds for her service in his household he was john j dumont who lived directly opposite hyde park on the hudson in ulster county new york after many years there in his employ she decided to go to new york city then having about or inhabitants there she labored at numerous jobs in households she cooked cleaned scrubbed polished brass trimmings doorplates and railings and all the time earning the very first money she ever had of her own and that amount was scanty indeed isabella seemed to possess a power of speech in behalf of her race and had gained quite a reputation in speaking to small groups she then decided to go on a crusade she started out with two york shillings in her pocket and a bundle tied in a bandanna she left the city on foot and unshod much of the way took a route easterly through long island she lectured where and whenever she could make arrangements sometimes in churches sometimes by the wayside she never lacked an audience and she received many donations of money which were freely given after a successful trip across the island she boarded a little boat which carried her across the sound to connecticut and pursuing her way she reached windsor fame had preceded her and she was accorded unusual cordiality she remained several days and people listened to her with fervor she declared her intention of going on to massachusetts so on she went afoot and alone along mere trails and roadpaths through wild sections stopping occasionally at some little cabin settlement if no sleeping quarters were available she could always crawl under the low branches of a friendly evergreen tree and rest like a homing bird peaceful as a dove then at dawn she would resume her journey until another sundown after many many days she reached her destination at springfield massachusetts work was secured for her at the home of samuel hill esq and there isabella remained for sixteen years always promoting the principles which coincided with those of the state of massachusetts which was the first commonwealth of new england to resist slavery while living at springfield isabella decided to go on further missions she also determined to change her name to do this she wanted names which would in some way signify her ambitions she chose sojourner as a term for one who dwells a short time in one place and then moves on to another in effect a traveller here and there for her last name she gave the matter a long time and then declared that truth would be the right word from then till her days were ended she became famous in more than twenty states and in washington d c and wherever she spoke for her race sojourners voice was not confined to her time and place for it breaks forth today and may still reach the high mission which she espoused for the rights of all races it has been said that the best in mankind lives in obscurity for ages and then comes out in a people the voices of whom cannot be forever stilled sometime in the s i believe sojourner left massachusetts accompanied by several abolishionists also the hon george thompson for a tour of lecturing in western new york state her cause at that time was both imperilled and dangerous for their meetings in public were often broken up by proslavery mobs sojourner and her aides went on into ohio where their cause was also unpopular at intermissions sojourner would rise and offer the first editions of her little book for sale the proceeds were given to her as a benefit she also carried a blank note book in which she asked people to write their signatures many signed and expressed their sentiments pro and con and there were many donations of from five to ten dollars her own personal sense of ignorance and nothingness overwhelmed and depressed sojourner at times and it seemed as though nothing could raise her spirits except her implicit faith in god as she said god only could make people hear me and he did it in answer to my prayers and added you wouldnt doubt it if you could see me in my ignorance and destitution trotting about the streets bareheaded and barefooted her perfect trust raised her above fear and shielded her from her enemies that faith carried her on to the consummation of plans which filled her mind her knowledge of events was remarkable for one who so keenly lamented her lack of schooling but her wit and repartee were boundless it seems almost unbelievable that the woman could become so shrewd and so widely acknowledged and reach such acclaim as a public speaker of her day all of which is evidenced in the words of the noted bishop haven of massachusetts who wrote there is no more deserving woman of her day than she as one of the famous women of famous times covering in her own experiences the emancipation period from the declaration of new york state in to abraham lincolns proclamation she deserves special honor the nation could rightfully grant her a pension for her service since the war for the amelioration of those still halfenslaved about the year henry clay then living in kentucky formed what he called an americanization society of which he was president its purpose was to form a colony of emancipated slaves and give them a chance to live free three acres of land in guinea was to be given to each applicant but the location proved unhealthful and another site was chosen vermont history points proudly to the name of one jehudi ashman who graduated with the first class of uvm in and five years later led his first mission from america to liberia upon the sesquicentennial of that event the university of vermont made a notable celebration one of sojourners high hopes was to secure land from the northern part of the louisiana purchase as a reserve for freed slaves instead of sending them to africa her goal was to reach washington and present her plan there and so on she trudged bearing the scars and stripes of her slavedom a tall supple wellbuilt muscular figure never shrinking from opposition or danger her wit wisdom and humor with her strange dark personality brought her fame and popularity her activities became widespread and her talks more convincing harriet beecher stowe said of her i never knew a person who possessed so much of that subtle controlling power called presence sojourner lectured in many small towns in york state and at rochester gowanda and buffalo while working her way on towards the nations capitol in various ways and byways she met much harsh criticism and censure with crisp and well directed replies while offering her little book for sale she was accosted by a man who asked in effect old woman what do you think youre doing we dont care no more about what you say than we do about a flea bite she replied well chile de good lawd willing ill keep ya scratching she faced many accusations in her travels a man in one audience challenged her to prove that she wasnt a man she told the people present that she was a mother of a large family but that all except one had been snatched away from her for eventual slavery that she had been forced to suckle many a white infant at various times at washington sojourner was guest in the best of homes and was received with unreserved cordiality at one occasion she was directed to a guest room which was furnished in the most sumptuous manner she had ever seen when ready for bed she concluded that such luxury as exhibited on the bed was not for her so without disturbing the rich materials covering the bed she lay down on the floor and slept underneath at next sunup she turned down the bed covers and mussed up a pillow a bit as if she had slept there so that her hostess would not know where she had really rested walking past the administration buildings with the stars and stripes floating overhead she folded her hands as in supplication and thanked the god of love that they no longer floated above the scars and stripes of her free people asked what her work in new york had been she told of housework washing cleaning scrubbing and polishing brass door plates and railing and then added now i go around scouring copperheads replying to a man who asked what she thought of politics she told him she had just come from kansas and witnessed the wheat crop failure where there was no grain in the heads just empty hulls and she believed politics was just like that too many weasels in it i recall a story of sojourner who had smoked a pipe from early childhood in her advanced years she became ill and in talking with a minister the conversation ran something like this the reverend speaks now you believe in the good book and how it tells of heaven what a clean lovely place it is and i wonder how you expect to go there with such a vile smelling tobacco breath as yours and she told him well chile when i goes to hebben i spects to leave my breff here on earff but when her physician advised her to stop smoking on account of her health and said she would stop if it killed her she did stop and lived on and on in amy post writing from rochester n y sent sojourner these words of commendation dear friend sojourner the announcement in the antislavery standard of thy having laid aside the pipe is receiving considerable attention i received a letter from dr trask of fitchburg mass who rejoices greatly over thy grand and triumphant to cast aside the abomination also a letter has just come to me from our highly esteemed friend jonathan walker the original subject of the poem the branded hand he was captain of a small vessel running from new york to the gulf ports he secreted numerous slaves and brought them to the free states he was nabbed and imprisoned and the letters s s were branded on his right hand as a slave stealer the vessel was confiscated with its cargo and the crew and captain walker lay in a filthy jail in florida for several months jonathan walker himself wrote the following letter in from muskegon mich my dear and venerated friend your earnest and effectual devotion for so long a time to the cause of human redemption from the first knowledge of your mission services to the present time impresses me as well as many others with the warmest fraternal regard for your welfare and usefulness when i saw that you had abandoned the pipe at your advanced age i could form no other conclusion than that you had done it under the influence of keenest moral and religious sensibilities i have known ministers and professors of religion who have tried hard and long to abandon the habit and yet could not conquer i distinctly remember also the tedious and desperate struggle i had to emancipate myself from the foul weed after years of slavery to it one of the finest letters printed in the little book of narratives was written by william lloyd garrison of boston who was a strong abolitionist in he began publication of the liberator which he had bought from a quaker named lundy he had declared that he would neither think speak nor write with moderation he burned a copy of the constitution publicly to show his abhorrence of the legalization of slavery professional men and mercantile classes became as bitter against garrison as the southerners and demanded that such literature as that of the liberators incendiary type be legislated against the bitter attitude toward garrison resulted in his being tarred and feathered on boston common garrison wrote in regarding sojourner having been long acquainted with her eventful life and marvellous experiences i heartily commend her to the respect hospitality and goodwill of those among whom her lot may be cast and because of the cruel wrongs and sufferings endured by her during so many years of slavery and because of her timely selfsacrifices laboring among the wounded and the destitute during the late rebellion and for her venerable age and necessarily increasing infirmities calvin fairbanks who was confined in prison in franklin kentucky for aiding a slave was a signer in her autograph book charles sumner called the belligerant wrote his famous words equality of rights is the first of rights and signed his name james boyle md of new york signed as coworker in the antislavery movement he presented sojourner with the stereotyped plates for the first edition of her book a few other names signed in person were a lincoln u s grant parker pillsbury wendell phillips gilbert haven stephen and ann foster gerrit smith gen o o howard elisabeth cady stanton and mary mapes dodge during the administration of abraham lincoln a washington news paper published the following it was our good fortune to be in the marble room of the senate chamber when that old landmark of the past that representative of the forevergoneage sojourner truth made her appearance it was an hour never to be forgotten even in our magnanimous age of progress that we see our revered senators even he who holds the second chair in the republic vacate their seats in the hall of state to extend their hands of welcome their meed of praise and substantial blessings to a poor negro whose old form under the burden of nearly four score years and ten tells but too plainly that her marvellous strange life is drawing to a close but it was as refreshing as it was odd to see her who had served in the shackles of slavery in the great state of new york before these senators were even born now holding a levee here where less than a decade ago she would have been spumed from the outer corridor by the lowest menial much less could she have taken the hand of a senator surely the leaven of love is working in the hearts of the people pointing with unerring certainty to the time when ties of affection will cement nations and kindred of tongues into a common brotherhood sojourner made her mark in the world without any education or booklearning but if thought produces intellect that she certainly had in harriet beecher stowe wrote a story of sojourner under the title the libyan sibyl which was printed in the atlantic monthly there is a statue of sojourner somewhere made by a sculptor named story he became interested in her while in italy working on a magnifint model of cleopatra and he was contemplating a trip to africa to id an exact opposite type to copy he had talked with the author of ijourners narrative which led to his producing some two years later e statue of sybilla libica which was exhibited at the worlds fair in liladelphia olive gilbert wrote the following letter from leeds mass in how little we know of the world we live in you and i seem to move about as easy as soap bubbles i suppose here and there making our mine is a very quiet one compared to yours i did not hink you were laying the foundation of such a worldwide reputation when i wrote the little book but i rejoice and am proud that you can make your power felt with so little education susan b anthony in her day wrote and asked sojourner to make her mark on a petition against the constitution shutting out all women from voting for president vicepresident and congressmen although they might vote for their own states officials sojourner truth died in battle creek michigan where she lived in a little hut built from donations of numerous friends and that was her final earthly home her last employment was in a large house built on the same property which the owners had bought with the agreement that sojourner was to remain living in the little home which her own hands had helped to construct on college street from the first marker placed at her grave are these words though now the etching is dimmed by time in memoriam sojourner truth bom a slave in ulster co n y in the th century died at battle creek mich nov aged about years and at the base of this data is the quotation is god dead history has recorded the words as spoken by sojourner at a meeting being addressed by frederick douglass for the promotion and liberation of negroes he was evidently discouraged and was speaking with deep emotion when sojourner rose and said frederick is god dead there is a later newer stone placed at sojourners grave by a religious sect which is tall and slender like the old one and bears only her name in the shape of a cross in memoriam sojourner truth the only clue to the age of sojourner appears to be in the following letter written in which seems to refute the date on the tombstone the letter was written by waring lattimer a nephew of john j dumont previously mentioned whose dateline reads feb having heard that many persons have expressed doubts as to the age of sojourner truth i feel it is my duty to make a statement of what i know on the subject it is already known to you that when she was a slave she was held many years by my uncle who lived on the west bank of the hudson and it was during my frequent visits the last time was about at which time she was still held in slavery though i have i no doubt she was entitled to her freedom some years previously it was impossible to tell her age exactly as i now recall her appearance i at that time i feel quite sure she could not have been less than fortyfour or fortyfive years of age which would make her from to or years old and as extraordinary as it may seem i am firmly convinced the above is about her true age dear old sojourner yours respectfully waring lattimer why racial peace is imperative as governor of michigan i was proud that the bishop of my church was in the fore front of the fight for civil_rights and fair employment practices but by the same token i was more than unhappy when some of the parishioners used to ask why must the bishop have a colored man carry his insignia of office i was especially unhappy when they not only asked such questions but when some of them began to drift away from the cathedral church where there was brotherhood not only in the bible but in the pulpit and in the pews why i used to ask myself is there no corporate response in the church to racial discrimination why no ringing support of the bishops stand on human dignity why no positive affirmation in word and deed of christs brotherhood did not christ say if ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well but if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin stung by these questions and of course i speak here in my private capacity and as an episcopalian you can imagine that i was filled with real joy when i heard the still small voice of conscience assume corporate strength in the episcopal society for cultural and racial unity i will be happy to be a shorttime member of this society shorttime i say because the challenge to each of us is to work ourselves and our society out of a job as it were in other words i trust that we shall shortly achieve that unity we seek and that there will no longer be a special need of any i group to remind christians of the second great commandment fthou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself just a few weeks ago in africa this point came home to me in another way when i heard an african comment when the white man first came to africa he had i the bible and the black man had the land now the black man has the bible and the white man has the land while there is no question of the good done by the white mans contributions in africa it is a great tragedy that although the white man brought the word of lifeand many lived and died for italltoomany white men didnt live by that word the result is that many africans converted to christianity by the word brought by the white man have been shocked to disbelief by some white mens acts the new generation of educated africans is examining closely christianitys claim to be a universal fellowship many of the younger africans have lived among large numbers of europeans in african cities they have lived among europeans in europe they have lived among us in the united states and those who have not lived abroad get their impressions of western christianity from their newspapers and radio both of which devote considerable attention to the problem of racial relations as a result of this exposure to many nonmissionary whites africans today are giving deep and serious thought to the fundamental values of christianity young africa stands waiting father trevor huddleston has written and his eyes are vigilant eyes we have baptized him into the fellowship of christs church we have told him that he is the child of god and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven we have taught him to say our father with us we have placed upon his lips the body of christ and told him that it is a pledge and proof of our communion with one another in every possible way we have driven home to him that truth which we recite every time we say the creed that we believe in the catholic churchthe universal church the church in which all barriers of language and culture are broken down and what do these vigilant eyes see as they look at the present along with sitins and freedom riders they see whites entrenched in the best lands and the best jobs they see their ambassadors turned aside at the doors of white restaurants on route they see apartheid trying to reverse the course of the th century they see ghettos for the black man adjoining every white city as peter abrahams wrote in his autobiography all my life has been dominated by a sign reserved for europeans only which in some parts of the united states could read whites only the question is how can african converts balance what they hear about christianity with what they see happening to black people in christian nations in many cases they cannot when they see us fail to live up to our religious principles quite often they will waver in their religion and then cast it aside in disgust and become agnostics although many africans recognize that we in the united states are actively seeking to remove the cancer of discrimination from our societyand many recognize that we are doing more in this direction than most of the worldmost feel we are moving too slowly they are newly independent proud and prone to make quick judgments when their judgments of us are made on the basis of our racial discrimination it involves practical as well as moral implications for us to consider modern africa is young it is impatient and it is in a hurry to make progress africans aspire to move quickly into societies as advanced as our own and their aspirations center around three key areas they want genuine independence for all africans and those who have it guard it jealously they want rapid improvements in their standards of living and they want equality and dignity both national and individual both for themselves and for all colored people wherever they may live thus racial discrimination in the united statesin addition to i being wrong for its own sakeis a i serious detriment to a successful u s foreign policy in africa and in asia and latin america as well t typical of how seriously discrimination is treated in the african mind is this editorial comment from a west african paper if the west led by the united states of america and great britain loses africa to the east it will not be in the race between both blocs to possess more arms or to award more foreign aid rather it will be in the race problem man does not live by bread alone a number of other things go into the making of man to lift him above the herd of beasts and chief of these is what the western world has sung through the ages as respect for human dignity it is the denial of this right to be accepted and treated as human beings to people of dark skin in both the united states of america and the united kingdom in particular that will cost the west dear and another but what has the west with all its religious trappings to show in practice to get ahead in the race for the friendship of africa discrimination in the bus discrimination in the bar and discrimination even in church and on african diplomats in america there is this comment it does not take long for them to discover that in the corridors of the united nations or at state department functions they are accepted as equals and even petted for the favor of their friendship outside this spherein restaurants parks swimming pools clubs and in busesthey find to their amazement and chagrin that white men are more equal than yellow or black faces jwhile the problem of discrimination in housing against darkskinned persons is in origin a domestic race relations issue it also is inextricably linked with the conduct of our foreign relations one prime example of this interrelationship is the situation where many darkskinned foreign diplomats from asia and latin america and especially from africaencounter great difficulty in obtaining suitable housing in washington it is not difficult to imagine the harmful effects of this situation upon the foreign diplomats estimate of our national capital from my own contacts with diplomats i know how distressed some of them have become with housing restrictions they have encountered another place where the question of the american racial situation never fails to arise is in my press conferences throughout africa that is one question i have to be prepared to answer the minute i sit down to face the press and i am always asked it this is also a matter of great concern among african youth just as night follows day i am asked about race relations in america whenever i speak to african students on this last trip i met with the faculty and students of the university college of sierra leone and among the first questions from the audience was one on racial discrimination these are the young leaders with whom we and our children will live for the next several decades the impact of our discriminatory policies on africans cannot be exaggerated this is an open wound in the tissue of africanamerican relations and every incident keeps it inflamed furthermore this impact is important because it affects not only specific problems but also the philosophy and very way of thinking of colored peoples the impact of white mistreatment of darkskinned peoples already has developed for them special definitions for general concepts thus independence to them means first and foremost getting rid of white domination in the same way colonialism for many africans doesnt mean domination of one people by another but the domination of black men by white men such definitions distort and obscure our whole fight for freedom and our struggle against communism to many africans therefore the soviet satellites do not represent colonialism because they are not countries of blacks dominated by whites it is hard too to interest the african in berlin as a fight for freedom partly because by definition there is no oppression of colored people by whites and partly because the black african has felt we have had alltoolittleconcern for the black man deprived of freedom sometimes thoughtful people wonder why the newly independent afroasian countries are so little interested in some of the things that concern us so much and rightly so but i think we must also ask ourselves if we are interested in manifestations of the same things in their part of the world communists can use the line that the united states cant really be sincere in its interest in africa because of our discrimination at home our own transgressions make it extremely difficult for us to answer such charges in a way that satisfies many africans and the fact that the russians discriminate themselves doesnt seem to surface let me make clear right here however that neither the communist challenge or our need for friends abroad is the primary reason that we should be concerned with ending racial discrimination in the united states the important reason is that it should be ended because it is the right thing to do if we are to abide by the words of jesusthe reason that motivates escru and brings us together let me also make clear that there is a need for very rapid progress in the field of racial relations this is pointed up by the comment of msimangu the african priest in alan patons cry the beloved i country who said there is one great fear in my heart that one day when they the whites are turned to loving they will find that we are turned to hating as of today the africans are not full of hate in fact while there have been a few passionate exceptions the africans are remarkably forgiving for the centuries of enslavement and mistreatment they have suffered at the hands of the white man nevertheless we must feel a deep sense of urgency to get on with what remains to be done if we are to attain our goal of dignity and equal treatment for all we cannot expect that the charity shown us by the darkskinned peoples of the world can last forever the challenge to christianity is to grasp the leadership in the fight to assure all people their full and equal rights this is a job that merits the best efforts of christians of all colors in all lands if we are to fulfill the highest principles of our religion a missionary who experienced the fall of china to the communists has said the root of our failure lies in an introverted religion we have forgotten that god must be the god of politics since he is the god of history and of the whole of life we have forgotten that christ died to save the world and not the church only and therefore as christians we have failed to identify ourselves with the rest of mankind in all its human misery and in all the legitimate desires which if unsatisfied clamor for revolution which brings me back to escru and the real tragedy of the white mans relations with the black the real tragedy oddly enough is not what has happened to the black man bad as that has been the real tragedy is what has happened in the corruption of the soul of the white man and the degradation of his character while there is no good to be found in the discrimination against the black man the ultimate loser before god is he who has sinned not he who is sinned against thus escru in hard point of fact is not a crusade to improve the life of the black man but to save the eternal life of the white man finally returning to the words of msimangu the ultimate sin would be if with unsensitive hearts we not only warped our own characters but turned the colored peoples of the world to hating this would be to them and to our children a legacy of horror as dreadful as the bomb as i see it it is our task to lead the battle to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of mankind thus is a task that we must be about without a moments delay and let us pray that with gods help we may be successful in this allimportant endeavor miscegenation is a phony issue i have been cegenist it a misseems for over a quarter of a century i am neither ashamed nor especially proud of this in fact im not even sure im spelling the word correctly miscegenation is a phony issue a false tempest in the modem tea cup and the whole issue would be amusing if this new bogeyman didnt have such tragic meaning in our countrys affairs to give but one amusing example i recently happened upon a list of tv taboos along with rape child molestation and other real hideous crimes miscegenation was also listed the tragic side of this issue is evident in our daily headlines everything from education to drinking a cup of coffee in a restaurant in some parts of the u s a becomes an issue on the alleged grounds that it will all end in that horror of horrorsintermarriage it hasnt in the north the reasoning completely eludes me why should anyone assume their sons or daughters are such morons that they will swoon away upon sitting in the same classroom with a negroas though colored people were newcomers from mars during the depression years of the early thirties negro families invaded to use the real estate term our street living in a large northern city our homes were typical lower middle class private houses the white families promptly sold out and moved away there were no harsh words violence or even the hint of a mob most of the whites never saw the new buyers if anything we white families were rather happy about fleeing times were bad most homes had a large bank mortgage which in the case of my family we would never have been able to pay off suddenly via brokers there were buyers for the houses mostly show people we were told offering a price above the mortgageproving even then the fallacy about negroes lowering property values to this day the prices of these same wellkept homes have constantly risen there wasnt any housing shortage in those days my folks moved downtown and the money helped put me through a year of college but the depression remained a threatening cloud above our heads and i had to leave school after the usual barrage of no jobs and odd jobs i was fortunate enough to become a mailmana very big deal in the days when any civil service job was like winning the sweepstakes true it was only a temporary job but it lasted for several years one christmas a bunch of temps were sent to the post office serving my former home for the christmas rush yes i found myself delivering mail to the house id lived in for most of my life never having returned to the old street i was curious to see the inside of our house now i explained to the family i had formerly lived therewhich didnt make them overly happy as they were sweating under an even larger mortgage than wed had but they let me walk through the house to my surprise it was furnished in almost the same horrible stuffed furniture wed had except for fixing up the porch and a new fence in the backyard the place looked pretty much as i remembered it the family had a daughter a darkskinned yearold it turned out she was interested in art and commercial illustratingas was i i made a point of delivering the mail there as often as i could after christmas the daughter and i began visiting art galleries twelve months later we were married and this year well celebrate our th anniversary if i were asked to highlight the one thing about our marriage which sticks out id have to say its been a very ordinary average life understand im not advocating intermarriage not on the grounds that it is wrong but merely because marriage is a personal matter and it is ridiculous to urge anybody to marry or not to marry this or that person because they are fat or slim bald or hairy of light or dark skin the fact is i would not advocate any marriagefor some people nor am i a spokesman for anybody i can not speak for other mixed couples but i can state that weve had a very normal life weve had our high points and low ones like any couple but none of them have been due to a difference in skin pigment mainly our problems have been the same as yours keeping up the car payments wondering if we will be able to take a cottage for the summer if we can afford to send our daughter to college etc etc we have never lived a furtive life been thrown out of restaurants or cafes assaulted on the streets or even subjected to nasty remarks this is not to say that the threat of possible indignities doesnt hang over ussomething we are more aware of or more aware of the relief from it when we go to europe it is also true our choice of vacations is a trifle limitedweve never considered going to miami beach for example which hasnt bothered us in the least as many americans became suddenly and sharply aware when it took the u s army and world indignation to get even a handful of colored kids into a little rock school our country suffers from a major infectionbigotry certainly this is far from native to the u s a its a world sickness but we seem to have open or belowthesurface prejudices against nearly everybody some of us hate jews catholics protestants indians foreigners northerners southerners progressives reactionaries the rich the poor the educated the uneducated fat people and skinny people while im neither being facetious nor trying to equate the viciousness of these hatreds the fact remains that everybody is a victim of prejudice in our nation to some degree which is also why this article is anonymousin addition to my love of privacy while it is a difficult thing to sum up i think in our case prejudice has hit us mainly in the matter of housing not that weve ever lived in a shack but neither have we lived in an apartment quite in keeping with our income although j in the last year i think this has i changed somewhatthe trouble now is all new rents are so darn f high it is also true some of my relatives still do not speak to me but then weve never been a closely knit family i have aunts living less than two miles apart who only meet at family funerals when i was in the army i probably would have suffered isolation perhaps even physically if it had been known i was married to a negro but the few lasting friends i made in the service visit our apartment to this i day as we visit theirs looking back i think we have had a full life it may be weve lost some white and negro friends because of our marriage but i doubt if we would want them anyway certainly weve never made color a criterion for friendship among our friends we have a few boyhood pals of mine and their wives some of my wifes and a number of people of various colored skins perhaps due to our being a mixed couple we have also met many negro and white intellectuals we would never have known on our own in addition i think our marriage has given each of us a deeper and more mature understanding of humanity and dignity i must add that we have also come across a few well meaning bores who felt our life not their i own should be one long hot civil i rights battle my wife and i have u been active and still are in many i community affairs including the v struggle for civil_rights but we t long ago realized life cant be only a battle there also has to be plenty of time for plain living but as a white person ive had my eyes opened to the many subtle shades of discrimination most whites dont know or care to know for example very few whites can realize the true courage it takes for a negro family to move into an allwhite neighborhood never certain of the reception theyll meet of the physical and mental effect on their kids but happily if humanity has its brutes and fools we always seem to have our heros too the nuances of racial misunderstanding often leave me completely confusedon both sides of the fence i have negro friends who are well aware of my average financial income yet they often ask for outrageous and impractical loans for some wildhair ideas i sometimes believe the only reason they ask me is that they still cling to the oldfashioned idea that all whites must have money i have heard negroes bitterly condemn the hate they found in the south yet in the same breath they will spew out an equally stupid brand of hatein antisemetic and antipuerto rican remarks some people cant believe hate is hate no matter who says it in the course of my work i spend some time in a downtown hotel which has a white staff and about per cent of their guests are negroes including a number of people in the music world on the surface it would seem a well integrated hotel the desk clerk and bellhops are most polite to the colored guests ive often seen and heard them go out of their way to give negro guests detailed instructions on seeing the city or finding a certain theatre with the permanent negro guests the white manager and desk clerks are on a firstname basis they laugh and exchange jokes yet ive also heard these same clerks say upon seeing new negro guests entering here comes a couple of dark clouds or a more bitter phrase i dont know even the socalled new wave french and italian movies with their sophistication and fairly high level for pictures of intellectual understanding still relate mixed couples with sin they will only show a negro man with a white woman for example in some bar or wild party as if their very presence proves what a dive they are picturing on the screen but then these are small shadings and i suppose of no real importance in fact i often think the white desk clerk says his chauvinistic remarks more out of habit than meaning our daughter will be old enough to think of marriage in a year or so to date she has gone out with young men of various skin colors i will be greatly dismayed if she decides to marry or not to marry a young man because his skin is or isnt a special color being a sensible young lady i trust she will decide on a marriage partner by one standard onlydoes her heart and mind tell her they can make it as for those idiots who frighten themselves into a lather over the whole idea of miscegenation both the hysterical dupes and those who use the dupes to keep the cushy for themselves status quo of white is rightlet me remind them that the days of ghosts and bogeymen are long over and ask them to really grow up but please dont tell me we have to grant equality to negroes or what will the russians think most of us never read our constitution but we have one stating all men are born free and equal and it is our own laws we must follow regardless of what any other country will think obviously the reverse of this silly tongueincheek agreement is that if there wasnt a russia it would be okay to keep jimcrow i dont think anybody believes that but sometimes whites have to take a roundabout way of saying things perhaps to allay their own sense of guil by paul crump the pale dusk of evening was settling over the jangling early night of black babylon as i cursed the lethargic battery in the old sedan damn little man i guess shes dead were gonna have to hoof it to the swanksters i told crow yeah well lets dont forget de juice huh momma he said throwing his skates over his shoulder and slipping one of the two fifths of wine i had bought into his hip pocket under his sport shirt i did the same thing with the second bottle as we got out and started walking up the street that dead battery was going to make my scheme a little tougher as i had first planned it it would be a fairly simple matter to get crow loaded at the swanksters roller rink and then instead of driving him back to dots house deliver him home to maxine and the folks he would never stay of course not with dot in her condition but at least he might be able to feel that he had ties beyond her something to keep his life from seeming so miserably hopeless then it would be no problem to get him home by the thanksgiving holiday how did you happen to get tickets to this place guy crow wanted to know as we headed for the swanksters ive never even heard of de joint its new i explained just opened up a couple weeks ago i hear dipper got his hands on four tickets and gave me a couple he had a date with a new broad so he went on ahead that dipper is one straight ofay crow said yeah i said thinking of the lone white boy we called friend man its hot walkin crow said when we had gone about four blocks he paused and took a long swig from his wine bottle good little man i thought glad to see him in a drinking mood youre doin fine we alternately walked and drank the rest of the way to the swanksters with me just taking small sips to encourage crow by the time we reached the lobby of the rink crow was feeling no pain as we approached the pimplyfaced tickettaker he stared at us momentarily then looked at our tickets before raising his blue eyes back to mine dig mani mean he started apologetically like i hope you cats dont take offense i mean i just work here but the fact is mani mean i dig you cats the most and all that yeah you may have seen me dancin at the vipers i looked at crow he was staring at the white boy with openmouthed wonder a hush had settled over the crowded lobby and a sense of shame engulfed me as i felt the play of many eyes upon us i returned my gaze to the white boy he was still talking its not me baby you dig its just why all the gab dad i interrupted feeling a slow anger building up within me just this man i cant let you cats in you dig he said i snatched the tickets yeah man i dig you the most and thats sayin the least i said with suppressed fury come on crow lets dust this democratic den of albinos ah hell guy why crow protested de tickets was bought on de square this is a public place and i wanna skate man grabbing him by the elbow i steered him back through the lobby running a gauntlet of resentful stares as we started to cross the alley a which led to the entrance of the i rinks parking lot a long blue auto i pulled into it and stopped block ing the sidewalk i oh honey look at that funnylooking runty little nigger the blonde girl inside the car exclaimed pointing a redpainted longnailed finger at crow she wore more paint than a japanese geisha girl i grabbed crow as he lunged furiously at the car yanking open the door hands grabbed the girl as she started to tumble out i fought to hold the struggling crow let me go guy he yelled furiously let me lam de pig no bloody sluts gonna call me no no no for craps sake cool it crow were off the reservation man i shouted shaking him another car pulled up behind the first boyseight nine maybe tenscrambled from it hollering rebel cries the other three boys in the first car got out too they all formed a circle around crow and me i released crow he stared around with drunken belligerence the boy who had been driving the first car swaggered to within a foot of crow a cigarette drooped from the comer of his mouth and his eyes were halfclosed as he gazed insolently down at him say spade what was you intending to do to my broad i know you didnt mean to put your black paws on her the malice in his voice caused me to reach towards my belt whoa shine one of the fellows wearing a rebels jacket said stepping up and snatching the belt from around my waist that action will only get you to the graveyard a little earlier his movement toward me left a fairly large hole in the formerly tight circle as he turned the girl cried out slap that little black snot dont talk to him i reached up and grabbed my hat shouting cop and blow crow shouldering the boys aside and lunging through the open hole with crow close on my heels i ran as we raced down the street we could hear the girl screaming get the nigger get the nigger jake dont let them get away ah hell i came to skate not to play in mud after a couple of blocks of hard running i stopped for a breather satisfied that there was no pursuit i stepped into a doorway and called crow as he came charging by sliding to a stop he came back to where i was standing of all de damned and dirty luck he said finally what do you mean i asked were black yeah i said passing him the wine bottle well drink up crow and dont worry about it somebody had to be dark look not upon me because im black because the sun has looked upon me my mothers children were angry with me i quoted in angry disgust then took a long drink of the sweet wine to clear the bitterness from my mouth yeah they were angry all right he said snatching the bottle from my hand to take a drink come on lets make it to the stick hall there should be some tricks there by now buddy if i ever meet that horsefaced tickettaker at de vipers his head belongs to me oh he seems like people crow the cat was only doing his duty yeah he said but de good has got to die with de bad his job to hell with his job de cat on de gate at de vipers does his job too but he dont bar nobody i dont understand well neither do i but life is a bitch here have another drink as crow reached for the bottle he hesitated then shouted my skates theyre gone i could feel the hurt and anguish in his tone i knew the great affection he had for the skates well i told you to cop and blow man why didnt you hold on the damn things yeah i know but what am i gonna do he asked wretchedly go to the cops for what i asked your best bet is to chalk it up to experience yeah but if i ever get my hands on one of those hunkey bastards im gonna he let the threat trail off ominously tilting the bottle he drank half of what was left noticing that he could hardly stand up i took his arm and led him into a nearby hallway we sat on the steps crow with his head hanging between his legs and his narrow shoulders drooped in drunken dejection he muttered my skates damn then in a surprisingly sober voice guy have you seen my family lately the question and the loneliness in his voice were the last things id expected hiding my surprise i said yeah momma i saw maxine i promised to get her a thanksgiving present in fact i nodded at the bottle go ahead man knock yourself out hey baby i wonder how im gonna make it after dots gone i mean until

weakness so all of a sudden youre a superman what about you and your momma ive grown up thats over not wanting to pursue this line of conversation further i grabbed him by the arm and got to my feet come on man those tricks wont wait all night i said as we crossed the railroad tracks he said guy you know i im trying to kick my habits thats i why i been drinking so much late ly i figure after we have come f back from summer camp i might go back home just then a car came speeding by one of its satinjacketed occupants shouted hey black boy heres one of your skates the skate fell at our feet crow picked it up with tears in his eyes the leather shoe was slashed to ribbons oh de bastards ill get even he said as we watched the receding tail lights screeching tires caused me to turn around quickly the blue auto from the rink was coming up fast snatching the almost empty bottle from crows pocket i threw it as the car came even with me the force shattered one of the car windows brakes locked tires burned as the car skidded to a stop crow i said running for the car surging with rage as i neared the car heavily mascaraed eyes stared through the shattered window as i got within several feet of it the car pulled away in rapid acceleration i stood trembling as the tail light disappeared into the night crow caught up with me and we continued to walk down the street as we were getting ready to cross bishop street the blue auto pulled up again a sense of danger gripped me i made a desperate grab for crow as he lunged toward the curb his body slammed back against me knocking me down a thunderous sound was ringing in my ears i tried to get up crow lay sprawled across my leg i shoved his shoulder roughly hey man get the hell off my leg crow raised his head a painful smile split his dark face ii cant momma the dirty bastards shot me i sat up quickly turning him over in my arms his hands gripped his stomach blood gushed from between his fingers coloring his white turtleneck sweater crimson i started to lift him hold it momma he croaked in pain of all thefrigging luck tell dot max thethe old folks ii his head slumped to my chest i raised it blood trickled from the corner of his mouth the dirty foulfighting bastardsthethe momma momma ththeha he laughed thethe he sighed his body shuddered into stillness i knew that he was dead too horrified to speak or move i sat and clutched him to me tightly staring at the hole in his stomach which the fall of his lifeless hands had exposed i realized he said the instead of de for the first time since i had known him he wouldnt say de or the any more yeah the de had been shot out of crow one boom and the des had begun to flow a whole lifetime of des flowing going going gone dead killed thou shalt not kill son never let a blow from a white man go i rocked back and forth with crows head in my lap as the voices rang in my brain finally there was a louder voice saying all right i said turn him loose well take care of him now i looked up in the direction of the voice white hands extended toward me i leaned away from their touch clutching crows body close to me i thought of my promise to maxine crow would be home long before thanksgiving let go boy well take care of him the voice repeated keep your hands off him i screamed leaping to my feet as the white hands touched crow blue eyes opened wide with surprise i jabbed my fists at them with all my might and felt my knuckles smack against flesh the eyes disappeared white faces began to pop up around me i lashed out at them again and again trying to empty myself of all the frustration id ever been made to feel hands tried to hold me i bit at them the street lights reflected on a silver star a woman screamed as i staggered from a blow to the back of my head i reached out blindly for support and felt cloth guy guy for gods sake stop it before they kill you another blow to the head knocked me to my knees i felt myself sinking into oblivion no officer he doesnt know what hes doing the womans voice shouted again was that luzon luzon dont let momma know i yelled as a third blow fell blackness covered me talents new wave in recent years much has been made of the new generation when the spotlight turns to education and civil_rights the attention has been deserved for the young and the newdirected negro indeed has served notice that a new day is at hand what has not been noticed sufficiently is that the spirit which moves the young freedom fighter also has infected the artist and there is an excellent young writer musician or sculptor to match every martin_luther_king jr or diane nash the creative personality in short is keeping pace all over the country gifted young men and women are gaining recognition for their work in the plastic musical and dramatic arts and negro poets and writers have made a major breakthrough in recent months many of these bright young people are well known nowjames baldwin earle hyman and grace bumbry as examplesbut there are many more whose extraordinary ability demands recognition among these are sculptressceramistjewelry maker cledie taylor of detroit actress ellen holly and poet leroi jones of new

obie at mr jones has behind him a solid background in the dramatic arts after switching from medicine to drama at the university of michigan he appeared in campus productions and made his professional debut in christopher frys a sleep of prisoners he also played the leading roles in michigan productions of deep are the roots and othello before heading for new york in for two years the actor honed his talent at the american theatre wing then in he landed his first bigtime role in the play wedding in japan while some of the plays in which mr jones subsequently appeared received negative or indifferent reviews his own notices invariably were good the obie award is testimony in last seasons moon on a rainbow shawl mr jones had the signal honor of acting with his father robert earl jones

says exploring until there is no longer anything to explore or until i become interested in other things the plight of negroes as individual human beings in america i want to understand it all but do not think i will ever venture any answers and then the question put to this articulate representative of the new leaders what do you feel about the future of the negro in america and the answercool thoughtful assured this is a very personal view and though it may be right for me it can be completely wrong for the race though i think it perhaps will ultimately have to be done i feel it is time for the individual negro to come out from behind the shield of race each negro must realize that his worth as a human being comes from his being unique not a member of a race or party or club or group a sixteenth of an inch of skin is nothing either to crow about or to feel ashamed of if you are a human being and know it you will remain a human being even if you are brainwashed deprived of food clothes and shelter drugged beaten or shot you are a human being until you die any respect you get is because of your humanness i do not mean that the negro race should not weld itself into one great power to achieve equality in this country but what will happen to these people when they go home and are alone being negro is a relative thing each lone negro must find something in himself that he feels is worthy of respect and decent treatment and that in my view can only be his unique quality as one lone human being in death of a salesman arthur miller gives some lines to mrs linda loman she is speaking of her husband willy i dont say hes a great man willy loman never made a lot of money his name was never in the paper hes not the finest character that ever lived but hes a human being so attention must be paid hes not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog attention attention must finally be paid to such a person and perhaps this is true of each man when thinking about himself attention must be paid by each one of us to what we really are human beings not simply members of a race young alvin ailey is in a class all his own a superb dancer he is hardly less talented as choreographer and actor above all he is a pacesetter and innovator in his field exploring new areas of the dance with spectacular success last august he crowned a busy and meteoric career at the american dance festival at connecticut college the following is part of what allen hughes of the new york times had to say about mr ailey and his dances and dancers at the new london festival some of the most exciting dancing our country has to offer was seen at the american dance festival when the alvin ailey dance theatre appeared at connecticut colleges palmer auditorium this second event of the festival season was planned to focus attention upon influences that ethnic traditions have wrought upon the dance of our time the chances are however that hardly anyone in the audience bothered to reflect on the origins of anybody or anything for the proceedings on stage were simply too engrossing most of the time to allow for any meditation continuing with his enthusiastic assessment of the ailey performance mr hughes wrote as it happens it is considerably easier to be enthusiastic about mr ailey and his dancers than it is to say just why they seem so good he and the five colleagues with him are american negroes and their major work revelations is based on nine negro spirituals unfortunately these bare facts explain little if anything nor is it of much use to speak of the dancers infallible rhythmic sense extraordinary physical suppleness and inherent grace one must turn rather to the galvanizing personality of mr ailey himself there one might find sweetness and rage hope and despair the sacred and the profane all battling with each other for ascendancy weakness resigna tion and compromise would hardly have a chance alvin ailey is an alumnus of the late lester hortons dance troupe from los angeles the troupe that also developed the dazzling carmen delavallade and the enchanting lelia goldoni in new york where fame awaited the trio ailey often teamed with miss delavallade in dance recitals and performances in the metropolitan area miss delavallade shared the spotlight with ailey on the state department sponsored tour of the orient from which the dancers returned just prior to the connecticut college triumph the tour of course was an unqualified success it was five years ago in the broadway musical jamaica that critics first realized a new star had risen in the person of alvin ailey since then he has appeared wherever excellent dancing is important in this country including the young men and young womens hebrew association dance center and jacobs pillow his brilliant ideas have been realized in such choreographic masterpieces as cinco latinos blues suite creation du monde revelations and the more recent gillespiana mr ailey has been featured on television notably on the red skelton and dave garroway shows but early in he exposed an extension of his extraordinary gifts at which he had only hinted in the past he appeared as one of the trio of lead actors in the offbroadway call me by my rightful name and scored as a dramatic actor of power and promise but it is with alvin ailey the dancer and choreographer that this article is concerned for it is in the dance that he has forged new paths which it is his duty to explore more fully it is significant that alvin ailey achieves the first peak of what can only be a long and fruitful career at the very moment that his most famous predecessor katherine dunham returns with a new revue in another era it was dunham who showed the world how ethnic traditions could revolutionize the concept of modern dance from the dancing in on your toes to the sensational choreography of west side story the dunham influence has been everpresent it is fitting then that at an ailey performance hardly anyone in the audience bothered to reflect on the origins of anybody or anything this is the goal toward which the long hard bitter struggle has been directed to the moment when talent needs no recommendation except itself howard n meyer a lawyer living in suburban new york is one of those staunch and determined people totally immune to the defeat usually induced by endless encounters with arrogance obstinacy and ignorance frustration seems only to goad him onward mr meyer is an avid student of the civil war and reconstruction periods and he happens to feel that the real truth about that era has rarely been told moreover he also feels that the communication media television movies radio books magazines etcresist pressures in behalf of the truth like a growing number of scholars and historians mr meyer maintains that the souths howard n meyer point of view toward the civil war and negroes graduallyin the years following the civil warbecame the accepted national viewpoint in the november issue of negro digest we reprinted his article did the south win the civil war which made the point that for all practical purposesit surely did but let mr meyer speak for himself i think that the most important and the most neglected area of the civil_rights battle is the teaching and writing of historyfor as long as million white kids north and south are brainwashed with what i see in our american history books as the story of reconstruction just so long will they continue to grow up feeling that the negro was and therefore is something less than human for several years mr meyer sought to get publishers to reissue thomas wentworth higginsons allbutforgotten army life in a black regiment a classic inside report of the first south carolina volunteers in the civil war higginson a colonel commanded the negro troops and his sympathetic record of their problems and performance refuted all the myths of negro military inadequacy last year two different publishers released editions of the higginson book at and respectively now at last mr meyer has persuaded collier books to issue an edition of army life in a black regiment at the popular cent price this edition one of the collier civil war classic series suitably boasts an introduction by howard n meyer the book should make an appropriate souvenir of the civil war centennial celebrations currently underway and which for the most part imply that the south and the slave holders were on the side of the angels negro digest recommends this highly entertaining and enlightening book to the readers tuesday the allimportant day to james henry when the art supervisor made her once a month visit to the abraham lincoln elementary schoolnow no longer for just colored children but which still had rv just coloredon the outskirts of town the building was a hastily reconverted warehouse in need of painting again with windows so constructed that james henry could easily peer out without turning his head and see miss higgins five year old ford make lined tracks in the road in his own way james henry knew it really wasnt miss higgins who sparked this tremendous wave of excitement within him there were times the short plump white woman unnerved him by the way she hurriedly talked and looked into the chalk flecked space above their heads as if she were anxious to be somewhere else other than the always stuffy room with too much heat in the winter and burning sun warmth in the spring finally if she did deign to concentrate for a moment on one of the small heads before her she seemed to look through but never quite at the little one there no it wasnt miss higgins that caused him to often lie awake sleeplessly the night before but the longer art time enabling him to make things real from his mind to his hands onto paper after what appeared to be an eternity of time he saw miss higgins drive up the graveled lane and park beside the school all right class his teachers voice broke into his reverie were going to put up our readers and prepare for our art supervisors visit the heavy sound of desk tops being raised and books carelessly thrown into them were almost one now remember boys and girls were going to act very nicelike intelligent little people when miss higgins comes miss cain always said that and james henry often wondered why since to him they acted like nice people all the time carefully miss cain began to pass out the scarred paint boxes used by too many small hands in the past along with the coarse looking drawing paper of which there never seemed to be enough from the way she counted the eager dark eyes over and over again to be sure when the last tin of water had been apportioned miss higgins opened the door she perpetually arrived billowing a heavy shower of lilac perfumeher face powdered too thickly beneath the black felt hat worn throughout the school year good afternoon boys and girls good afternoon miss higgins they unisoned miss cain smileda different smile from her regular classroom one her mouth appeared jerky and tight making the thin coffee tinted cheekbones more prominent without taking off her hat only pausing long enough to quickly shut her purse and jacket in miss cains tiny locker miss higgins began today were going to try to do a spring scene now what do you think about when you think of spring a collection of multihued hands assailed the air since miss higgins j did not know their names or even seemed interested enough to askj voices tumbled out and over onj another flowers y warm weather birds yes all of those and were going to put down our thoughts of springa nice warm southern spring like we have hereright on paper first lets james henry began to feel the familiar surge of excitement causing a tingling sensation to course through his body he picked up his brush staring at the small half dips of red blue green and yellow colors in the opened paint box before him already he could see touch and smell his spring on this chilly april day the spring he would soon like to see in his yard along the narrow wooded path to school and by the bank where the grass grew tall and cool smelling fresh and feeling damp beneath his outstretched form it was his yard he began to shape the flowers he had planted around the house and the old gnarled bent tree older than time shading the ground in the summer and warding off the wind in the winter oh this is delightful miss higgins exclaimed beside him then he looked up james henry paints very well miss cain said pride in her words maybe youll grow up to be an artist someday young man miss e liggins said someone like remrandt or michelangelo rembrandt and michelangelo lames he had never heard of but yet they were artists people who drew to live and lived to draw vaguely he wondered if they were colored much too soon miss cain said class im sorry but our art period is over over and to him it was just the beginning tell miss higgins good afternoon class good afternoon miss higgins they chorused politely on the way out of the room miss higgins suddenly turned to miss cain with a tiny surprised gasp oh my dear i almost forgot the community art league wants to enter some of the schools pictures in the state childrens art festival in all fairness they asked me to get a few representative pictures from here of course they just cant be any old thing and im not promising theyll even be accepted i understand miss cain said with the funny tight smile around her mouth again well see what we can do wonderful well goodbye class goodbye miss higgins when school ended james henry ran all the way home to the grey shingled house with the jagged yard around it his mother was in the kitchen busily frying the perch they had every friday for supper look mom look excitedly he clutched the paint box and piece of smooth white cardboard miss cain regretfully had said was all she had miss cain let me have these for the weekend who son my teacher mom what for to draw with she said james henry you take these home and paint whatever you feel like wiping her hands on the wide apron the woman squinted curiously at the tightly clutched box and paper thats nice son thats certainly real nice miss cain says maybe ill be an artist when i grow up maybe she said sighing looking at and beyond him like she was already seeing him grown up she reached over the stove and put a heavy iron lid over the huge skillet covering the fishgolden brown hard crisp git ready n eat son you got to take your daddy his dinner hes got to work late tonight wonder what i can draw mom up to you n god son clear up to you n god after dinner he sat at the window gazing out trying to make the picture thought come i got it all ready son he took the brown bag his mother handed with the fish sandwiches and thermos of hot black coffee be careful now your daddy aint eaten since this morning i spect hes awful hungry all right mom he walked quickly down the dusty road beginning to loom dark in the twilight shouts of partly clad children playing in the road dust around the rows of shot gun shacks raked the air further on he could soon see the railroad track and knew it wouldnt be long before he reached the canning factory where his father would be waiting by the gate ahead he saw a car approaching and moved closer to the side of the road suddenly the car pulled over beside him and stopped two white men peered out the one closest stared directly into his eyes hey you boy cmere tentatively he walked towards them wonder what hes got in that bag hes holding like a pot of gold the nearest one said james henry could smell the beer on his breath as the man pushed his face out the window he knew the smell from passing the taverns while shopping in town on saturday with his mother especially in the summer the smell would come out the door and blend angrily with the hot pavement damned if i know the driver said maybe it is gold boy you got gold in that bag his mother always told him to answer white people quick and polite then get away as soon as you could no sir james henry said shaking his head its my daddys dinner sir the man leaned over the bag hummm he said wrinkling his nose smells more like his mothers youknowwhat the second man laughed uproariously body pressing hard on the car horn thats a goddam good one a goddam good one its fish sir james henry said softly eyes a little frightened now your daddys dinner hey well dont believe it think its a pot of gold here gimme the bag n lets see instinctively the boy hesitated moving back slightly you hear me nigger boy gimme the bag the arm reached out quickly grabbing sandwiches sprawled over the road into the dust and the thermos fell and broke spilling hot coffee over his feet and ankles the hotness burst into hard pain well ill be damned it was his daddys dinner the first one said in mock amazement yeah and not his mas youknowwhat hawhawhaw then just as hurriedly the car roared forth with the laughter and the motor sound quickly gone first he wanted to cry and then he did all the way to the factory where his daddy was waiting in the grey dusk hey boy whats wrong a reassuring sound of a familiar voice in spurts gasps and in between tears he told him well dont worry bout it boy itll be all right them things happen to people like us best thing to do is forgit it i can wait only four more hours anyhow you go on home now ill be there directly the next evening he walked to miss cains house and gave her the picture carefully covered with brown wrapping paper he didnt wait until she looked at it but silently turned and left no more was said about the picture and soon spring came and june quickly followed then just before school was out for the summer miss cain took him to the principals office miss higgins was there and when he went in she looked at him very strangely for the first time he noticed her eyes were greyjust greyand that was all james henry the principal began coming from around his desk youd better brace yourself for a big surprise you won the first prize in the state childrens art festival ridiculously his tongue felt weightless and immovable after a while all he could say was yes sir the principals round brown face was smiling broadly and miss cain looked is if she was going to cry you know miss higgins said the award presentations will be made in our new museum and art institute in the state capitol the program will mark the official opening of the institute and your picture will be displayed there still smiling the principal patted james henrys shoulder itll be a big big day for you son only the big big day got all tangled up first his mother and father dressed up in their sunday clothes that monday his daddy looked different in the blue suit he seldom wore that was too short at the ankles and his mother looked odd in the one good black dress black hat and white gloves but they seemed very happy his mother kept flashing warm smiles at him and brushing imaginary lint from his blue suit when his daddy looked at him and said im sure proud of you son im sure proud he felt better than he had ever felt in all his life together they got in the car with miss cain to drive the fifteen miles to the state capitol after they got to the sprawling new museum and art institute with the two stone lions on each side of the iron gates and a confederate general in the middle of the steps they were stopped by the institutes guards the guards were sorry but they couldnt come in because it wasnt julythe one month in the year set aside for negro visitors just at that time miss higgins and a man dressed in a white linen suit hurried out of the building toward them thank goodness we were wondering if youd get here on time miss higgins said breathlessly the programs about to start well the man said staring down at james henry is this the boy why yes miss higgins murmured glancing fleetingly at james henry thats james henry miss cain supplied hand lightly brushing his shoulder quickly the man extended his hand congratulations im mr rusick chairman of the state art festival committee you people should be mighty proud of this boy mighty proud we are suh his father answered softly eyes focused on the center of the white mans black tie we certainly are james henry was surprised that it was his father who had spoken and not his mother his father didnt have much to say especially to white people but neither did his mother for that matter lets go in before we hold up the works mr rusick said taking james henrys arm these people cant go in there the guard repeated blocking their path what do you mean cant go in there mr rusick said frowning i told em the institutes rule is for colored in july i miss higgins and mr rusick i stared at each other in amazement i both turning a deep red this is ridiculous mr rusick f finally managed to say absolutely ridiculous why this boy won first prize sorry mister rules are rules didnt make em groups of welldressed white people began climbing the steps and entering the building a small number of colored james henrys minister friends and a few relatives who had heard about the picture prize started up the steps saw them and paused nearby then the orange and black school bus bearing his classmates and the fifth grade teacher drove up the students got out quietly and stood beside the other colored and they all made one big shadow in the sun god mr rusick mumbled angrily wiping his face with a clean white handkerchief this is preposterous he glanced embarrassed at the colored waiting out of hearing but somehow knowing this program was planned for this particular time to commemorate the opening of the new building we just assumed everyone would be welcomedregardless besides miss higgins said in a tiny awed whisper almost as if to herself but not quite to herself we had no idea a colored boy would win dont care if a green eyed toad won mr rusick said this boy won the prize and he should go in there and get the award like everybody else well miss higgins began ive lived here all my life and its been like thiscertain times for colored at the state placesand will bei suppose but this is a joint school project mr rusick protested the schools are integrated i just dont understandi just dont understand he said over and over again the neat white gloves didnt conceal the quivering of james henrys mothers hands nor was the sun shining too brightly in his fathers eyes which kept blinking like he couldnt see or didnt want to see im going to call the governor mr rusick said turning and stalking pass the confederate statue from somewhere a newsman appeared and quickly snapped their pictures while it was being decided what to do with them later mr rusick came back shaking his head hes out of the state and cant be reached nobody else will handle it ratherfunnyisnt it miss higgins laughed shakily suddenly james henrys father spoke up quietly distantly mouthing words he had echoed over and over again at other times and places we dont want to cause no trouble suh well miss higgins interrupted smiling graciously at the bent colored man the programs been delayed long enough ill just have to bring the prize to the boy at school next week maybe miss cain can think of a nice little assembly program and then miss cain spoke up a hint of tears in her eyes lips trembling slightly nono we wont do that james henry earned that prize and it should be awarded by the committee as its supposed to be miss cain was tall but when she drew herself up like she was doing now it seemed she was tall and straight and brave as a warrior mr rusick go in there and get that picture and bring it out here tell that committee it can either come to us and present the award or the boy will reclaim the picture mr rusick looked at her quietly for a moment and all the world stopped in that moment then when he smiled the world came alive again youre quite right young lady quite right thats exactly what well do in a few moments the steps and yard were surrounded with guests award winners and the committee the small colored group did not move but remained there quietly impassively until james henry was given the silver cup prize with his name on it then the group broke into restrained applause faces lighting like multiple lit candles when the picture was unveiled there was a stunned awkward silence as they saw a small naked black boy standing in the dimmed greyness of a twilighted road looking toward the sky and crying large red blood tears while there was nothing around him except the penetrating dusk later they hung the picture in the art gallery but james henry never went back again after that to see his little black boy crying in the twilight not even when colored were allowed short story writing in black south africa the short story by black and controls restrictions and prosouth africans is the hibitions the principal feature of literary record of the these stories is the analytical study system of apartheid it of the african character the psymirrors the total im chological adjustment the accompact of that system upon the af modation to the system this charricans the coloureds mixed acter is conceived as a hero far rebloods and the indians caught in moved from the standard code the complex mass of regulations of moralitythe antihero concept the heroes of these short stories are pickpockets hijackers payroll robbers beggars and other generous assortments of social maladjusts acts of heroism are marked by games at beating the law stealing from whitesa calculated defiance against law and order the police and whites in general are the villains or the victims this short story hero is invested with a birdofpassage morality concentrates into every minute or every hour the feverishness of intense living our hero abandons himself to the lower freedomsthe freedom from morality and the freedom of vice and because of the dichotomy of the social structure of south africa the hero functions on the fringe of a culture which is rejecting him in a society which has labelled him pedigreed him and then discriminates against him to understand this character the motives behind the seemingly irrational behaviourit is necessary to understand the psychological mores of the kind of society which produces this state of mind nadine gordimersouth africas most perceptive writeris illuminating in her analysis of it the greatest single factor in the making of our mores in south africa was and is and will be the colour question it is far more than a question or a matter of prejudice or discrimination or conflict or loyaltieswe have built a morality on it we have gone even deeper we have built our own sense of sin and our own form of tragedy we have added hazards of our own to mans fate and to save his soul he must wrestle not only with the usual lust greed and pride but also with a set of demons marked made in south africa a colourcaste society like south africa must establish definite identifiable groups with consistent group attitudes in a society like britains where the visibility of the social groups has been lowered by the commercialization of the uniformity of dress and the democratization of social institutions it is still the establishment which is surrounded by the symbols of opulence they dominate the economy and therefore the social structure but in south africa where the different social groups have high visibility the whitesa numerical minorityhave arrogated to themselves all the symbols of wealth and authority and have arranged themselves as a political majority the nonwhite groups africans coloureds indians form the numerical majority which is invested with symbols of inferiority and are a minority politically against the background of this social dichotomy the short story highlights attitudes between blacks i and whitesextragroup relations j and the attitudes among the i blacks themselvesintragroup re y lations the problems of race the attitudes and the relations that go with it are present in all life in south africa we are born into race prejudice we live with it we die with it and are buried with it with all these groups arranged against each otherthe one dedicated to maintaining it the other committed to smashing itforce becomes implicit conflicts arise and since race prejudice is written into the law there is no common arbiter the parties must decide for themselves the arbitrament of the sword becomes if not the moral but the real arbiter and thus force becomes the expression and violence the clarification of the society the tone of the short story is primarily that of protest the african character must arrange himselfsurviveunder the system with some personal dignity his reaction is implicit in his behaviour to the white man and this behaviour will be determined by the circumstance and the situation in which he finds himself his behaviour is changeable and his pattern of behaviour may be analysed into these three forms submission and accommodation aggression and escape or flight in the first category the attitude of the african to the white man is that of servility he observes the proper forms of address using the appropriate terms of reference he exploits these proper forms of address when in trouble or when seeking to extract favours from his overlords the africans whole existence his personal safety depends on depth studies of the south african white thus the african understandshe has tothe white man more than the white man will ever know the african the white man mourns with lyricism the passing from the scene of the good native thus the african in trouble will obsequiously resurrect the image of that noble savage this character merely accommodates the system without in any way beginning to accept it the african character differs from the other nonwhite characters in that he acceptsrather than regretsthe blackness of his face in my own short stories the characters accept the physical reality of their colour and then proceed to exploit it in exactly the same way that a beggar needs to be horribly deformed to be able to milk peoples sympathy in the short story the professional beggar to the disability of being black is added physical deformitya kind of double indemnity nathan serurubele is educated to highschool level but is condemned to being a beggar for a living not that he is unable to earn a living but because he is crippled he submits to their construction that to be disabled is to be necessarily dependent upon the charity of a society which will destroy a mans pride rather than set aside the charity mentality nathan serurubeles pride is too humiliated by the degradation and it is this humiliation which sustains him he becomes a professional beggar organizing himself into a commercial enterprise he is arrested and the scene before the magistrate is a cynical exploitation of peoples sympathy the disability is used mercilessly as a weapon to assault the sensibilities of the whites your lordshipmy honour most of us beg because we have been ostracized by our parents by everybody people treat us like lepers they have trained us conditioned us to look up to them for all the things we need no one wants to employ uspeople are more willing to offer us charity rather than give us jobs all they ever do is show us pity we want to be given a chance to prove were as good as anybody this character has realized that ability is rejected inclusively with the colour of his skin that being black is analogous to being deformeda physical handicap in the athletics of earning a living his personal philosophy becomes thus if anything is worth doing its worth doing well nathan serurubele accepts this condition and the commitment to it in south africa privilege is white and nonwhites are placed on different levels of underprivileged the indians and the coloureds are situated on a higher level of privilege than the afri cans psychologically the indians and the coloureds tend to gravitate further and further from black nearer to white to them it is a misfortune not to have been born white and they emphasize this by their own brand of rejection of and discrimination against the afri cans these two groups are obsessed by a white complex this is perhaps understandable in a society where white is the positive standard and black the negative as it is implicit in the label nonwhite in the short story the bench j by richard rives whose story the strike appeared in the april negro digest an indian schoolteacher living in cape town the indignation at being nonwhite instead of white is shown as the motivation behind the social protest it is not white domination which is being protested against but its singling out of those who were not born white it is the effect it has and not the condition itself which is under fire being white and being privileged are confused to mean the same thing richard rives captures the essential tone of the ambivalence to the colour white the scene is a political meeting and a speaker says we form an integral part of a complex society in which a vast proportion of the population is denied the very basic right of existence a society that condemns a man to an inferior position because he has the misfortune to be born black a society that can only rej tain its precarious social and ecoj nomic position at the expense of an enormous oppressed mass the coloureds and the indians are a lighter skin colour than the africans a pigmentorial quality which places them closer to white the coloureds in particular since they are publicly described as the appendages of the whites requestby commensurate approximation proportional privileges improved conditions in their social status and gradual integration acceptance and accommodation as a reaction to social prejudice is determined by the situation as illustrated in the short stories themselvesthe individual finds himself in thus the african policeman the teacher in bantu education schools the people who serve on tribal councils school boards etc have to accommodate the system even if it is implied that they are the instruments of their own oppression the next pattern of behaviour analyzed by the short stories is that of aggression directed against the system like america south africa has a frontier or voortrekker mentality a savage throwback to the days when the law dangled in the holster or the shot gun and justice was swift informal and prejudiced lynchings and horse whippings are deep in the traditions of these countries both are compulsive addicts to horse operas under stress the average man in america and in south africa will resort to violence in south africa violence exists as the expression of the public conscience this violence is contained in the law it is the instrument of maintaining law and order the african character lives in the screaming wake of this violence and unlike most south african attitudes violence is truly colour blind compulsively driven by frustration the african directs his aggression against himself this ingroup aggression is directed against the more successful afri j cans who are by and large re sented for being successful because success is seen as the quality of being white on the surface the motives for this aggression may be for material gain or just lawless rebellion against form and cohesion where form and cohesion are symbols of authority which is white this african character lives so close to death that death becomes the reflection of the empty gestures of the living a defiance against his life death revenges the african character against life it is both sides of a single reality death is the master who must be paid and although this character may fear death he is fascinated by it because he is familiar with it he courts it he jokes about it he dares it he surrenders himself to it and then death becomes a refuge from the burden of being black in white south africa in the short stories of arthur maimane a journalist on a london news agency death purges bis characters from being black his m characters defy death they run from the police ignore the order to stop and defy the warning shots compulsively runningrunning away from south africa into death arthur maimanes stories just a tsotsi and a manner of speaking probes the depths of desperation which his characters have reached in the story just a tsotsi his character is arrested for a pass offence and during the assault upon him by the police he breaks from them and starts running he is ordered to stop but he continues running now hes asking for trouble hannes said seeing a chance to vindicate himself with one fluid motion he grabbed his rifle from where it was leaning against the wall and fell down on one knee he wont be cheeky any more after this he fired deliberately low the bullet hitting the ground between the running boys legs and ricocheting at an angle with a whine the boy yelped and ran faster dont kill him hannes the corporal said in a low tight voice hannes laughed this is what ive been waiting for his next shot whined close by the boys ear with another frightened yelp the boy crouched down and started running zigzag fashion he had almost reached the gate now he straightened up to grab at the post and swing round it hannes grinned and fluidly shifted his rifle to the hand holding the post he fired two quick shots smashing the hand vith the first and hitting the boys head with the secc id as it came round and above the t ost the violence strikes out against everybody and perhaps with more eroticism against ourselves the incidence of drunkenness crime and violence in urban black communities is alarmingly high the anger of the african character is always a going to extremes we love parties nicetimes noise and people we are sweating in a world where death is all around us a world in which only death has value in our attempts to obliterate timethe minutes of our lives we intoxicate ourselves with orgiastic pleasures noise and people and then when we are dizzy we annihilate ourselves we kill each other for pleasure for revenge for caprice aggression directed against the whitesthe outgroupsis more complex and variable it may be physical as demonstrated in the high incidents of crime and violence or more overt as on the personal level where insolence against the white man is common there is always some sort of rebellion against the race attitudes in the story a manner of speaking by arthur maimane the character is aggressively insistent on maintaining his dignity by being courteous but refusing to conform to the ster eotype of the african being in solent or cheekyby south afri can standardsbecomes a game which at the end of the story is to cost him his life after a minute he coughed the young woman turned her head slowly her eyes narrowed as she recognized him she looked out of the window again he coughed louder ja what do you want she asked without looking at him two tuppence stamps please she took the four steps towards the counter slowly hands on broad hips and head stuck out ahead of the body she stood across the counter from him her grey eyes boring into his say missis she said quietly the middleaged woman looked up from her novel and studied the two he remained silent if you dont say missis youre not getting your stamps look mevrou all i want is two tuppence stamps ive said please and that should be enough say missisor get out he stared back for a moment shrugged his shoulders and walked out physical violence strikes out against everybody the african character is always reacting scratching at the wall of colour prejudice accommodating it being aggressive to it or looking around for escapein compensationor taking flight from it going to other parts of africa or i running away to europe in search of a gentler political climate escape from the colour bar is the subtlest of the reactions of the african character the coloured and the indian the south african public image is white the values of that society are white and all the sex symbols are white and consequently the africans and the coloureds have to arrange themselves under the code of this standard since to be white is to be privileged the coloureds with low visibilityfair enough to pass for whiteescape into the domain of the whites and the africans of lighter skinthe less clearly visible africanssteal into the structure of the coloured group for the coloureds it means the end of living in social igloos the end of discrimination it means sliding into white society access into white restaurants cinemas theaters bars and other symbols of white privilege it is freedom to the lightskinned african it is an end to the regulations and the strangulations of the document called the pass passing himself off as a coloured will give the african freedom of movement the opportunity to select and accept the job of his own choice and the relief from being at the black bottom of the colour scale this escape into another colo r the rationalizations for it are illustrated in my own short story the havenots why go all sentimental this is a battle between the haves and the havenots the haves have made being black too much of a burden and the only way to survive is to fool them by playing their own game they made white a symbol of privilege and comfort so i decided to be as near white as i can bleach its not my fault im lightskinnednothing like enough to pass for lily white that isbut sufficiently to masquerade as a coloured okay okay i said raising my hand as a sign of peace whats in being a native anyway black devil black pitchforking devil black thats alljust black black black well i dont wanna be blacknot any more youll never be a white man steve said contemptously i dont wanna be a white man i shouted i just want to be white just white of particular interest is the way in which the nonwhite groups particularly the africanswill live with this situation and even retain their sense of humour without in any way beginning to accept it the nonwhite groups have been educated into an acceptance of their own inferiority and in some insidious way this educating has had some effect for this doctrine to be acceptedor even suspected the education into this accommodation or even acceptance will be directed towards elevating whiteness as some unattainable ideal some unobtainable standard all ambition will be directed physically towards or to an association with it the coloureds especially the ones with a darker skin have a psychosis about marrying coloured girls with a much fairer complex ion this woman becomes the substitute for white alternately the african man seeks to marry a lightskinned african girlpreferably a coloured girl this preoccupation with skin colour is a feature in the story forbidden love by d can themba the african character falls in love with a coloured girlhis personal substitute for white his psychological rejection of black comes into conflict against the coloured girls physical rejection of black the question of colour foreshadows the conflict she turned her head and placed her chin on his chest somehow mike she tried to explain softened again now i feel trapped by a doubly guilty shame im ashamed that its my people who are in the foreground of every move against your peopleashamed of my father whom i love but whos violent in his hatred of africans ashamed of my sister louisa who ought to feel nearer your people but hates them so unreasonably ashamed of my brothers shame for having been reclassified as an african ashamed of my mothers silence when i suspect i know it that she disapproves of their attitudes and then sweetie sometimes when i listen to them all iii am ashamed in a queer way thatj i hate myself for this secret love of ours another form taken by escape behaviour is one expressed by means of compensation the african character is obsessed with easing his condition he surrounds himself with the symbols of the society which is rejecting him he wants to be accepted he wants to qualify to be civilized so he develops a love for academic trappings and the related trinkets of opulence he flaunts his wealth he drives in big cars prefers publiclibrarysized houses filled with enormous pieces of furniture he erects these monuments both as a symbol of success and to his own sense of insecurity in south africa where opportunity and wealth are white such an african reasons that if to be white is to be wealthy then conversely to be wealthy should be to be white thus the african buys not a car but a status symbol the car must be big and flashypreferably a cadillacfor success has to have a high visibility this reaction is also manifest in the vulgarity of the makeup african women wear if to be white is to be painted with makeup the african woman in her search of this ideal adds on the paint with generous vulgarity straightens the tropic curl from her hair by burning the hair with a hot comb and she bleaches her face with lotions it is necessary that this should be done with vulgarity whatever she does must be better than the best in a tedious succession of escapist short stories published in drum zonk and other south african popular magazines the african indian and the coloured characters are paraded as gaudily successful boxing promoters tough private detectives and other cardboard images of romanticism yet even against this background the escapist short story hero is seldom if everon the side of formal law and order his efforts are directed at flaunting the law but in the short stories of ezekiel mphahlele famous educator and writer the characters do not easily fall into the categories defined in this analysis primarily because the author believes that the african character should be portrayed as a purely fictional character and not as a mould cast in racial tensions in his stories the african exists on a level far removed from the tensions of the colour bar which is not necessarily a hazard in his life author mphahlele insists upon the african portrayed as a human character wrestling with the basic hazards of man greed lust and pride in the story i the suitcase ezekiel mphahlele emphasizes the motive of greed be hind timis action of claiming the suitcase abandoned in a bus but behind every motive is cause and effect the position of the individual in any societyin particular that of south africa and to a lesser extent that of britainis determined by the colour or social caste into which that character is born that timi is black is implicit in the young white typists impersonal attitude towards him the same attitude is seen in the foreman they are not addressing themselves to timi the individual but to a black mask timi reacts by smiling knowingly this reaction is particularly interesting in that timi accommodates the depersonalization the grim reality of his situation returned to him with all its cold and aching pain today he had been led on something of a wild goose chase he had been to three places where the chances of getting work were promising he had failed at one firm he was told weve already got a boy john at the second firm a tiny typist told him youre too big jim the boss wants a small boyabout eighteen you know then she had gone on with her typing clouding her white face with cigarette smoke at the third place a short pudgy white man put down his price in a squeaky voice two pounds ten a week three pounds ten a week timi had said take it or leave it my boy was the proprietors final word timi chuckled to himself as he thought of the mans face his fat white cheeks and small blinking eyes ezekiel mphahleles white characters in the suitcase are not just human characters they are south african white the human character in any fiction has to function within the society which produces that character in the story down the quiet street also by ezekiel mphahlele there is no mention of the white figure nor is the colour question implied the characters come to life vividly with all the humour that is african the orchestration of the characters is flawless it is a recount of the story of the endless funeral processions which trailed down nadia street week after week short ones long ones poor insignificant ones rich snobbish ones there is a kind of escapist romanticism in the setting of this short story and but for the smuggling of liquor the story might be set outside south africa the reasons behind the liquor smuggling is not because prohibition is general but that it operates against africans only the african must drink and to do this he must be one jump ahead of the law no device is left unexplored even the sanctity of the funeral ritual is violated during one of those inevitable human accidents an incident reveals the se cret of those funeral processions one of the coffins cracks and a miniature avalanche of bottles came down to the ground in his more angry moods ezekiel mphahleles characters protest against the colour bar and against white attitudes all life in south africa is dominated by the impact of one colour upon the other the colour bar motivates all our actions all our reactions and all our attitudes the whites act in a manner determined by the roles they have to play in a dominant society the africans the indians and the coloureds react to one another and towards the white man in the various forms outlined in this analysis they may accept or accommodate the colour bar in accordance to the situation they are in they may be aggressive in their rejection of the situation or find a way of escape or take flight from it but there is always the physical presence of the colour bar examined in this essay are the social conditions and group attitudes which shape the pattern of the south african black short story all nuances of life of human relationships are contained in it perhaps in time other influences will insinuate different attitudes order a new society which will have a more fluid social mobility with a new set of relationships the short story will be there to interpret the new society meantime for so long as the social structure in present day south africa persists for so long will the africanrather the south african character wrestle with a set of demons marked made in south africa in june a delegation of six quakers representing o the annual meeting of the progressive friends came to the white house lincoln told them he was relieved to learn that were not ffice seekers for his chief trouble was from that class of persons sensing their mission lincoln informed his visitors that his next most troublesome subject was slavery in the discussion that followed lincoln matched his visitors in earnestness but he did not promise them that he would issue a proclamation of freedom as they wished sometime within the space of the next three weeks however the president decided that the time had come for an edict of emancipation lincoln did not take lightly the wishes of religious groups but more important in shaping his determination was the military situation things were not going well on the war front in late june and early july richmond the confederate capital had withstood a bloody siege thus sending aglimmering the hope that the south would soon sue for peace a prolonged war now became inevitable which meant calling up additional troops and evoking a fresh source of inspiration for this latter moralebuilding component lincoln took the course that had been urged upon him for so many months by church groups abolitionists and negroesa presidential decree of freedom during the first days of july lincoln began to put together the first draft of an emancipation proclamation the writing was done in the cipher room of the military telegraph office at the desk of superintendent thomas t eckert sixtytwo days were to elapse before lincoln could issue the proclamation during this period he had to keep his intentions secret worse still he had to endure the jibes of the abolitionists and the more restrained but equally pointed criticisms of other reformist groups lincoln had to listen to the vehement antislavery views of his friend cassius clay returned from his post in russia he had to receive religious groups who urged immediate emancipation such as the large delegation of chicago clergymen who spent an hour in earnest and frank discussion at the white house on september what good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do he asked the clergymen i do not want to issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be inoperative like the popes bull against the comet i the most influential of the lincoln critics during the two months while the proclamation lay in the darkness of a desk drawer was the energetic horace greeley editor of the widely read letter dated august and printed on the editorial page of the next days tribune was a piece from mr greeleys own pen bearing an impressive title the prayer of twenty millions addressed to lincoln the editorial complained of the seeming subserviency of your policy to the slaveholding slaveryupholding interest loyal americans wrote greeley demanded that lincoln enforce the second confiscation act liberating the slaves of rebels on the face of this wide earth mr president there is not one disinterested determined intelligent champion of the union cause who does not feel that all attempts to put down the rebellion and at the same time uphold its inciting cause are preposterous and futile greeleys public letter was welcomed by lincoln it gave him a chance to do two things restate his own position and prepare the public mind for an emancipation proclamation issued upon military necessity on august in one of his most important state papers lincoln released his reply to the press his opening lines were eventoned and conciliatory if said he greeleys letter was impatient and dictatorial in tone he overlooked it in deference to a long friendship he did not mean lincoln continued to leave anyone in doubt as to the policy i seem to be pursuing as you say my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union these added lincoln in a final short paragraph were his official views and were not intended as any change in his repeatedly expressed personal wishes that all men everywhere could be free by saturday september lincoln was assured of the withdrawal of the confederate forces on the next day he went to the soldiers home and wrote out his second draft of the preliminary proclamation and then read it aloud to vicepresident hannibal hamlin with the document much as he wanted it lincoln was now ready for the historic day of its promulgationseptember on noon of that monday lincoln met with his cabinet in special session with everyone present it was evident that this was an important occasion lincoln sought to reduce the tension by reading a passage from humorist artemus ward then abandoning his light tone lincoln informed his solemnfaced and attentive associates that he had vowed he would issue an emancipation proclamation as soon as the rebels were driven out of maryland that time had now come he had brought them together explained lincoln to hear what he had written he did not solicit their advice on the wisdom of the step he had determined that for himselfbut he would listen to any comments on style or wording lincoln then read the document through making remarks wrote chase on several points as he went along this preliminary emancipation negro colonization the act of march forbidding officers to return runaways and the second confiscation act of july but the heart of the proclamation was the opening phrases of the third paragraph that on the first day of january in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtythree all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforward and forever free after he had finished lincoln waited for comments chase and montgomery blair made brief statements seward suggested two modifications to which lincoln had no objections then the cabinet was dismissed later that afternoon lincoln and seward signed the proclamationas negroes and their wellwishers read over the preliminary emancipation proclamation they could not fail to note the complete absence of any abolitionist fervor or pronegro sentiment plainly lincoln had not followed the abolitionistnegro line that the favor of the almighty was to be gained not by force of arms but by the panoply of righteousness indeed this document of september sounded like a cross between a military directive and a lawyers brief its opening sentence set its tone in it lincoln called attention to his authority as commander in chief of the army and navy and he stated that the aim of the war was the restoration of the union moreover in the edict lincoln stated that efforts at negro deportation would be continued and of course slavery was to be abolished only in those places in rebellion not in places where the stars and stripes actually flew to abolitionists the proclamation had another drawback it gave the rebellious states the opportunity of keeping their slaves if they would lay down their arms by january but nobody the abolitionists included made much of this alternative inasmuch as nobody high or low north or south believed that the people of the confederacy would listen to lincolns terms despite the proclamations limitations negroes hailed it with much joy the war wrote frederick douglass was now invested with sanctity a few celebrations were held the largest was one of new york city negroes at shiloh church on september the man who called this meeting and organized it was henry highland garnet who simply could not wait until january as he had already been waiting for nearly two decades i do pray garnet had written on september from troy new york to g a thatcher that you and i may see that great dayi mean the emancipation day o that the lord may hasten it on at the enthusiastic and crowded meeting at shiloh church garnet presided was one of the main speakers and delivered the benediction most negroes were too prudent to follow garnets example preferring instead to wait until january when the final proclamation was due for negroes while ever hopeful were also ever realistic they knew that lincolns preliminary edict was little more than the declaration of an intention they knew that there was nothing in custom or in law that could compel him to follow it up would the president issue the final proclamation this was the momentous question before the negroes during those fourteen weeks from september to january those fateful one hundred days of the countdown during this period the negro listened intently for telltale sounds from the white house but lincolns words and actions seemed to take on all the ambiguity of a delphic oracle entering into lincolns deliberation and fixing his determination about issuing an emancipation proclamation were considerations of a varied naturemilitary political and diplomatic to lincoln the first of these was preeminent military necessity required that the enemy be deprived of his slaves lincoln knew that the black population of the south was one of its greatest assets the confederacy had not actually put a gun in the hands of the colored man but tens of thousands of its slaves saw frontline service being employed as orderlies teamsters and military laborers slaves who remained on the home front supplied the skills for the factories and the brawn for working the mines and it was the labor of the plantation slave that produced the cotton the south hoped to sell in england to weaken this black arm of the confederacy had become the first order of military business a blunt fact from which lincoln could not flinch in the late summer of on september lincoln told secretary chase that the emancipation proclamation had been issued solely as a military necessity and not because it was politically expedient or morally right nonetheless political considerations had influenced the issuing of the edict himself a republican lincoln was obliged to make concessions to the point of view of his party including its radical wing as the war went on with no end in sight these radicals became more insistent than ever that the abolition of slavery become an officially avowed goal of the war the support of these radicals was important to the lincoln administration and this support could be jeopardized without an edict of emancipation the extent to which political considerations shaped the issuing of the emancipation edict becomes evident in lincolns dealings with the altoona conference governors andrews of massachusetts had called a meeting of loyal governors to be held at altoona pennsylvania during the last week of september as announced in the call the chief aim of the conference was to press for action against slavery lincoln was not asleep by a shrewd stroke he proceeded to undercut the scheduled conference he summoned governors curtin and andrew to the white house and told them of the emancipation proclamation lying in his desk awaiting a battlefield victory curtin and andrew realized that they had been outflanked they had also been won over fortunately for lincoln the victory at antietam enabled him to issue his proclamation before the altoona meeting after their conference the governors came to washington in a group and called at the white house on september they congratulated lincoln on the issuing of the proclamation and lincoln with a straightfaced solemnity matching theirs told them that their approval of the measure assured him more than anything else that he had done the right thing a third important factor in bringing about and supporting the proclamation was european particularly english opinion in england the governing and aristocratic classes were antinorth and would have been glad to extend diplomatic recognition to the confederacy but the masses and the middle class in the british isles were union sympathizers and disliked the south as slaverys strongest bastion in the western world in large measure the groundwork for this british antislavery sentiment had been laid by american negroes who for a quarter of a century had been touring england ireland and scotland many of these negroes were escaped slaves like william wells brown who in five years abroad made over a thousand addresses william and ellen craft moved british audiences to tears with the story of their dramatic escape from macon georgia with ellen disguised as a young slavemaster the procession of negroes did not abate with the war american negroes like j sella martin acted almost as if they were ministers without portfolio in furthering the union cause far from her salem massachusetts home the young eloquent and earnest sarah p remond always effective on the platform exhorted her listeners to stand firm let no diplomacy of statesmen no intimidation of slaveholders no scarcity of cotton no fear of slave insurrections prevent the people of great britain from maintaining their position as the friend of the oppressed negro the greatest drawing card among the american negroes during the autumn of was william andrew davis the escaped excoachman of confederate president jefferson davis these negroes like their counterparts before the war did much to intensify the antislavery sentiment of the british masses lincoln knew that reformist groups and workingmens associations in england would hail an edict of emancipation he was aware too that such a proclamation would be a heavy blow to the foreign policy of the confederacy striking king cotton diplomacy in a most vulnerable spot after the emancipation proclamation was issued the confederate agents stationed in european capitals were no longer able to play down the slavery issue by asserting that the north had no intention of changing the status of the black man member of parliament and reformer richard cobden who was interested in free men as well as in free trade was sure that lincolns edict turned the tide of public opinion in the british isles you know he wrote to charles sumner from londons athenaeum club on february how much alarmed i was from the first lest our government should interpose in your affairs this state of feeling existed up to the announcement of the presidents emancipation policy from that moment our old antislavery feeling began to arouse itself and it has been gathering strength ever since the final emancipation proclamation was signed on the scheduled date considering the widespread discussion of it during the preceding one hundred days the signing ceremonies were quiet and undramatic indeed almost offhand on the afternoon of january the document was ready for the presidents signature after he had spent nearly half a week on and off working it over he had held cabinet meetings on each of the last three days of the year on december reading the proclamation to the heads of departments on the next day furnishing them with copies for their criticisms and on the last morning of the year reconvening them for final revisions the afternoon of that december lincoln spent in reviewing the notes and memoranda submitted by the cabinet members and in framing his language he then began the rewriting of the entire document making sure that his penmanship was spencerian in clarity if not in slant up early the next morning and clearheaded after a new years eve without revels lincoln completed his writing and sent the finished product to the state department to be engrossed shortly before eleven oclock the document was returned to the white house lincoln was on the point of signing it when he noticed an error in the attestation as a clerk had used the phraseology common to a treaty rather than to a proclamation staying his signature the chief executive rushed off to the blue room to undergo a threehour ritual of handshaking the reception at the white house on new years day was a long established custom lincoln and his wife stood in the short receiving line to be wished a happy the first hour was reserved for officialdom diplomats high army brass navy officers congressmen and federal judges then for two hours came the general public by midafternoon the reception was over and lincoln could return to the executive office waiting for him was the properly engrossed proclamation spread out on the desk by secretary seward not more than a dozen informally gathered witnesses were present as lincoln reached for his steeltipped pen its inksplattered wooden handle rough from gnawing lincoln feared that his signature would be tremulous and uneventhree hours of hand shaking he explained to schuyler colfax that evening is not calculated to improve a mans chirography but if his arm was limp and his hand was unsteady his will was firm to himself but loud enough so that it could be heard by frederick seward the secretary of states son he remarked anyway it is going to be done carefully and slowly he traced abraham lincoln not abbreviating his first name as he so often did why lincoln freed the slaves abraham lincoln was a great american and a great president in the civil war crisis one with a vision of freedom for his nation a pioneer in political freedom one who was devoted to duty and to his ideals one who sacrificed for his achievements and gave his life in martyrdom for his cause but even in explaining the emancipation proclamation lincoln did not regard himself as a great man but rather modestly said i claim not to have controlled events but confessed plainly that events have controlled me it is in this spirit that we approach the subject of abraham lincoln in the first place while there is considerable difficulty in discovering the real lincoln it can be said that abraham lincoln was not an abolitionist and he was not a proslavery advocate there were several types of antislavery men there were radical abolitionists i such as william lloyd garrison almost in a class by himself and such men as wendell phillips and gerrit smith there were educators and ministers with antislavery views horace mann and theodore parker there were statesmen with antislavery views salmon p chase and charles francis adams there were also many hundred whose views were antislavery but who were mild in their expressions what was lincolns real attitude and opinion in early years his career in early years was similar to that of a politician who was a rough product of pioneer parents in early rural kentucky and who had married into a slaveholding family he broke openly with the abolitionists and even declined to go along with the free soil party the influence of environment had considerable value upon his career he shared with southerners some of their views concerning the negro the fact that abraham lincoln was born in kentucky taken to indiana at the age of seven years and from there to the great state of illinois had its influence on his lifes attitudes toward colored americans buttressed by the moving events of the civil war the fact that there were antislavery sentiments expressed by him is very clearly shown in one of his early speeches when he said if slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong i cannot remember when i did not think so and feel so attempts have been made to show the origins of lincolns opinions on the negro and slavery they have moved all the way from a belief that god endowed abraham lincoln with a dislike of slavery and used him as his instrument to destroy it to the belief that he was merely an instrument in the hands of events however the official biographers of abraham lincoln nicolay and hay state that these attempts seem an idle waste of labor these sentiments came with the first awakening of his mind and conscience and were aroused into active life and energy by the sight of fellow creatures in chains on an ohio steamboat and on the wharf at new orleans however it is well to note that abraham lincoln differed sharply with abolitionists in reference to slavery at one time it is reported that he appeared as a councilor for a kentucky slaveholder seeking the return of a fugitive slave his first public avowal on slavery was made as a representative in the illinois legislature in this was the period following which congress had declared that all abolition petitions should be laid on the table without discussion the proposal being for the purpose of decreasing acrimonious debate when similar resolutions were presented in the illinois legislature in abraham lincoln and daniel stone his colleague from sangamon county protested against this on march this attitude was further revealed in the lincolndouglas debates in stephen douglas was wont during these debates to accuse lincoln of endeavoring to establish what he called social equality and on one occasion he used the expression abe lincoln and other abolitionists wanted to i marry negroes lincoln answered j on september spurning the doctrine then known as social equality in his fourth debate with i douglas i am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black racesthat i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intimacy with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black faces which i believe forbids the two living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of the superior and the inferior and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race and again lincoln answered i protest against the counterfeit logic which concludes that because i do not want a black woman for a slave i must necessarily want her for a wife he criticized the dred scott decision because it decreed that a negro could not be a united states citizen and yet he said i told douglas very frankly i am not in favor of negro citizenship however it was lincolns view that the states had the power to make the negro a citizen and said he if the state of illinois had that power i should be opposed to the exercise of it lincoln later changed his halfslave and halffree declaration to the effect that all states have the right to do exactly as they please about slavery but yet he opposed the spread of slavery to the territories he also emphasized the moral evil of slavery joining fc the same with his moderation and tolerance and yet as a politician he permitted his law partner herndon to keep in touch with antislavery people lincolns opinions on slavery were maturing gradually with the passing years it would be difficult to prove that lincoln changed his ideas about slavery but it is evident that they were maturing developing and following events of war and that he was not the uncompromising and outspoken opponent of slavery the great emancipator as hero worshipers would conclude however nothing is more compelling and more plain than that one of the background motives of abraham lincolns career was his antipathy to slavery when lincoln assumed office as president his policy was again a conservative one he assured a kentucky democrat that he would administer the fugitive slave law as honestly and as fairly as mr buchanan had done to alexander stephens he wrote do the people of the south really entertain fears that a republican administration would directly or indirectly interfere with the slaves or with them about the slaves if they do i wish to assure you as once a friend and still i hope not an enemy that there is no cause for such fears the south would be in no more danger than in the days of washington in the inaugural address of he disclaimed especially no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists and any design to violate the rights of the states on the subject of slavery this statement was in accordance with the republican platform of which proclaimed the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states to control their domestic institutions it may be alleged that these were the shrewd observations of a politician used by a man who was a master politician to prevent a more decided opposition from the border states to secure to his administration the support of many doubters at the north and to express the view that he would not ally himself with the abolition wing of the republican party not long after he had been in office president lincoln was forced to deal with the practical questions of slavery the movements of union troops released slaves and made them free at first the commanders were permitted to decide the question as a local one when general fremont in had undertaken the declaration that confiscated slaves were free in missouri lincoln overruled him when general hunter in declared the slaves free held by their owners in georgia florida and south carolina lincoln vetoed the measure saying that he reserved to himself as commanderinchief of the army and navy to declare the slaves of any state or states free and when it shall become a neces sity indispensable to the maintenance of our government lincolns policy was a policy of discretion and of expediency which he declared i reserve to myself the important policy of lincoln toward slavery was based on compensated emancipation he believed that the states should emancipate the slaves the slaveholders must be paid for their property in slaves the federal government must bear the cost in bonds the states should have time even until and that the colored people should be persuaded to be colonized in a foreign land with federal aid when horace greeley through the tribune issued his prayer for twenty millions urging freedom for the slaves and that president lincoln should strike boldly at slavery lincoln replied my paramount object is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do also that and yet he said that he expressed his personal wish that all men everywhere could be free here then was the president of the united states speaking not as a man who was necessarily an advocate of negro freedom and negro equality but one who spoke as the president of the united states this is fundamental to the understanding of abraham lincolns attitude toward the negro congress was ahead of the president in emancipation policyand this fact is too often ignored the dramatic announcement of the preliminary proclamation and the emancipation proclamation which seized the popular imagination and has been kept alive by orators and writers has dimmed the emancipation acts of the congress of the united states these congressional activities were prior to lincolns action and were evidences that congress was ahead of the president and also that he ignored the action of congress and acted when he issued the proclamation as if congress had done nothing on july lincoln advised secretaries gideon welles and seward according to welles that he had about reached the conclusion that a proclamation of emancipation was absolutely essential for the salvation of the union two days later secretary chase states that he announced that he would issue such a proclamation finding that he could gather influence from northern elements for there was increase of war radicalism the presence of thousands of negroes within union lines recognizing that the international aspects of a northern antislavery policy would cause distress to the south t particularly in england and supported by general lees retreat from pennsylvania to virginia and general braggs retreat from kentucky the preliminary proclamation of emancipation as a war measure was issued on september this preliminary proclamation was welcomed with acclaim by the abolitionists and by the people of color in the united states but was received rather coldly by the nation as a whole and it was said that states would be turning away from the president in the ensuing elections the emancipation proclamation declaring slaves in the rebellious states then thenceforth and forever free was a war expedient it was a war measure which lincoln said was an act warranted by the constitution upon military necessity it was intended to affect enemy territory for it also declared that the executive government would not act to repress any efforts that negroes in slavery would make for their actual freedom and yet he urged them to abstain from all violence unless in selfdefense this proclamation was not an encouragement to violence but it meant that colored men might fight for their freedom as soldiers the picture of an emancipator breaking the chains of slavery in the united states through this proclamation is false the proclamation exempted parts of louisiana tennessee and virginia and in states under union control it proclaimed emancipation where there was no power to execute it lincoln himself admitted that measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful by be coming indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation however the proclamation was a symbol of the fact that the war was not only to save the union but also to free the slaves for in the freedom of the slave was also the saving of the union he also admitted in a letter to secretary chase september that the proclamation had no legal justification except as a war measure and that he regarded it as expedient and right we do well to commemorate the years of the civil war and the year of emancipation and and we do well to honor one hero who stands out predominantlyabraham lincoln however we should not overlook frederick douglass and the thousands of negroes who were abolitionists and emancipators in their fight against slavery and the subordination of man to man the negroes who gave their best in the cause of freedom and emancipated themselves and the hundreds of thousands of white citizens who believed in freedom and all those of both groups who continue to believe in it the cause of emancipation is one therefore in which millions should join throughout the land for just as slavery had enslaved the black man it had also enslaved the white man for both were in bondage and are still to the concepts of color we now await freedom from color domination freedom from prejudice freedom from false concepts as they relate to population groups and the realization of the freedom of which lincoln was an exponent and for which he became a martyr the great emancipator then and now must have many lesser ones who motivate events and give to him the chosen opportunity the query why would h rrp a big ten couple send i their son to a negro allege has been tossed at me so often since my son matriculated at fisk that it occurred to me that perhaps the true reasons might bear reanalyzing i have abs degree from state university of iowa and an ma degree from the university of michigan while my wife holds a bs degree from kansas state and an ma degree from the university of michigan first maybe i should point out the relationship that exists between my son and me for years we have been fishing buddies he hooks the big ones and ole dad handles the net for him it is my intent here to convey the idea that butch and i are about as close as possible for a fatherson team plans for his future have been sifted and resifted between us with him making the final decisions his high school career was studded with such honors as class president junior achievement club president boys state gubernatorial candidate and national honor society these honors are cited merely to point out the fact that the boy ran up against a minimum number of those situations normally confronting a youngster in a student body in which he was a member of a very small five per cent minority may i insert at this point that not all of his frustrating experiences were brought about by members of the majority white group however minimal as those situations were they occurred frequently enough to convince both my son and me that his educational and social experiences as a minority member even in a very liberal high school left much to be desired in a youngster destined to be a minority member for life with this thought in mind ole dad began a little retrospection my high school days under strikingly similar circumstances my undergraduate days at iowa and my graduate days at michigan were brought into focus and analyzed what i saw under my retrospective microscope did not exactly please my experience over the past years as a teacher in a system where the prime requisite for promotion is to be a member of the majority group also undoubtedly had an effect upon my thoughts this is all incidental thinking however i feel these background thoughts are necessary if one is to understand the final outcome my sons matriculation at fisk we started our search for a college when butch entered his freshman year in high school upon request we received catalogs from a half dozen of the better small liberal arts colleges liberal arts because my wife and i advised butch to steer clear of the large university campus for undergraduate work as we feel the campus of the small liberal arts college is where the real educative process takes place as we browsed these catalogs the name of fisk as an exchange school was frequently mentioned thus the initial stimulus in our thinking of fisk was planted we then became more aware of the frequency with which fisk was mentioned in the daily press as the alma mater of recently appointed local state and even federal officials so we sent for and received a fisk catalog a thorough examination readily pointed out the excellent reasons fisk appeared in the other catalogs as an exchange school we became enthused and began to five years ago my work took me to swaziland where i had a bad motor accident i was nursed by harriet dhlamini a niece of sobuza ii paramount chief of swaziland f i l from the age of three harriet had spent most of her life in durban training there as a nurse she had only recently returned to swaziland when i met her she was she is goodlooking vivacious with a quick sense of humour softhearted and sympathetic to those she was nursing and yet herself strong and selfconfident i had never before met anyone like her regardless of colour and at i fell in love with her and she with me i determined somehow to make her my wife it was going to be one of the most difficult things to achieve my work was in publishing in south africa but how could i return there and continue my association with harriet apartheid has been responsible for two acts which affected us under the immorality act any association of any kind between opposite sexes where one party is white and the other is coloured is construed as an attempt to have carnal intercourse the act makes this a criminal offense punishable by up to seven years imprisonment and for a man under to whipping in addition the maximum being eight lashes the mixed marriages act not only prohibits mixed marriages but also stipulates that those contracted elsewhere are not recognized in south africa if we were to live in south africa marriage was therefore out of the question i suggested to harriet that she accompany me to durban we would have to wait to marry until we could see our way clear to leaving south africa for good in the meantime she would be my housekeeperour only chance of being together because she knew that i was genuinely in love with her she agreed in the hope that one day our difficulties would be resolved we took a flat in durban each night harriet had to leave me and sleep in the location slum at cato manor to comply with the apar theid laws cato manor about halfanhours ride in an overcrowded african bus is the filthy hideout of every kind of durban african from respectable working people to thieves dope peddlers prostitutes and murderers on a sunday in february we took a run in the car down the natal south coast harriet of course sitting in the back and wearing an overall like a real servant at scottburgh some miles south of durban we had trouble with the car and as it was sunday and no mechanics were on duty at the garages i had to try to put it right myself harriet helped me by passing tools and so on soon we had onlookerstwo boer youths who spoke very pleasantly to me one went away for five minutes or so and returned almost immediately they were joined by a third youth also a boer he announced that he was a policeman and so were the other two and that we were under arrest for attempting to contravene the immorality act by enticing each other to have carnal intercourse we were marched off to the police station where they kept us waiting for three hours whilst the charge against us was being prepared eventually we were called into a sergeant detective who said that sworn statements had been given by members of the public and that we were being formally charged there was no question of bail but they agreed that i could telephone a lawyer however every time the trunk call came through they cut me off on the switchboard after the third attempt i was told that they couldnt be fed about all night and that we were to be locked up the police said that there were no cells for europeans at scottburgh and that i would be taken to umzinto nine miles away harriet was locked up where she was in a crowded cell where she was made to sleep on the bare cement with one ragged blanket that stank of urine and excrement the whole place was crawling with fleas bugs and lice i was put into a scrupulously clean cell with new blankets the next day we were brought before the magistrate at umzinto court and remanded in custody for two weeks harriet was locked up in umzinto goals which was so overcrowded that the women had to sleep on top of one another i was put into a small cell usually used for africans who had been sentenced to solitary confinement it was only just big enough to lie down in they gave me a new sisal mat to lie on and two new blankets i was allowed out only to wash and shave i was not permitted to read or to smoke no one spoke to me when we came before the court again we were charged with attempting to commit an immoral act the police had three fake witnessesan unemployed african and two unemployed indians who i found out later had been bribed with s each before the court adjourned for the day i informed the court that i should require the petrol boy at the garage to be called as a defense witness next morning the prosecutor handed me a packet of cigarettes i knew then that he had thrown in the towel at the end of the case for the state i asked for our discharge and the magistrate granted it back at the garage the petrol boy described how he had been beaten by the police and threatened with the loss of his job in an effort to get him to tell lies after the publicity of the trial it was impossible to return to the flat so using a different name we took a acre farm midway between durban and pietermaritzburg i could continue with my work while harriet looked after the farm we were happy the farm was fairly isolated but a regular visitor was the sergeant of the local police one day he told harriet that she should not share one bedroom with me he said that police both european and african frequently came around in the night and had reported to him we had been there about three months when we paid off one of the african farm laborers who was idling he went to the police to report that harriet and i were living as man and wife the sergeant came again and said he was sorry but the complaint appeared officially in the occurrence book and he would have to make a report to his superiors in pietermaritzburg he advised us to leave the farm within a week before we found ourselves in serious trouble after a couple of temporary moves we bought a house at escombe some miles from durban this was a lovely little house built on the top of a hill my bedroom was at the front and under it with no access from inside the house was a large cellar which was harriets bedroom the large garden was surrounded by a high stone wall except along the nextdoor garden boundary where there was a wire dividing fence with our past experience to guide us we bought two great danes one of which was most vicious we frequently found pieces of uniform and civilian clothes in the morning tom from african and sometimes european policemen and detectives the africans told harriet they hated trying to spy but were under orders eventually the police began to watch from the nextdoor garden causing the dogs to bark most of the night after a yearour longest time in one placeour nerves could stand it no more and we decided to live in basutoland a british protectorate my idea was that i would work in south africa all week and come home to harriet at the week end i transferred my business activities to bloemfontein in the orange free state travelling over miles every weekend but the roads were shocking the house primitive and the cost too high we stuck it out for four months and then moved to swaziland another british protectorate where we rented a small farm while i travelled each week to south africa after three months we again realized we could not afford it there was no other course but to do what we hated doingmove back to south africa this time we took a flat in barberton in the eastern transvaal it had a servants room outside to which harriet had to go soon after dinner usually at about pm the old troubles again beset us detectives were round the house all night one night harriet crept out on three african detectives and threw a bucket of hot water over them we had a bit of quiet for a week or two after that by the end of may we thought johannesburg might be a better bet i went to live with my sister in the hope that nobody would suspect that harriet was anything other than a real servant but one night after we had been there a few veeks harriet and i were awakened by the bedclothes being roughly pulled off us it was the police we were taken to the district surgeon who tried to find evidence of sexual intercoursean examination i shall never forget after we had been twice before the court we were granted bail on september we decided to push off to rhodesia by train through bechuanaland we stopped at francistown and got a travelling pass for harriet since she had no passport we caught the night train which was boarded by federal rhodesian immigration officials just before plumtree the border post as we were travelling together they quickly realized the position and demanded a deposit of in cash from each of us as a condition of entry we did not have that sum so returned on the next train some miles back to tsessebe but the federal rhodesian immigration official had been in touch with francistown and told them that as we were obviously man and wife we were not wanted in rhodesia the francistown immigration officials came out in a truck took us to francistown and told us we were not wanted in bechuanaland either we were ordered on to the next train to return miles to south africa african police travelled with us there had also been a telephone call to the border post so that police were waiting back in johannesburg we were held in custody until trial we did not go on defense since we did not want our history to come out under crossexamination on october last year we were sentenced to six months imprisonment each this meant release on february allowing for remission my main concern in prison was that as i was a united kingdom subject i might be deported on completion of sentence and have no chance of seeing harriet again to defeat this possibility i wrote to the south african immigration authorities a real bulldust letter stressing how i supported apartheid and so on as february drew near i realized there was only one solutionto take harriet to england as quickly as possible we cleared up what we could in a week and travelled separately to lobatsi in bechuanaland we were granted a special license and married by the district commissioner on march the first mixed couple to be married in the bechuanaland protectorate after a couple of weeks together we went separately to cape town and stayed in different hotelsharriet in a coloured one and i in a white harriet got a passport from the british embassy after being registered as a citizen of the uk we caught the ship on which i am writing this with minutes to spare now we have little left with which to make a new start in england except our love and our freedom to us the most valuable things in the world from the time she could toddle a little colored girl bom in went up and down among the rows on a south carolina cotton plantation picking cotton she wore a coarse cotton dress her feet were bare little did she dream that nearly a hundred years later beautiful ladies in rich silken ball gowns would attend a gala ball in washington in honor of her memory but just that happened the ball held in was called the international debutante cotillion it was a colorful affair with women from many lands making a brilliant showing in their native costumes it was sponsored by the members of the national council of negro women an organization founded when she became a woman by the little girl from the cotton patch the money raised at the ball was to be used by the council to help in erecting a monument to its founder mary mcleod bethune the monument the first one in the nations capital to honor an american negro was authorized by the congress and by the president in sponsoring it in the senate senator kenneth b keating of new york said mary bethune has earned her monument it is significant that the memorial honoring mrs bethune will also commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the signing of the emancipation proclamation thanks to that proclamation mary mcleod was bom a free child although her parents sam and patsy had been slaves they had enjoyed twelve years of freedom when mary was bom however being bom free did not necessarily mean that a poor little negro girl could do whatever she wanted to while she was very young mary learned that the hard and painful way two arrogant little white girls taunted her with not being able to read as they could that hurt there was nothing she wanted so much to do as to be able to read but there was slim chance for a little negro girl to learn reading in mayesville south carolina in fact there was no school within many miles and if there had been sam and patsy could hardly have spared even one child from work in the cotton fields least of all could they have let mary go she was their prize picker but as she made her way up and down the rows mary kept hoping hoping hoping that some way some day she could manage to go to school she prayed that she might unexpectedly her prayers were answeredanswered by an unknown presbyterian mission board in the north miss wilson a teacher sent to the south by them managed to persuade sam and patsy to send one of their seventeen children to the little school she had been commissioned to start in mayesville after thinking it over marys parents decided that she should be the one to go shes homely but shes smart yes she is smart sam said so the elevenyearold little girl swishing her bright gingham dress skipped five miles to school each morning and trudged the distance home at night never had she been so happy the day of her graduation came all too soon when she was fifteen after that no further education was in sight for her the cotton fields seemed to stretch endlessly through life for mary mcleod then just as unexpectedly as her first chance for going to school had come to her a second opportunity came again miss wilson brought it a faraway northern seamstress whose father had instilled into her mind the realization of the need for negro education in the south had offered a scholarship to some promising negro girl at scotia seminary in concord north carolina miss wilson herself a graduate of scotia was to select the girl she chose mary even her train fare was provided she started off alone on her first train trip to scotia seminary two hundred miles away in she finished her studies there with credit to miss wilson to her parents and to the unknown seamstress during marys years at the school she developed a great interest in africa and the missionary work done there and still needed there she decided she wanted to go to darkest africa as a missionary after she left scotia she talked this idea over with the principal who helped her get a scholarship at moody institute in chicago he felt that in that school she would get the best possible training for her desired lifework mary made an excellent record in her two years at moody after which she went to new york to apply to the presbyterian board of foreign missions for an assignment in africa from that board she received her first big disappointment they said no she was too young fortunately youth has ideals and determination marys ideal was education for all colored young people her determination was to use her strength her talents and her life to help them get it if she couldnt help negroes in africa she would do her utmost in america from that determination she never wavered as long as she lived years later she wrote in her spiritual biography i give my best at all times and accept without complaint the results i expect the best she went home after her disappointment about africa and did her best in the cotton fields sometimes she even outpicked her father gathering in pounds a day her neighbors were glad to have mary back at home she worked among themespecially among the children she had an exceptionally fine contralto voice well trained at scotia and on sundays she invited everybody to come and sing with her at her fathers cabin door all this time however her dearest hope was for a teaching position finally in answer to her application the board of missions assigned her to a school in augusta georgia it was called haines normal institute the school was in a poor district of the city called for some unexplained reason the terry the streets were swarming with the juvenile delinquents of that day who made walking there a hazard here mary saw a chance to do her best to expect the best from these hoodlums seemed like looking for a miracle but she tried she persuaded the principal of the school to let her invite the young street arabs to come to the school on sunday afternoons walking up and down the dangerous streets of the terry she told each child he would be welcome the next sunday one imagines that the first little rascals who came did so with tongues in cheeks it must have looked to them like a heavensent opening for more and different mischief to their surprise they liked what they were offeredstories singing and no sermons the first comers spread the word that it was fun to sing along with mary and more and more children came as the weeks went by before long the terry became a better and a safer place no doubt mary learned a useful lesson herethat a singing child is a happy child and a betterbehaved child at any rate singing was always part of her program in all her later association with children and young people by mary had married albertus bethune like herself a teacher while they lived in savannah marys only child a son was born while the child was a little boy the bethunes moved to palatka florida education for negroes in florida as elsewhere in the south was in a sad state mrs bethune was consumed by a desire to do something about it it made her boil to see grown men and women unable to read she remembered what that was like herself and she knew how much her own mother patsy wished she had learned to read although patsy was descended from tribal rulers in africa and carried herself like an aristocrat she could not read mary could not rest until she had made a supreme effort to give colored children the chances she felt they should have she learned that daytona florida to which many negro families had come to work on flaglers new railroad lacked schools would that be a place to open her own school she wondered she talked it over with her husband who was skeptical about her ability to help the situation in daytona youve only got a dollar and a half he pointed out to her that will hardly start a school that and faith will answered mary albertus probably said something like well itll be your baby and went about his own teaching in palatka mary however would not be dissuaded from her purpose she set his house in palatka in order took little albert by the hand and accepted a ride to daytona concerning marys daytona venture mrs arabella denniston in later years mrs bethunes private secretary has said i have never met a person who possessed more faith in god and in humanity eventually with a prayer and a promise of future payment to the landlord mary opened her school in a rickety little shack on the edge of a snakeinfested dump she stretched her dollar and a half beyond belief and on opening day welcomed her entire student body five little girls in some way she managed to pay her first months rent eleven dollars soon she had a regular income from an unusual source sweet potato pies she excelled in making that wholesome delicacy which sold like the proverbial hotcakes laborers families loved them and wealthy winter visitors found them a pleasant change from hotel fare as she had proved in the terry mary bethune was an expert at making children sing and sing well as her school grew she trained a chorus which sang at daytonas resort hotels they were at one time taken in a boat to the home of john d rockefeller at nearby ormond beach not only were they paid for their concerts but wealthy men and women down from the north for the winter sent generous gifts to the school it was in that marys school opened now nearly sixty years later the tiny school has grown to be a large accredited fouryear college like other colleges it confers not only earned degrees but honorary degrees at one commencement after she had retired as president mary was privileged to confer an honorary degree on a friend and helper of early days he was a grayhaired negro minister from virginia in her citation she reminded him of how they had gone together to the city dump as scavengers they had picked out bits of broken furniture and discarded packing boxes remember she said how we patched these up glued them together and made desks and chairs for the little girls and for me the old gentleman smiled and nodded he remembered throughout her years as president of bethunecookman college no less than eight other colleges conferred honorary degrees on mary she treasured particularly the one given to her in by rollins college in winter park florida it was the first honorary degree ever conferred on a person of her race by a white college in the south in presenting her to president hamilton holt the public orator spoke of her triumphant struggle against almost insuperable odds president holt in his citation said to her you have in your own person again demonstrated that from the humblest beginnings and through most adverse circumstances it is still possible for one who has the will the intelligence the courage and the neverfailing faith in god and in your fellow man to rise from the humblest cabin in the land to a place of honor and influence among the worlds eminent as she walked down the aisle of the beautiful chapel of rollins college wearing her cap and gown and with the rollins doctors hood of blue and gold over her shoulders perhaps she felt as dressed up as did the gayly clad women at the later cotillion in her honor how any little fivefoot woman accomplished all she did for her college and her country is hard to understand her secretary mrs denniston has written each days work began with a few moments of meditation and prayer with her entire staff for recreation on quiet evenings we would enjoy a few games of checkers she usually came out best there perhaps was part of the secret of her accomplishment days begun peacefully with prayer and ended in quiet relaxation possibly too the fact that she usually came out best buoyed her spirits her students loved her although she had a wholesomely restraining influence on them possibly she remembered when she had had to be threatened with demerits while she was a toolively girl at scotia the students seemed to feel about her as james barrie did about his mother you never knew where she was unless you took hold of her if mary appeared on the campus in a white dress beware she was wearing her inspection uniform any students who had left their rooms in disorder might well quake dusty corners and carelessly made beds never escaped her attention as she made her rounds in mary came to an agreement with the methodist church whereby her girls school and their boys school in jacksonville were amalgamated under the name of bethunecookman college the church assumed all financial responsibility mary as president kept control of the courses of study in the nineteen thirties the nation suffered a crippling depression banks closed and unemployment was widespread it was an especially hard time for negroes so many of them were out of work mary felt that she must help her best was needed by her country as she went up and down and to and fro in the land urging help for her people an inspired idea came to her she thought she would be more convincing if she could say she was speaking as the voice of all negro women not just as mary bethune following out this conviction she organized a group which was named the national council of negro women soon it was strong quite a voice mary was seeking nothing that she was not ready to give herself let her secretary illustrate that she wrote she had a way of talking with people and reestablishing their confidence in themselves a young womanhungry jobless almost at her wits endcame in to see her one day she had no appointment and when she came mrs bethune was in conference she waited more than two hours she went into the room in tears but came out smiling she still had no money no job and was hungry but she knew mrs bethune would help her in a couple of days she was at work she kept in touch with mrs bethune and mrs bethune urged her not to give up her desire for higher education she worked went to school at night finally went into the womens army corps after discharge she completed her law course at howard and today is one of the most able lawyers in washington as the depression became worse president roosevelt created an organization to help young people it was called the national youth administration nya he asked mary to be on the board and assigned her to work among negro youth mary worked very hard but by the end of a year she felt that not enough had been accomplished as she sat down to discuss it with the president her feelings overcame her discretion and she shook her fist under his nose mr president she ordered as though she were talking to the youngest member of her faculty youve got to do better than that for my people she recoiled in horror what am i doing she gasped mr roosevelt only laughed he thought too highly of her to be offended in fact he once said to her you never ask anything for yourself always for others as her responsibilities in the nya increased so did her efforts at last she was so tired and so sick that she was hospitalized then came pearl harbor and world war ii mary sprang into action as though she singlehanded had to win it she was made assistant director of the womens army corps wac her work was naturally among the colored girls she fought for their privileges she wrote regularly to her girls overseas she comforted them she loved them as she was carrying on in texas word came to her of the death of president roosevelt she felt as though life had gone out of her too but she couldnt mourn very long within two weeks she was in san francisco witnessing the birth of the united nations soon after that she came back to the home she loved so dearly on the campus of her college she was over seventy years old she was tired and often sick when she walked among her students she leaned upon a goldheaded cane which had belonged to her friend president roosevelt it was a gift from his wife in when she was years old she was jubiliant over the supreme court decision on antisegregation old and tired though she was she led her students on the campus in grateful thanksgiving yes she was happy but she was also experienced and wise concerning the slowness of change she warned that changes could not bexpected overnight there was still much persuasive work to be done almost exactly a year after that happy day mary bethune died she is buried on her campus behind her little white home mrs denniston her devoted secretary has told the story of her final resting place in these words a former student of bethunecookman asked her for a loan of to complete his tuition i objectedlooking over the long list of borrowers who never paid back she thought about it for a couple of hours called me and asked how much money do we have in the bank do we have enough to send my boy i assured her we did the money was sent the boy completed his course paid back every cent one of the few who did and is now a successful mortician at her death he contributed a bronze metal vault for the preservation of her body another lesson for me in faith will parets ghost ruin griffiths career what does the future q nst q hold for emile grif vv fith can the brilliant young champion go on to take his place among the great welterweights of boxing or will the sickening memory of the night he sent benny kid paret to his grave haunt him for the rest of his career and detract from his remarkable skills gil clancy his manager and the man who is closer to him than anybody else admits even he doesnt know nobody can predict what effect a tragedy like that will have on a boxer clancy said we all know that he is one of the most talented men in boxing today and that he is a dedicated fighter who will always enter the ring in excellent physical condition but wondered clancy it is a question whether he will ever be able to function at per cent efficiency again we wont have the answer until we see him in the ring against strong competition griffith who savagely demolished paret at of the th round of their march title bout has overcome the first hurdle in his inner struggle to continue in his cruel trade when paret died emile thought seriously of quitting the ring clancy said he had a terrible guilt complex it was unreasonable inasmuch as everybody knew emile never intended to hurt paret seriously but it was there nevertheless he was very distraught and he even indicated to some newspapermen that he might quit in his moments of agonizing doubt griffith holed up in a new york state resort for two weeks of solitude and then returned to his native virgin islands to think it over finally he made up his mind two things did it for him clancy revealed he recognized his responsibility to his family and he responded to hundreds of letters of encouragement griffith is one of eight children his ring earnings have been supporting them and his mother he realized said clancy that he couldnt let them down as for the letters they came from priests rabbis ministers doctors lawyers and just plain fans and they all urged him to continue told him not to blame himself and reminded him to think first of his family most important to emile were the letters sent by the men of religion i think they were decisive in making up his mind clancy wants griffith to be a fighting champion but he has yet to decide on an immediate course of action there are two schools of thought some say when you fall off a horse get right back on another and others say go slow i dont know which is right for emile im going to watch him very closely for the next few months and then ill make up my mind clancy a lean sharpfeatured man who has treated griffith like his own son shook his head and said softly but the big question will come when emile climbs through the ropes again will he always see paret standing there and will the vision cause him to pull back on his punches will it rob him of his knockout instinct and paralyze his reflexes i dont know nobody in the world can answer that question except emile himself if its any consolation for griffith boxing history suggests that his career will not be ruined the rec ords show that most of the ring killers were able to shake off the effects of their horrible experience go back to dec the night jimmy barry knocked out walter croot in the th round of their bantamweight bout croot died shortly after the beating but barry was back fighting the following march he fought two more years before retiring as undefeated bantamweight champ of the world former heavyweight champion max baer survived the same ordeal max hammered frankie campbell into submission in five rounds on aug and campbell died a few days later max was back in the ring the following january and fought more times that year he went on to win the heavyweight title and didnt hang up his gloves until when the gigantic primo carnera knocked out ernie schaaf in madison square garden on feb there was serious doubt whether he was really responsible schaaf had been previously mauled by baer but it was the pound italian who had to live with the tragedy big primo however won the heavyweight crown in his very next bout by kayoing jack sharkey in six rounds and he continued fighting for four more years schaaf was carried out in the th round after a spiritless bout that had the fans yelling for action as a matter of fact when camera unleashed the left jab that put ernie away the spectators cried fake fake but for ernie it was the blow that capped the savage beatings he had received not only from baer but also from tubby tony galento and paolino uzcudum in the previous eight months jimmy doyle died in after absorbing a terrific beating from sugar ray robinson even then the question was raised whether robinsons career would suffer but sugar ray was back in the ring two months later he scored knockouts in his next five bouts and has fought no fewer than bouts since the tragedy doyle hit the canvas in the eighth round of his june boutbut he had been washed up long before he met the sugar percy bassett returned to the ring less than a month after his bout with sonny boy west ended in a tragedy and scored five kayoes in his next eight bouts sonny boy was certainly in no condition to fight after the three beatings he had received at the hands of ike williams ko sammy angott and george dunn georgie small snapped back after laveme roach died at his hands on feb he continued fighting although he never rose to championship class roach should never have been allowed in the ring after his murderous ko by rockfisted marcel cerdan and bennie gordon whose fists killed tommy pacheco in a preliminary bout on june continued to campaign until recently so for what its worth history says that griffith will shake off the effects of the tragedy and go on to a magnificent career that will place him alongside ring idols of the past nobody can bring back benny kid paret but nobody wants to see the life of emile griffith ruined too one tragedy is enough no nat hentoff definitions in jazz are chronically imprecise and perhaps the most fluid term of all has been the term jazz singer through the years vehement claims have been made for peggy lee chris connor frank sinatra rosemary clooney and even eileen farrell as candidates for membership in the club moreover judy garland considers herself fully capable of singing jazz and if asked sophie tucker would very likely respond that she is not only hot but swinging the case of ella fitzgerald is particularly enigmatic if her relationship to jazz singing can be clarified it may be possible to come closer to constructing a measuring rod for borderline cases like sinatra and peggy lee we may even begin to arrive at a definition of a jazz singer that will not crumble at its first collision with the next new set of qualifications as proclaimed in a record companys publicity release by my criteria ella fitzgerald is an aboveaverage pop vocalist but a minor jazz singer an explanation of my scale of values requires a check list of the essential qualities of jazz singing it is possible for many vocalists to have one or more of these in varying degrees on this basis of partial qualifications i would call frank sinatra and peggy lee for example jazzinfluenced but a complete fullstrength jazz singer like billie holiday louis armstrong or jack teagarden must have them all swinging and phrasing a flowing pulsation which can vary from the powerful and deeply personal thrust of louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie to the surfaceskimming of maynard ferguson and ahmad jamal is basic to any jazz performance ella swings smoothly and is an expert at play ing with rhythm while keeping the meter accurate but while her facility with the beat often approaches virtuosity she seldom applies it with any great relevance to particular songs as billie holiday did in this respect ella resembles a fleet instrumentalist whose timing never stumbles but who appears unconcerned with the meaning of a songs lyrics this tendency to ignore the original meaning of a song is understandable among jazz instrumentalists because they often use only the harmonic skeleton of a piece to create a new structure and mood of their own a singer however must deal with words and if the way she shapes her phrasing is at variance with the story she tells she has broken a key rule of jazz singing tell a story and tell it from the heart for example when ella sings love for sale she cannot be faulted musically but she communicates little of the aching weariness that is in the song similarly her phrasing of the more urbane cole porter and lorenz hart lyrics indicates an inadequate comprehension of the nuances involved ella in short always swings but she too frequently swings in an emotional and intellectual vacuum she neither remains faithful to the original nor creates a new story just as improvisation alone is not enough to characterize a performance as being jazz pointless swinging is not a certain guarantee of an illuminating jazz interpretation instrumental singing it has be come a commonplace to insist that a jazz singer should approximate the work of an instrumentalist in phrasing and even timbre this requirement is often oversimplified ella does indeed approach a song as if she were using her voice as a horn dom cerulli has accurately noted on up tunes particularly the scat songs she improvises in a steady flow much as a tenor would she jumps octaves and adds little breathy afterthoughts to phrases much as a tenor and she builds vocal riffs exactly the way a tenor would but a singer after all is not simply an instrument being able to imitate the habits of a tenor saxophone is not enough to ensure striking jazz vocalizing there are many timesespecially in wordless scat singingwhen she sounds like an extraordinarily fluent but dehumanized horn the human being with flesh and bones is absent technically these acrobatics are brilliantly sustained but they have less to do with selfexpression than with mechanics billie holiday never approached ellas instrumentlike facility but there was not the slightest doubt about the complex nature and uniqueness of a human personality when billie sang a similar contrast is that between the wry poignant individuality of everything pee wee russell plays and the more fluent but basically characterless clarinet of buddy defranco accordingly defranco is relatively a minor player while the durable russell has made and continues to make a singular and compelling contribution to jazz music timbre the timbre of ellas voice is naturally rather thin and lacking in intensity it is difficult for her to produce as wide and subtle a range of colors as sarah vaughan or anita oday still mildred bailey had an even smaller spectrum to work with yet through the intimacy of her phrasing and the quality of her improvisations she personalized everything she sang like the early blues shouters like the later more sophisticated jazz vocalists holiday lee wiley oday like carmen mcrae and ray charles today mildred bailey brought to her singing a strong sense of life of adult experience had her voice been richer she might have been even more effective but there was no question that mildred bailey communicated basic emotions hopes and frustrations by contrast ella too often sounds like a child and although much popular music is based on the fantasies of actual or arrested adolescents the essence of jazz has certainly never been for children what is jazz the veteran bassist milt hinton once asked rhetorically what makes a great jazzman is experience unless youve had experience and lived what could you have to say a person has to have lived to play great jazz charlie parker put it even more concisely if you dont live it it wont come out of your horn imagine if you will ella fitz gerald singing god bless the child or good morning heartache and then compare billie holidays approach to the same songs the difference is rather like that between paintings by norman rockwell and ben shahn at one end of the nonclassical vocal scale are the shallow mechanical teenage favoritespaul anka chubby checker ricky nelson at the other are ray charles carmen mcrae jack teagarden who are aware in chaucers words that the lyfe is short the craft so long to leme the assay so hard so sharp the conquering in between are accomplished stylists like frank sinatra and peggy lee who use jazz techniques for greater expressivity but who usually stop short of going down to the bedrock of their feelings it is to this camp that ella fitzgerald bem longs a major jazz singer must swing improvise imaginatively and phrase instrumentally but a major jazz singer must also make each song reflect what he has lived and experienced musicianship however skillful is not enough and ella technically brilliant as she is is not emotionally open enough in her singing to merit a place in the first rank of jazz singers after all these years do we know yet just who ella fitzgerald is and if she has indeed revealed all there is to tell there is not enough there for the best of jazz yes leonard feather very well ella fitzgerald is not really a jazz singer segovia is not really a guitarist carl sandburg is not really a poet barry goldwater is not really a republican let us first state our terms eligibility as a jazz singer involves four basic factors musical context musical content timbre and innate rhythmic feeling nurtured by jazz associationthe impact of context is often stronger on the listener than on the artist a singer who would otherwise be ignored or passed off as belonging to the world of pop music may be accepted in some jazz circles through chance association helen ward helen forrest dick haymes and many others who happened to sing with jazz orchestras during the swing era or through their love for jazz and bookings before jazz audiences billy eckstine nina simone on the other hand singers like roberta sherwood and kay starr because they move in the las vegasmiami copacabana orbit peopled by unhip bands and audiences are ignored by most jazz fans and critics although they qualify as jazz singers by every test except that of context ella of course moves with grace and consummate ease from jazz to nonjazz settings at home in a jazz concert with oscar peterson or against a plush background flanked by strings at the hollywood bowl jazz content too involves psychological overtones if the material dealt with has a builtin jazz identificationan ellington standard say or a bop instrumentalthe singer gains an advantage with the critic who subconsciously thinks in terms of jazz vs nonjazz but nowadays ella leans as heavily on broadway and hollywood as on basin street and birdland for her repertoire the matter of vocal timbre in the definition of jazz singing has generally been associated with the jagged throaty quality found in the singing of louis armstrong and dizzy gillespie billie holiday and anita oday but if the presence or absence of this quality were in itself defining louis prima and frances faye would deserve entry to the jazz elite ahead of the softervoiced ella most important of all is a natural rhythmic sense for a singer may have such an overwhelming feeling for the jazz beat that the other factors become unimportant ella a professional singer almost from childhood grew up completely in the jazz tradition singing from the age of sixteen with the unique chick webb band leading it herself for two years after his death and later touring for many years with norman granzs alljazz concert group under such conditions even kirsten flagstad would probably have wound up swinging that ella does not spill her guts before her audience and that she lacks a guttural tone no more militates against her competence as a jazz singer than her failure to acquire a police record psychiatrists couches and stateowned institutions are not mandatory training grounds for a jazz musician mildred bailey jimmy rushing jack teagarden and many others can be cited whose lives were never scarred by traumatic experiences such as billie holiday endured whatever bearing this lack may have on the character of their singing it has none on their emotional honesty and intensity or on their ability to communicate by means of a natural jazz beat seven tracks of ellas lullabies of birdland on decca and eleven tracks of ella sings the duke ellington song book on verve consist partly or wholly of scat or bop singingthat wordless brand of vocal adlibbing entirely indigenous to jazz because of her mastery of this art jazzmen have compared her with legendary instrumentalists as cannonball adderley observed no girl living can sound more like a jazz soloist than ella but even in the more conventional songs with lyrics ella uses every delicately oblique device of syncopation of shading and phrasing that marks the work of a nonpareil jazz singer there is no direct relationship between jazz singing and personal maturity or depth of emotional experience a performer who has lived in shallow spiritual waters may it is true become a shallow jazz singer but a jazz singer nonetheless another performer may endure psychic agonies and grow up to be a judy garland but this does not give the garlandtype singer a passport to birdland i have observed however in the course of listening to hundreds of singers during the past twentyfive years that it is possible for a nonjazz singer to become a jazz singer certainly peggy lees roots were not in jazz and her early records had very little to do with the idiom yet during the past decade she has matured in emotion delivery phrasing has constantly surrounded herself with a rhythm section of firstclass jazz musicians and today ranks as one of the finest living jazz singers as quincy jones lou levy and dozens of other jazzmen who have worked with her will testify but the reverse of this process never takes place it is impossible for a jazz singer ever to become a nonjazz singer the qualities that were ingrained in ella during the years with webb will remain with her always in these times of planned nonconformity i suppose i should be ashamed to admit that my view of ella is shared by the vast majority of her fellowartists in fact she is held in esteem to a degree without parallel in jazz history it would be tedious and of little purpose even to begin a list of the jazz musicians who respect ella as a jazz artist but in a poll i once took among a hundred jazz players and singers she received sixtysix votes as the greatest female jazz singer of all time followed by billie holiday with twentythree and sarah vaughan with twentyone votes incidentally a comparison between ella and billie holiday serves no more constructive purpose than asking a winetaster to compare champagne and vodka to my mind no greater jazz singer than billie holiday has ever lived there was in her work a bitter beauty that is not to be compared with anything contributed by any other jazz singer but ella fitzgerald is peerless in jazz on another level she has virtues that are not to be sought and certainly not to be found in billie or anyone else hers is a different vitality a different not a lesser range of emotions emotions that reach most listeners as completely as billies emotions reached hers to suggest that comparative measures must be used in evaluating the contribution of either artist is to suggest that only one means may be used to reach an artistically perfect end in conclusion it may be apt to summon as evidence one of the most illuminating attempts to separate the jazz from the nonjazz singers undertaken some years ago by a jazz expert who voted in the down beat international critics poll i dig sinatra but i dont consider him a jazz singer stated the critic and for this reason stood sinatra in the comer and refused to vote for him but the same critic in the same poll voted for ella fitzgerald and billie holiday as the worlds greatest female jazz singers in the light of the present discussion this has a special interest for the name of the voter in question was nat hentoff free transportation out of the south to ne r groes who are unhappy here recenty was fferej hy the white citizens councils of the southland negroes professing unhappiness were given a oneway ticket out five dollars expense money and the telephone numbers of their friends in the norththe naacp the urban league and the welfare department within two days after the project was underway the council reportedly had enriched chicago with unhappy negroes this reminded me of a question i sometimes am asked by whites is it true that negroes are happy the inquirer approaches usually with a face of friendly naive curiosity once however in a seminar on consumer behavior at the university of chicago a white fellow of wealthy texas parentage bitterly declared that although negroes are chronic bellyachers the fact is that they are happier by far than whites he was basing his conclusion he said on personal observations along sin strip the name white newsmen gave chicagos rd street between cottage grove and stony island avenues i asked him why since he thought negroes so much happier than himself he did not go down to live on sin strip give the negroes there his money to worry over and accordingly increase his own happiness that response was borrowed from an english professor i once had at oklahomas langston university an allnegro college in the allnegro town of langston the professor who was mayor of the town used to tell us of his escapades among whites in his travels and kid us that the declaration of independence had given us life liberty and the pursuit of happiness with no guarantee that we would ever catch up with it to what extent has the negro caught up with happiness a happy individual the dictionary tells us in part is one favored by hap chance luck or fortune fortunate prosperous such adjectives obviously refer to few negroes i know but the dictionary goes on to say that a person may be labeled happy if he is addicted to the exhibition of joy or gaiety is joyous it is this i think that leads to the controversy revolving around two main concerns in the first place there is lacking an official gauge of the negros relative bliss then comes the inconsistency of the negros outcast state and his jocular public demeanor i have looked for the answers in the stockpile of facts and figures on the negros struggle taking pains at the same time to scrutinize typical specimen chancing to come before me for a firsthand picture or mosaic of the negros inner mood for one important indication i compared the incidence of misery among whites and negroes although much of that contrast is now wellknown i was struck by several interesting contradictions one is the negros disdain for ending his own life during the depression when whites departed this earth in voluntary droves negroes in birmingham alabama for example were less than onetenth as likely to take their own lives in fort worth texas only ten negroes in twenty years to compared to whites chose to end it all recently two sociologists out at the university of washington combed through suicide statistics for the years to and found negroes less than half as prone to suicide in seattle as the negros situation becomes more equal his suicide score along with other social characteristics becomes more similar to those of whites do not conclude however that the negros past and present distaste for voluntary death is proof that he is less fed up with life the seattle study also found that he is more likely on the other hand to attempt suicide without completing it some people sayerroneously i believethat negroes today are very much like those depicted on the plantation in the movie wild river when things go wrong they simply shrug and say let the white folks worry about it anyway contrary to popular fallacy it is not true that whenever a negro starts to worry instead of worrying himself to death he simply falls asleep mental derangement for example which may accompany emotional distress is higher among negroes than whites available figures for revealed that negro admissions to insane asylums in northern states containing large numbers of negroesnew york illinois chicago and californiamore than doubled admissions for whites bear in mind however that most of the insane were migrants from the south more than two million colored refugees between and alone having left the south forever they sought a rainbows end in the north often to their tragic disappointment many never made the adjustment or quite got over the disillusionment however the higher rate of psychosis among negroes is partly due to the lower prevalence of persons of the middle class and above among them sociologist august hollingshead has found that the higher the social class the fewer the psychotics but the more the neurotics persons financially well off can better afford psychiatric help for mending psychotic dispositions they also are more able and prone to shield psychotic relatives from public commitment and common knowledge more the feelings of personal inadequacy infused in the negro individual from the age of four or five onward psychologists say may be too much for some of them to bear negro parents have yet to solve the problem of what and how to tell their tots about racial matters in order to make their egos shockproof enough for the brutal deprivations and humiliating insults to human dignity they will suffer in later life many parents in the middle class go to extreme ends to guard their children from unfortunate racial experiences slum children on the other hand are more impelled to fall back on the juvenile gang for security and acceptance writing in his book slums and suburbs james b conant formerly president of harvard university reported recently that per cent of the young negroes from to years old in a typical slum are both out of school and out of work out of work because of slim chances for employment out of school in large part due to a sense of defeatism or a lack of incentive developed by dim prospects for them in the job market yet many such youths have internalized the american cultural goal of success and plenty while thwarted in their own access to legitimate means of achieving the goal sociologists among them robert k merton of columbia university know this has the capacity for making a man a criminal denied the routine legitimate means to success many individuals cannot resist the temptation to substitute whatever means are available some take out their frustrations on one another by way of switchblade brawls amid the dilapidated squalor of their neglected environment most continue to suffer in adult life from extreme and unfair policies of occupational discrimination quite often this leads to desertion by fathers and to general family disorganization not surprisingly many are driven to drink as a means of dousing their troubles the average negro family vance packard points out in the status seekers spends twice as much for liquor as the average white family does although this is no indication that whites have an aversion for such beverages negroes farthest down of all turn typically to religious enthusiasm in search of a way out wandering from one cult to the next hoping for a brighter day by and by in deserting conventional religions they are rejecting those they have found unrewarding and the god and his followers they feel have rejected them black muslims for instance counter their sense of rejection and abuse by whites with a passionate rejection of whites they say this is sufficient to cure colored alcoholics en masse because it gives them a sense of selfrespect many middleclass negroes on the other hand who according to the muslims are growing fat satisfied and greasy develop an insouciant frame of mind as a mechanism of ego defense i just dont let it bother me they frequently declare and you see in their faces that they are hoping to convince themselves as well as the listener others spurred by a history and personal background of hard labor and the increasing preeminence of the knob and the handle in american culture confuse mere idleness particularly freedom from productive activities with general wellbeing then finding that ease alone does not bring happiness they are led quite like the lower class to compensate through chronic dissipation they hang after ecstasy in pursuit of the happiness that eludes them i found that much of the negros glee is a function of his low general circumstances in most cases his predominantly lower class origins in others persons of middle class and beyond in their groping for social approval typically place proper deportment above the expression of their own inner tastes and emotions lowerclass codes of conduct regardless of race are much less governed by the rigors of social constraint puerto ricans in the slums of new york and chicago for example also are given to a jocular disposition although i have heard it said that this represents the nigger in them i believe their behavior is due to class and culture like negroes they possess the chance to pursue happiness but hampered in the acquirement of it they overindulge in the pursuit too often the mechanisms of pursuit become ends in themselves masks of glee are publicly worn but often as camouflages for private sorrows and frustrations some scholars go back to the slavemaster relationship for an explanation of this tracing the anachronistic grin many negroes exhibit from the yassuhboss front they were forced to present to whites down through the dictates of racial etiquette under the souths system of intimidation subsequent to civil war reconstruction others like john dollard a sociologist at yale university and coauthor with allison davis of children of bondage give a freudian explanation dollard recently conducted research on the preoccupation of many negroes with playing the dozens and came up with the conclusion that they do so and also kid one another a good deal as a socially approved means of releasing racial frustration this suggests that the gleeful negro is not twofaced after all but is acting unconsciously often without knowing why he does so himself freud had explained in his jokes and the unconscious that funmaking is derived from human social relations and a joke will allow us to exploit something ridiculous in our enemy which we could not on account of the obstacles in the way bring forward openly or consciously perhaps many negroes themselves are way ahead of freud when they realize as the song goes that they are laughing to keep from crying i have concluded that the negro is not so happy as he is joyous joyous says the dictionary refers to the emotion excited by the acquisition or expectation of good although the negros joy is far more in the expectation than the acquisition and he has been expecting a fair chance merely to pursue happiness for quite some time he now can see more clearly the impending demise of jim crow barriers the more his access to true happiness the less he will need to drug himself with compensatory ecstasy for six years i worked f as reporter for a chijj cago newspaper that thrived on stories about sex crime and racial discrimination during those years i witnessed a great many murders accompanied police on bookie joint raids rode a taxi into the midst of a race riot at trumbull park and watched a young man who shot to death a theater cashier during a robbery die in the electric chair among the people i find difficult to forget if i could forget any of them at all are the countless narcotics addicts i have seen and still see today in increasing numbers they are without exaggeration among the most miserable people i have known and the pity of it is that too few people care about them at all i say too few people care about narcotics addicts because i have continuously noticed how the average citizen relentlessly criticizes him for being addicted while doing nothingor very littleto relieve him of his plight people are more apt to want to institutionalize him for life separating him from the rest of society than they are to see the necessity of rehabilitating him in hopes that he will become a useful and productive member of society i believe however that while the bulk of the blame for the degrading and primitive status of the narcotics problem in america can certainly be laid to the lack of adequate state and municipal facilities for handling addicts and enforcing laws against peddling the stuff the christian church must share the blame for turning its back on these socalled social outcasts there are a few individual churches that are attempting to help but in the main the church as a whole is not doing all it can to give addicts the fellowship spiritual guidance and understanding they so desperately need narcotics addiction is a lingering living death that is sold on the streets of hundreds of american cities towns and villages its victims teenagers and adults men and women people of all races and religions who live in unbelievable torment and anguish no one knows for sure how many addicts are in the united states estimates of known addicts have ranged from a low of to a high of conservative estimates place the number around to with about being youths under almost half of this countrys addicts can be found in new york illinois ranks second with to percent practically all of them in chicago california is third with about to percent and michigan fourth with six to eight per cent the problem is big there is the need for a larger budget so that the u s bureau of narcotics can strengthen its undermanned staff of agents who are fighting a losing battle in trying to keep narcotics from being smuggled into the country there also is the need for stronger laws and better enforcement of laws that already exist to rid society of suppliers and peddlers of narcotics a bigger problem some think however is what to do with the scores of thousands of unfortunates who are now addicted can society afford to continue to treat them as criminals rather than as medical cases can state and city governments continue in their reluctance to formulate and put into operation adequate medical and clinical programs that could possibly lead to the cure and rehabilitation of addicts can churches continue to refuse to recognize responsibility admittedly what is being done is not enough this is pointed out periodically by large metropolitan newspapers that find sensational articles about narcotics good circulation builders they usually highlight what cities and states are failing to do how law enforcement is not what is should be and how peddlers are treated better than addicts when they are hauled into court but one area which is often overlooked or completely ignored is the responsibility of the church in regard to the total treatment and rehabilitation of the addict it is time the church took a hard look at the problem and translated its pronouncements against narcotics into concrete programs that will benefit those who need help the mostthe addicts like the mentally ill the tubercular the blindthey too are people of special need no longer a problem exclusive to big cities narcotics addiction is now spreading to smaller cities and towns that for years were relatively free of the dope traffic while new york los angeles and chicago still have the bulk of all u s addicts narcotics addiction has been found to flourish wherever there exists wide slum areas and large segments of frustrated minorities at least per cent of the addicts use heroin a yellowishwhite powder of overwhelming addicting qualities powerful potency and strong euphoric effects other drugs used but in lesser demand are morphine a painkiller with great danger of addiction cocaine a stimulant that is most dangerous when the user has a maladjusted personality and marijuana a cheap narcotic that often leads to insanity after prolonged use always in great demand by addicts heroin a derivative of opium is the backbone of a vicious and illegal racket controlled by the underworld despite tight federal and strong international control it i manages to smuggle enough drugs into the country to realize a million annual profit by supplying organized mobsters of big east coast midwest and west coast cities most heroin smuggled into the u s comes from italy other major illicit sources include communist china frequently accused of flooding western countries with drugs to create moral and physical weaknesses as a prelude to war burma malaya india japan turkey thailand iran syria and lebanon since world war i when there was one addict for every persons in america the narcotics problem has continually sparked an increasingly bitter controversy particularly over how best to treat addicts hospitals refused them treatment states and cities declined to pay for rehabilitation centers and often threatened to close the few clinics that existed with state and city governments failing to measure up to the immense and growing task of coping with dope addiction the federal government in was forced to open a public health service hospital at lexington kentucky the first of its kind in the world for treating and although to a very limited degree rehabilitating drug victims in a smaller hospital was opened at fort worth texas none have been opened since for the most part circumstances for addicts have not improved much in the last fifteen years hospitals still refuse them treatment and cities and states still refuse to establish rehabilitation centers many of the clinics that were open have been shut down even in new york where there are some known addicts and possibly thousands of others who go undetected fewer than beds have been made available to addicts wanting to withdraw from drugs however since the state has established addict treatment facilities at three hospitals and as recently as march governor nelson a rockefeller signed a bill providing for treatment of addicts as medical cases rather than criminals the law finally establishes a new central narcotics office in the state mental hygiene department to direct expanding programs in narcotics research treatment and aftercare addiction is a vastly complicated physiological and psychological problem it is complicated by the publics general assumption that addiction is criminal in reality many addicts are much more sick than criminal there is a need many experts feel to ferret out and objectively classify addicts in order to discover whether all addicts are really alike whether all are criminal instead of sticking to the point of view that they are alike because they are essentially bad or because they offend society historically the same was at one time felt about the leper they were either bad or just dirty or the same was felt concerning venereal diseases and alcoholics these narrow points of view have been mastered now with a more enlightened attitude toward these diseases they have responded favorably to treatment addiction can be found in all classes the wealthy upper class the conservative middle class and the lower classes all have their share of addicts the masses however are found in the subculture of the lower classes and in congested slum areas where large numbers of minority groups as negroes and puerto ricans are clustered together and frustrated by the innumerable discriminatory social and economic problems that are heaped upon them one of the nations few narcotics clinics is located in new yorks east harlem protestant parish directed by the rev norman c eddy a congregationalist who has dedicated himself for almost twenty years to an unyielding battle against narcotics the clinic is a rare place where the church is fighting on the firing line it concentrates part of its limited facilities and budget to which four protestant churches contribute a meager amount on helping adult addicts withdraw but out of the scores who come to the clinic for help it can only help a handful mostly neighborhood residents when men and women come in off the street and say they want to end the narcotics habit declares reverend eddy we have to tell them there is no place for them to go right now for treatment we are in a sense saying go out and steal or commit prostitution so you can get the drugs you need this is a vicious position for us to be in the parish was established in to alleviate suffering among the addicted and their families its budget is about a year and because it cannot always prick the conscience of society enough to raise the money needed to continue operating the parish faces a crisis that pushes it near its final days two other churchsponsored programs in new york face the same possibility judson memorial church which set up a narcotics center and proposed treatment plan in in almost two years its active case load is about addicts about addict patients have come in contact with the center and approximately psychotherapy interviews have been carried out with patients the center averages to patient contacts per week the other is the quaker committee on social rehabilitation inc affiliated with the religious society of friends it concentrates mostly on women addicts since the start of their program in women have been interviewed have been helped and referred for jobs during the early s the rev robert t jenks then pastor of st marks episcopal church on chicagos south side established a narcotics anonymous group on the belief that drug addicts could be rehabilitated for two years his small interracial parish with limited facilities was relatively successful in treating addicts with the help of new tranquilizing drugs testifying before the illinois state legislatures narcotics investigation commission in the rev james w mack then the assistant pastor said the parish started its work as a community problem finding the heaviest illegal drug traffic existed in its own neighborhood it used pastoral counseling tranquilizing drugs group therapy and job placement tranquilizing drugs were administered only by physicians after clinical experiments in the police lockup demonstrated that tranquilizers were ninety per cent effective in eliminating the vicious withdrawal symptoms that afflict addicts when deprived of narcotics reverend mack cited cases of twentyone addicts helped at their mission clinic their average age he said was and they had been addicted an average of four years after four days of taking a tranquilizer and nonbarbiturate sleeping pills reported back completely withdrawn jobs were found for them and after a twomonth period ten of them were still known to be clean father jenks was in constant contact with some junkies to whom religious counsel was given nevertheless the program soon failed for lack of funds and community interest there are innumerable aids the christian church can give in help ing to eliminate the narcotics traffic and to cure and rehabilitate those addicted to drugs for one there is a need for closer cooperation and more clearly defined relationships between the probation department the narcotics court and medical counseling clinics which need to be established in greater number churchrelated hospitals which do not now admit addicts can support the establishment of these clinics and even make available a limited number of beds for the treatment of addicts hospitals should have shortterm detoxification facilities to treat addicts wanting immediate withdrawal and then refer them to neighborhood clinics which the church should be operating for their rehabilitation and aftercare there is a need to stress community education most addicts are dependent not grown up the public should learn that the addict feels inferior allies himself with a gang to bolster his masculine feelings but ambivalently takes the drug to satisfy his passive dependent cravings churches can help the withdrawn addict get involved in a nondrug centered society this is one of the addicts greatest stumbling blocks to rehabilitation once he has been institutionalized treated and released he will need a new environment a new set of values he will need additional therapy and rehabilitation perhaps a trade and employment any addict can be taken off drugs once he is institutionalized but once he is released he is strictly on his own and the tide of frustrations and narrowminded social attitudes that engulfed him and drove him to narcotics in the first place will be waiting for him on his doorstep the church can offer narcotics addicts consolation and understanding and encouragement the church can get them involved in churchcentered activities and afford them opportunities to meet other youth who can help them abstain from further use of narcotics few addicts are religious most of them have been reared in families where religion was not a part of family life and have rebelled against the church this is very well pointed out by new york judge john m murtagh and sociologist sara lou harris in their book on narcotics who live in shadow mcgrawhill the church has a superb opportunity to reach addicts but it has thus far failed to do so the church should accept them not shun them as so many other agencies do it can work with parents to make them know that addiction is a disease and not a crime and it can see to it that its young peoples groups offer addicts who are attempting to kick their habits encouragement and normal social associations most addicts cannot ordinarily be reached through religion in their early contacts with the church they claim to be atheists or agnostics and only come to church in the first place because clergymen and counselors reveal warmth toward them and yet despite addicts general lack of religion some members of the clergy report great satisfaction in their contacts with them the hands that are held out to addicts are so few that they become dependent on any that are thus some addicts who begin coming to church out of no more than their need for comradeship may eventually acquire faith and belief society is irritated by the problem of addiction and is anxious for a solution with cooperative efforts of the church federal state city authorities and private agencies effective plans can be put into operation almost immediately if there is a slowness to act on the part of others however it is the responsibility of the church to supply the impetus for actionas it does in so many other areas of life he heat was oppresy sive it quivered from ii the corrugated iron y roofs of the houses t he middle distance was distorted by the waves as they silently rose toward the brassy sky dust devils swirled aimlessly by picking at loose debris as they passed the cloudless sky seemed to press downward compressing the heat into a vast weight until all movement became an effort nothing stirred even the cicadas were silent seemingly beaten into subjection by the glare of the african sun to the man sitting on the verandah of the hotel the scene was not new even though he had not been in the town before it was no different from a hundred others a few stores a post office government liquor store garage and ubiquitous barclays bank all these were spread along the main street which led north and south only hunters and africans went east or west there was nothing out there except bush and beyond that more bush nobody wanted to go into the bush this weather or did they sweat coursed down the chest of the man as he lounged in his chair his shirt was dark beneath the arms from perspiration his thinning hair wet as the beads of moisture evaporated he grunted and moved into a more comfortable position boy he called an african dressed in white with red sash worn around the body bandolier fashion moved from the doorway in which he had been lounging he had in his hand a small looseleaf book and a stub of pencil which he held out to the man who took it and wrote slowly hurry back eh he said handing the book and pencil together with a silver coin to the other the african waiter left his bare feet making no sound as he crossed the floor away to the north a vague figure appeared in the heat the waves of hot air undulating glassily elongated and then foreshortened whatever it was as it moved toward the town it could have been a bus a car a man on a bicycle or just a man walking at that distance and in the heat it was impossible to tell the man in the chair mopped his brow and peered up the road with narrowed eyes leaning forward to make out the image of the approaching newcomer unaware of the waiter standing at his elbow with bottle and glass on a tray blast the heat he muttered as he relaxed turning back to the table and the waiting african the figure approaching the town proved to be a lone man tall wellbuilt his legs bare to the middle of his thighs which were encased in a pair of faded and dirty khaki shorts his tom shirt matched the color of his pants as he walked his hands held a small marimba which he thumbed rhythmically and with some vigor the dust from the road adhered to his black skin and kinky hair he seemed unperturbed by the heat and quickened his stride as he reached the edge of the town presently he neared the hotel stuffing the marimba into a tom pocket he blew his nose between his fingers and beat some of the dust from his clothes mumba you skellum the man on the verandah came to life he rose from his chair and quickly walked down to the road mornin bwana it was always morning to the african even in the middle of the night the greeting was always the same so you finally got here eh take this and get something to eat and rest up for a while then well be off the man handed mumba some money rascal or rogue a term of endearment be back here at four oclock the man turned and climbed the steps back into the hotel where heaving a sigh he sank into his chair again as he sat drinking his beer the man reviewed the events of the past few days last wednesday a runner had come with news of a leopard near kafulata mumba had sent for him to come it was eighty miles from his farm but mumba knew he would not want to miss the kill he and mumba had more or less grown up together mumbas father had been boss boy on the farm many years ago no other white boys being within miles of the farm the two had been thrown together and in their own way had formed a rare attachment for each other the white man would never have admitted to being a friend of the other but there could be no doubt of the affinity it was nicholas the newspaper man who wanted most to be in on this thing he did not believe the african had the courage nor the mind capable of devising any scheme to kill other than by the conventional trap or shooting method well he would see this animal was old or lame or it would not be so bold several goats and a dog had been taken right out of the village and numerous attempts to catch the leopard had failed hence the call of the white man he knew mumba wanted to play to the gallery so here was a chance to put nicholas in his place the man rose to his feet and entered the main part of the hotel he walked down a wide corridor and opened the door of a room wherein a man lay sleeping on a bed sweat rolled off his bare torso as his chest heaved his hair matted with dampness nicholas the man shook the sleeping figure nicholas wake up mumbas here were off at four nicholas grunted yawned and stretched opening his eyes he asked what time is it just after two time to get a bath ill be back in about half an hour must get the jeep filled up some thirty minutes later the man returned with the jeep two water bags hung on either side of the front seat a rifle pointed skywards its blueblack barrel glistening in the sun a canvas covered box was propped in one comer of the back seat and a red jerry can lay on the floor all right mumba well be off in a few minutes the man addressed the waiting african time meant little to anyone in this town even less to mumba he settled down to wait in the shade and soon slept it was well past four oclock when the two white men appeared each carrying a roll of blankets and a waterproof groundsheet both wore toupees on the back of their heads and nicholas carried a khaki bush jacket the three climbed into the jeep mumba in the back the other two in front the engine rumbled into life and they moved out of the town leaving a cloud of dust hovering in the still hot air the road unpaved and corrugated made travelling uncomfortable the vehicle was not built for comfort and was inclined to dance a little on the uneven surface but nevertheless a steady fifty miles an hour soon brought them to a fairly wide bush path into which they turned their progress was slowed now owing to the narrowness of the track which twisted and turned among the trees it was cooler here in the shade but the oppressive air was in no way diminished and all three were eager to reach their journeys end after travelling some twelve miles along this twisting track they crossed a dambo topped a small steep rise in the ground and there on the edge of the bush was the village a cluster of huts low entrances set in low mud walls topped by grass thatched roofs cooking fires smoked as the women tended their pots children played their games as do children all over the world men smoked and drank beer brewed by the women it was a scene typical of africa the queer pungent smell that is prevalent throughout the country was very evident multicolored dogs of varying degrees of thinness greeted the newcomers with yelps a dry river bed and barks scrawny fowls fluttered this way and that scurrying to get out of the way of the dogs the children stopped their play to gaze at the men fingers in mouths little potbellies bulging over their ragged short pants the jeep pulled over to a vacant hut and the men alighted each stretched the kinks out of his legs and then began to unload the bedding from the rear seat a large tree with wide spreading branches stood some thirty yards from the cluster of huts the earth beneath it was loose and sandy churned up by hundreds of playing feet around the trunk fibre baskets of leaves were stacked it was to these leaves that mumba turned his attention after seeing the others were settled in their quarters calling several loungers over to him mumba proceeded to scatter the leaves quickly under the tree until an area of some fifty square feet was covered next he and two others walked over to one of the huts and presently returned with a large piece of dripping meat tied within a fibre net tossing a rope over a sturdy lowhanging branch of the tree the men fastened one end to the net and hauled the meat into the air until it was suspended some fifteen feet above the ground there it was secured by tying the other end of the rope to the tree trunk after some deliberation the men next returned to the hut and brought out calabashes full of honey golden brown liquid which they proceeded to pour out over the leaves starting in the centre each walked backwards pouring as he went presently it was done to their satisfaction and returning the calabashes to the hut the men went back to their various homes where their daily meal was awaiting them the two white men prepared their own meal and as they ate the sun began to sink they watched the sun drop down like a ball of flaming brass orange and reds merging with yellows and gold steel grey deepening pale blue turning to purple and then to black darkness fell soon after sunset and fires flickered near the homes the men saw an occasional firefly flash his light and huge moths dance around the fires before plunging to their death in the flames tonight the fires were allowed to die early the moon rose like a huge lantern swinging in the sky spreading its pale light across the clearing casting sharply etched shadows from the trees there was an air of expectancy about the village as the people waited mumba sat with the two white men a shorthandled stabbing spear across his knees no one spoke the voices of insects and small creatures broke the stillness of the air an occasional night bird wheeled past on muted wings searching for food a faint cough in the distance sent a thrill down the spines of all who heard it and knew it for what it was a leopard somewhere out there in the shadows the spotted cat was on the move perhaps he would come into the village again in his search for easy pickings dogs goats or even a chicken were his prey now the eyes of all were on the tree in the clearing children kept close to their mothers sides fathers gripped their spears waiting alert to every sound and movement it seemed hours before any other sound of the leopard was heard perhaps it had gone the other way hoping to find food near the waterhole beyond the dambo everyone waited hoping it would come each one dreading its appearance and yet knowing that unless it came tonight the hopes of destroying it would perhaps be lost forever and all the preparation be of no avail a brief moving shadow flickered maybe it was a passing breeze brushing the leaves of the bushes perhaps it was the imaginings of a taut mind there it was again nearer this time suddenly the leopard was in full view its body slung low to the earth tail waving slightly as it gazed toward the silent huts its head lifted as it scented the air the stench of the dripping meat touched its nostrils slowly the cat advanced until it reached the area where the drip had wet the leaves cautiously the beast examined the wetness suddenly its whole being sprang into violent eruption like the abrupt loosing of a tightly coiled spring it leaped snarling into the air teeth grinning upward eyes flashing claws unsheathed ready to rend anything within reach for almost thirty seconds this poise was held nothing moved gradually the tension died and the cat looked upwards seeing the meat hanging there it began to pace the area slowly padding in a circle its face turned up for several minutes this continued until it became aware of the leaves adhering to its paws lifting first one and then the other the leopard tried to bite off the leaves but only succeeded in sticking them to its face the more it tried the worse the situation became the cat became infuriated at its failure to remove the torment gradually its eyes became fully covered and in desperation it rolled over on its back mumba rose to his feet gripping his spear the white man picked up his rifle and released the safety catch pulling the bolt back he gently eased a round into the breech raising his hand he gripped mumbas arm in a brief clasp each knew the others thoughts there was no need for words the black man stepped out into the open and approached the maddened beast somehow the animal semed to sense the approach of the man despite its blinded condition it turned to face the newcomer ready to give battle mumba picked up a stick of wood as he walked deliberately toward the great cat when he was within three yards of the waiting beast he threw the wood to the right front whereupon hearing it strike the ground the leopard leaped toward it as it left the ground mumba struck with his spear his whole weight behind the blow it took the cat through the ribs piercing the heart the beast fell without a sound its leafmatted body still mumba stood his hand on the knife at his belt waiting for what might come next the villagers rushed out crying joyfully stopping short of the fallen beast half afraid it might suddenly spring to life again the white men each of whom had sat with bated breath through it all expelled the air from tortured lungs white tensed muscles eased from the rifle sweat ran unheeded from the faces of both satisfied now nicholas nodded my god the nerve of the man ill never doubt them again they walked over to where the leopard lay picking up one foreleg mumba pointed to the joint of the leg and chest two black dots were clearly visible porcupine he said thats why he was hanging around couldnt get around so good the white man replied must have jumped a porcupine and got shot full of quills lame wonder he didnt get them in his heart nasty things those spikes work their way in and never come out he looked at mumba pushed his clenched fist gently against mumbas bare chest and turned away there was no need for anything to be said mumba knew his friend was proud of him watching him return to the darkness of the hut he breathed deeply then speaking rapidly in order to hide his emotion mumba ordered the men to pick up the carcass and move it out of reach of the ants which were already thick among the leaves attracted by the honey fires were soon blazing merrily once more native beer was brought forth a drum began to beat rhythmically feet began to tap and the village came to life mumbas praises were sung songs of his prowess would be sung for many days the story of the slaying of the leopard would be told to all who would care to hear the deed becoming more hazardous with every tellling the celebration carried on until the small hours of the morning and it was two weary white men who rose at daylight to prepare for their homeward journey mumba was on hand to help them load their belongings and after a leisurely breakfast they left the sun was hot already as they entered the shade of the trees the heat was dancing from the road and shimmering above the rooftops when they reached the town nothing moved it was just another african day in a typical african town what caused that cat to jump after it smelled the meat asked nicholas oh that well it was standing directly underneath the meat and a drip must have landed on it from above i never thought of that nich olas said but it did seem strange at the time i suppose you must be off thanks for everything you were right it certainly opened my eyes oh thats alright remember that the african is just as coura geous and just as resourceful in his own environment as the white man is in his the man walked out into the heat and climbed into the jeep the dust trailed behind as the dancing air distorted and swallowed up the retreating vehicle soon there was nothing left but silence nicholas looked out to the east where the trees stretched endlessly it seemed he was beginning to understand the respect the other man had for the african maybe their sense of values was different from his but one thing was sure the baubles the white man held so precious could avail him nothing in the life and death struggle which continually raged around out there in the shimmering heat money could not buy courage nor diamonds the faith in ones ability to meet death on its own terms and come out victorious this was a mans country where weaklings could not survive from somewhere behind him he heard a white mans voice calling boy he smiled crookedly white warrior five years ago f g when arthur spingarn t fresh from the arms of sptkix a sociay prominent and wealthy family was doing his fathers bidding by practicing law he was asked to try a civil_rights case the details of the case have long since escaped his memory but the effect of it has not to spingarn it was a simple matter of indecency and injustice which he says hes never forgotten today he says the fact that hours after our naacp branch in a tennessee town printed the names of their local members the members were fired from their jobs couldnt get credit and couldnt even buy food so that we are now sending milk to their babiesthats something that even with years experience you dont get used to spingarn is a little rolypoly white man of who for the past years has been president of the national association for the advancement of colored people having served it earlier for years as vice president and chairman of the national legal committee he can recall the times when newspapers described the early interracial meetings as sex orgies when he and his negro friends toured city saloons breaking every glass of beer they were served if charged a dollar a beeronce a bartenders habit to discourage negro patronage he also recalls the many times clients left him because they thought he was a nut not all is well now but some things have changed through the years if saloons charge a dollar for a beer it is now levied against white as well as negro as for spingarns clients they seldom leave these days regarding him as more of a celebrity than a nut they talk about the new negro says spingarn but theres no new negro the difference is that now a negro has the courage to tell the truth to a white man fifty years ago negroes wanted their rights as a woman wants a mink coat now theyre ready to die for them today a leader has to be militant and willing to suffer or hes out spingarn has been in this movement for a long time and if when he talks about the young leaders he does so with a hint that they are whippersnappers who somehow got around their elders it is not the most heinous of sins officially and personally his commitment is to them including the rev martin_luther_king and the freedom riders but he wants it understood that these are people who though they travel the south in groups under the auspices of core are members of the naacp and whose energy and purpose were inculcated in them by the naacp for spingarn the dynasty is due some respect a lot of these people like the sitins think they lit the torch he says at the last naacp convention some young kids reminded me that i had led a picket line in st paul last year why i was leading picket lines in in memphis against the assn of social workers none of this is new to me or the naacp we lit the torch and theyre carrying it now we may not be running the freedom riders but weve been trying their cases all along for once they land in jail they turn to us continues spingarn torn as he is between pride and irritation frankly i dont think anything is served by their staying in jail the way to stop segregation is through court action the protest in montgomery over bus segregation wasnt won by the marchers but by a supreme court decision it was magnificent for those people to suffer for their rights but they finally got their rights by court decision the south is playing a waiting game the southern lawyers tell us frankly that their segregation laws are unconstitutional but they know it will take four years before they get to the supreme court and are set aside the young people just dont want to wait i wish they were better organized but i cant blame them after all weve been waiting for almost one hundred years for what were legally entitled to before joining the naacp spingarns late brother col joel spingarn was one of the original signers of the lincoln day call from which the organization grew spingarn a native new yorker studied law at columbia university he was graduated in with an lld and began an extensive collection of negro literature which he presented to howard university in not long after joining the naacp he tried his first case before the supreme courta white primary caseand won establishing the right of negroes to vote in primaries in texas the legal aspect has always been fun he says here you are a snip of a person you try a case and all of a sudden you make history spingarn made history times from to with supreme court civil right victories there is one place he doesnt like and one place he doesnt go the south twentyfive years ago spingarn and his wife who died three years ago spent some time in the south he has rarely been back since the prejudice northem ir ers feel toward south erners is roughly parallel to that felt by english people toward americans and is compounded of many of the same ingredientsa thoroughgoing dislike of their public policies contempt for their level of education and culture and a sort of instinctive recoil at the sound of the accentlarded in both cases it must be said with a thick layer of that particular form of snobbishness that sneers at the provincial it is distasteful to the northerner that a human being should have the name of lady bird it grates on the northern ear to hear an educated person say sumpn and prolly or speak of a mess of fried chicken pronounced maiss of frad chickn the photographs that appear so regularly in the newspapers of white faces caught in the act of hate outside some school or drugstore fill the northerner with uneasiness and almost incredulity for when the northerner segregates and discriminates he does it on the whole slyly rather than overtly and without passion thus the white south comes to be pictured in the northern mind as an undifferentiated arid wasteland of the human intellect and spirit incongruously smeared over with a sticky coating of sugary politeness and sentimentality all the

kids extending the hand of friendship to three negro classmates at georgia tech my point in going to the south was as a certain kind of tourist will often put it to see how the people really live to slide into the daily lives of people to soak up their ordinary conversation to savor their manner and manners to achieve an oblique rather than a direct look was my plan slightly easier said than done

there a negro newspaper editor told me in these border communities its not popular to believe in segregation most whites will tell you they have colored friends even though they generally mean their maids but although theres abstract agreement about the inevitability of desegregation theres no agreement about implementation the when and how the editor asked me if id like to meet some women who were going to do the testing he explained in the wake of a successful sitin movement by students the year before some two hundred eating places had agreed to desegregate and now their good faith was being tested the testers a group of welldressed negro women gathered at the negro ywca for instructions and assignments there were the usual asides so familiar to anyone who has worked in pta girl scouts the usual civic organizations cant work beyond two oclock my jimmy gets back from school then sorry i couldnt come tuesday miz brown but my kids all came down with the flu efficientlooking mimeographed forms were handed out with spaces for place tested time tested environment check one low medium high attitude of waitress or manager check one poor fair good the trouble is you have to drink so much coffee before the days over confided one woman a complaint i had further occasion to hear during my travels for another view of louisville i accepted an invitation to dinner at the country club this was for me a little like being shown around a steel factory behind the iron curtain never having seen the inside of one at home i had no basis for comparison nevertheless a certain amount of southern life revolves around these country clubs and i thought it would be a good thing to have a look we were a party of five two couples and myself rather to my surprise conversation centered for a time on the servant problem i have of course heard and read of such discussions but had never before been actually present at one the subject was first broached by one of the guests a middleaged man whom i shall call mr mitchell he related the sad story of his experience with life magazine which had run a series of articles on domestic servants a life editor had called mr mitchell about his old uncle mo who has been with the mitchell family for thirtyfive years then just when mr mitchell figured the story was all set life dropped him and uncle mo and picked a servant who had been with his white folks a year longer with life many are called but few are chosen i murmured but the other couple now chimed in along these lines why wilfred youall certainly have it easy why our chorine shes simple terrible i mean shes just awful simply ruined the best silver by pouring bleach all over it weve rechristened her chlorine just as i was being overcome with prickly embarrassment mrs mitchell came to my rescue and turned the conversation to books mrs mitchell jerst lerves to read in fact the local branch of the public library simply cant keep up with her she just gobbles up books five or six of em a week why books are just bread and meat to her mr mitchell demurred he never reads anything unless it has first been digested by the readers digest hes a vey vey slow reader always has been cant git through these long long books of threefour hundred pages thats asking too much of a man he means he likes reading but why drag it out so mmm youve got a point i said i felt that time was staggering on and we were somehow missing the crux of life in the south today and undertook to change the subject myself what do you think of the sitins i asked of the general assemblage mr mitchell undertook to propound the position for the group he explained that it was like this inegration may be in evitable but its gotta be fought because just as sure as night and day it will lead eventually to the mongrelization of the race using bits of tableware he illustrated here youve got a racehorse producing a fork and heres a cart horse marshaling a sugar bowl that did look a little bit like a fat plodding old nag mix em and what have you got since reader you have heard this one before i will cut it short youve got sumpn that aint fit for running and aint fit for haulinga crossbreed a misfit and what oh what have you got if you breed a slow reader with a fast reader i asked anxiously but answer came there none fortunately there are other viewpoints to be found among louisville whites louisville is the home of barry bingham publisher and owner of the liberal courierjournal bingham impressed me as one who would be more at home in london or paris than in this provincial setting a cosmopolitan in outlook and by preference yet he works conscientiously with the locals for the liberalization of racial attitudes in his hometown trip notes last day in louisville no fair using taxi drivers for copy but this ones an exception shes a rugged stronglooking woman build of marie dressier i ask her what she thinks of the sitins all for them she calls out gaily goes on to tell me about her sons elementaryschool picnic last year there were about sixty white people kids and parents and one negro boy the park custodian refused to admit the negro child upon which the whites by common agreement decided to chuck the whole thing surprising because tm not at all sure this would necessarily have been the outcome had a parallel incident happened at home in california on to nashville tm told it is known by its inhabitants as the athens of the south leads one to speculate for a fanciful moment on whether athenians ever think of their city as the nashville of greece in nashville i drove to a shady road on the outskirts of town one of those roads bathed in the luminous green that is the hallmark of a southern spring you feel almost as though you were swimming through the weeds of a sunny overgrown pond so exuberant is the vegetation the large tidy house at the end of the circular drive was of the vintage of its inhabitants perhaps a little older and furnished in the style of their youth with lots of leather varnished maps flowery chintz and fringed lamps several ladies were gathered for tea which was shortly served by a prim negro maid the sweet soft voices twittered away i declare francielou these brownies are just mouth watering and i never did get my ramblers to bloom just right last spring but then the weather was downright unseasonable touches of lace rose and fell on dimity bosoms old fingers groped in purses for photographs of grandchildren one might have stumbled into a scene from a mary petty drawing soon enough as often happens in a gathering of the leisured elderly the conversation turned to good works the particular form of good works practiced by these ladies for the past several months was being observers at the negro sitins the role of an observer they explained to me was merely to sit at the lunch counter or in the theatre where negroes were seeking accommodation and in silence to lend moral support to the effort there was no contact between observer and sitin demonstrator and no words were ever exchanged nevertheless by some sort of mental telepathy as one expressed it the friendly intent of the observer was usually somehow transmitted to the negro group looking round at these particular observers i felt it wouldnt require much detective work to divine that a woolworths lunch counter was not their customary eating place nor son of tarzan their preferred form of entertainment i dont think miz beardsley ever set foot in a woolworths before in all her bom days confided one because she turned to me real surprised and said why whod have thought they serve coffee in these places mrs beardsley had good cause to find out that they not only serve coffee but ply the customers with free refills for after two hours during which because of a temporary breakdown of organization no negroes showed up she was heard to complain in an agonized stage whisper where in the world are they i simply cant drink any more colfeeand i must find the ladies room coffee drinking seems to loom large in this struggle with a hundred or more white observers involved mostly women with free daytime hours to devote a few minor hitches were bound to develop one lady sailed angrily up to an acquaintance who had merely stopped at a lunch counter for a bite to eat after a hot afternoon of shopping and snapped what are you doing here this place is reserved for the unitarians integration of the movie theatres presented yet another problem informal agreement was finally reached with some of the theatre managers that negroes would be admitted but to smooth the initial stages of the change they would be expected to walk directly to their seats and not to stand in the lobby patronize the candy stand or use the restrooms a white lady observer seeing a negro patron in front of her move as though to rise from his seat reached forward and grabbed him saying loudly youre not supposed to go to the restroom what early experience or sudden turn in life had prompted the missionary zeal of the observers this was hard to discover i guess ive always felt this way ever since i was a child said one its just that there was never any opportunity to do anything about it until the sitins started i was to get the same sort of answer from many another southern white i spent an afternoon with an elderly intellectual one of those rare women whose entire life is spent in the realm of scholarly endeavor she was a leading authority on boswell and johnson a translator of eighteenthcentury french poetry a student of modern thought from freud to sartreand an alert interesting conversationalist at one point i asked her what she thought the outcome of the segregation problem would be she became exceedingly ruffled and answered quite crossly to tell you the truth i never give it a thought evidently to think about this particular problem would be disturbing and in an area in which she had no wish to be disturbed if one stayed long enough in the company of people like the observer ladies it might be possible to get the wrong impression it would not be difficult to travel through the south entirely in such company for today they exist to one extent or another in every state even in the deep southand like all minority thinkers they tend to hang together they are for the most part a deeply dedicated lot in the north there are countless numbers of white people who contribute occasionally to core or naacp go once in a while to a meeting or lecture on race problems and vote for a local negro candidate but these activities are on the periphery of their lives among the southerners i met who have taken a stand for integration it seems to have swallowed them whole and to occupy their every waking moment once you start out with the integrationists they are likely to pass you from hand to hand and from town to town without giving you much chance to peer at the other side i mentioned this to a young attorney originally from jackson whom i met in nashville he laughed and said you should tra meetin kissin jim folsom thatd open yo ass for a moment i was frozen with astonishmentuntil i realized he was saying eyes trip notes atlanta so far everywhere vve been louisville nashville and now atlanta people keep saying this isnt the real south or its more of a border city yet they look like southerners they talk like southerners they act like southerners i gather what they really mean is that atlanta nashville and louisville have better newspapers better colleges more enlightened leadership and consequently better race relations than other southern communities therefore to say they are not the real south seems vaguely unfair i met a couple of southern belles models the first was a senior at a womens college on the outskirts of atlanta academically the best school in the south she told me she had the delicate look of a spring floweryet a certain bounciness of mannerand that special softness and highness of voice often encountered in southern women what made me join the sitins i dont know i always wanted to do something about discrimination when i saw them there i felt i had no choice but to join in she said she had not known any of the negro participants one day she was downtown shopping and came across a negro picket line i just started picketing with them but the tears were rolling down my cheeks the second southern belle conventionally honeyhaired and blueeyed was introduced to me by her mother who said i want you to meet my lil ole jailbird daughter shes just been in and out of those jails since the sitins started havent you lambchop and now shes on her way to jackson with the freedom riders lambchop an honor student at her southern college is jeopardizing a coveted junior year abroad by making the dangerous journey to jackson but with her as with a growing number of her generation the mewvement as they all pronounce it must come first the little old jailbirds attractive and delightful mother took me to some meetings where i met the men and women of goodwill who were busily organizing for ddaythat day toward the end of summer when the schools would be desegregated for the first time dont ever say integration we like to call it desegregationit sounds so much more palatable somehow a network of committees and subcommittees with their cleverly contrived nameshope for help our public education oasis for organizations assisting schools in septemberwere meeting almost daily often to the background whir of a mimeograph machine grinding out the latest mailing from the toplevel planners including y leaders churchmen schoolboard people to the neighborhood groups and youth committees hundreds were involved in this huge humanitarian enterprise i heard the superintendent of schools tell a gathering that police protection for the entering students would be as carefully planned as the invasion of japan it was all thrilling and heartwarming and inspiringwith one tragiccomic aspect this great outpouring of bestintentioned energy was directed to the very modest end that nine negro children out of a hundred thirtyeight applicants should be allowed peacefully to take their rightful places at high school these nine had survived a barrage of tests academically they had to be above the fiftieth percentile of the school to which they sought transfer their behavior record had to be blameless their personalities had to be declared outstanding no such interpretation of the tests was made for their white classmates which leads one to speculate whether the old phrase separate but equal is being supplanted for the negroes by the concept together but vastly superior trip notes montgomery at last people have stopped saying this isnt the real south my favorite sort of houses everywhere white frame two or more stories most with nineteenthcentury gingerbread trim even in the better suburbs none of this splitlevel streamlined modern that gets so tiresome in wealthy california everything half hidden by the rampaging vegetation of a corotmonetmanet land the frescoes round the walls of the rotunda in the state capitol incredibly like the worst examples of soviet art depicting scenes of montgomery history one titled the golden years shows a group of happy slaves toting bales of something each with delighted smile on face no postcards of this available to my sorrow as i should have liked to tease my friends at home with them the elite cafe fine food pronounced eelight cafe fan fude weeds pushing up all over the tennis courts in the immense public park a couple of years ago negroes won a court decision granting them use of the park so the city authorities closed it up for everybody noses and faces being respectively cut off and spited all over they disbanded the zoo too and now if you want to take the kids to the zoo you have to go all the way to birmingham where the zoo is integrated social gatherings in montgomery are full of echoes of the past the food in private houses tends to be in the shape of thingsicecream boats or hearts fishshaped aspic saladsand almost everything is creamed not only creamed but served with cream sauce the fare is as mild and gentle as the ladies themselves no bitter or pungent taste to offset the bland no crisp consistency to contrast with the soft the very form of conversation seems more nineteenth century than contemporary at ladies lunches the talk proceeds like a croquet game with three standard opening moves the weather well is it hot enough for you the food about which someone is bound to declare pretty near the beginning that rosiebelles whateveritis is just simply out of this world the frontalassault type of compliment where somebody declares that my you get younger looking every day and how in the world do you manage it and goes on to bet your husband doesnt like to let you out of his sight for one single minute this sort of remark may as well be delivered to a matron of fifty as to the latest bride and trips off the tongue as readily exaggeration as a way of life may confuse the auslander my hostess answers the telephone and is heard to say why janie thats just about the nicest thing i ever heard in my whole life upon being asked later what the call was about it turns out that janie has invited us over for a drink no use to comment that my hostess must have had a rather thin time if that was really just about the nicest thing she ever heard in her whole life she merely stares uncomprehendingly as conversation warms up which of course it does eventually the sense of the past is intensified for so much of it deals with endless ramifications of family history and gossip about old times one thing leading to another the longago romances of aunts williejo and sarahmarie cousins robbielou and marigold are brought out for examination and speculation anecdotes often end and the thing of it was he simply up and took a shotgun and blew his brains out and of course she was found in the river we all felt so bad and no one ever did exactly get the right of what happened the poor feller just actually took to the bottle well you know he did and of course its in the family his father died an alcoholic and well anyway i declare one day they found him in the garage hanging from a belt of course nothing was ever proved about it but they do say her death was not accidental few seem to have died in their beds all this in surprising contrast to the peachycreamy surface of life in montgomery the montgomery country club is much like the one in louisville spacious oldfashioned with french windows giving onto a long outdoor terrace presumably for gonewiththewindish occasions as in louisville good whiskey and terrible food are served by old familyretainer types of negroes in white coats there were a lot of young people in the crowd girls in diaphanous evening dresses boys in white dinner jackets their talk was all but incomprehensible their yalls rang out like rebel yells i found myself talking to a middleaged man introduced to me as a member of the school board so we discussed education in its noncontroversial aspects for i was a guest and on my best behavior the topic was the difficult situation of the unusually bright child whether he should be skipped or handled otherwise it is a safe and wellplotted subject with enough on the one hands and on the other hands to keep one going for a while my interlocutor explained that in his district the problem is being tackled by grouping the children within each grade according to ability i rejoined that the same system obtains in oakland californiaand could not help adding that in our grammar school there is a fifthgrade group of six children with iqs of over two whites two orientals and two negroes with genuine foreheadwrinkling puzzlement and no apparent rancor the schoolboard member drawled is that so it dont seem possible no nigra could have an iq of do it now i started to say to me it do when our hostess hurriedly bore me off to talk to someone else for a breath of fresh air i went to the mass meeting in the negro community where reverend martin_luther_king jr was to speak with the freedom riders actually the air was disturbingly filled with tear gas at one point and no one quite knew if wed get out of there alive the hostile white crowd outside which had been gathering for some time before the meeting was suitably attired i noted with approval in the latest thing in mob wear in faded cotton frocks revealing insectbitten bare legs or dirty shirts and jeans they might have been movie extras assembled by a rather unimaginative director to do a corny mob scene a wellread lot they appeared to be too versed in the literature of their region surely that halfbeatendown halfsavage look that casualyetbrutal slouch that mean glitter in the eye could only be achieved by one with at least a passing acquaintance with the works of faulkner tennessee williams and eudora welty there was only a handful of police and a squad of very nervouslooking us marshals to achieve the church i parked my borrowed car nearby and walked past the extras with all deliberate speed as the supreme court would sayfor being hatted gloved and stockinged i felt more than a little conspicuous inside the church was a loud m sweetsinging haven warmly enveloping it was filled far beyond its normal seating capacity with people of all ages darksuited men women in best dresses and flowered hats little girls in party shoes little boys wriggling in their stiff collars as the evening wore on its nightmare quality began to unfold first there was the tear gas an alien and threatening odor next incredibly reverend king was telling us in matteroffact tones that the mob outside was completely out of control they had injured some of the us marshals and had overturned and burned a car the implication was rather strong that the church might be next more incredibly the vast packed audience was taking it in stride there was not a sign of panic not a shriek not a fainting fit just murmurs of yes lord thats right lots of singing lots of patient confidence it seemed to go on forever and ever later it was announced by a general of the alabama national guard that no one could leave the church until morning because of the danger outside the atmosphere became positively jollylike an impromptu camping expedition i thought as we prepared to make ourselves as comfortable as possible for the long hours of confinement searching that sea of calm determined faces i felt as though id stumbled on the very source of strength that would brace a young girl to exchange a year in paris for a stretch in the jackson prison or a provincial gentlewoman to brave the scorn of her set by publicly giving a hand to the negro sitins some time after five oclock in the morning having learned that my borrowed car was the unlucky one that had been demolished earlier i was driven home in an alabama national guard jeep it was a morning of startling beauty a soft warm breezy dawn in which the lovely town looked its best trip notes montgomery after the freedom riders the fire marshal came round to see me about the burnedup car i was rather hoping he might be interested in finding the vandals who had destroyed it but he asked whether i was connected with core or naacp whether i had made other stops in the south or had come directly to montgomery from california whether l had attended regular church that sunday morning whether i knew anyone else who was at the meeting why went whether my friends had lent me the car of their own free will an editorial in the montgomery journal deplores the view that mob violence will chase industry from montgomery it points out that atlanta had the greatest race riot in history in six hundred negroes killed and carted off in trucks and look at flourishing industrial atlanta today a twentytwoyearold english student here is in trouble she was quoted in a maninthestreet interview as saying negroes should be allowed to go any place they wish i am for integration of the races a hundred per cent since when for some reason she has been dropped from of all things the englishspeaking union the country clubbers have vanished from my life like summer snow since the carburning one of them called me sounding absolutely terrified to say a rumor was spreading that she had accompanied me to the meeting that her husband and inlaws are furious with her for even knowing me that it wouldnt be safe for us to meet again twentytwo students from auburn university signed a letter which appeared in the montgomery advertiser first sane thing to appear locally theyve since been hanged in effigy on campus by counterstudents a local white couple fred and ann gach have been tried and fined for disturbing the peace they saw a negro freedom rider being stopped by a mob asked three policemen to stop the beating to no avail finally the gaches were arrested when a policeman was assigned to escort them home and they refused to accompany him on the basis that one policeman could not protect them just before i left i was smuggled into one last drawing room for tea by now there was virtually only one topic of conversation in montgomery the freedom riders and for comic relief the case of the young english girl versus the englishspeaking union after the usual preliminary comments on the weather the strawberry cream cake and the youth and beauty of all present our hostess patiently undertook to put me wise to the basic objection to the freedom riders integration of the busstation facilities would surely lead to intermarriage but does one usually marry a person because one sits next to him at a bus stop she answered with glint in eye and scarlett ohara toss of head honey when ah sit next to a man any manah jest cant help thinkin jest how hed be you know to make love to ah might jest as well come right out and say itin baid now you know yourself owl women are lak that later the ladies discussed a mutual acquaintancesomebodys aunt i believewho is currently in a nearby mental institution its real real nass out there one of them said ah declare they have the loveliest grounds its all beautifully kept up you should see the flowers at this time of vear the m fudes fan too and she has such a pretty room she added reflectively it really isnt so very different from the outside visitors to the beautiful city of seattle of which there will be throngs this worlds fair year will blink no eye to see the stars and stripes floating over the tall buildings nor give any particular thought to the wonderful addition western washington makes to our country they do not realize how it might have been otherwise how our northern boundary line which runs straight to the pacific shore once threatened to loop down around that lovely northwest corner and draw it into british territory had that happened the union jack would now be flying over the canadian waters of puget sound and some southern british columbia metropolis would reign where seattle stands in this connection there is a story which deserves attention but has never been completely and forthrightly told it concerns the impact made on the outcome of the boundary dispute by the personality of a remarkable negro george washington bush details about bushs early years are sketchy and contradictory but best information indicates that he was born in pennsylvania in his parents were servants to a shipping magnate named stevenson with whose household they moved to tennessee when the bushes remained faithful retainers to the end caring for their master and his wife in their declining years they were left the stevenson fortune george their only child was educated among the quakers of philadelphia and though some of their gentle peaceloving philosophy rubbed off on him he nevertheless joined the army during the war of he fought under general andrew jackson at the battle of new orleans and is sometimes credited with having made important suggestions to jackson in connection with the barricades which helped to win the engagement not yet through with adventure george bush became a voyageur with the furtrading companies sometime in the s employed first by robidou of st louis and later by the hudsons bay company for two years he traveled widely over the plains and mountains of the wilderness west and even made a visit to the pacific coastan experience which was to influence the most important decision of his later life undoubtedly the stevenson inherited money helped to stake him to a start in life when he was ready to settle down and he became a farmer stockraiser and nurseryman but it was due to his own intelligence and industry that he prospered possibly he farmed in illinois before his furtrading travels afterwards he settled in missouri first in boone county later moving westward into clay county having remained a bachelor until he was past in bush took as his wife isabella james a twentyyearold girl of germanamerican extraction to the couple five sons were born in rapid succession meantime in faraway oregon the historic situation was building up in which george bush was to play his part this was the international quarrel over the spoils of discovery along the north pacific coast at first four nations were involved but when in spain gave up her claim north of the nd parallel of latitude the oregoncalifornia line of today and in russia agreed to stop her southern advance at the approximate middle of the present province of british columbia the united states and great britain were left to quarrel over the intervening territorya strip miles wide stretching from the rocky mountains to the pacific ocean then generally known as oregon from the beginning the american government was loud and belligerent in its demand for all the territory north to the th parallel which was the westward extension of the northern boundary of the louisiana purchase this would have given the united states roughly twothirds of the disputed territory whereas the most the british felt impelled to yield up was onethird the u s did have an excellent claim to the columbia river and in after the russian position was stablized at the british government offered the columbia as the boundary line from the th parallel to the sea this offer reduced the territory in dispute to about twothirds of the present state of washington including the okanogan valley the kittitas and yakima valleys the washington cascades the fertile western lowlands the puget sound country and the beautiful olympic peninsula the u s unwilling to modify its claim to this extent haughtily refused the offer with the matter thus in stalemate the two govern ments agreed in to continue to occupy the territory jointly which they had been doing by treaty since for the next fifteen years the situation remained virtually unchanged a few american missionaries furtraders and settlers were attracted to the region but these took land to the south and east of the columbia in territory already understood to be american through the last british offer meantime the hudsons bay company had established the trading posts of fort vancouver on the north bank of the columbia fort nisqually near puget sound and fort langley on the fraser river as well as agricultural colonies on the cowlitz and nisqually prairies which strengthened the british position north of the river then in the early s a new force rolled westward over the plains waves of american emigrants boiling with oregon fever bringing wives children and possessions in covered wagons as families descended the columbia it became the duty of dr john mcloughlin chief factor at fort vancouver to direct the settlers into the rich willamette valley to the south and keep them out of the disputed territory to the british the columbia river was still the dividing line and they meant to keep it after a couple of years in which only small parties traveled westward a great migration took place in wagons people head of oxen and cattle early the next year talk drifted back to missouri of rich lands to be had in oregon for the taking of cattle and grain selling there at four times their price in the midwest some of bushs white friends and neighbors were determined to move to oregon to better themselves bushs knowledge of the west gained in his voyageur days would be an asset on the trip and they urged bush to join them george bush was by then a wealthy man but that circumstance had not kept his family from suffering the indignities of race prejudice bush felt that his sons would have a better opportunity in free oregon than in the slave state of missouri which was already growing bitter with the ferments which were to lead to the civil war and where feelings against free negroes were growing virulent so bush decided to go and thus became the wealthiest man to migrate to oregon in pioneer days he took with him seeds nursery trees implements and herds of stock and the story is also told how he carried one hundred pounds of silver nailed under a false bottom in his wagon but unlike many wealthy men he was kind and generous and he furnished teams and money out of his own pocket for some of his neighbors who started west with him the party as made up consisted of george bush michael t simmons david kindred james mcallister gabriel jones their wives and children and three single men mike simmons was a tall resolute kentuckian who was genial generous and strong in his attachment he and bush were very close friends and they complimented each other very well for simmons impulsiveness sometimes needed the temper of bushs sage counsel while simmons was more aggressive in fighting for his friends rights than the forgiving quakerraised farmer the wagons of the bush party joined with others until a train of some wagons was formed the train traveled forward in the spring of under a quasimilitary organization of which mike simmons was elected colonel a position which put him second in command when the general who was in command spent most of his time galloping after buffalo the real leadership fell on simmons shoulders and simmons in turn relied greatly on bushs shrewdness resourcefulness and knowledge of the country the spring proved tremendously rainy rivers were so swollen with flood that the wagons were delayed and the train reached the western slopes behind schedule and with many of its members desperately short of provisions in the emergency bush helped at least twenty destitute families out of his own stores and pocket a nd then on reaching the dalles on the columbia river the ax fell even while the simmonsled party toiled westward that spring settlers from missouri who had reached oregon the fall before had been busy putting their race intolerance to work the organic law adopted by the provisional government set up by willamette valley settlers in included an antislavery ordinance to which in june the slavestate missourians were able to force a harsh amendment the amendment forbade the settlement of free negroes in oregon on pain of a lashing not less than nor more than stripes if any should remain longer than two years thus the bushes after giving up their old missouri home after traveling two thousand miles through the wilderness seeking tolerance reached oregon to find the door slammed in their faces a not wanted sign affixed by means of a stilettopointed whip handle the feelings of the bushes at this point cannot be described their companions reacted in outraged indignation with deep disappointment for themselves for they were too deeply indebted to george bush too fond of him and his family to abandon them and if the bushes could not settle south of the columbia neither would they the willamette valley was out and also the rogue river valley farther south which they had been considering they soon discovered that the jurisdiction of the provisional government did not extend into british territory on the north side of the columbia and on going down the river they camped twenty miles east of fort vancouver on the washougal river where they remained for nearly a year during the winter the men of the party cut shakes which simmons and bush took to fort vancouver to exchange for provisions meantime the party was casting about for a place where bush could settle permanently in the fall simmons had become interested in reports of the inland sea of puget sound to the north and had made an exploring trip in that direction but was forced to turn back before reaching his goal even had he been successful he and his friends could hardly have defied dr mcloughlin they like most of the other american immigrants who reached the lower columbia arrived so short of provisions as to find themselves dependent upon the hudsons bay company the only source of supply the overland migration of american citizens had put dr mcloughlin in a compromising position if some of the american parties should starve after reaching the promised land it would certainly discourage others from starting and mcloughlins superiors desired him to deny the resources of the hudsons bay company to the arriving americans but mcloughlin possessed too humanitarian a heart to let women and children suffer he lent the necessary aidwhich only encouraged more families to come so now here was george bush and his party with a need to escape north from the negro whipping law both bush and simmons were outstanding intelligent men of the type to gain the chief factors regard and the good doctor was a tolerant man who himself knew the stings of race prejudice who had once caned a man for insulting his indian wife so dr mcloughlins sympathies were aroused by bushs plight and sometime during the spring of he found his humanitarian inclinations again running counter to the policy of his company and to british interests in july mike simmons again went north to explore puget sound this time successfully it seems sure that a private understanding with the chief factor had already been arrived at and in october when simmons led the rest of his party to a permanent settlement on the sound he carried with him a letter from dr mcloughlin to dr william f tolmie the superintendent of the agricultural company at nisqually asking tolmie to cooperate with the americans by providing them with supplies bush simmons and their friends spent fifteen days in cutting a road north from cowlitz landing for their wagons on arriving at the south end of the sound simmons took a claim at the falls in the deschutes river bush on the adjacent prairie afterwards known as bush prairie and the others on land nearby all within a radius of six miles this little colony represented the first definite breach in the britishheld line true one american john r jackson had settled in the cowlitz valley earlier that same year but whereas one man made little impression a party of thirtytwo men women and children carried real weight meantime a shift in the american position on the boundary question had been loudly trumpeted during his campaign for the presidency in james k polk had whipped up oregon emotionalism and promised if elected to demand the end of joint occupancy and to go to war with great britain if necessary to win the whole of the disputed territoryyes clear to the russian line this brash threat gained popular support and the cry fiftyfour forty or fight helped put polk in the white house though there was no new basis for this northward shift in american demands which resulted from sheer yankee bluster the development was an alarming one to the british american settlers were pouring into the willamette valley so fast as to have doubled their numbers and now that an american colony was established on puget sound it would be impossible to keep other emigrants in check south of the columbia should they surge on north of the th parallel the american government might find good grounds for its new demand for all of oregon this unhappy possibility caused the british to yield suddenly and in after thirty years of refusal they agreed to adopt the th parallel as international boundary to puget sound there to dip down to the strait of juan de fuca to give the british the whole of vancouver island the treaty which was concluded on june filled out the northwest corner of the united states as we see it on maps today historians assess in differing measures the reasons for this dramatic british capitulation but an important factor was the pressure of american immigration and fear of its northward trenda fear aggravated by dr mcloughlins failure to restrain the bush party south of the columbia river so it cannot be denied that the bush partys invasion of the forbidden field helped to tip the scales in uncle sams favor nor that this sequence of events resulted directly from george bushs worth of character had he not proved kind and neighborly in missouri and charitable and responsible during the westward trek his companions would have marched off to the rogue river valley without him even then had he not won the sympathy of dr mcloughlin the way to puget sound probably would have remained barred bush may never have been fully cognizant of the influence exerted on the outcome of the boundary dispute by his decision to go north to puget sound to find a free home if he did understand it the results must have seemed ironic with the signing of the oregon treaty the organic law of the provisional government was extended to the th parallel in this way the odious ordnance followed him north and within one year fell on him and his family in their new home but bush had staunch white friends who had seen him through before mike simmons who was appointed a justice of the peace under the provisional government traveled to oregon city where he pleaded bushs case so earnestly that he succeeded in having a special act passed removing bushs race disability but though bush could now reside in the territory legally he still endured other forms of discrimination ezra meeker pioneer washington historian has dwelt on bushs difficult position he was a true american and yet without a country he owed allegiance to the flag and yet the flag would not own him he was firmly held to obey the law and yet the law would not protect him he could not hold landed property and his oath would not be taken in a court of law not being able to hold landed property was the worst feature of this injustice for bush with his characteristic energy and intelligence had immediately set out to make his acre homestead a model farm he grew wonderful garden produce raised fat stock harvested manybushelled acres of wheat and other grains and set out an orchard he helped others with seeds and nursery stock he supplied the money to buy the mill irons for the first sawmill erected on puget sound built in by a group of settlers led by mike simmons the bush pioneer home on the prairie became a way station on the route between cowlitz landing and the sound where travelers were welcomed with unhesitating hospitality all who met bush were forced to admire him then during the winter of a time of near famine the fame of the negro pioneer spread more widely bush proved to be the only man on the sound with surplus stores of wheat and seattle speculators offered him a fortune for the supply but he refused to profit from the misfortunes of his fellow citizens he kept his wheat and apportioned it out fairly and charitably in april washington territory was divided off from oregon territory olympia only a few miles from the bush homestead became the capital within a month of the first meeting of the new territorial legislature in friends of simmons and bush among the lawmakers succeeded in having a memorial passed asking the u s congress to grant bush title to the section of land on which he had lived for nearly ten years in this memorial bushs white champions said of him his habits of life during said time have been exemplary and industrious and that by constant and laborious cultivation of said claim and by an accommodating and and charitable disposal of his produce to immigrants he had contributed much toward the settlement of this territory the suffering and needy never having applied to him in vain for succor and assistance and that at the present time the said george bush has a large portion of the said claim under a high state of cultivation and has upon it a good frame house and convenient outhouses in all amounting to several hundred dollars and in view of the premises aforesaid your memorialists are of the opinion that the case is of such meritorious nature that congress ought to pass a special law donating to him his said claim congress complied with the request granting george w bush the title to his homestead on january after that he continued to farm for eight more years and brought the first reaper and mower to the sound he died in his wife in one more boy had been born to the couple after they reached puget sound and their six sons carried on the tradition of their father they were among the most industrious and enterprising citizens in thurston county according to historian george h himes william owen bush the oldest son raised wheat which was awarded first premium at the philadelphia exposition of over all other wheat in the world and also medals at the buffalo and chicago worlds fairs descendants of george bush continued to live on the old homestead for one hundred years and the bush name has become so outstanding it will even be found in family records of washington pioneers compiled by the dar of washington statethe irony being that none of the information given reveals that bush was a negro recent newspaper articles about bush simmons and the early colony on the deschutes river also carefully omit this fact but the identity of george washington bush must not be denied he was a negro an ornament to his race who through sheer goodness won through to puget sound where the american flag followed and in the end extended its privileges to him 12408 100 s а v q e ףv 9 l c
