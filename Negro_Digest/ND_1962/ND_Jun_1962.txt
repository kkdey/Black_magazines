why boxers go broke
boxers the process of going broke is much like an inevitable incurable feels early stages but is terribly painful ever after is a disease that afflicts most of the bigname highestpaid boxers regardless of race creed or disease good it color regardless of their own innate intelligence regardless of good management regardless of all the bad examples lateera fighters could learn from sugar ray robinson is a mental giant in his craft he is a man who understands sharpies and sharp practices yet a few years ago sugar ray sat in the guest dining room at the ebony magazine offices and literally cried over his financial woes he blamed friends whom he had trusted implicitly exheavyweight champion ezzard charles admits that his managers were gentlemen and most of his federal income taxes unlike joe louis were paid off the top of his purses yet charles couldnt escape an attack of secondstage poverty jimmy carter several times lightweight champion was once so frugal that he wouldnt even purchase an automobilebut somehow his money trickled through his fingers as if they were paralyzed and his bank account leaked like an open wound the total number of oncerich fighters of the past halfcentury who have escaped the financial blight can be ticked off on the fingers of one arthritic hand the fact is charles an expert on the subject has neatly packaged the complete story by saying of himself i seem to have gone the way of all champions at the time he spoke charles was bereft of plush cincinnati home several businesses dozens of old friends and the gleaming cadillacs he used to drive but still possessed of a fine mind and a keen will to win he was fighting backholding down a promotional job with a wine company learning the wrestling profession manfully holding his family together always a man capable of turning the fetching word charles concluded i lay me down to bleed a whileand then rise to fight again the inability of boxers to hold onto their money earned through a rigorous expenditure of blood sweat and tears only slightly less horrifying than war between worlds composes the saddest sorriest most sickening story in sports the number of exfighters who once earned more money in a night than many workers earn in a lifetime only to end up as charity cases is legion conversely the number of negro boxing greats who retained their wealth from careers end all the way to the pearly gates hardly totals more than one celebrated casethat of the late harry wills jack dempseys chaser who amassed a considerable fortune and then carefully maintained it throughout his declining years to drop a few more names beau jack the lightweight who supposedly was protected by some of the finest minds in boxing traversed an unusual circular route from shoe shine stand to riches back to shoe shine stand when it was all over jack admittedly was no more knowledgeable of what had happened to his money than a preschool age kid who attempts a scholarly reply to that famous toothpaste query where did the yellow go joe louis financial difficulties are known throughout the world although joe who probably when i was dieting for fights virtually living on cups of tea charles continues my buddies were drinking scotch and eating steaks  on me i used to visit a place in cincinnati called the cotton club there were guys there who used to hit me for eight and nine dollars a day every day i think now that those guys must have been junkies some guys would borrow as much as  a day from me in a sense im glad that its all over now and i dont have to be bothered with that group anymore  because they were not for real joe louis sugar ray robinson ezzard charles jimmy carter beau jack and henry armstrong another member of the clan probably grossed as much as  million in boxing an incredible amount of money properly invested this money might well have been the foundation of enterprises now worth a billion dollars henry ford for one never possessed any such beginning bankroll but it is not entirely the fault of boxers that they are unable to manage money most of them gush up through solid bedrock of poverty into sudden fame and undreamedof riches the wise management of money as millionaire j paul getty has said is a talent that does not come easily fighters who have in most instances barely finished high school simply are not prepared to contemplate what all the money they earn so quickly means sudden wealth causes them  to lose equilibrium gives them a sense of power they cant handle makes them do foolhardy things busy fighting making personal appearances training and having fun they reserve little time to study such as banking or the stock market although many boxers do selfeducate themselves admirably in the basic economics of life the sad truth is that few fighters actually control their own money most of them notably excepting sugar ray robinson docilely take orders from others some are owned by individuals or syndicates managers may take as much as  per cent of the purses boxers earn v is the usual percentage a champion fighter must employ trainers rent training quarters and pay various other normal and abnormal expenses such as paddings called publicity by the time all the deducts are in the fighter finds that his oncehefty purse has been greatly decimated and then there are income taxes which constitute a vicious circle once a fighter has become delinquent for while he is fighting to pay off the pastdue bills he is piling new tax debts on the old unless he has hired reputable managers or accountants a fighter who earns a halfmillion or a million dollars in one year can easily fall into serious difficulty with the government once the treasury department held up a sugar ray robinson purse of several hundred thousand dollars louis tax bill the result jewelry and other socalled accoutrements of luxurious living of course if one is to be fair he must note that spendthrift boxers are no more egocentric nor hardly more careless with their funds than many of the nouveau riche of business or industry the basic difference however is that the boxer gets only one shot at riches he doesnt keep big money long enough to become truly accustomed to it what is the remedy for this disease of going broke which is so peculiar to boxers before an attempt is made to answer that question perhaps this point should be made most often it is the general public the fans who lament feeling the plight of oncerich boxers gone broke invariably the boxers themselves will tell you on reviewing their careers that if they had their lives to live over they wouldnt change a thing it sometimes seems that boxers dont expect to hang onto their money it comes easily and it goes easier many boxers live with the wild abandon of people who know the hellbomb is on the way and the bomb shelter is made of cardboard boxes nevertheless many concerned people suggest programs rules and regulations to protect the boxer and his money these suggestions usually begin from two points  the appointment of a federal boxing czar and  special income tax consideration for fighters this consideration to emphasize a payasyougo plan and special rates to equate taxes and the boxers short period of high earnings some of the suggestions advanced in recent years though wellintentioned probably would violate the civil_rights laws if put into practice in many cases the boxers themselves would have to be protected over their dead bodiesfor one seldom finds a rich champion who is humble enough to admit that he needs help in anything unless it is in an introduction to that pretty babe over there the rich boxing champion unfortunately is more apt to react in the manner of a wellknown fighter of a few years ago on being given unsolicited but undoubtedly sound advice by a sports writer who loved him like a son the rich champion turned a deaf ear a frigid shoulder and a pipinghot retort i dont tell you how to write do i
he sang for the angels
rtlesville is a small almost asleep southern town on the  mississippi river in the old days excursion boats used to sail up and down the mississippi carrying cotton on the way up and happy people on the way back i remember especially how the shouts and the music coming from the boats sounded like the distant revelry of remembered carnivals and i would run to the apple tree in our yarda splendidly arching tree on which i had nailed thin planks of wood for a ladderand i would climb up as high as i could to see the big white boats sailing brilliantly in the sunlight from one of those boats many years ago so people told me stepped charlie logan the boat was going north so charlie must have come from someplace further south although nobody ever knew where i first met charlie when i was nine years old while exploring the outskirts of the thenbustling little town where my father a methodist minister had just been assigned to a new church i was pedaling on my bicycle up a steel hill where the tall red and yellow hollyhocks allowed only brief glimpses of the mississippi below when i decided to stop for a better view completely enraptured by the wide panorama below i began walking toward the edge of the hill suddenly the ground gave way and i found myself clinging fearfully to a clump of thick grass on the edge of the hill i was too terrified to yell for help and as i began edging my way toward the top i imagined i could see my body slipping from the ledge and plummeting to the jagged rocks below suddenly in the midst of my struggling two dark arms darted down and strong hands lifted me upright i stared up into the dark smooth face of a man whose strangely laughing eyes and strong hands gave my shaking body mental and physical support it was charlie logan thank you i managed to say weakly my heart seemed as if it was pounding through my chest i glanced backward over the hill and quickly retreated from the treacherous edge towards my bicycle charlie gave a chuckle that sounded like a low rumble of thunder thats all right son he said youre a brave boy didnt even hear you cry for help shakily i mounted my bicycle and began coasting downhill almost at the bottonttt glaneed back briefly to see charlie standing like a muscular brown statue in his somewhat tattered shirt with a grin on his broad dark face somehow i still remember the way charlie looked then but years later i was to remember him looking altogether differently my mother and father met charlie about two days after my fearful experiencean experience about which i knowing the restrictive measures of my father and the fears of my mother refused to tell them we heard a knock on the door my mother in her friendliest and most melodious voice had called out just a minute as she quickly glanced in the hall mirror and patted her hair in place on her way to the door move your guns out of the way billy she said in a hushed voice to me on the floor then she opened the door and there flashing a broad whiteteethed grin was charlie are you the preachers wife maam charlie said yes wont you come in my mother said hesitatingly charlie looked down at me on the floor and grinned have a seat wont you my mother said pointing to a wooden chair near the door charlie immediately contented himself with talking to me howre you doing son he said lets see your guns over there iscooted around on my knees and dragged the gun from under the big padded sofa charlie had a strange pleased smile on his face when i handed him the gun and he stroked and patted it as if he was caressing a favorite pet he barely looked at my father who had just walked out of the room where he had been reading hello preacher charlie said still stroking the gun this heres a brave boy you got preacher charlie said poking the gun toward me fearfully i awaited what was to come but charlie didnt mention the neardisastrous incident he just continued to rub my air gun and talking more to himself it seemed than to my father and mother im gonna get a houseful of guns im gonna get me a trunkful of shells too charlie said one of these days theys going tbe a war between us colored people and them white people on white horses and im goin tbe ready the eyes of my mother and father met they looked back at charlie who began talking faster and louder i had a family once but they left me to go up north i had a son once too until those white people on white horses got him he never done nothin wrong preach er he never done nothin wrong but they beat him and they beat me lawd he didnt even cry preacher and those white people with those white sheets on jus laffed they wouldnt even let me help im charlie was almost crying now but he rambled on he said his family left him but he was glad that they were gone because those white people on white horses might try to kill them too he said he had a wife but she went to heaven shes gone where im goin tgo when i leave this world charlie said then he started to cry i had never seen such big tears before they dropped on the wooden polished floor and on charlies dusty shoes making mudspattered spots on the worn leather my mother said something soothing and patted charlie on his shoulders which seemed to be bent low with a heavy weight my father said well charlie gods going to make everything right after a few minutes charlie wiped his eyes and walked out without a word to my mother or father mom hes got my bb gun i whispered shhh my mother said but mom hes got my bb gun i screamed i started to run out to tell charlie to bring back my bb gun but my mother caught me at the door i clung to the screen door long enough to see charlie walking slowly down the street wiping his eyes with his forearm and carrying my air gun like a stick in one of his big hands charlie could sing real loud he would stand outside the small methodist church my father pastored until it was almost time to sing then he would march up to the front row of seats and sit down when the time came to sing charlie would sit up straight as a cigar store indian rear back his head and really sing after church he would walk to his home smiling to himself he wouldnt look back or talk to anyone he would keep on walking and smiling to himself until he got to his oneroom boxlike shack that was covered with red rubber shingles charlie told my father one day when dad was trying to tell him in a tactful way to sing more quietly that he was singing for the angels those angels in those shiny white robes gonna like the way i sing charlie said theys going to put in a good word for me to god gods probably too busy to hear me but he wants us people to raise up a joyful noise anyway my father gave up after that conversation nobody could learn much about charlie he never invited anyone to his home and if a stranger or visitor came to his place he always met them at the door charlie ran errands and worked around the yards and houses for the wealthy people in town they all liked him and at christmas time they would give him bushel basketsful of food and clothes but charlie never worked at one place for any length of time sometimes he would quit a job for no reason at all several times he was told not to come back to work but his white employers always talked fondly of him he was a good worker and many times charlies neighbors would see him returning from work late at night carrying some kind of a crooked stick in his hands the children of those wealthy people liked him too sometimes in the late afternoon or whenever charlie was coaxed long enough he would tell them stories everybody in the big houses knew where charlie and the kids were at those times because they could hear that deep throaty laughter of charlies accompanied by a chorus of childish laughter charlie would make the children tremble with fear when he told them ghost stories but he often made them laugh when he teased them about their pet cats and dogs he would feel the little cats body or the little puppys underside and say hes got some good ribs on him whens he goin tbe ready to eat the kids would laugh and tell him that nobody was going to eat their pet charlie would reply when he gets a little more meat on those ribs hes going to be just right for eatin but despite charlies fondness for the wealthy people and their children he would insist on saying that there was going to be a war between us and those white people on white horses some day my father once told him no charlie one of these days each person is going to accept the other as a brother and well never want to hurt the other again no they wont preacher you watch and see what i tell you charlie said one of these nights youre going to hear those white horses cornin and youre goin to see white people come out of the woods with sheets on and theyre goin to pull you outta your bed and beat you charlie began to talk louder and louder and his eyes seemed to grow bigger and he shook like he was cold you aint goin tbe able to do nuthin preacher but you got a brave boy here he said pointing to me when they start to grab holt of you hell start booming and hell keep going boom and boom and boom and calm down charlie calm down my father said nobodys going to hurt us thats just your you jus watch what i tell you preacher you jus watch what i tell you im telling you the truth you jus and charlie talking as he walkedto the earth under his feet would mouth his warnings all the way home nine years passed during which time my father was transferred to  other churches his new assignments were to take him far away from the mississippi and far away from charlie however we continued to hear from old friends who would write and tell us about how the church was going along with reasons they didnt like the new pastor one of them wrote that charlies still singing for the angels and added hes becoming harder to get along with here lately maybe its because hes getting up there in age three years later on my way back from the navy base where i was stationed my train stopped for a halfhour lay over at hartlesville i took the opportunity of renewing old friendships and surprising some of my fathers old members with my growth in the past  years wheres charlie the man who used to sing so loud i asked their expressions became almost solemn he lives the same place one of them said sister johnsons been with him since i dont have much time i said ill drop by to see him on my way to the station goodbye ill tell dad i saw you charlies house looked surprisingly smaller and more ragged than i had remembered it the loosened and fallen shingles left the little shack with a ragged checkerboard appearance i knocked on the door then pushed it inward at the response of a small voice inside as i blinked to get accustomed to the darkness i made out the form of an old lady sitting by a bed and in the small bed lay an old man with a large bony frame his face resembled a dried prune how are you charlie i said the question seemed somewhat strange for the old man laying there with the empty gaze aimed toward me was not the charlie i had so fondly remembered through the years do you remember me charlie i bent down closer to his face his watery eyes seemed sunken amidst his wrinkled skin whats wrong with charlie i asked the old woman the old woman just shook her head suddenly charlie looked toward the dark ceiling his eyes rolled and for the first time he seemed to be seeing he started to rise   y heah them angels is cornin he whispered hoarsely jus lak i toldja they would an singin even louder than i used to sing i grabbed charlies shoulders as he seemed to totter precariously on the bed and eased him back down the old lady just sat calmly and patted charlies arm and looked with meek concern into his face charlie seemed to breathe a deep sigh of relief as he lay motionless my eyes wandered from charlie and the rickety wooden bed to a dark corner near the window which afforded the only light in the dirty cluttered shack what i thought at first glance was thin cordwood stacked against the wall were guns and almost to one side stood my bb rifle from ever so long ago blue bright and shiny my gun  and all those others near the guns was a huge wooden trunk curious i walked over to it the lid was unlocked i lifted it and to my amazement saw boxes and boxes of shells and bullets of all kinds stacked to the very top and then i recalled charlies warnings of years ago i knew the purpose for which those guns and ammunition somehow had been collected by charlie through the years i knew they had meant death for those longremembered riders on white horses who dared not come while charlie was still alive on this earth and singing for the angels
the new negro saint
hen the  cardinals in rome approved the canonization of blessed martin de porres during the recent consistory presided over by pope juan xxiii a memorable event became part of church history this is the first time in the history of the roman catholic church that a latin american negro was elevated to sainthood and friar de porres also is the fourth latin american saint the others saint rose of lima peru st felipe de jesus of mexico and saint maria ana paredes de jesus of ecuador canonization of the new saint took place may  in the basilica of st peters in rome culminating the sanctification process which had been developing in tribunals of the holy see for the past  years friar martin was the son of juan de porres a young spanish knight and ana velazquez a mulatto of spanish father there is not much information about the mother but supposition is that she was a mexican slave of african origin juan de porres met ana velazquez in lima fell in love and made a home in a street named the holy spirit for a time ana was able to hide her mulatto background for she could pass as white and this deception was even practiced on her lover but when she was with child a halting confession was made as ana had feared her noble gentleman was highly disgusted or perhaps disillusioned fearing birth of a colored son this was exactly what happened and the newborn infant was taken from the house by a back door to the church of san sebastian where parish priest antonio polanco baptized the baby in the presence of two neighbors as son of an unknown father and ana velazquez with margin of document stating martin a natural son don juan de porres continued his relationships with ana who gave birth again this time to a daughter also black when the viceroy of peru commissioned de porres to a new post in guayaquil the father abandoned mother and children without any provisions for their maintenance however neighbors with more conscience aided the mother in rearing the children instructing them in religion  from the start young martin isolated himself from the other children preferring to stay for long periods within the grounds of the parish church from the age of two onward the darkness of martins skin grew more pronounced but the lad did not seem to mind this at all though it drew attention to him at seven he was charged with the care of his sister for whom he invented all sorts of ingenious games one day however de porres returned for his children alleging a great love for them taking them to guayaquil ecuador a key point in the spanish dominion of peru the youngsters were presented to captain diego de miranda chief of the spanish garrison and de porres confessed his alliance with ana and his decision to give a good education to the children as is the duty of a christian gentleman three years later de porres was named governor of panama then a province of peru leaving the young girl with his uncle de porres returned with the young martin to lima sought out his former mistress and delivered his son to her with the recommendation that she arrange for his confirmation and also his continued schooling the father selected the vocation of barber for his illegitimate son ana velazquez took her duties seriously placed her boy in a barber shop run by one known as mateo in the san lazaro district where there was a profusion of  homes of negroes huge haciendas and fragrant fruit orchards martins duties were to keep floors seats and mirrors clean and he was soon apprenticed to learn the intricacies of barbering he also acquired some knowledge of surgery and pharmaceuticals professions then allied with the barbers trade his teacher in the arts of medicine and surgery was the selfsame maestro mateo still a youngster in his teens martin began devoting much of his nights to prayer on his knees his arms stretched out face bathed with tears he got a reputation as a queer one in the district and decided to leave one day after mass he crossed the rimac river over a rickety wooden bridge made his way to the santo domingo convent and was granted an audience by the father superior to whom he confessed his desire to be a lay brother the dominican friar heading the convent looked with benevolent eyes on his humble supplicant and despite rulings at that time  not permitting acceptance within a monastery even for the choir of indians or mixed breeds to the fourth generation martin was permitted to stay the accepted convert brothers had all the rights of the dominican order whereas the lay brothers were without any rights considered terciaries and were tolerated as servants of honor who also had the advantages of a religious life lay brother martin passed many years doing menial tasks on his own request he sought out the most modest tasks served as a sort of slave of the brothers his devotion to the order was a silent unspoken one but one day when funds for maintenance of the convent were not increased with the prior hardpressed to make ends meet martin who considered himself a slave of religion offered himself to the prior saying sell this poor mulatto who is worth nothing here for he serves so badly those who treat him so well maybe if you sell me to a master who treats me badly i may learn to serve well to which the friar touched by martins offer replied go along friar for we have need of you here and god will provide the remedy for our situation martin served as a barber within the convent waited on table took care of the sick as well as sundry other duties and he always said his best reward was being in the company of the brothers and superiors so that he could sweep the floors over which their feet had tread one day martins father recently deposed from the governorship of panama by a change in viceroys came to the convent felt his pride wounded when he saw the humility in which his son lived the inferiority of his position and the menial tasks he had to perform the friar to calmthe aging father agreed to give martin at least the habits of a fully accredited monk in midmonth of october  friar martin was stricken by an intense fever which grew worse daily he asked for the last sacraments which were given to him with all the brothers of the convent surrounding his cot wax tapers in their hands the news of the friars illness spread and throngs from all walks of life came to the convent in a period of improvement friar martin even received the viceroy who prostrating himself before the sick man asked that when he passed on to the next life he should not forget to petition god for aid and to give a sign to the official so he could rule better on november  of  friar martin who had dedicated his life unselfishly to religion and to the welfare of his fellow man went to his eternal rest and now  years after his passing and after long years of sifting of the evidence as well as the ticklish issue of elevating a negro to sainthood his sanctity has been ratified on may  of this year blessed martin de porres was canonized by pope john xxiii in historic ceremonies in the vatican

the help of the selfappointed experts jazz has been manufacturing its own mausoleum for twenty years these experts gnashed and grieved at the lack of acceptance for the one true american art form since the acceptance finally came they have denounced it at every step flailing away at the network television shows musical prostitution deriding the major jazz festivals circuses  opposing every new attempt to bring the music into a mass medium for twenty years they bemoaned the relegation of jazz to cheap saloons and dance halls today instead of rejoicing at the profusion of national concerts and global tours they whine that too many acts are crowded into the shows and bemoan the low intellectual level of the audiences and the profit motives of the promoters for twenty years they complained that the giants in the field had earned pygmy recognition today the top jazzmen have been so glamourized and oversentimentalized by these same experts that a chorus blown by a nowdead artist while under the influence of sesame seeds taped on a home recorder in the basement of a bordello at  am evokes more learned analyses than the most brilliant work of a nationally popular bandleader taped in seventrack stereophonic high fidelity popularity of course is the sure road to excommunication among  these solemn seekers after a world they wish they had never found to qualify among the cognoscenti as a jazzman of consequence you need a an active rejection of the publics interest or preferably no public interest at all b a police record preferably for violation of the narcotics laws c an utter lack of concern for beauty of sound d a death certificate andor e a capacity for solemnity and the conviction that jazz is a deadly serious business this narrows the field neatly in a you have miles davis who turns his back on audiences and thelonious monk who seems unaware that they exist we wont go into the unhealthy details of b the constant newspaper headlines though slanted are basically factual chief contenders for c are ornette coleman john coltrane and sonny rollins in d charlie parker and lester young in e john lewis gunther schuller and a handful of other third stream jazzniks adding gerry mulligan and a couple more you find that this minute minority representing five per cent of the top jazz talent gathers more than fifty per cent of the nationalmagazine feature articles on jazz the rest are too popular too witty or too alive when bix beiderbecke flourished jelly roll morton had his red hot peppers venuti and lang their blue four and ellington his original cotton club band there too much for the slick boys from the slick sheets who have been trying for a dozen years to chase him back to canada leonard feather devoting an entire

for the handy duality of a jazz critic not too many years later a ferguson lp appeared with notes written byyou guessed itthe same mr feather it was mr feather too who found sidney bechets vibrato harsh and shrill yet was able to write fifteen hundred warm words on him for blue note records nat hentoff who once wrote in down beat    after thirteen years in jazz i know by now that if you say    maynard ferguson is the most tasteless overrated trumpet player this side of clyde mccoy somebody is going to get mad is a past master at the art of endorsement endorse of course means to write on the back as well as to give ones name or support to to sanction after notably failing to endorse the clarinetist buddy de franco often dismissing himnot without reasonas cold and unemotional of one de franco album the technique is swift and assured but not only is the playing decidedly chilly even de francos conception is disappointing there are clean almost diagrammatic patterns but what are they say ing hentoff nevertheless succeeded in endorsing him when he hentoff wrote the jacket notes for three of de francos verve lps noted for his gravely earnest dedication as a critic mr hentoff has written wordy endorsements of such major jazz figures as russ morgan for recent albums such as russ morgan at catalina mellow unhurried melodically clear music and morgan time spirited and yet graceful    sweeping and tender    glowing sensitive  rollicking   provocative  on the other hand he has come out fearlessly against the enemies of the true jazz for instance his constructive blanket statement that he is antiella fitzgerald was quoted in a recent issue of show business illustrated this is in line with his previously stated position reviewing a fitzgerald album for down beat he observed ella is excellent   the album  is thoroughly recommended because of ellashe floats with superb phrasing through the ballads and rocks the uptempos    ella of course deserves five stars if ella today were to team up with russ morgan perhaps hentoff would reverse his antiella fitzgerald position kiss and make up hentoffs soulbrother and coconsultant for the cbstv show the sound of jazz in  is whitney balliett currently a purveyor of jazz esoterica to the forty ish commuters who dig the new yorker who suffers from what appears to be a case of advanced onomatopoeia is it because you are a drummer manque whit old boy that you analyze your percussive betters in such terms as knicketyknack ticketythumpticktackthumpthump ping and swoosh or are you simply trying to make the magazines infatuation with sound of own coined words department in either case an english translation would be helpful balliett often is capable of realistic perception he once wrote bohemians law that true art originates only in the garret still operates to an astonishing degree in jazz when an occasional jazz musician breaks into the big time he immediately becomes suspect and often as not is dropped from all rolls of honor yet the same balliett has made this profound observation barring the blues and duke ellington jazz has never bothered its head much about content whether content here means size capacity matter dealt with or material contained to imply that fletcher henderson jelly roll morton eddie sauter sy oliver ralph burns or even pete rugolo ever lacked content is delicious sure and maugham wolfe wells shaw shakespeare and oflaherty never bothered their heads much about plot right another man the critics have done their best to bury since he began to please the public is dave brubeck who represents a deadend pseudomodernism for hentoff while feather confessed to an ambivalent reaction to the flood of publicity that has engulfed brubeck    how much closer is the tie between genuine jazz feeling and the modern jazz quartet ira gitler reviewing brubecks ingenious time out album suggested if brubeck wants to experiment with time let him not insult his audiences with such crashingbore devices  better still if he wants to experiment let him begin with trying some real jazz listen to any brubeck lp then to one of those third stream music concoctions in which john lewis submerges his modern jazzless quartet in a farrago of pseudocryptoneoquasiclassicalism all right gentlemen which one has the beat ironically this same thirdstream fusion was effected eleven years ago by stan kentons orchestra with writers like bob graettinger bill russo franklyn marks alongside whom the posturings of the john lewisgunther schuller clique are pretentiously pathetic yet hentoff said    kentons alleged innovations in jazz are a badly assimilated pastiche of the classical impressionists of a generation and more ago this criticism is more aptly applicable to schuller  co in the view of andre previn who observed   if somebody were to say that im imitating gunther schuller id quit the business martin williams perhaps the champion nit picker of the whole critical brotherhood he writes articles with titles like the funkyhard bop regression is capable of such a bon mot as thelonious monk is what no jazzman has ever been before him my italics still a legitimate innovator and experimenter after over fifteen years working directly with the materials of jazz    take a funkyhardbopregressive bow marty you just wrote ellington gillespie gil evans and lester young out of the party the case history of the aforementioned andre previn is a perfect example of critical hostility toward popularity versatility clean living a sense of humor and a lack of pomp all of which previn is unfortunate enough to claim he has been espoused by only three major critics ralph gleason who like previn is cursed with a sense of humor wilder hobson the level of whose critical values may be gauged by his explanation of the superiority of such bands as basies the answer may lie to some extent in the negro ganglia and leonard feather who can be discounted since he has supervised recording sessions for and has had a couple of his songs recorded by previn previn has all the wrong credentials he is a european white the  critics though not antiwhite have a tendency to be suspicious of nonnegro performers a former child prodigy a bestselling record artist a classical pianist who avoids mixing that part of his work with the rest a jazz pianist who enjoys playing a versatile writer who at nineteen was a composerconductor in the despised hollywood studios a producer of popular ugh songs one of which won an academy award nomination and winner of two oscars for the movie scores of gigi and porgy and bess he might have lived down two or three such handicaps but the tout ensemble makes him the persona least likely to be grata in all of jazz critical history why is popularity anathema to the pundits why are les mccann the most successful new pianist since peterson and a hirt the biggest new trumpeter since ferguson not even listed in the latest edition of feathers encyclopedia of jazz why is the immortal concert music of gershwin written off by hentoff as selfconsciously flatulent    sentimental instantly dated why does balliett find it trying work to listen to the delightfully unpretentious piano of ahmad jamal whose work is so much more broadly accepted than monks one key answer lies in the trend toward ugliness a factor now a part not merely of jazz but of the whole body of american popular art in which it has become a can cer velma west sykes who conducts the national screen council for box office a trade magazine for theatre exhibitors observed once beauty to the point of perfection was what the sculptor and the painter tried to portray now the grotesque the weird and the repulsively ugly are the rage among art critics    once stories were written about successful people    now the sharecropper the skidrow alcoholic the call girl the wealthy playboys and playgirls of loose morals are the folks you most often meet in current bestselling novels and plays miss sykess comments have a perfect parallel in jazz where once we heard the exquisite purity of johnny hodges alto we face the cacophony of an ornette coleman who rejects tone chords harmony and melody whose champions equate anarchy with progress coleman hawkins and ben websters tenor sax warmth gets nothing but occasional lip service from the yolktops whose tedious homilies are generally devoted to the rankling racket of john coltrane harry carneys rich full baritone sax has given way to the grainy schoolboy bleatings of gerry mulligan and todays new trumpeters lacking both the pure gold of armstrong and the brash brass of ferguson strive after the thin strained tones of the lesser beboppers as ralph j gleason once odserved john q square  is a lot hipper than hes been given credit for good music invariably rises to the surface stravinsky outlived his most virulent antagonists jelly roll mortons memory is unsullied despite the immature tirades of feather gershwins family can laugh off hentoff whose sarcasm can hardly erase the esteem in which the composer has been held for close to forty years lets remember too that cassals heifetz and horowitz were never criticized for paying too much attention to technique similarly the wellorganized creativity of ellington and kenton the genius of peterson the unique facility and versatility of previn and the rest of the reviled major talents of jazz will prevail simply because talent is a form of truth the real truths of jazz have a way of making themselves seen and heard and will continue to do so long after the cackle of the critics has sputtered its way to an inky inglorious coda 
what you should know about equal job rights
what exactly is the purpose of the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity the preamble of executive order  issued by president kennedy states the purpose clearly when it declares minus the whereas discrimination because of race creed color or national origin is contrary to the constitutional principles and policies of the united states it is the plain and positive obligation of the united states government to promote and ensure equal opportunity for all qualified persons without regard to race creed color or national origin employed or seeking employment with the federal government and on government contracts it is the policy of the executive branch of the government to encourage by positive measures equal opportunity for all qualified persons within the government it is in the general interest and welfare of the united states to promote its economy security and national defense through the most efficient and effective utilization of all available manpower the presidents committee was established by the president to carry out the above policy  who are the members of the committee and how were they chosen the officers and members of the committee were appointed by president kennedy when he signed executive order  on march   the president appointed vice president lyndon b johnson chairman secretary of labor arthur j goldberg vice chairman and assistant secretary of labor jerry r holleman executive vice chairman there are fourteen public members of the committee howard e butt jr corpus christi tex donald c cook new york the rt reverend monsignor george g higgins washington d c edgar kaiser oakland calif mrs mary lasker new york mrs marjorie mckenzie lawson washington d c fred lazarus jr cincinnati ohio george meany washington d c walter p reuther detroit mich the very reverend francis b sayre washington d c robert b troutman atlanta ga rabbi jacob joseph weinstein chicago ill john h wheeler durham n c howard b woods st louis mo there are eleven government members bernard l boutin administrator general services administration luther h hodges secretary of commerce robert f kennedy attorney general fred korth secretary of the navy john w macy jr chairman civil service commission robert s mcnamara secretary of defense abraham a ribicoff secretary of health education and welfare glenn t seaborg chairman atomic energy commission elvis j stahr jr secretary of the army james e webb administrator national aeronautics and space administration eugene m zuckert secretary of the air force  how does the individual citizen know which firms are oblu gated to abide by the presidents executive order forbidding racial discrimination in hiring there is no sure way for the individual citizen to determine whether a firm is a government contractor such information is a matter of general knowledge in a community insofar as many business firms are concerned but there is understandable lack of certainty as regards other firms particularly subcontractors there is no such thing as a master list of government contractors the number runs into the hundreds of thousands the presidents committee maintains a list of contractors subject to filing compliance reports from this list it can reply to inquiries asking whether specific companies are government contractors but it must be remembered that the list which is not complete at this time consists only of firms holding contracts of  or more and employing  or more persons since committee jurisdiction applies to contracts of  or more the compliance report list is far from a complete listing when a complaint of discrimination is filed with the committee the compliance report listing first is checked if the companys name does not appear on that list other procedures including telegraphic inquiry to the company are followed to determine whether the named company is a contractor locally the following means of identifying government contractors are probably the most certain  find out if he displays the we pledge equal employment opportunity poster on his bulletin board  look at recruitment advertising to see if he identifies himself as an equal opportunity employer  determine if the plant or company is a subsidiary of a company which is a known government contractor  put the direct question to the company as to whether it is a government contractor  how does the individual citizen go about filing a complaint when he feels he has been refused a job because of race he may file his complaint either with the government agency with which the company is doing business or he may file it directly with the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity washington  d c while the complaint may be filed in a letter in most instances a complainant fails to provide all necessary information when he writes a letter in such cases the committee replies to the letter by sending a complaint form with spaces and instructions for the necessary information complaint forms are available from the committee or from the contracting agencies a complaint may be filed by an individuals representative but must be signed by the complainant  who determines whether a firm is in fact discriminating against job applicants because of race first it should be pointed out that the committee is interested not only in job applicants but also in employees the equal employment opportunity clause in government contracts declares the contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race creed color or national origin the contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race creed color or national origin such action shall include but not be limited to the following employment upgrading demotion or transfer recruitment or recruitment advertising layoff or termination rates of pay or other forms of compensation and selection for training including apprenticeship the procedure followed by the committee provides for transmittal of the complaint to the contracting agency the agency investigates and reports its findings andor actions to the committee the committee may either accept or reject the agencys report the report may be sent back for further investigation or the committee may conduct a joint investigation with the agency or it may make its own investigation or require a full compliance review on the conclusion of the investigation the agency makes its decision as to whether there was discrimination subject to review of the committee staff and executive vice chairman the agency andor the committee sees to it that necessary corrective action is taken  in many parts of the country negroes have never been hired in other than menial jobs in factories and governmentconnected installations are these employers required to end their racial hiring practices each contract signed by the government and a contractor includes the sixpoint equal employment opportunity clause under this clause which is a provision of the contract the contractor is required to provide equal opportunity without regard to race creed color or national origin the mere signing of a contract clause of course does not insure performance each contracting agency in government is charged with responsibility for administration of its own contracts not only insofar as this clause is concerned but in all other areas of performance it goes without saying that there are varying degrees of performance under a contract as rapidly and as widely as possible the contracting agencies and the committee hope to achieve the fullest possible compliance with the equal opportunity contract clause in all sections of the country compliance includes the elimination of hiring policies based on race and treatment of all job applicants on an equal basis  does the committee ever step in of its own accord to persuade employers to hire negroes this question must be answered in two parts first the committee has authority to step in of its own accord to insist on equal employment opportunity when the executive order and contract clause are being violated but in general the regular procedure of referring such matters to the contracting agency is followed second it would be in error to say that the committee persuades employers to hire negroes the committee insists on merit employment without regard to race creed color or national origin this means that all qualified applicants must be given equal consideration for employment it also means employees must be given equal consideration for promotion upgrading transfer etc furthermore as required in the executive order and the contract clause the government contractor is required to take affirmative action to insure equal opportunity as a matter of fact of course insistence on equal opportunity results in opening job doors to negroes along with other minority groups who have been the victims of discrimination and experience has shown that affirmative action generally includes active recruitment of negroes and other minority group people by the companies  must there always he a case of reported discrimination before the committee steps in no the committee may act on its own motion or on the basis of information received as distinguished from formal complaints but the preferred methodand the most effectiveis on the basis of complaints moreover the caseload of complaints is so heavy that the limited staff and facilities available for investigation negotiation conciliation and review is fully utilized in handling them  does filing a complaint entail any fees or expenses for the complaining citizen no a complaint may be filed by letter or preferably on the complaint form provided by the committee while the complaint does not have to be notarized attention is called to the fact that the submission of false or fraudulent information is a federal offense subject to fine andor imprisonment  are firms covered hy the presidents executive order required to admit all applicants to their intraining programs they are required to treat all employees equally in all phases of employment including training all qualified applicants for intraining programs must be considered on an equal basis  what happens when an employer tells a job applicant that he cannot be hired because the union does not admit negroes by and large the employer who tells a job applicant this is not telling the truth although there are exceptions any applicant so informed is entitled to file a complaint with the committee it will be fully investigated and appropriate action taken it should be pointed out that in most instances management has an absolute hiring prerogative a right it has fought for and retained through the years in many cases the excuse given in the question is merely a means of putting the blame for not hiring on the union when in actual fact the union concerned has no control over hiring  does the presidents executive order apply to unions at all yes unions are specifically included in the executive order but it is recognized that the government does not have the same authority over unions that it has over contractors where a contractual obligation is written into the contract the committee is instructed in the executive order to use its best efforts to obtain cooperation of unions and is given authority to hold hearings concerning union policies and practices actually the committee has found national union leadership extremely cooperative as this is written the aflcio executive council is considering a program of union plans for fair practices in which unions will join with the committee in pledging and implementing equal opportunity without regard to race creed color or national origin some unions have insisted on inclusion of nondiscrimination clauses in their collective bargaining contracts and some have included such a provision in their apprenticetraining programs  how will the complaining citizen know that the president  s committee on equal employment opportunity has taken action on his case the committee advises the complainant that his complaint has been received and that investigation is being undertaken the investigator is required to contact the complainant to verify his complaint and to obtain any additional information he might be able to provide when the case is concluded the complainant is advised of the action taken  to date what percentage of complaints have resulted in breaking discriminatory practices by employers as of april   the committee had completed action on  cases not including  complaints in which the committee had no jurisdiction because the companies complained of did not have government contracts of those  cases  or  per cent resulted in corrective action  to date has any government contractor been denied further government business because of failure to comply with the presidents order as of april   no contractor had been barred from government contracts and no contracts had been cancelled the executive vice chairman of the committee did issue orders requiring the filing of special compliance reports by two companies before they could be awarded additional government contracts upon receipt of the special compliance reports the committee will decide whether additional steps should be taken to insure compliance similar action is pending in connection with other firms  has compliance with the presidents executive order opened up a significant number of jobs for negroes across the country there is no way to measure the number of jobs for negroes opened up as a result of the program the compliance report system which is just getting underway will provide some measure but not a compre hensive measure likewise the plans for progress reports from firms cooperating in that program will provide some measure but even taken together the two programs will be far from an accurate measure of what is happening in the employment of negroes  what percentage of major businesses in the u s have government contracts there is no accurate figure as to what percentage of businesses have government contracts it is safe to assume however that a big majority probably as many as of the major business firms in the country do business with the government either as contractors or suppliers  does the committee have any figures on the number of government contracting firms which hire no negroes in nonmenial jobs the compliance report system which has just been instituted by the committee will provide this information as well as other vital information about employment of negroes and other minority group people insofar as firms with  and over contracts and  or more employees are concerned  has the existence of the presidents executive order substantially increased job opportunities for negroes in the south is there a reason to expect that job opportunities for negroes will increase in the future as a direct consequence of the presidents executive order the word substantially is elastic and might be considered too broad for what has been accomplished to date although job opportunities have been opened to negroes in some plants and some areas of the south where they did not exist before as for the future the answer is a definite yes more and more doors to job opportunities will be opened as the program gathers momentum as more and more companies in more and more areas realize that this committee the agencies and this administration insist upon compliance with the executive order and the contract clause  how does the committee go about enforcing the presidents executive order barring discriminatory hiring a full answer to this question would be too lengthy for this occasion listed below are seven steps which were reported by the committee to the president in its report the first nine months which covered the committees work through midjanuary  copies of this report as well as committee literature are available without charge from the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity washington  d c the seven significant developments reported to the president were  every executive agency and some nonexecutive agencies of the federal government have taken affirmative steps to insure equal opportunity for all employees and applicants for employment  affirmative steps for insuring equal opportunity have been taken by a sizable number of business firms either through the plans for progress program or as the result of complaints filed with the committee  agencies are developing manpower capability for effective operation of affirmative action programs with government contractors  the compliance report system of the committee will provide for the first time information on minority group employment necessary for the development of affirmative programs on a broad scale  the committee has launched an educational and informational program aimed at developing greater incentive on the part of minority group persons to train for the fields of employment in which the doors are being openedor opened widerand to see to it that the training is available  programs of affirmative action in labor unions similar to and patterned after the plans for progress in industry are being developed  concrete steps are being taken to insure equal opportunity in apprenticeship and training programs and in government employment services 
a gift of song
first met paul laurence dunbar in a slim volume titled lil gal and read the poems of lowly life with much pleasure memorizing several of them there were tenderness and empathy in them humor and pathos i years later a friend quoted a stanza from a poem of his called when malindy sings fiddlin man jes stop his fiddlin lay his fiddle on de shef mockinbird quit tryin to whistle cause he jes so shamed hissef folks aplayin on de banjo draps dey fingahs on de strings bless yo soulfugits to move em when malindy sings i liked that so much i wanted to find out more about the author who had passed on in  and was surprised to find out that he was not from a southern state but had been bom in dayton ohio where then i wondered had he learned to express himself in the correct idiom and situations of his poems it was from his mother matilda dunbar who had been born in slavery and who told him stories in the limpid negro dialect of old kentucky i read his father joshua had also been a slave and the war between the north and the south had been ended only seven years when the baby boy was born lets call him paul said his father the bible says paul was a great man some day this boy will be great and do you honor and so he was named paul laurence dunbar laurence being the name of a family friend one wonders now if pauls father had the gift of prophecy because judging from where he started and what he succeeded in becoming he could be called great and he surely did do his mother honor his father did not live to share it pauls mother had learned to read and write and she taught both father and son when paul was only four years old his lessons began poetry was an especial love of matilda and she soon recognized the poetic gift that paul evidenced in his early boyhood and encouraged it in every way she could in both grammar and high school paul was liked for himself and recognized for his talent by his teachers and classmates in his senior year he was president of the literary society and editor of the school paper at graduation the only negro in his class he wrote the lyrics for the class song paul had high hopes then with his good scholastic record he would get a clerical position and be able to help his widowed mother so that she wouldnt need to work so hard his buoyancy was cruelly deflated because he was a negro nobody would hire him for office work he had to take a job as an elevator boy for four dollars a week he made the best of it continuing to scribble down verses at every opportunity his former classmates and teachers encouraged him in every way they could and his poems began to be printed in various newspapers when he was twenty he was asked to give the address of welcome to a meeting of the western association of writers this was really quite an honor and he made a very favorable impression on the assembled writers one of the members later quoted some of pauls verses in a newspaper article james whitcomb riley whom paul admired read it and wrote him praising the verses paul and his mother began to hope that his published verses might be issued in book form but they knew he would have to pay for the publishing himself how could he do that help came in the form of a loan and the enthusiastic help of his classmates the book oak and ivy appeared just before christmas  and within a couple of weeks paul was able to repay the loan now he began giving readings of his poems in different cities as will carleton james whitcomb riley and others were doing he was becoming well known as a poet but he and his mother were nearly penniless friends old and new came to his help again impressed by his courage and perseverance in  paul had another book of poems published majors and minors william dean howells the distinguished critic wrote a review of it in harpers weekly the copy containing the review came out on the poets birthday june   and as a result of the article orders for the book poured in and paul received over  letters of cordial appreciation his next book lyrics of lowly life was issued by a standard publisher and contained an introduction by william dean howells besides when malindy sings this book contained other favorites as ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes and ode to ethiopia a poem exalting his mother race reciting its wrongs praising its virtues and urging continued striving toward better things howells said that so far as he could remember paul dunbar was the only man of pure african blood and of american civilization to feel the negro life aesthetically and express it lyrically  a race which had come to this effect in any member of it had attained civilization in him and i permitted myself the imaginative prophecy that the hostilities and the prejudices which had so long constrained his race were destined to vanish in the arts that these were to be the final proof that god had made of one blood all nations of men dinners and receptions were given for him and after a visit to england where he met many distinguished persons paul was offered a position in the library of congress thus relieving him of the financial strain he was always feeling poetry as everyone knows brings in little money he had four novels published but they were inferior to his poetry i read a description of paul as he appeared at this timeof medium height with a lithe wellproportioned figure a resonant mellow voice and an appealing personality gentle and sincere if he had lived longer he might have gone to greater heights be cause he never ceased dreaming and learning some spoke of his writing as the beginning of a tradition others as the end of a regime with more years of personal experience in the slowly changing world as regards the negro race he might well have contributed more forthright expression of his own time but as dr w s scarborough said of him in his song he has helped pave the way for a future for his race he has hewn out a path    and what was possible in his case is possible for others his dayton home has been a shrine for over fifty years and in  a boy scout troop placed a bronze tablet at the entrance under the name of the poet laureate of his race is inscribed this verse from one of his poems because i had loved so dearly because i had loved so long god in his great compassion gave me a gift of song
si short story
in the summer of  charlie was my best friend we were in the same class in elementary school and we lived right next door to each other he in the first high stoop house from the comer and i in the second by standing on our backyard fire escapes and reaching out we could pass things to one another my mother came home late in the evening and my father never until much later so when i came in from school and my sister wasnt there to tell on me i would climb out on the fire escape and call to charlie to do this we each had a long string with a stone wrapped in cloth tied to it hanging from our fire escapes once when charlie had been mean to the lady under him she cut his string anyway to call to each other we would swing the stones so that they tapped the window the day of graduation from elementary school charlie was so excited when he came home that he almost broke my window when i climbed out on the fire escape he was there all dressed up in his blue suit with a tragic look on his face i thought you were dead he said why didnt you come to school i was sick i answered you dont look sick now    how was it i interrupted you didnt get left back did you of course i didnt you know what somebody said he continued they said your mama couldnt afford to buy you a new suit they were right you mean you missed graduation because you didnt have a new suit would you have gone if you didnt have one yeah he answered i guess youre right i probably wouldnt have    its all that stupid principals fault if he hadnt announced that everybody had to wear blue suits and all that this wouldnt have happened    then as an afterthought he added couldnt your mama afford to buy you a new suit i dont know i replied i guess not but i really didnt know we werent any poorer than charlies family and from the way mama had explained it when i had asked her i had been unable to figure out whether we could afford it or not she had said that the sunday suit i had was good enough for anybodys graduation and that if any of the other kids were getting new ones she hoped it was because they needed them when i tried to explain that it wasnt the other kids that i was thinking of but my teachers she looked at me real hard and said i know you dont want a new suit because the white man says so my principal says we should all  your principal huh a hundred boys sitting up there in blue suits may be the most important thing in the world to him but its not to me if how you look is all that counts then maybe youd better stay home but mama i cant stay home i cried then go in what you got i stared at her unable to believe this lack of understanding then turned and walked away i was sitting at the fire escape window indulging in a fantasy of how i would kill myself and she would have to buy the new suit to bury me in when i felt her come up behind me look here she said i want to talk to you i dragged myself around and saw her standing there wiping her hands in her apron honey she began softly a new suit isnt going to change you as far as the white man is concerned to him youll still be a little colored boy    that man she continued looking off out of the window is up there on a mountain and hell probably be up there all your life    but remember youre as good as he is new suit or no new suit tears began to run down my cheeks but i gave no sign of even noticing them she didnt understand me my own mother here she was talking about mountains and all i wanted was a new suit did you hear what i said the tears came faster and finally unable to ignore them i wiped my shirtsleeve across my face and blurted out all i want is a new suit just then the door opened and daddy came in when mama turned around i ran off i didnt tell charlie any of this that day on the fire escape and it wasnt until august that i realized what she meant in august charlie and i decided to visit columbia university we planned the trip one day in advance and the following morning arose very early and set out through momingside park which separated the valley where we lived from the area where the university lay the park a two block wide strip of trees grass rocks and sand rose steeply from momingside avenue to morningside heights its many planned paths and beaten trails having long since given up their secrets to us we crossed it rapidly pausing only twice once to cautiously inspect a man who was lying in the bushes we thought we had accidentally stumbled onto a murder but it turned out he was a drunk and the other time to throw stones at two dogs to prevent them from doing what we had been told would be injurious to their health at the top we rested in an oval from where we could look out over the whole of harlem it was bunched up it seemed between central park and the yankee stadium its old buildings spilling almost into the east river with cars and people filling the remaining spaces like black lava we tried to count all the parked cars we could see but after reaching two hundred we tired turned and headed toward the university we found ourselves in another world the buildings were tall and immaculate their polished brass fronts opening onto glistening tile floors which beckoned towards cool dark opulent depths awnings everywhere and the streets were large and clean the white granite faces of the buildings meeting the sidewalks in a line unbroken from comer to comer after two blocks we came to a sprawling group of buildings and charlie said this must be it know what i bet if we had been dressed up i bet that woman wouldnt have thought we robbed her yes she would have too i replied it wouldnt have made any difference how do you know it wouldnt have made any difference i almost told him what mama had said but changed my mind i just do thats all  i just do we stood looking at each other im sure he knew what i meant then two cats began fighting in the backyard we turned to watch and night fell

george lived in otterg ville illinois he was nineteen years old when his great good friend silas hamilton died the year was  silas was a physician and he had shown an affection for george that was to be reflected throughout the state of illinois for years to come at the bequest of silas a double crypt had been prepared and the vacant space was to be occupied by george who would one day be laid at the side of silas george looked longingly at the double grave when silas passed away he had no real family except silas he would just as soon go too now when silas will was read  was to be used for the construction of a primary school in otterville it was to be the first free school in the state of illinoisthree thousand dollars in cash was left to george having been taught the rudiments of book learning by silas george who was forty years younger than silas wanted from the beginning to pass along knowledge to others he realized a limited education could help a person only so far the thought of a school close enough to walk to fired his interest and although he was nearly twenty years old he decided to enroll the first day school opened the day came when he taught on many occasions in the hamilton primary school when the regular teacher was indisposed frugal by nature as well as by the example silas had set george put his  into savings with his small earnings as a farm hand he accumulated enough to purchase his own land he began to farm it and realized profits from it every year george became well versed in the bible he kept to himself a great deal studying and pondering when the otterville baptist church which was erected partly with georges funds was not visited by the circuit preacher it was george who stood in the pulpit and delivered the sunday sermon for a long time he had known the value of wholesomeness and as he looked back to the memories of his association with silas hamilton the person he knew best  it occurred to him that he would like to imitate silas most outstanding quality that characteristic of being rid of more pesky traits than the average human being the attribute most of all was the ignorance silas was so completely rid of status or social class did not mean anything to silas where his patients friends and neighbors were concerned he was without reluctance to actually love his brother the rid of george never forgot about silas was his definition of learningnot a means to an end unless the student knew the meaning of purpose to this day ottervilles population has not increased beyond the number of several hundred people but from early days of its settlement it was developed into a rich agricultural region george lived as a bachelor in the community honest and shrewd he was known as a good man but there was nothing about his everyday life that attracted attention no it was not when george lived that people gave much consideration to him except as a genial neighbor but when he died in april  the townspeople accorded a high tribute to him as they laid him to rest beside silas hamilton then came the reading of georges will and otterville friends realized most certainly now the love he held in his heart for others the community learned that  had been set aside for the erection of a monument in the memory of silas its people were privileged to see what is probably the only monument of its kind in the worlderected by a single man in memory of another individual he admired part of the inscription on the stone reads the monument stands today but another stipulation in georges will is the one that after  years is a living testimony of his profound feeling for humanity he left the residue or whatever may be left of the estate not otherwise appropriated to the education of qualified persons of jersey county of which otterville was a part the residue amounted to  a board of trustees was appointed to administer it it became the george washington educational fund was put in trust under the jurisdiction of the circuit court of jersey county and through its interest earning power increased to  within sixty years during the first fifty years so few applicants had come from students in jersey county the board of trustees decided to extend the limits of residence to the whole state of illinois sixtyeight years from the date of probation of george  washingtons will  students had been helped to a higher education a resident of illinois applying for financial assistance to further his education will be advised by the board of trustees that he must provide references of good character have a good scholastic standing and he or she must indicate what specific course of study he wishes to pursue what the letterhead george washington educational fund or its contents does not say is that the applicant must be a colored person or an american of african descent for george washington of otterville illinois was a negro and a christian freeman it has been mainly by word of mouth that scholars have the unique qualification of his will his legacy to aid others to follow him to be rid of the handicaps of ignorance has been realized in a way he could have hardly visualized r m warner jerseyville illinois present secretary of the fund reports that  students have been assisted up to this year  reflecting the higher general economic status of illinois negro residents in recent times mr warner points out for the last eight or ten years we have had very few requests for assistance he would not have presumed to substitute riddance as one of the three rs but george would be pleased to know how far his bounty has gone toward providing the substitution

i am a southerner i was bred in the south where my forefathers were slaveholders and    ¦ confederate soldiers i was born and raised in southern towns with their rigid racial patterns and their typical southern prejudice i was away from the south for a few years but i returned to live in the south by choice and intend to remain here for the rest of my life i love the south and its people i like having two black arms in my kitchen and two black legs pushing my lawn mower to help take the drudgery out of living for myself and my family and i like having them at a very minimum of cost to me i like choosing my own friends and associates and i like eating in pleasant places with well bred people of my own race class and status i like to worship in a church which is composed of my friends  and equals where i will be among my own group racially socially and intellectually i like for my children to go to school with their own kind and with other children of their own racial social and intellectual level i like for them to be shielded against poverty ignorance dirt and disease i like to practice medicine among intelligent cooperative people who understand what i am trying to do for them who are friends as well as patients and who pay their bills i like to live in a neighborhood composed of people of my own group who have pleasant well kept homes and where there is no conflict or strife i do not want my daughter to marry a negro i like the racial status quo i am a southerner but i am also a christian as a christian i must believe that god created all men and that all men are equal in the sight of god i must believe that all men are my brothers and are children of god and that i am my brothers keeper i must believe that jesus meant what he said when he commanded me to love my neighbor as myself and when he commanded me to do unto others as i would have them do unto me i must believe that the church is gods house and that it does not belong to me to the congregation of trinity presbyterian church or to the southern presbyterian church i must be lieve in the fellowship of all believers i am also a scientist and have devoted my life to the pursuit of objective truth therefore i must know that while there are individual differences among people there is no such thing as racial inferiority i must know that within every group there are individuals with different potentialities and that i cannot arbitrarily classify anyone on the basis of his race or color i must know that poverty and ignorance and isolationcall it segregation if you willbreed feelings of inferiority frustration resentment and despair and that these feelings in turn lead to misery to immorality and to crime which in turn not only depress the people and the groups involved but the community as a whole and the whole country therefore as a christian and as a scientist i am obligated to act on the basis of what i know and what i believe and not on the basis of what i like i must live by conviction and by conscience rather than by preference and by prejudice i must therefore regard every man rich or poor black or white as a child of god and as a person not as some kind of subhuman being or animal or even as an inferior i must try to see to it that every individual gets equal rights under the law and in politics this applies particularly to the right of equal justice in the courts and to the right of the exercise of political privilege that is the right to vote    i am obligated to pay a living wage to every man who works for me and to do my best to see that others do the same i must accord to every man the right to rise to the limit of his abilities in any job or profession and i must make every attempt to see that no man is blocked because of his race or social status if any individual of any race rises to a position equal to mine then i must accord to him the same privileges that i have and welcome him as an equal i must see to it that everyone has an opportunity for an education as good as my own children have if this means as the social scientists the courts and the negroes themselves believe that that education must be the same education as my children have then i must accept it and encourage it i must try to see to it that no man be humiliated and rejected because of his color if this means that the negro eats where i eat sits next to me in the theater or rides next to me in public transportation then i am obliged to accept it i must see to it that every man has an opportunity for a decent home and decent surroundings and if this means that he will live in my neighborhood or in the house next to mine then that is the way it must be if a negro wants to worship in my church or join my church then i am obligated to see to it that he is not only accepted but welcomed into that church even if it be trinity presbyterian church i must not be led by false pride to try to judge his motives for coming into that church    i i must try to overlook the selfish politicians who use the negro for their own ends the communist agitators who delight in stirring up i i racial strife the noisy aggressive negro who abuses his privileges i and who makes life unpleasant for me and even the negroes who exploit their own race i must even overlook such irrelevant questions as which race is the further developed which race pays the most taxes etc and remember the basic principles on which i am trying to act and in which i believe i must not only accept the efforts of the negro to achieve his legitimate aspirations but i must try to help him achieve them and i i believe that the church must do the same if it is a truly christian church i must do this even though it goes against my deepest prejudices and even though it threatens my superior and isolated position in the community and even though it entails the risk of intermarriage basically the problem is not one of what i like but what i know to be right i must not let my wishes determine my attitude toward my associates my school my church or even my own family but if i am true to the principles which i profess then i must act according to those principles this i believe

remarkable social experiment is being carried on in chicago these days one of the citys largest merchandising firms is hiring people with black skin for the same reason it hires people with white skin the reason is merit that is the person hired negro or white shows promise of being able to perform the work for which he has applied such a policy is known as fair employment practice and it is not news today any company that does business with the government is required to consider job applicants without respect to race religion or national origin but in the retailing business it is unusual in the first place retailers seldom come under the provisions of the fair employment practices commission legislation in the second place retailing by its nature requires the greatest possible exposure to an unpredictable buying public    and relatively few retailers have been willing to risk sales by asking white customers to buy their shoes or gloves from negro sales people even companies that do adhere to the fepc code have been slow to bring negroes and other minority group members into middle and upper management negro girls usually it seems lightskinned have been appearing more and more often as secretaries in the large corporations and negro men sometimes serve as foremen in manufacturing plants but the day when a negro will sit on the board of directors of a white firm still seems remote it is impossible to predict when a negro will be a director of carson pirie scott  company in chicago or indeed if a negro ever will however as a result of the companys adoption of a hiring on merit program the opportunity is there carsons is a company that employs  people in its  retail stores in metropolitan chicago and downstate illinois heading the companys operations as president and director is c virgil martin a fiftyish sixfooter with a firm but friendly manner and a conviction that ideals arent worth much until somebody puts them into action martins ideas on segregation of any kind are strong even though quietly expressed he grew up in bloomington illinois a community in which there were few negroes and few unreasoned fears perhaps this contributed to his easy acceptance of the idea that negroes and whites are basically equal his mother and father impressed that principle upon him and emphasized it by selecting a negro doctor to take care of him in his earliest years martin first encountered segregation when he took a job in another town to help pay his tuition through illinois wesleyan university he was working as assistant boys secretary at a ymca and found that the swimming pool was closed to negroes the boys secretarymy boss didnt even know when the rule had been made we talked about it and decided to break the barrier just by letting the negro boys in it caused a bit of a fuss on the part of a vocal minority but there was no real trouble martins concern with social values continued after his graduation from school he took his ab at illinois wesleyan and a masters degree in business administration from the university of chicago he went into social work as an administrator became executive director of the indianapolis community fund and in the midforties served as executive director of the new york city war fund organization by  when he joined carsons as general superintendent martins varied experience had added to his sense of social justice a knowledge of how things were accomplished in the business world the combination has served him well undoubtedly it helped lead to his selection in  as chairman of the illinois public aid commission which oversees the administration of  million in welfare funds each year in contrast to many business executives who regard public aid programs as throwaways martin views them as investments in people which if properly administered will pay dividends in the economic order as well as the social the story of how martin and carsons have been able to eliminate discriminatory hiring practices suggests that ideals can be a good deal more practical than many selfstyled realists would allow the story begins in  it was about that time that the first fepctype legislation was passed in new york state i was opposed to that legislation at first martin recalls it seemed to do nothing but solidify resistance to equal employment opportunities and lead to ingenious ways of avoiding compliance but as time went on without bringing any suggestions from the  leaders in the retailing business as to ways of improving hiring policies with respect to negroes and other minority groups carsons decided to design a program of its own before a government model could be forced on the company the first step was to obtain agreement from all members of top management that the act of discrimination was wrong in itself and that carsons should eliminate bias in hiring we debated this in our top management for a year and a half says martin all but one of the top men agreed that we should do something about the problem and we decided that we wouldnt move until he was sold nobody put any pressure on the man but as the months passed he began to feel like a heel now hes one of the most enthusiastic backers of our equal employment policy after the policy had been debated and approved the next question was that of approach sessions with negro and white backers of fair employment practices helped carsons management lay down some guide lines first we decided that there would be no publicity on the program martin says too many people try to make integration a drama next we agreed that we would not hire negroes for the traditional jobs    elevator operator porter that sort of thing the purpose of the program wasnt just to put negroes on the payroll but to give them a real chance at positions that were formerly closed to them martha douglas director of personnel activities for the company and one of the planners of the hiring on merit program remembers that management also had to define the nature and goals of the program very clearly some people think integration is running out and hiring lots of negroes that wasnt the point of the program at all hiring on merit meant that there would be no discrimination against minority groups it also meant that there would be no discrimination in their favor the first negro to join carsons under the new program came in as a member of the companys junior executive training team he began work as a tracer in the adjustment bureau within months the bureau manager asked if there were any more negroes available for assignment to his section carsons felt hiring on merit had passed its first test today  years after the program began there are very few levels of upper and middle management in which there are no negroes according to martin hiring is just the first step promotion is on merit also negroes serve as assistant department managers stock department supervisors credit and personnel interviewers interviewing both whites and negroes for jobs and charge accounts and as sales people on the floorsthe most sensitive areas of a department store the manager responsible for carsons downtown properties after hoursand that represents many millions of dollars says martinis a negro many negro supervisors have white subordinates  i sat in on a discussion yesterday at which a negro was being considered for a department managership hell be responsible for purchases promotions sales and profit on several lines of merchandise hell have a terrific psychological problem because he will be the first negro department manager says martin translating retailing titles into familiar terms id say hell face the same degree of difficulty that jackie robinson faced when he went into the majors there is as yet no negro in top titles into familiar terms id say ceived some nasty letters says management at carsons whether there will be is not a question of tolerance or of brotherhood but simply of business the first negro who serves as an officer will do so because he has more ability than his contemporaries this is one aspect of the thinking behind carsons employment policy the hiring on merit program is regarded by management not as a form of missionary activity but as a business policy from the beginning the successor failure of the program was not to be judged by the percentage of negroes employed by the firm nor by the volume of praise it brought the program would have to meet the same test as that applied to any program undertaken by the company did it help the business attain the end for which it was founded making money in a legitimate way one of the encouraging results of carsons hiring on merit policy is that it has proven to be good business after the first negro sales people appeared on the floor we received some nasty letters says martin all unsigned we also received hundreds of favorable letters signed from white people the favorable results of the program were not limited to expressions of approval from customers another was carsons discovery that it had tapped a pool of excellent workers who had been passed over because of prejudice or fear negro employees have proven themselves equal to whites and predictably more than equal in many cases the program has not been without snags of course carsons had to learn as it went along since the program was in the main a pioneer effort faulty interpretations of the program by supervisors as well as employees called for corrections negro workers were very well accepted by other employees from the beginning martha douglas remembers soon requisitions came to the employment department asking for negroes    the requisitions had become discriminatory then we had to explain to department managers that to favor any group defeated the purpose of employment on merit sometime it was negro employees who needed talking to occasionally we had sessions with negro workers to point out the difference between poor business deportment and discrimination a white lady who was rude to a negro sales girl wasnt necessarily a bigot perhaps she was just illmannered we also had to remind some negro associates that they would have to accept correction just as white employees did discipline was not the same as discrimination but despite the problems the company encountered as it enlarged the program carsons considers the hard business advantages alone have justified the work and the planning that went into the hiring on merit policy mrs douglas spoke for carsons management when she summarized the program for a group of midwestern retailers in this way we believe it is economically foolish even unwise business to exclude a large segment of the population from job opportunities the business today that does not employ minority groups cuts itself off from a valuable source of labor supply carsons is benefiting from this valuable source of labor supply but martin draws no comfort from the fact for the existence of such a large number of minds that are going to waste is due in his opinion to discrimination the negro college graduate is the most unemployed man in the country he says he spends time energy and money to develop his mind and talents and then finds that the only jobs open to him are as a truck driver or mechanic but the lack of opportunity resulting from discrimination has a more insidious effect than that of depriving negro college graduates of positions commensurate with their training for martin believes it discourages many young negroes from entering college at all or from improving their abilities in any way its a vicious circle he explains take away from any man worthwhile opportunities and you take away his incentive to develop the talents that would enable him qi to take advantage of opportunity when and if it comes the result martin has found is that the great bulk of negroes lack the basic skills necessary for any employment above the menial level this is not because negroes have less native ability than whites but because their color has forced upon them a future which holds little promise    and it is only future hopes that motivate present preparation the effects such a joyless horizon has upon young men and women of a minority group are well known police reports show that the incidence of assaults petty larcenies and the others in the melancholy catalog of melancholy crimes few really big crimes in order to embezzle a million dollars in this country youve got to be white is higher among negroes and puerto ricans than among other racial or national groups yet a recent comparison of the number of juvenile crimes committed in puerto rico and those committed in new york city by puerto ricans showed that delinquency soared among the young migrants to the land of opportunity the effects of discrimination and economic injustice toward the negro show too in current unemployment statistics financial columnist sylvia porter recently cited labor department statistics to back her statement that though our nonwhites make up  per cent of our work force    they account for  per cent in the longterm unemployed group another labor department report showed that in  the average negro earned only  per cent as much as the average white some commentators felt that this figure was cause for congratulations inasmuch as the figure for  was  per cent but as michael harrington wrote in commonweal july   at this rate the negro will not reach parity with the white man until some time well past the year   other indications of the negros attitude toward his white world are not expressed in numbers for example elementary school teachers say that when negro children are asked to draw a man and his family they usually produce a white family this is to be expected advertisers illustrators for the mass media and even doll manufacturers daily teach the children that most attractive people are white what can be done to change an economic system that again in harringtons words keeps the negro down and then uses the fact that the negro is on the bottom of the pile as an argument for keeping him there as a definition for what the negro naturally is there are two parts to this question the first is what can the negro do martin would advise a young negro to acquire professional skills law medicine accounting architectureand then go into industry he believes young negroes would do more to advance the position of their raceand ultimately their ownby entering white corporations rather than negro professional firms this might mean in the case of a young negro lawyer that he would be hidden in a back office preparing briefs for white lawyers to try it is hard advice but solving the problem of economic discrimination will call for real sacrifices the second part of the question is what can the wellmotivated white do to help the negro attain equality in the business world martin has no ready answer for this half of the question which is fitting in a way for he and his company are one

gup aunt clara git g  up big toms comp in a terrified voice ggaosji whispered into aunt claras ear as she lay sobbing face down in the dirt you goddamn goodfornothin nigger bellowed big tom the overseer of the plantation giving aunt clara a vicious kick git that swill to the hogs but aunt clara only buried her face deeper into the dirt she was trying desperately to shut out the memories of that terrifying afternoon a slave dealer had arrived at the plantation he had examined her four children richard mar garet elizabeth and palina pinching their firm young flesh and looking at their teeth after assuring himself he was getting his moneys worth he bought them for  each and dragged them away aunt clara was bom in january in  when she was three years old she was sold with her mother to ambrose smith she was married at eighteen and had four children when ambrose smith died all her children were sold aunt clara was then bought by george brown in kentucky when he died in  his children freed aunt clara the law in kentucky required slaves who were freed to leave the state within a year aunt clara was fiftyseven years old when she left the brown plantation for st louis she was a tall woman with a fine carriage sometimes her black eyes were gay sometimes tragic sometimes brooding in st louis she got a job as a cook and washwoman ever since her four children had been sold one dream had filled her life someday somehow she would find them and free them an exorbitant dream for an exslave who could neither read nor write she didnt have the slightest idea how she could accomplish this but with her hand in gods she knew she could do it aunt clara could not read the st louis newspapers but the crowds that jostled her in the streets could hadnt the rocky  mountain news in denver got out an extra on brown wrapping paper they had run out of regular print paper headlining the discovery of gold in gregory gulch in colorado thousands were leaving st louis each day for colorado in covered wagons drawn by oxen many of them didnt have the slightest idea of how gold was mined some thought a flat bottom boat with knives on the bottom of the boat was carried to the top of a mountain and then propelled down grade while the knives shaved off the gold as aunt clara listened to the stories of the gold rush she knew there would be plenty of work for her men would pay good wages for cooking and washing and she would save her money always her dream was before her to find her children who had been sold as slaves and to free them she heard of a big caravan leaving for colorado if the boss would take her her stove wash tubs and boards along she would cook for the men on the trip he snapped at her offer the wagons were heavily loaded thirty of them each drawn by six oxen the caravan crawled between the barren windswept peaks of the cruel rocky mountains through terrible gorges and across roaring mountain streams they could only do about two miles an hour naked bones marked a trail of death there were eight terrible weeks of sickness hardships and death they had no meat until they came across a herd of buffalo aunt clara was strong and lithe and as lean as a panther she worked from dawn into the night she comforted the sick and nursed the dying the smell of sweat from the oxen was incense to her suppose she was walking like mike ryan instead of riding in a caravan mike with a companion started out from st louis for colorado with a cart loaded with supplies while one pushed the other one pulled ryans companion gave out but he kept on alone a group of men also bound for the gold camps in colorado overtook ryan who was almost dead from exhaustion some of their oxen had died they offered ryan the job of looking after them he knew nothing whatsoever about oxen but he took the job after weeks of hardship and hunger they reached denver the oxen were almost dead and there was no feed for the starving animals with no time to lose quickwitted mike ryan baked great pones of bread from the flour in the covered wagons when they cooled he fed them to the oxen they devoured the bread and lived the caravan in which aunt clara traveled finally reached auraria colorado now denver after eight terrible weeks auraria was on cherry creek wooden sidewalks were raised a foot above the muddy streets spitsplashed prospectors pushed and jostled from one saloon to another it was a lusty flagrant mining camp with riches pouring into it from central city aunt claras destination was central city she left auraria the same day she arrived the tobacco juice of the driver of the stage coach landed square in the middle of the rump of a pawing grey horse and was the signal for the rearing six horses with a careening stage coach at their heels to start their wild breakneck trip from denver to central city aunt clara wildeyed and fearful clung for hours to the side of the stagecoach as it careened around dangerous hairpin curves and up narrow precipitous virginia canyon whose walls dropped a terrifying thousand feet as the driver of the stagecoach with a mighty flourish of his powerful hairy arms brought it to a sudden stop in central city aunt clara fell sprawled into the mud of eureka street men pushed and jostled each other to get a glimpse of the woman with the black skin where had she come from had she come all the way from africa what was central city coming to when the stage unloaded the likes of her with her old castiron stove and tubs which had been strapped to the top of the stagecoach aunt clara was the first of the colored race to reach the pikes peak region in the gold rush of  with her battered old cast iron stove and wash tubs she began to wash for the men hers was the first laundry in the new country now the miners could have their heavy sweaty shirts washed for fifty cents apiece instead of throwing them into the muddy streets to be fought over by mangy hungry dogs aunt clara worked far into the night her little cabin became a hospital and a refuge for the sick and poor she was a good nurse and was always the first on the scene when disaster struck in the mines one night a beautiful young girl in red tights was dancing in the gold dust saloon leathernecked tobaccosplashed prospectors threw gold dust in little bags on to the stage as she stooped to pick them up her red tights split the men howled and stomped and threw more gold dust the girl hadnt always been a dance hall girl in red tights confused and sobbing she ran out of the saloon and down the road to aunt claras cabin there there soothed aunt clara ill sew you up quick as a jiffy so aunt clara sewed up the split in the red tights drying her eyes the girl then went back to the gold dust saloon she was always on the lookout for people who needed help she lived a life of poverty often her meals were only sour dough and cured hog meat she was welcome in every shack whether catholic protestant jew or indian wigwam but she was never too much at home anywhere  aunt clara was a friend of columbine lily another dance hall girl one day blacksnake lachut walked into the saloon to order his favorite drink blackberry brandy with his long snake whip he cut off the button that held columbine lilys dress it dropped to the floor and columbine lilv was stark naked there was one place where she could run to in order to get away from blacksnake lachut that was aunt claras cabin down the road he wouldnt dare come there aunt clara wasnt shocked when columbine lily ran into her cabin without a stitch of clothes on she just pulled out her battered old trunk found some red calico and made columbine lily a dress within a year after gold was discovered in gregory gulch  men were camped on the sides of the rocky mountains and in the gulches men fought for the privilege of sleeping on the floors of the saloons packed with smelly humanity saloons and gambling houses ran full blast at night men in wide sombreros their woolen shirts open showing hairy chests with little visitors tangled in the hair roared down the dusty mountain trails to central city food was cooked over open fires flour was  a sack potatoes a dollar a pound and bad whiskey  cents a gulp there were no banks but many of the miners hid their gold dust and nuggets in aunt claras cabin one day a man couldnt get his oxen to cross a bridge over a swollen creek as aunt clara came close she heard him shouting oh lord if yell git me over the goddamn bridge ill never ask ye for another damn favor she helped him get across aunt claras business was prospering and her dream of searching for her children was nearing fulfillment it was aunt claras birthday and mike flaherty her old friend who had struck it rich gave aunt clara a gold watch mike couldnt tell time but neither could aunt clara the old prospectors in central city had a lot of fun asking her what time it was her black eyes would twinkle as she answered see fer yerselfthen yell know i aint lying to ye a young married couple arrived in central city from the eastv the people in the camp wanted to welcome them so they surrounded their cabin and began to serenade them but the bride and groom bolted

clara git aunt clara he shouted theyll open their door for her so aunt clara was sent for they unbolted the door for her and she explained to them all the folks wanted to do was to serenade them so then the groom invited the crowd into the cabin to meet his scared bride the serenaders prepared a feast and the merrymaking lasted all night aunt clara who had been quite a dancer in her day danced a jig while the fiddler played good ole turnip greens every sunday morning aunt clara went to church there were a few indians in the congregation the sun was beating down upon the tin roof and it was very hot the young minister talked on and on a young buck dozed off and dropped his gun it went off with visions of an indian uprising every man present jumped to his feet his hand reaching for his gun aunt clara was sitting up in front she stood up drawing her tall body up to its full height holding out her full skirt like it was a big apron she walked down the aisle as cool as a buckberry and demanded that every gun be dropped into it nobody argued with her they were all too glad she had thought so fast and perhaps averted a bloody massacre it hadnt been too long since the last indian

opera house to her where famous people from colorado have been similarly honored
do negroes lack courage to move to the suburbs
for four months i tried to sell our home in bostons outer suburbs to a negro family i have failed my white neighbors did not stop me i could not find a negro buyer this experience has shattered many of my illusions about negro housing when i began seeking a negro buyer in the spring of  i shared with many other whites a vague feeling of common guilt i had never personally discriminated against a negro but somehow i felt partially to blame for their situation deep down in my heart i believed i was at least partially to blame for the very bad housing which they had to live in now i have lost that feeling of guilt i no longer feel responsible for the negroes having to live in what amounts to a slum district in boston it is not the fault of my fellow whites that many negroes are in that district it is the fault of the negroes themselves most of them are afraid to leave the ghetto they know so well and move out into the strange territory that is now the white suburbs even today i find this hard to understand i can appreciate their psychological reasons for not moving out into the suburbs the ghetto is familiar to them in some ways it probably resembles a mothers wombit is warm and comfortableand gives one a feeling of security but in other ways it is very very hard to understand why mothers and fathers do not try harder to move out into the suburbs and give their children a better start in life it is not the lack of guidance or leadership that keeps todays negroes locked into bostons slums such guidance and leadership are present in fact i was amazed when i found out just how talented some of the negro leaders are in boston today take attorney walter c carrington for example this year old boston lawyer graduated from harvard college and harvard law  school since  he has been a member of the massachusetts commission against discrimination recently he submitted his resignation from this salaried post to accept an appointment as a mission chief in charge of  secondary school teachers in the infant african nation of sierra leone attorney carrington has sacrificed what could have been a potentially profitable private law practice to devote his life towards the betterment of his fellow colored people he is not alone in this task ill never forget how many devoted and enthusiastic whites and negroes whom i met during the four months i was trying to sell our home to a negro these devoted and energetic people are courageously trying to find more homes for negroes in bostons suburbs today you would be amazed to learn how many homes they have lined up and i think you would be as bitterly disappointed as i was when you come to realize how few negro families are willing to take advantage of these new opportunities opening up to them today our own home is just one example in the first part of  we were able to build a new home just a few miles away from our home of that time that meant we would have to sell our threebedroom ranch house in the suburban community of holliston i think it was the cuban invasion that made me decide to sell our home to a negro family the events during that invasionand the soul searching analysis of events and background motivations that followedcaused me to think deeply about our country i was conscious of the fact that the cuban invasion had failed partially because the world was not yet clear on just what america stands for we have always claimed to be the land of opportunity but deep in my heart i painfully suffered a guilty feeling a feeling that we were denying equal opportunity to negroes in this country together with our three young children my wife and i drove into bostons negro community what we found seemed almost like a new world but it was not the clean bright world of fresh air and sunshine that the puritans found when they first landed in boston in  we found instead a dirty noisy crowded worlda world almost exactly the opposite of the clean spacious suburb in which we were raising our children the streets were crowded with trucks automobiles and people we drove down the main street of the negro community block after block of dirty rundown threestory brick tenement buildings loomed up all around us torn weatherbeaten political posters stared down at us from lamp posts dirty brick walls empty store frontsa mocking reminder of bostons oftenmade but never kept political promises we drove past the secondhand furniture stores past the many poorlylit variety stores past the small loan company on the comer with its three discolored brass balls over the door and its big front window crammed with cheap jewelry old clothes and musical instruments and we turned into a side street a woman was leaning out a thirdfloor window shouting at her children playing on the street a push cart was at the curb and a tired little old man was making a sour face at a fat colored lady who insisted on squeezing the tomatoes before buying any a little boya darkskinned curlyhaired youngster about fourstarted to chase his ball onto the street a middleaged woman struggled to raise her bulky frame off the front stairs ran after him as fast as her tired legs would carry her and grabbed him by the ear she pulled him back to the steps clucking excitedly like a mother hen all the while this did not seem like a good place to raise children at the next intersection we turned and headed for home again as we drove back out of the negro section we couldnt help but notice that many of the people were fairly well dressed and quite a few of them seemed to own late model automobiles it seemed to us that there was money in the negro district what seemed to be lacking was opportunity to spend this money on suburban housing somehow this apparent lack of opportunity made our own good fortune seem almost unfair nine years ago we had very little ourselves i had married my childhood sweetheart in june  just three weeks after my high school graduation i was making  a week we moved into a threeroom second floor apartment this seemed like enough at first but in december of  our son was born and it no longer seemed like enough we wanted something better for our children for several months i worked at three jobs we accumulated a small nest egg in september of  i used it for my first semesters tuition at boston universitys college of business administrationevening division for seven years i had worked and studied studied and worked we had two daughters we needed more space in  we found a fiveroom firstfloor apartment and in  we were able to buy our first house a threebedroom ranch home in holliston i found a new job and in a year in which i graduated among the top seven in my classi was promoted to an assistant vice presidency now we were able to build our dream homea nineroom home on a large lot yards wide by  yards deep and covered with blueberry bushes and pine trees compared to the negro families we saw crowded into bostons ne gro ghetto we were doing nicely too nicely it seemed i couldnt help wondering could i have enjoyed such success if i had been colored and the answer seemed clearvery unlikely indeed this bitter realization soured the pride that had been growing within me it turned instead to shame and humility all my life i had believed deeply in the american dream i had developed a passionate devotion to the ideals expressed by thomas jefferson and until the cuban invasionand our drive through the negro ghettoi sincerely believed that my own success was a living proof that america was living up to jeffersons ideals what i had just seen seemed to me to be a shocking charge that americas equality of opportunity did not extend to people with colored skin i had read the words of jefferson many times they were burned deeply into my mind and heart and as i drove home that day his words came back to me clearly and sharply we hold these truths to be selfevidentthat all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness i could remember other things jefferson had said too such as no man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights of another    in europe the dignity of man is lost in arbitrary distinctions where the human species is classed into several stages of degradation    the american example has kindled feelings of right in the people and insurrection has begun of science talents and courage against rank and birth which have fallen into contempt  i agree that there is a natural aristocracy among men the grounds of this are virtue and talents    work and genius would thus be sought out from every condition of life the natural aristocracy of talents i consider as the most precious gift of nature       nobody wishes more than i do to see proofs that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to those of the other colors of men and that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence    but we must await with patience the workings of an overruling providence and hope that it is preparing the deliverance of these our suffering brethren when the measure of their tears shall be full coming when their groans shall have involved heaven itself in darkness doubtless a god of justice will awaken to their distress a just god i remembered only too well that abraham lincoln had said that those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under a just god cannot long retain it it seemed clear to me that boston was denying freedom to its negroesfreedom to live in good housingand i felt a shared sense of guilt in this deprivation i was about to taste the fruits of success myself and why had i had the opportunity to attain this success only because of those who in the past had created and preserved this opportunity i myself am only a third generation american but i am proud of my countrys tradition i have adopted its heritage as my heritage and i knew well what a major role boston had played in winning this heritage of freedom for america the mayflower compact was signed by the pilgrims at nearby plymouth this compacta sacred covenant of democracy sworn before godset the tone for the puritan founding at boston in  through the years this heritage has burned brightly in boston it was in boston that the first major resistance to the king of england began in the midseventeen hundreds it was the closing of the port of boston by an angry king that rallied the colonists together it was in boston that the colonial army under general george washington had first driven the british back out to sea and it was from boston that swift yankee clippers carried the american ideal to places as far away as the spanish isles of hawaii now americas fiftieth state i myself had benefited from this tradition of equal opportunity as i looked back i could remember clearly the many men who had generously helped me advance in my career with no thought of reward for themselves other than a good feeling that comes from such a brotherly act suddenly it seemed that all the favors that had been done to me had merely been loaned to me now it seemed to be my turn to return these favors to lend a helping hand to some other person driving home from the negro ghetto that day i talked it over with my wife and she agreed that we would make our home in the suburbs available to a family from bostons ghetto the problem of negro segregation was a very large problem it was a social problem a matter of social justice as an individual and a part of societyi felt individually and partially to blame for this problem i could not cure the problem by myself for i am only one man but i can do my part and i sincerely believed that if i did my part as an individual other individuals might be inspired or encouraged to do their part we reached holliston and drove through the center of town but then as we turned onto our own street i began to have doubts about my decision ours was a relatively quiet deadend road of about a  dozen almost new low cost ranch homes built on property next to a rolling green dairy farm the houses were inexpensive but well maintained our neighbors were young hardworking families many of them with young children we pulled into our own driveway our three youngsters spotted their playmates and piled out of the car running across our wide front lawn to the house next door as we watched them go it was only natural to wonder what it would be like when young negro children ran across that same front lawn to play with the children next door would they be acceptedor rebuffed they would have fresh air and sunshine and behind them a large rolling space of the dairy farm but would they have friends would the blessings of suburban living be more than offset by the absence of their old friends of the city how does one go about selling ones home to a negro should we go up and down the street ringing doorbells and ask their permission did we owe it to our neighbors to give them a veto over our decision we had decided to sell our home to a negro because of our concern for people we had never metthe negroes crowded into bostons ghetto did we not owe at least equal consideration to our friends and neighbors living on our own street believe me these are disturbing thoughts for a few days we kept our decision to ourselves i felt the need of discussing this matter with someone else before we actually placed our house for sale to a negro hesitantly i turned to our minister for guidance he seemed like the natural person to ask but there was one drawback our minister reverend james e turner of the community christian church was a southerner he was formerly from austin texas i wasnt at all sure of his feelings about negro segregation and thus i was pleasantly surprised by his reaction when i told him about our intention did he approve he most certainly did not only was this young exsoutherner strongly in favor of our intentions he has since become a member of the local fair housing committee himself but he enthusiastically volunteered to help us find a negro family i heard from reverend turner just a few days later he was so excited he couldnt wait until i got home that night he telephoned me at my office he told me he had just been advised by the massachusetts council of churches that the american society of friends would be the best place to find a negro family quickly i looked up the american society of friends in the greater boston telephone book i found their headquarters listed in cambridge appropriately enough the same community in which general george washington had assumed command of americas revolutionary army my hopes were soaring as i dialed the number as i heard the ringing on the line i had visions of learning that hundreds of negro families were waiting in line to find suburban homes in boston i remembered how desperately we had wanted a home in the outer suburbs for our own children and it seemed only natural that most negro parents in bostons colored ghetto would have the same desires for their children a woman answered the telephone i gave her my name and told her why i was calling can you help us find a negro family i asked yes she answered pleasantly she was sure that she could she gave me the name of a fair housing committee leader in framingham a large suburban city near our town she advised me to contact him directly she said that he was sure to have several families lined upjust waiting for homes to become available in our area and so it was with great hope and enthusiasm that i wrote a letter to this man i described our house and explained our motives for wanting to sell our home to a negro to make it absolutely plain that we were not trying to sell to a negro to get an abovethemarket price i suggested that any potential buyer call in an independent professional appraiser to determine the value of our home i said i would sell our house for whatever price this impartial expert decided was fair i also asked specifically if they had a negro family listed with them who  had small children who might most benefit from our dairy farm environment and  had worked hard to improve themselves like myself several of our neighbors had been combining both work and study what i wanted to offer to an individual boston negro was equality of opportunity in the truest sense i deeply believed that if one individual negro who had worked hard to better himself was rewarded in the same manner that a white man may expect other negroes from the ghetto would see this and be encouraged to try and improve themselves too i wrote that i had no idea how our neighbors would react to a negro family moving into our area but i thought it safest to expect the worst and hope for the best i suggested thatout of respect and deference to our neighborswe would like to sell to a negro family whose moral character had been proven i did not approve of discrimination in regard to negroes either for or against i still do believe that to give a man a special privilege because his skin is colored is just as much an insult as to deny him the same privilege because his skin is colored  in short i was applying the same standards to choosing a negro buyer as we would have applied to choosing a white buyer seeking a family that could benefit from our house and fit into the neighborhood with a minimum of disharmony i hoped that an educated hardworking negro family of good character would make such a good impression on our community and on the area that other opportunities would open up for additional individual negroes to buy homes in this area several days went by and i received no answer i began to get impatient work was proceeding rapidly on our new home we planned to move as soon as school closed for the summer and we wanted to line up a negro family immediately to be sure that their own children were able to enjoy a full summer of outer suburban living finally the answer arrived anxiously i ripped open the envelope i expected to find a list of negro buyers instead i found a letter praising our intention and stating that eminent sociologists agreed with our conclusions about the benefits of motivating negroes my blood began to boil i wasnt interested in eminent sociologists i was interested in helping some young negro children gain an opportunity to play in sunshine and fresh air this was the first hint i was to uncover that finding a negro buyer for our home was not to be an easy matter but i did not yet realize that the fault lay not in the white committees in the suburbs but in the city negroes themselves i incorrectly assumed that day that the local committee was inefficient and that dozens if not hundreds of negroes must be waiting anxiously for word of available suburban housing so i began again i drove in town to boston to personally seek a negro family i went to boston universitys housing department i asked them if they had any negro faculty members who were seeking suburban housing they said they did not i asked if they had any graduate students who were seeking suburban housing they said they did not do you have any graduates seeking suburban housing i asked they said they did not they were very friendly and encouraging but they did not have any negro buyers we tried the housing departments at massachusetts institute of technology and harvard universityacross the charles river in cambridgebut we had the same results there i was deeply disappointed i had heard so much about hardships encountered by negro students and instructors trying to find adequate suburban housing all of this wide publicity to the need for a fair housing and yet i could not find a single individual negro actually looking for a suburban home he month of may was drawing to a close soon schools would be closing negro children would be playing again in the crowded slum streets of bostons colored ghetto but what could i do i felt a strong social obligation but it did not extend to ringing every doorbell in the boston negro ghetto and asking the occupants if they would like to buy a house in the suburbs i i had worked hard to make my own way i expected negroesif they wanted equal opportunity to show equal initiative a few days later just as i was about to abandon my effort to find a negro buyer an article in the boston morning paper caught my eye the headline said housing aid vowed to negroes and the article said the eyes of the world are not alone on montgomery alabama or jackson mississippi an assembly of four hundred colored south end and roxbury residents were told last night they are on the cities of new england and boston in particular the article went on to tell of the proposed programs to rehabilitate the negro sections of boston and give that group its greatest opportunity and challenge and it added but this will require community cooperation and some sacrifice to succeed what was this i asked myself were the negroes trying to find suburban housing or werent they were they more interested in fixing up their homes in the ghetto my initial feelings of guilt and shame were now giving way to sorrow and even anger a picture with the article showed three of the leaders of bostons negro community i decided to call one of them up on the telephone i picked walter c carrington identified as a member of the massachusetts commission against discrimination i called him on the telephone i told him of my efforts to locate a negro buyer for my house i also mentioned that i had been specifically trying to find a particular negro family one which had made sincere efforts to improve itself there was a silence on the phone an awkward pause i could almost sense resentment building up in mr carrington he was very polite but he asked if perhaps i was not a bit unfair in trying to restrict the potential buyer to a certain type of negro was i he asked implying that all negroes were not entitled to fair housing i asked him if he had not sacrificed time and effort in his own personal selfdevelopment program if he had not worked hard and studied hard to get through harvard college and harvard law school yes he agreed he had i asked him arent you better able to lead your peoples battle for justice because of the long selfdevelopment program you have gone through his voice noticeably softened yes he answered now growing much more friendly and even enthusiastic i can see what you mean you are not trying to discriminate against some negroes but rather to reward effort on the part of negroes who show greater initiative i agreed and with that the ice was melted between us we had a long conversation he was very encouraging he suggested that since some time had elapsed since i had contacted the society of friends that i try them again he pointed out that with school closing several negro families might have just contacted the society and inquired about suburban housing i thanked him and did contact the society of friends again mr carrington proved to be right there were several families now listed the society gave me the names of several families and also referred me to a local area chairman i contacted that chairman i explained the situation to him he volunteered to contact the negroes on the list to get more personal information on them for me and find out which family might best fill the specifications i had in mind several days later he got in touch with me again he was discouraged families had not wished to commute to my community in the outer suburbs he said it was too far i grew very angry how could it be too far when i was commuting to boston daily myself and when a neighbor on my street commuted daily to revere on bostons north shore even further away i told him that it seemed to me that if any parent wanted his children to have good housing they should be willing to spend a little more time driving each day as i did and as most of my neighbors did he agreed but said it just did not seem to be so in the case of bostons negro families i wanted to make at least one more last try and was given the name of the fulltime coordinator of all twentyfour fair housing committees massachusetts is probably one of the leading states when it comes to legislation forbidding restrictive covenants on real estate i called this coordinator he too enthusiastically and sincerely tried to find a negro buyer for us but he could not there were none i could hardly believe my ears by now it was the middle of june schools were letting out our own new home was ready and we were about to move so far i had not told my neighbors about our twomonthlong effort to find a negro buyer now we decided to come out into the open with the matter i believed too deeply in what i was trying to do not to make at least one open and bald effort to find a negro buyer on the st of june  ran a large ad in the newspaper looking for a negro family we described our three bedroom ranch home with its large yard and its neighboring dairy farm and in large type we announced that this offer is open to everyone    regardless of race color or creed we got only one telephone call from a person who identified himself as being black we gave this person directions on how to find our house he sounded tremendously interested and said they would be there that night with the down payment deposit we waited he did not come but a delegation of our neighbors did i had expected such action they told me that one of our neighbors who was also moving had turned down a negro buyer at their urging i now understood why the black buyer had not shown up probably he had recognized the street decided he would not be welcome and had kept right ongoing what surprised me most of all  though was the very reasonable attitude of my neighbors there was absolutely no emotional reaction on their part they were coldly logical about the situation they explained that they were concerned that if a negro family moved in the value of their own property might drop i told them that studies had shown that negro residents over the longer term had practically no effect on real estate values whatsoever one of my next door neighbors said that he had heard the same thing but that one could never be sure of what might happen in an actual situation we shook hands all around and they left in a generally satisfied manner they told me they understood it was our house to do with as we wished but they had merely wished to make their own thoughts known to us i was really surprised i had expected threats of bricks tossed through the windows of our new home or the windows of our negro buyers this was typical of the surprises i encountered all during my efforts to find a negro buyer the whites were in many cases either enthusiastically for the project or at least reasonable and calm in their acceptance of it there was very little of the excited white agitation that i had been led to expect on the other hand there was apparently almost no initiative being shown by negro families trying to move out into the suburbs their condition seemed to be one of apathy if they wished to live in the ghetto i felt that was their business but i began to grow angry as i reflected on how i had been given such deep feelings of personally shared guilt over keeping them in the ghetto it appeared to me they were there of their own choicenot because whites had sealed them in we spent the summer in our new home i did not list our former home with a real estate broker we kept waiting waitingand hopingthat one of the fair housing groups would find a negro buyer for us the summer ticked away our large yard stood empty     on the th of august with department stores beginning to run backtoschool notices our hopes were finally smashed the fair housing committee contacted us and said that they still had no negro buyer lined up summer was gone and so were all our initial hopes and desires reluctantly we listed our house with local real estate brokers and decided to place it on the market we sold it to a white family our experiment in a personal effort to help establish social justice and brotherhood had failed not because of resistance by the whites but because of apathy by negroes it is hard to express the disappointment i feel over this situation i still sincerely believe that negroes should be entitled to equal opportunity and i still sincerely believe they must show equal courage i can understand their reluctance to move out herefor they will not be welcomed with open arms by all of the whites in this area but then the whites who first moved out into this area were not welcomed with open arms by the colored residents who then dominated the area our local history is rich with stories of white families who battled both indians and hunger in putting their roots down here these early new england colonists sought only new opportunity and they were willing to fight for it if the negroes want this opportunity they should be willing to fight for it too
