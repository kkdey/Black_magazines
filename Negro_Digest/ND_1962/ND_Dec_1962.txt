the habit of mediocrity
a student at one of a  our better known colf leges submitted a term  paper in american history several days before it was due the research content of the essay was reasonably thorough but the paper itself was hastily written and it contained a number of very obvious errors the professor suggested to the student that since the deadline for submitting the theme had not passed perhaps the student might want to do the paper over if the errors resulting from carelessness were corrected and a few minor points of information were clarified and expanded the paper might possibly merit an a otherwise c would be the highest grade the student could expect the student settled for the c he later explained that since c was an average grade he would see no reason why he should trouble himself with extra effort in trying to earn an a after all he concluded  c is passing a young couple i know has a teenaged son who at a very early age showed a high degree of talent be pigs in the house and anarchy in the streets is mediocrity good enough are we really satisfied with just getting by do we really appreciate the boorishness of our friends and do we really accept ourselves in the role of casual indifference in which we find ourselves so often cast we explain our shortcomings by reminding our critics that we are i only human and this handy little phrase has been used to excuse more gross ineptness and general lazinessmoral and otherwise than we are likely to admit one is never merely human for if being i human means anything at all it means that everyone is heir to possibilities which are in a very real sense unlimited you can be better than you are you can excel being human is not a license to be mediocre life has a way of rewarding those who meet it squarely and who are willing to work for its treasures life is selfenriching mediocrity can only beget mediocrity but the real treasures of living the worthwhileness of living may only be discovered and enjoyed if one is in search of something the scale of values you hold and the standards of excellence to which you subscribe determine in large measure whether your life will be rewarded with depth and meaning or whether it will be but a series of shallow episodes colorless and inane yes you can be better than you are but first you must kick the habit of mediocrity there never was a deadlier and more destructive drug
elizabeth keckley
the rash of memoirs t by white house servants recently in public print reminds us of a very unusual negro woman of almost a century ago who wrote a sensational book at the time entitled behind the scenes or thirty years a slave and four years in the white house this book was published in  and was authored by elizabeth hobbs keckley the book was suppressed by robert lincoln son of the martyred president but it was later reissued many of the facts that are known about mary todd lincoln are garnered from this modest literary endeavor of a former slave who rose to a position of trust and love in the first family of the tragic civil war period elizabeth keckley lived a life filled with romance and striking incidents her book invited criticism she portrayed the dark side of slavery and also its lighter moments she had kindhearted true friends in the south as well as in the north many charged that she wrote too freely in reference to mrs lincoln mrs lincoln by her acts forced herself into an unfavorable light she invited public criticismalthough she may have been judged too harshly at times people did not know of the secret history of her transactions mrs keckley stated if i have betrayed confidence in any thing i have published it has been to place mrs lincoln in a better light before the world a breach of trust  of this kind is always excusable mrs keckleys life was an eventful one she was born a slave in dinwiddie county virginia in the s she was the chattel of colonel a burwell who was an unstable master and moved with his slaves several times during the childhood of elizabeth at the age of four she was given the care of the infant daughter of the burwells she felt the cruel lash at this tender age for inadvertently dropping her charge on the floor this was not the last time she was to be whipped at the age of eight elizabeths father was separated from his family and was sold to a man going out west she never saw her father again however he wrote to his family in virginia at the age of  elizabeth went to live with her masters eldest son a presbyterian minister the minister was burdened with an invalid wife elizabeth did the work of three servants and yet was scolded and held in great distrust at  she moved to north carolina with the young couple in north carolina the burwells befriended the local schoolmaster a mr bingham mr bingham was a cruel hard man and a frequent visitor to the parsonage mrs burwell had always mistrusted the young slave and mr bingham became her ready tool of wreaking vengeance one evening as elizabeth was watching the baby mr bingham commanded her to follow him to the study he told her that he was going to flog her and demanded that she take down her dress the thunderstruck slave demanded to know the reason for the flogging she refused to do as the schoolmaster wished but she was overpowered this was the first of many whippings she received at his hands to break her proud spirit these revolting scenes created a great sensation and were the talk of the town when informed of the events the rev mr burwell promised that elizabeth would receive no further floggings savage efforts to subdue elizabeth were not the only difficulties she encountered she was regarded as a fairlooking woman and for four years a white man pursued her elizabeth considered this period frought with pain and she does not dwell too long on the events which led to her giving birth to a baby boyher only child she wrote if my poor boy ever suffered any humiliating pangs on account of birth he could not blame his mother for god knows that she did not wish to give him life he must blame the edicts of that society which deemed it no crime to undermine the virtue of girls in my then position elizabeth returned to the burwell family seat in virginia and was attached to the family of one of the daughters who moved to st louis in st louis elizabeth acquired something of a reputation as a seamstress and dressmaker the best ladies in st louis were her patrons and she never lacked for orders through her nimble thimble she was able to support her white owners however the strain undermined her health about this time a negro from virginia a mr keckley sought her hand in marriage she could not think of marriage as long as she was enslaved and sought to purchase her freedom and that of her son but her owners at first refused to consider it later however her owners reconsidered and set the price at   for elizabeth and her son she then consented to marriage assuming she could buy her freedom piecemeal  mr keckley proved to be dissipated and a burden further elizabeth discovered that he was a slave rather than a freeman as he had represented himself to be after eight years of marriage mrs keckley preferred that charity draw around him the mantle of silence many years passed and mrs keckley was unable to buy her freedom in the meantime her masters died and she was allowed to make further efforts to gain freedom six responsible men were persuaded to guarantee her return from new york city where she planned to journey to seek donations for purchasing her freedom several of her wealthy patrons learned of her planned trip to seek funds and raised the sum for her and the trip to the east was cancelled on august   proceedings began which culminated in the emancipation of elizabeth and george keckley five days later elizabeth considered the purchase money a loan and in a short while repaid her generous friends in  mrs keckley left st louis en route to baltimore maryland she tried to operate a school to teach her method of dressmaking to a group of young colored women but this venture was unsuccessful she left baltimore for the nations capital rooms were obtained in washington and she soon had a good business operating senator and mrs jefferson davis later to become president of the illfated con federate states of america arrived in washington at about the same time as elizabeth keckley elizabeth learned that mrs davis was seeking a modiste and elizabeth sought and won the position in this post elizabeth was close to the southern family and their cause secret meetings and discussions of war were held in her presence when the daviss prepared to move out of washington they sought to persuade mrs keckley to go with them but she preferred to cast her lot among the people of the north it is coincidental that in refusing to accompany the confederate first family to alabama mrs keckley remained in washington to become entangled in the affairs of the family of abraham lincoln several of mrs keckleys customers knew of her dream to work for the first lady in the white house one of mrs keckleys customers promised to recommend elizabeths services to mrs abraham lincoln who was a good friend of the customer the customer kept her word and elizabeth keckley was summoned to the white house with a nervous step she entered the presence of mrs lincoln a lady of about  years and inclined to stoutness she was interviewed and given the position over three other dressmakers who had also been recommended by other friends of mrs lincoln terms were satisfactorily arranged and thus began a relationship which would last throughout the lifetime of elizabeth keckley and mary todd lincoln mary todd lincoln was bom in  in lexington kentucky of distinguished ancestry and was reared amid genteel surroundings of the six surviving brothers and sisters four are said to have had abnormal personalities mary was carefully educated and in  she visited springfield illinois and two years later she made the illinois capital her home living with her sister favored by the prominence of her sisters family and aided by her own accomplishments she became a belle of the fashionable society and her acquaintance among people of political importance was extensive there are a number of stories surrounding the courtship of abraham lincoln and mary todd but on november   the pair was married after hasty preparations despite lincolns awkwardness they moved in the best of local society but in their home there was limited hospitality unfavorable things were said of their domestic life and even friends admitted that marys temperament was difficult her background and outlook differed markedly from those of her husband toward whose family she was unsympathetic within limitations of her temperament however she was a devoted wife and mother her reputation has suffered much from the ann rutledge legend and from the writings of herndon a law partner of lincolnwho wrote extensively on the lincolns but it is hard to believe that the lincoln home was as thoroughly as unhappy as herndon pictured it lincolns letters show an affectionate regard for his wife and a playful delight in their four sons during the presidency of her husband mrs lincoln gave special attention to levees and other social affairs for which mrs keckley was employed making suitable gowns a southern lady in the white house she was subjected to criticism much of which was gossip and malicious slander certainly the imputations of disloyalty were unfounded even the touches of social gayety with which she relieved the strain of wartime anxiety were criticized as inappropriate a short plump brunette mary lincoln had a certain formal beauty and was described as vivacious and apt in conversation accounts of her extravagance combined with penuriousness her interference in politics her irritable temper and her concealment of expenditures from her husband are too numerous and authoritative to be ignored but on the other side of the picture she was considered by some to be an agreeable mistress in the white house and a ministering friend to soldiers in washington hospitals no presidential family evoked so much curiosity and as soon as it was known that elizabeth was the modiste to mrs lincoln part ies crowded around and affected friendship hoping to induce the seamstress to betray the secrets of the domestic circle lizabeth as mrs lincoln called her became a close friend and confidante of the first family and her advice and suggestions were often sought as a trusted servant and friend mrs keckley described the tragic death of young willie lincoln who died in the white house she assisted mrs lincoln in caring for the youngster and she was exhausted when the end came but she was sent for immediately mrs keckley assisted in bathing and dressing the corpse she was a silent witness to the grief of abraham lincoln and she was a great comfort to the inconsolable grief of mrs lincoln who was so overwhelmed that she did not attend the funeral mrs keckley lost her own son about the same time leaving wilberforce university in ohio he had joined the army and gone to the battlefield and he was killed in missouri it was a sad blow to her and the kind letter of condolence that mrs lincoln wrote when she heard of the bereavement was full of golden words of comfort in the summer of  mrs keckley organized negroes of the capital into a group to raise funds for the relief of suffering soldiers the idea proved popular and in two weeks the contraband relief association numbered  workers armed with credentials elizabeth visited new york with mrs lincoln in the city she circulated among the colored people and got them interested in the idea she also started a group in boston while accompanying mrs lincoln to harvard to visit robert lincoln frederick douglass contributed funds and lectured for the groups foreign contributions were received and mrs keckley served as a national president for many years elizabeth joined in the turbulent period of the election leading up to abraham lincolns reelection and when many doubted his reelection she stood firm in her belief that he would succeed she was one of the first to congratulate him on his reelection elizabeth was given as a memento one of the gloves worn by lincoln at the inaugural reception many colored citizens wished to attend the reception but orders were issued not to admit them a member of congress enroute to the reception recognized frederick douglass on the outskirts of the crowd when the congressman was told of the restrictions on negro guests he received permission from lincoln to allow the admission of the famed orator and abolitionist when richmond fell in the spring of  elizabeth keckley was a member of the presidential party which traveled by boat to the once proud city in the senate chamber she sat in the seat sometimes occupied by jefferson davis she also had the chance to visit scenes of her childhood she described this trip as one of the most delightful of her life the fateful evening in april when lincoln was assassinated comprises an interesting chapter in mrs keckleys life she had been to the white house earlier to assist with mrs lincolns toilette at eleven oclock that evening she was awakened from her sleep to receive the information that the entire cabinet and lincoln had been murdered the news stunned her however she gathered her wits and went to the white house she learned that the dying president was not at the mansion and she could not learn where mrs lincoln was located the next morning a saddened nation learned of the death of lincoln and mrs lincoln sent for elizabeth to come immediately to the white house mrs lincoln scolded elizabeth for not coming sooner and it was learned that mrs lincoln had sent for her immediately after the shooting of her husband three messengers were unable to locate her home mrs lincoln was very exhausted from grief elizabeth was the only person who seemed able to comfort the widow she was also a tender consoling friend to the young sons of the lincolns for five weeks mrs lincoln was confined to her room and only allowed her loyal friend elizabeth to be with her they started to pack to leave the white house and this activity afforded some relief for the two sorrowing women in packing mrs lincoln gave away everything intimately connected with the president the articles were given to those who were regarded as the warmest of lincolns admirers the cloak of mrs lincolns stained with the presidents blood was given to elizabeth later she was to receive the comb and brush of the martyred lincoln at still a later date she donated these precious items in addition to the inaugural glove to wilberforce university in ohio which coincidentally was destroyed by fire on the same night as the assassination of the president mrs lincoln moved to chicago and faithful elizabeth accompanied her there after the family had been settled in illinois elizabeth returned to her occupation in washington she was offered the custom of the andrew johnson family now occupying the white house however she had no desire to continue to work for the first family mrs keckley continued to prosper in her profession meanwhile she entered into a correspondence with mrs lincoln which would last the rest of their lives in  mrs lincoln experienced financial troubles and she sought the advice of mrs keckley she wished to sell a portion of her extensive wardrobe for she had not received much assistance from the nation the women met in new  york and sought to sell the clothing anonymously the newspapers soon learned of the plans and the impoverished widow fled new york leaving elizabeth to salvage what she could the clothes were placed on exhibition and did not bring in much revenue attempts to sell the clothing also failed the venture proved so disastrous that mrs lincoln was unable to assist elizabeth with her expenses of staying in new york and elizabeth was compelled to take in sewing to pay her own way little is known about the later years of elizabeth keckley she continued to work at her chosen profession sometime after the publication of her book she served as director of domestic art at wilberforce university although mrs lincoln had promised to assist her financially these promises were never fulfilled as mrs lincoln was not able to do so as for mrs lincoln the death of tad in  left only one son a certain mental instability now became more pronounced and she was adjudged insane and spent some months in a private sanitarium at batavia illinois in  congress tardily granted her an annual pension of  this later was increased to  at which time an additional gift of  was voted after some years of foreign travel she spent her last clouded days in the home of a sister in springfield where she died of paralysis in

what the american new gro may need at this time as a status symbol is a continuous fictional hero there is a tendency among white citizens to take a longer look at black slum areas and at negro degradation than at the fine record of cultural and educational progress within this much maligned race it would seem timely therefore to introduce a negro hero of great character and poise who might fire the imaginations of black and white alike who would gently influence national opinion regarding the emergence of the negro masses from the aura of second class citizenship in the world of fiction all heroes are white cowboys soldiers detectives doctors lawyers scientists spacemen patriots rarely if ever sport a handsome black face rather the trend is to confront the reading or viewing public with a veritable giant of white male beauty with all the virtues one would expect in a god possibly without intention this tends to promote the image of white supremacy and what is more disturbing there would appear to be no plan at the present time to create noble and intelligent negro heroes in book or television play to balance this concept negroes continue to accept unimportant or derogatory roles as servants or straight men for the white heroes who win all the battles and display all the wisdom through it all the black man reflects brawn and quick reflex rather than brain and quick wit certainly the time has come to write a black superman into the literary scene of course we have a few negro actors and a number of negro characters in story form who have reached such prominence that one might question the need of a super hero sydney poitier has gained real stature on the screen while the inimitable sammy davis jr has appeared in a number of television plays as the lead figure and in a few movies in starring roles other negroes have been featured in novel or screenplay so that one cannot say unequivocally that impressive negro representation in fiction is nonexistent but the symbol characterization is still missing the roles enacted by the present cluster of colored stars are so varied that contact is lost by the public as soon as the vehicle in which each has starred has ended unlike the image of a perry mason a cheyenne a marshal dillon a doctor ben casey or a dr kildare the negro hero flashes like a meteor on the horizon brilliant but brief with the darkness of nonrecognition closing in at once behind his sparkling performance this does not mean nonrecognition in the sense of rejection but rather nonidentification with the negro upsurge into respectability and accomplishment the occasional drama such as sydney poitiers ramble in raisin in the sun can do little to erase from the minds of too many white persons the subconscious image of the black man as jungle creature with his bare feet churning the dust in a violent dance ritual unfortunately a number of young american negroes help to advance this association by their penchant for loud or brazen adornment and wearing apparel to counteract this reflection the negro needs a constant hero in story form or in a television series since television is a complicated business in the matter of programming perhaps the story form makes more sense at first a writer preferably negro but not necessarily should introduce a black fictional character in serial form who would carry the banner for his race so admirably that his impact upon the american public could not help but inspire respect and consideration the detective character would seem to hold greatest promise although there might be some arguments in favor of a great dusky doctor who would join the ranks of kildare and casey in serving mankind the detective choice however is strongest in this initial quest for recognition for the express reason that the detective story along with the western retains highest reader preference in america the dated western seems destined to remain in white hands since few negroes wore guns in anger during those roaring times but the detective is timeless furthermore few heroes enjoy the esteem of the sleuth who time and again will move through a maze of perplexing clues and dangerous situations to expose the villainous murderer we have instinctively learned to love the image of a philo vance a sherlock holmes the thin man ellery queen and lawyerdetective perry mason to name a few now is the time for a negro detective alert smart brave clean strong to become a household word he must be so  successful in crime detection that fictional white clients will clamor for his services without thought of skin pigmentation the black face of this new hero will not be a badge of inferiority it will become a symbol of honor and achievement he will never use dirty tactics nor will he be vulgar violent compromising his adventures must be the ultimate in plot and characterization so that his public will await each new episode with eagerness and impatience thus we have our status symbol can anyone doubt the influence which the great deeds of mr moto and charlie chan have had upon oriental respectability here is a minority race within this nation which has enjoyed virtual acceptance for many years one would be foolish to suggest that the oriental heroes of fiction were alone responsible for this agreeable development however the favorable light which glows from the brilliant derringdo of the likes of moto and chan cannot be refuted this amounts to a power of suggestion in which many readers bathing in deeds of courage and integrity find themselves cleansed to some degree of race prejudice thus in the negro world the advent of a colored fictional hero couid perceptibly plant the seeds of respect in a previously barren ground this would not mean a sudden and miraculous end to problems of discrimination there would be many hardcore individuals who would not be impressed by a fictional hero but by and large the subtle penetration into subconscious minds of favorable reaction to an idol might cause a number of persons to realize more vividly that the colored race in america is not a total abyss of ignorance squalor immorality and indolence of course there is frequent reference in magazines and newspapers to the large percentage of negroes who have risen above poverty to higher levels of accomplishment and refinement than have a surprising number of white citizens however this direct method of dispensing truth may not be as effective as the revelation by suggestion which would result from adoption by the public of a dashing hero there is nothing furtive in this approach the use of the word brainwashing which has acquired a scurrilous connotation within our society does not apply in this case we have here a simple desire to reflect truth to a public which has closed its eyes long enough to the struggle of a people to be acceptable and accepted in their own country and what exactly is the truth it is the realization by conscientious negro leaders that the black belts of population both north and south teem with a discouraging percentage of ignorant impoverished and unclean people who would not blend in even a middleclass white neighborhood the negro authorities are also aware of extensive white slum areas with their streams of human degradation though a much greater percentage of white population has reached superior cultural and intellectual levels those negroes who qualify under the standards of morality dignity intelligence and achievement should have equal billing there is no logical reason why the sudden appearance of an enlightened negro family in an all whiteupperclass area should cause pandemonium yet real estate values will drop legal battles will rage ostracism for the intrepid family is assured and in many instances broken windows or worse will reflect the angry mood of selfrighteous citizensthis in spite of the fact that the family which can afford to live in a pretentious settlement will have reached cultural and educational heights worthy of the neighborhood thus the only objection is black skin the standard by which all negroes continue to be judged that is why our fictional black detective or doctor or whatever should have his day with this recalcitrant public should he win no friends change no minds soften no attitudes blunt no windmills nothing will change for the worse if on the other hand the clouds of prejudice were to open just enough to admit one thin beam of the light of tolerance our negro fictional hero will have served mankind to the utmost
the urban ordeal of negroes
a discussion of the condition of negroes in american cities is concerned essentially with the problem of negroes in american civilization since more than seventenths of the negroes in the united states are city dwellers today until world war ii much of the thinking concerning the conditions of negroes in the united states was dominated by the mistaken assumption that the major problems of negroes  were those growing out of their position in the rural south while it is true that until world war i ninetenths of the negroes lived in the south and fourfifths of those in the south were in rural areas the majority of the negroes in the north have always lived in the cities in  when the first federal census was taken negroes constituted for example  per cent of the population of new york city and  per cent of the population of philadelphia since  the proportion of negroes in the north who live in cities has increased from  per cent to nearly  per cent at the same time negroes in the south have been migrating to cities with the result that somewhat more than half of the negroes in the south are in cities i before the civil war in the south as well as in the north where there were relatively few slaves free negroes were concentrated in cities in  for example there were  free negroes in new york city  in philadelphia  in baltimore  in richmond virginia  in charleston south carolina and  in new orleans louisiana after emancipation negroes migrated in large numbers to the cities of the north as well as of the south between  and  the negro population in fourteen southern cities increased  per cent as compared with an increase of  per cent in the white population of these same cities during this same period the negro population of eight northern cities increased  per cent during the next two decades  to  the movement of negroes to cities slowed down and as late as  nearly seventenths  per cent of urban negroes were in southern cities ii the urbanization of negroes during the twentieth century has followed a similar trend in the white population in the south the urbanization of the negro population closely paralleled that of the white increasing from less than  per cent in  to over  per cent in  between  and  a million negroes moved from rural areas to  southern cities with a population of  and over and into  towns and cities with populations ranging from  to  the movement of negroes to southern cities was inconspicuous and occurred at the same time as the mass migrations to the north which were replete with dramatic incidents and were directed principally to a few citiesnew york chicago philadelphia and detroit the mass migrations to northern cities which began during world war i and have continued to the present time have resulted in a shift in the negro population which has changed fundamentally the relation of negroes to american civilization there has been a change both in the numerical distribution and in the proportion of negroes in the population of the north and of the south at the opening of the present century  per cent of the negroes were in the south whereas today only  per cent are in the south  in  they constituted a third whereas at the present time they comprise only a fifth of the population of the south for  years negroes did not constitute more than  per cent of the population of the north and only one per cent of the population of the west at the present time the more than   negroes in the northern cities comprise about  per cent of the population of the north in new york city chicago philadelphia and detroit there is a total of  negroes in the  citiessix in the south seven in the north three border cities and one western citywith negro communities numbering  or more there are to be found today about  or a third of the negroes in the united states ill the pattern of settlement of negroes in american cities has always provided an index to their economic and social condition in urban areas from earliest times negroes have been concentrated in the slum areas of american cities this has been primarily the result of their poverty at the same time those who were economically betteroff and educated were able to escape to some extent from the slums in philadelphia it was noted as early as  that the more successful negroes tended to move to the periphery of the negro area or to escape from it altogether but on the whole the negro population has been concentrated in the slum areas especially in northern cities where the processes of ecological segregation in the expanding cities are most manifest therefore in considering the pattern of settlement of negroes in american cities it is necessary to recognize the differences between not only southern and northern but border cities as well in the older cities of the south the location of negroes was due largely to historical circumstances the location of the widelyscattered negro population in the older cities like charleston south caro lina and new orleans louisiana was the result of small negro settlements comprised mainly of servants which grew up close to the house of the whites in which the negroes served these patterns of settlement took root before the spatial pattern of the cities was affected by the economic forces which have shaped the pattern of modern american industrial and commercial cities therefore another pattern of settlement has appeared in the newer cities of the south where industry and commerce have determined their spatial pattern in these cities there are several large concentrations of negroes and the remainder of the negro population is scattered over a large area nevertheless in these larger cities of the south the majority of negroes are concentrated in the slums and blighted areas on the other hand in the larger northern cities negroes have always been more segregated within a small area than in the larger southern cities this has been due mainly to the operation of impersonal economic and social forces which has resulted in the segregation of other ethnic groups as well in slum areas the concentration of negroes in certain areas of border cities has been somewhat similar to their concentration in the larger southern cities with one important difference neither historical circumstances nor impersonal ecological processes have been decisive in determining their location with the result that it was in the border cities that the more important battles over residential segregation of negroes have been waged in view of the fact that negroes have been concentrated in the slums of american cities it would be expected that they would be housed in the worst dwellings as negroes moved into northern cities the ghettoes grew in size and became more crowded just before the united states entered world war ii the housing situation of the negro is indicated by the fact that about half of the negroes in northern cities lived in houses which needed major repairs or had serious plumbing deficiencies in  the increased earnings of negroes during the war years enabled them to demand better housing but private housing schemes even with government assistance did little to improve housing facilities for negroes in amer cities  klose negroes improvement in the housing of negroes appeared only when the federal government began to build lowcost housing projects and negro workers began to occupy these projects nevertheless these lowcost housing projects have been wholly inadequate to meet the housing needs of negroes in american cities then the problem of racial segregation in governmentsupported housing has been inevitable since racial segregation is inseparable from the negro ghettoes from all indications it is probably as true today as it was  years ago that a half of the negro population in american cities live in substandard dwelling quarters when negroes began to migrate to cities in large numbers it was believed that their high death rate in urban areas would soon eliminate them from the american scene but in the s with the declining death rates and an increase in the birth rate of urban negroes it appeared that they were improving their ability to survive in the city the improvement in the vitality of negroes in northern cities was much better than in southern cities of course the increase in the birth rate of negroes in cities was due to the movement of large numbers of negroes of childbearing age to cities on the other hand the greater improvement in the vitality of negroes in northern cities than in southern cities has been due to better welfare and health provisions professor hauser has made a significant contribution to the study of the differentials in the mortality of negroes and whites in cities  in a study of chicago it was revealed that economic status was an important factor in survival of both whites and negroes however among negroes of the lowest economic stratum   per cent of males as compared with  per cent of white males of the same economic stratum would die before  years of age while  per cent of the white females and  per cent of negro females of the same economic stratum would die before  the most recent materials on the fertility of negroes in cities indicate that the vitality of the urban negro population has improved during the past  or  years though it is still below that of whites this improvement is associated with the decline in infant mortality and in the proportion of childless couples who are the victims of venereal diseases and a decrease in various forms of family disorganization iv the migration of negroes to cities especially the cities of the north has accelerated the occupational differentiation of the negro population negroes have ceased to gain their living primarily from agriculture and have become an important element among industrial workers likewise they have become an important element in organized labor especially in the cioafl unions the most rapid and important changes in the occupational status of negroes have occurred in northern cities while in the cities of the south negro workers are still largely excluded from skilled and white collar occupations as the south has become industrialized white workers from rural areas are absorbed into the new industries  while negroes must live at a starvation wage in domestic service and in unskilled labor or are forced to migrate to northern cities this is due partly to the fact that in southern cities negroes have no political power while in northern cities they are able to exercise considerable political power and the color line in industry and commerce does not exist as in the south in many northern cities negroes have entered practically the same occupations as whites and in recent years their entrance into clerical and other white collar occupations has been especially significant moreover many negroes are employed in white collar and professional occupations and other public services by the municipalities then it should be added that many negroes are elected to public offices in northern cities on the other hand in the south practically all negroes in white collar occupations are restricted to the institutions of the negro community this has resulted in an important difference between the incomes of negroes in northern and southern cities according to the federal census figures for  for  all cities in the united states the median income of a white family was  and a negro family  and for unrelated white individuals  and unrelated negro individuals   but the difference between white and negro families and individuals was much greater in the south than in the north in southern cities the median income of white families and unrelated individuals was  while the median income of negro families and unrelated individuals was  in northern cities on the other hand the median income of white families and unrelated individuals was about  and that of negro families and unrelated individuals was between  and  the greater occupational differentiation of the negro population of northern cities and their higher incomes have made possible the emergence of a sizeable middle class in northern and western cities a conservative estimate indicates that  per cent of the negroes are able to maintain a middle class way of life while in southern cities only about  per cent of the negroes have incomes and education to maintain middle class standards in this connection it should be emphasized that in northern cities negroes have access to a standard american education to a larger extent than in southern cities and that there is more illiteracy among negroes in southern cities than in northern cities it has been mainly through education that negroes have achieved and continue to achieve social mobility the negro middle class which has emerged in recent years is composed mainly of salaried professional and white collar workers with a goodly number of the higher skilled workers the socalled negro business enterprises are insignificant both from the standpoint of employment of negroes and incomes moreover negroes are only beginning to secure employment as salaried professionals and white collar workers in industry and commerce yet the emergence of a negro middle class has created an important cleavage in negro communities in cities nowhere is this more evident than in the middle class negro neighborhoods that are emerging especially in the larger southern cities the movement of negroes to cities especially northern cities has been regarded as the second emancipation of the negro in a sense this has been true it has enabled them to escape to a large extent from the race prejudice and caste restrictions of the agricultural south it has enabled them to escape from domestic service and unskilled occupations and enter most of the same occupations as whites it has meant an increase in incomes and created a sizeable middle class all of these changes have been in response to changes in the economic and social organization of american life and as a consequence negroes have been faced with new problems in the competition of city life the majority of negroes have been confined to slums and forced to live in dwellings unfit for human habitation because of the lack of education and skills which are required by modern industry in which automation is becoming important large numbers of negroes are not only unemployed but unemployable therefore it is in the city that the masses of negroes with the added burden of racial discrimination are confronted with the frustrations of an industrial civilization many seek an escape from these frustrations in alcohol and in narcotics while others seek an escape in the numerous religious cults which range from spiritualism to a militant black nationalism thus it is in the cities that negroes are being subjected to the rigorous ordeal of american civilization the outcome of which no one can predict with certainty
stronghold of yoruba culture
the majority of the population of bahia state in brazil comprise people of african descent among whom traces of a longstanding yoruba influence are still clearly noticeable at salvador the capital city of the state of bahia vivid reminders of the african particularly the yoruba way of life are constantly met in every sphere of human activity for example in the field of the culinary arts one meets the inviting sight and appetising flavor of akara known here as acaraje as it is being fried in sizzling palm oil by bahian ladies on the pavements or in street corners all over the city other names of bahian foods which suggest african connections include arroz haussa mocoto which corresponds to the yoruba word mokoto that is stewed calves or pigs feet acaca which is also used in dahomey there are also various kinds of dishes which come under the classname muqueca a word used in lagos in the form of mukeke for referring to delicious savory dishes and the words feijao farofa mingau arroz doce canjica which travelled back to lagos with the return of the brazilians towards the end of the last century and with little or no orthographic change have become household words among the aguda of popo aguda that is the brazilians of catholic mission street igbosere road campos square and the environment sometimes referred to as the brazilian quarters these gentle but constant reminders of the african way of life are not confined to the culinary art they are visible in the religious observances of people of african descent in the placenames and other descriptive names of bahia in the womens hairdos and in the contributions already made by bahians themselves towards the production of a written literature in yoruba in the sphere of religion we have under general examples the different candombles that is the religious ceremonies of african origin held in various casas or centres scattered all over bahia where the gods of africa especially the yoruba gods sango oya  obatala ogun osun ososi and others are worshipped by bahian men and women who sing yoruba songs and dance to yoruba drumrhythms the principal candombles include that of the senhora at sao goncalo in the retiro district of the city where the yalorixa yoruba iyalorisa bears the yoruba name osunmuyiwa after the great river osun which flows between oshogbo and ilesha in nigeria at the candomble at rua luiz anselmo in the matatu district the yalorixa is olga alaketo named after alaketu the king of ketu in dahomey whose ancestor was the first alaketu one of the seven grandsons of oduduwa and at avenida vasco da gama there is the candomble oxumare a name which recalls osumare the yoruba name for the rainbow in addition the egungun cult is very much alive in bahia on the island of itaparica on the other side of the bay the egungun rites are regularly performed they even have an alagba the title held by the head of the egungun cult in every yoruba town examples of contributions already made by bahians to the production of a written literature in yoruba include introducao ao estudo gramatical da lingua yoruba by professor edson nunes da silva who has himself recently visited nigeria and yoruba tal qual se fala by sr deoscroedes maximiliano dos santos son of senhora osunmuyiwa from this brief description of yoruba associations in bahia it is not difficult to understand why yoruba was chosen as the first african language to be taught at the university of bahias centre de estudosafroorientais on the invitation of the director of the centre i came to bahia in august  to open the first course the foundation class which is held in the evenings is attended mainly by men and women of african descent who are working as teachers doctors businessmen and clerks the first anniversary of nigerias independence coincided with the completion of the first year of the yoruba course as the students had been practising a play oduduwa ati awon omo re oduduwa and his children i encouraged them to stage the play as a contribution towards our celebrations of the anniversary the support that i received from the director and the entire staff of the centre was superb the school theatre was placed at our disposal and the centres photographer designer and stage manager as well as the university choir all rallied round to give every ounce of the assistance needed working far into the night during rehearsals everybody seemed bent on making our show the best of its kind the afternoons performance opened with a brief summary of nigerias centurylong progress under british rule from the status of a crown colony to that of a sovereign state this was followed by my own personal anniversary greetings struck on the talking drum while the drum beats were translated into yoruba sentences by sr luiz sergio barbosa a member of the yoruba class and the yoruba sentences translated into portuguese by dr olga lydia da conceicao a lady member of the class then there was a short speech of welcome in portuguese and yoruba by professor taurino eduardio topazio sauze another member of the class the audience then heard a selection of nigerian music and accompanied by a commentary oduduwa ati awon omo re finally came a rendering in a magnificent style of nigerias national anthem the highlight of the days show was the play oduduwa ati awon omo re the reason is not difficult to find for this was probably the first time in history that an african play had been staged in bahia by bahians wearing african costumes and speaking an african language the colored yoruba robes i had carried from nigeria to london and from london to bahia but all the white robes were sewn here with local materials by brazilian tailors who borrowed my own white robes and used them as models i was particularly intrigued with the embroidery on the agbadas because while the nigerian tailors who made my own agbada kept strictly to convention using silk thread of only one color for each agbada the brazilian tailors sometimes boldly departed from this convention using threads of two or three different colors the colors blended so beautifully that i came to like the braziliansewn agbadas better than my own
i was there for six months and saw practically all of africa i did not of course go to south africa i felt i would not have been welcome there but from nigeria i went to senegal the ivory coast to liberia ghana sierra leone uganda tanganyika kenya southern rhodesia tell us about some of the universities you visited i spent most of my time in contact with university people students and members of the faculty of course i also had associations with nonuniversity people a few politicians a good many professional writers and others the university system in africa differs considerably from ours the secondary school course is five years and the university course three years upon completion of this a baccalaureate degree is awarded is this applicable only to the english speaking countries no this is true also in the french speaking universities dakar for instance and the university college of the ivory coast you were in africa fortuitously at the time of the writers conference held at makerere university college in kampala uganda tell us about that from where i sat at this conference it was very successful it was surprisingly successful the one african writer of some reputation in this part of the world who was not there was amos tutuola the author of the palm wine drinkard he is not a young man and the eight hours flight from lagos to kampala would have been pretty hard on him but all the others were there chinua achebe the nigerian novelist wole soyinka the nigerian poet and playwright john pepper clark also from nigeria arthur drayton from trinidad yemi lijadu from nigeriathey were all thereand a brighter group a more intense and exciting group ive never seen langston hughes was there too and did a very representative job in presenting the problems which american writers face the problems which in some instances were similar to the problems being faced by the african writers several problems peculiar to themselves seemed to exercise the african writers first of all the problem of a second language a problem which american negro writersamerican writers in generalcertainly do not have they worried as to whether as africans they would express in english what they call the african personality after a stimulating discussion on this subject the tentative conclusion reached by the conferees was that whether they wrote in their native tongue or in the english language depended on the audience they wished to reach were there any french speaking writers present yes and those who write in the french language did not seem to have the same problems at least they didnt acknowledge having the same problems i think this is so simply because french colonial policy differed radically from that of the english the french said we will assimilate these people and although this was probably only a saying it had its effect on the africans who write in the french language they seem to feel that french is their language it is not a second language with them at all as you know for instance president leopold senghor of senegal who is a poet and philosopher as well as a statesmanwrites only in the french language would it then be your impression that far from regarding this as an impediment they regard the use of the french language as being an asset in creative expression oh yes they are very proud of the french language senghor believes and rightly i suppose from his point of view that the french language is the only language and so far as i am concerned he has expressed in the french language the african personality what about your own participation in the conference i must tell you that african publications have mentioned you as a prominent participant i was asked to keynote the conference and i spoke on the writer communication and response this was on saturday on the following wednesday langston hughes and i shared the platform and talked to the writers about those problems which american writersparticularly american negro writersface in the belief that the problems which americans face are in some instances similar to the problems they were facing for the most part we talked about problems of practical concern what does one do about finding a publisher does one employ an agent what does one do about publicity  i hope the discussion we carried on was helpfulsome of the participants indicated it waswell i hope it was to what particularly were you addressing yourself in your keynote speech to the writers commitment i indicated that the writer to be a really serious writer had to be sincerely committed to something i tried to indicate that it did not matter very much what the nature of his commitment was some writers for instance have been committed to nihilism which is from my point of view completely untenable but their commitment has been sincere and they have certainly lighted up for some of us an aspect of life and living and the world which has been helpful another point that i tried to make was that writing after all in addition to being an art is a craft and that one has to learn his craft there is no such thing as being a primitive if you are a writer primitivism is in fact a negation of craft i got some argument on this point particularly in regard to the work of amos tutuola who is probably a much better craftsman than his work seems to establish did you find in the dialogue among african writers the pursuit of the same question that american negro writers often probe shall the african writer write about colonialism independence ie protest works  or shall he just write as any other writer this came up in the conference and there was a very definite division  must point out that the discussion of what the new african writers material should be was definitely tied up with the business of the second language there were those who said that the african writer in addressing himself to a nonafrican audience must engage in protest there were others who felt that the african writer should forget the nonafrican audience and write for his own people in which case his effort should be spent on building on the very great and rich oral tradition in african literature and some writers are doing the latter some of the most successful writers and some of the most talented writers like wole soyinka and john pepper clark are examples some of the other writers also talented like achebe and cyprian ekwensi are doing the other thing but in neither of the latter is protest so apparent that one feels as one reads oh this guy is just protesting their works impress me as being delineations of what is happening to them and explanations of why it is happening to them what about the african writers evaluation of their own work at the conference they were pretty tough on one another tough in the hope of promoting competence skill tough because they did not want the world to say that this that or the other piece of writing is a good job for africans so they tended to tear each other apart not in any spirit of nastiness but in the spirit of help i was particularly struck by this because some of the more established writers like ezekiel mphahlele like bloke modisanewhich leads me to say something about south african writers in a moment caught the devil and they took it in very good spirit as a matter of fact on about the fifth day the conference converted itself into a critical workshop this was very good hat was said about the south african writers the south african writers are i think in the deepest of quandaries most of them who were there are exiles living principally in england they want to appeal to the african audience in south africa hut they have trouble with censorship some of them are afraid that if they say what is in their hearts reprisals will he made against their families in south africa it is a serious problem which they face a problem with which it was my impression the other writers there could not possibly deal because theyre not in the same situation and do not really comprehendwho does comprehend whats going on in south africa these days regarding your remark about the writers being extraordinarily selfcritical what did they think was their present status in the literary world some of the writers at the conference are people whose reputations are more or less made in the rest of the world they felt nevertheless that such appeal as they have had may be an appeal based on the wrong reasons they are afraid of the probability that they are read in europe and the united states simply because they are new voices and not because they have anything important to say and they wish to avoid this they want to he read because they have something important to say in these new times was there an opinion expressed about doing works particularly dramatic works in african languages so that local groups might more easily perform them no there was not a discussion touching upon this did come up the drama group at the university college ibadan did an adaptation of shakespeares the taming of the shrew in pidgin english this disturbed some of the delegates to the conference for reasons which i can perfectly well understand before i knew anything about this performance i had made the remark at ibadan that pidgin english was to the british idiom what negro dialect was to the american idiom i went on to explain that dialect speech represented an early effort on the part of negro slaves to master the english language and was therefore legitimate and good since those days however it has become an element in the denigration of the american negro his capacity his ability to master a difficult language it has meant his assumption of ideas and expressions which are disingenuously his it seemed to me that this definition was applicable to pidgin english but at my lecture at ibadan during the question and answer period i was severely challenged by certain british members of the faculty so when the discussion of the adaptation of the taming of the shrew in pidgin english came up at the conference i was par ticularly interested to hear what was said by and large members of the conference were very disturbed that the british director of dramatics at ibadan had done this sort of thing was there any criticism of literature in terms of form and style on the one hand and subject matter on the other was selfevaluation based more on one than the other the mbari group of writers and artists from ibadan hold that the african writer will create new forms at the same time that he will probably create a new idiom or idioms this everybody seemed to accept in spite of the fact that it was pointed out that the creation of new formsforms which are amenable to the african personalitywill not be an easy thing to do genre have been established and only a real genius will be able to overcome the tradition that now exists  ?  after six months of this association brief though it was with african writers and their works what is your feeling about the prospect for literature and the theatre in africa my own feeling is that the african writer that african art expression in the theatre in poetry in the novel is now at the point where american negro art and expression was in the renaissance of the s and early s there is an exciting yeasting going on theyre finding their themes their idiom they are experimenting and considering that in many places they are being encouragedalthough not directedby government it would seem to me that the prospects for a great future are very good could you tell us what feeling you had in regard to your receptivity as an american negro writer and an american negro professor of english speaking to other africans my reception was fine i had naturally in the beginning a feeling of intrusion i certainly wanted nobody in africa to feel that i was pontificating i wanted them to know that i was there to learn i was received not only with great courtesy but great warmth i think i made some friends i certainly hope they realize that i consider them friends of mine in your talks to university students were there any particular questions which predominated the question i got most often was why dont more american negroes come out to africa the feeling seemed to be that the american negro had a great deal to offer them but of course they are proud people and they dont want anyone bringing gifts in a condescending way they asked why dont we have more american negroes teaching in our universities  what about physicians  what about technicians  cant these people give us a year or two of their lives and their skills and their knowledge i think this was the most persistent question and i got it not only from university students and members of the faculty i got it from people in the street that seems to indicate at least a latent affinity between the african and the american negro oh yes they know for instance even in east africa of the american negro dentist who has been practicing in ghana for seven years they know of the small group of american negroes who have established an insurance company they know of the american negro who set up in ghana the first school for the deaf and dumb and who recently has been invited by the nigerian government to do the same thing and after that hes going to tanganyika they know these things it makes them happy the only complaint is that theres just not enough of us what did you gather was the reason that africans were interested specifically in having american negro teachers etc their feeling was that the american negro being of the same racial strain would be more sympathetic to the problems which they face that they could get closer to the american negro than to the european to the white man in general they made no bones about this africans will tell youand i heard this time and time againthat by and large the european in africa hears only what the african thinks will please the european but the african tells another african the truth i dont want to leave you with the impression however that just any negro will do you dont make it in africa simply because youre another africannor do you fail just because youre white you are accepted because you are a negro who has something to offer did you feel there was any marked yearning for knowledge about american negroes and american negro writing oh yes they know by and large all that is happening here in the statesin all forms of expression they can name american negro writers american writers in general they can name actors and singers and they know what these people are doing what they have done they also know of the sporadic movements that have been started from time to time linking the american negro to his african heritage they know about marcus garvey for instance they know that dubois called the first panafrican congress they admire these people tremendously and they feel although they recognize that the american negro is first of all an american that he needs to know a great deal more about his heritage than apparently he does who are the american writers with whom africans seemed most familiar they were certainly familiar with langston hughes they knew some of the work of arna bontemps particularly in east and central africa because arna had been out to the university college in kampala for a period of months helping the college organize its library they knew william faulkner a group of us one night had a session on faulkner they knew the older american writers whitman and emerson they knew strangely enough maybe not so strangelyjohn steinbeck and they seemed to know him better than ernest hemingway although theyd all read hemingway one of the interesting things about their knowledge of american literature is that it has been acquired on their own none of the universities have courses in american literature i pointed out to british members of some faculties that this was provincial of them especially in light of the fact that except for boris pasternak americans have in the last seven eight years taken the nobel prize for literature in the states we have a great and important body of literature i told them and you completely neglect it they didnt like the accusation but it was the truth one can assume then that if there are no courses on american literature there are none on american negro literature this is right and it is why african members of the faculty and african students were very happy to get the shelf of ten books including the works of richard wright langston hughes and james baldwinwhich i presented for amsac to various universities during my tour there were in fact many places many institutions i was unable to visit which heard about the hooks and have written to the lagos office asking if they could have them on the subject of another american negro writeryourselfi had spoken with a great deal of admiration to wole soyinka about your book the lonesome road when i was in lagos for a brief stay and  was pleased to see that he reviewed the book a couple of months ago in one of the lagos papers did you see it yes a very flattering review im quite proud of it vm certainly thankful to you for giving us this time to talk about your trip may i say that in a little better than five years of amsacs existence your tour on our behalf has been one of the most telling things in the relationship between america and africa that amsac has sponsored the laudatory letters that have come in from universities and individuals about your visit testify to this we hope we will be able to undertake similar projects in the future

by margaret burroughs
it was the beginning of the christmas sea son and someone had plopped a prepaid ticket of on my desk for a party to be held over in hyde park it seemed from reading the copy that it was to be an interracial benefit for some good cause or other since it was saturday night and my steady date had begged off for the evening and i did not like to face the prospects of sitting at home on that special night looking at tv i decided to make use of the ticket and attend the party i do not know how white folks feel about saturday night but i do know that colored folks work hard all week and look forward to having a natural ball at least that one night besides it had been some time since i had been inside of one of those exclusive hyde park apartments and i felt like seeing how the other half lived again for a change when i had finished dressing in one of my exotic numbers which i feel play up my negritudehair eyes full lips and alli called for a livery to deliver me to the door i do not feel safe going into a white neighborhood unescorted and especially before christmas when people need money and dont care who they get it from as i was riding along i wondered if i would have any trouble with some white landlord getting upset because he saw colored visiting in his building i certainly didnt feel like fighting that kind of battle right then these landlords do not seem to understand that some white people have guts enough to have colored friends and that the neighborhood is not being invaded every time a colored person visits in a white building i decided that the christmas spirit must have taken hold for i had no trouble getting into the building i was received at the door very cordially by the host and hostess  after chatting with them for awhile i found that she is a writer and that he is in the advertising business and further that they are prominent in a lot of dogood organizations which have to do with colored and white people getting along better together i liked their ideas right off for i too am for people getting along better together and i would like to see a lot more white people and colored people too like this couple not just talking about brotherhood but trying to live it i was pleased with what i saw everything was decorated real christmaslike with holly wreaths and bells and the people that i was introduced to both colored and white were all very nice i sat down in the living room and just enjoyed being surrounded by all of that fine modern furniture and having my feet buried in the soft persian rug i love nice things like that though i have not been able to afford them i just reared back and closed my eyes for a few moments listening to the christmas music playing on the fine bleached walnut hifi it sounded so good that i could hardly tell where the sound was coming from not wanting to sit in one place too long i got up and began to look at the original paintings hanging on the walls if you sit in one place too long at one of these interracial parties and you are colored pretty soon some white person will come over and insist on talking to you not wanting you to feel lonely or left out or to think that they are prejudiced they never seem to think that you just might be enjoying yourself being left alone these were all modern and abstract paintings real originals by artists like picasso bracque rothko and pollack i tried my best but i couldnt make much sense out of all those blobs lines and curlicues of paint the color was nice though some of the white guests came up and looked at them too they acted as if they could read those paintings like reading a book but not me even when i studied the history of art in school i couldnt make sense out of the nonobjectives i like representative art even if that does make me sound like a square i continued to look around the apartment and i must say that it was wellappointed or swelegant as a lady columnist in the colored weekly would say if she was writing it up it was just like the pictures that you see in the home magazines that people decorate their cocktail tables with i liked that place and couldnt help comparing it with my little old kitchenette i wondered how much rent they paid for it i went into the powder room which was right off the bathroom and locked myself in this was so fine that it could have been used for a living room someone rattled the door and i came out and walked down the hall to the dining room which was set up like a bar i could hear the christmas music back there from a speaker built into the wall it was very pleasant and i was feeling glad i came i ordered a drink and i was just sitting there at a corner of the bar sipping it and thinking of nothing in particular not even the race problem when i heard my name called hello there madge i looked around and coming straight toward me was a white woman with wavy dark hair at first i didnt quite recognize her because except for the color of the hair most white people look alike to me but a closer look told me who she was even though i had not seen this woman in over ten years oh sylvia goodrich i extended my hand its a small world isnt it how have you been now i had it her husbands name was bob and we all used to work together on the artist project in the good old days of wpa we used to visit back and forth because in those days people were not suspicious of you if you had colored or white friends they and a number of other white artists used to live down at thirtyfifth and cottage grove in a section called the arcade which isnt there any more then the project folded and i seldom saw any of those people any more only once in a great while and now here was sylvia i did remember though that she could talk up a blue streak but then it was nice to see someone at the party that i knew even if it was from a long time ago is bob with you i looked around no bob had some work to get out hes in map making now sylvia sat down sort of traoping me into the corner i was mighty glad to see her but i wished she hadnt squeezed me in like that i do not like being crowded by either white or colored people holiday greetings madge she said youre looking fine you look good yourself too sylvia after all of these years you are being kind said sylvia she peered at me closely and i felt as if she was counting every single gray hair and wrinkle that i had but you have not aged a bit trim figure smooth skin not a sign of gray how do you do it i dont have time to get old i laughed too much to do just trying to make ends meet inwardly i was thankful for my african and indian blood it seemed that with that blood you just didnt break as fast as the white people well there was one advantage then we went off into a lot of talk about the good old days and as i said before sylvia could really talk she was feeling pretty good and it seemed to me that she had had a couple before she got to this party i hoped that she knew how to hold her liquor for i certainly did not want her to embarrass me by acting up i do not like that from anybody either colored or white say madge said sylvia i  just got back from the west indies you ever been there not that i know of i said ive heard its great down there though nice climate and all ive been going down for a few weeks every winter for the past several years said sylvia i love it simply love it especially haiti i compared my arm with hers you sure got a fine tan this time i said a little bit more and you could pass for colored sylvia took a hurried gulp from her drink and i wished i hadnt said what i did i thought id better change the subject for i do know that white people are very sensitive about being mistaken for colored even though they do bum themselves to a crisp in the summer trying to get a tan and the colored people who already have a tan put bleach cream on themselves trying to get rid of theirs also the white people get permanent waves trying to make their hair curly and the colored people use hot combs to try and get the curl out of their hair its crazy i think since i am quite satisfied with myself the way that i am the travel posters sure make it look good down there i said its indescribably beautiful said sylvia and especially the people they are colored all shades from blueblack to honeyyellow uh huh i bristled inwardly theres just about the same range here in south side chicago i hoped she wasnt going to start all that colorstuff talk i was sure that those west indians didnt get all mixed up like that by themselves i decided to let that one pass the music and dancing sylvia went on is just out of this world the rhythm of the drums simply possess me every time i hear them she began to tap on the bar with her fingers i began to consider how i could get out of that comer i was not going to have sylvia goodrich or anyone else bringing me down i supposed now that she would come up with some of that stuff about how colored people just naturally have rhythm if she did i wasnt going to stand for it i didnt care how many years i had known her i was getting ready to put her down right then and there i guess thats where katherine dunham picked up all that afrocuban dancing i said of all the islands madge she said seeming not to hear me i love haiti the best um hum i lit a cigarette and tried to blow the smoke out in rings like you said it must be very colorful i was losing interest in the subject fast you see madge sylvia was close up to my face now i maneuvered back and saved my drink from being toppled over the woman must have been halflit or something i thought she continued you see madge the reason why i love haiti so and the colored people is    is    because im part colored myself you i stared at her maybe i was the one who had had one too many yes like you madge im colored too she spoke louder this time and the person serving the drinks glanced toward us oh yes oh yes i said but dont be so loud about it i know how to humor people when they have had one or two drinks too many i patted her shoulder youll be alright in a little while sylvia her voice was steady and even and she looked straight at me youre wrong madge im not drunk or even high this is something that i have been trying to say for a long time now ive said it and it doesnt sound bad at all im colored she repeated im colored just like you there seemed to be a note of pride in her voice even i wondered if sylvia was trying to pull my leg or something in case she didnt know it i did not play these kind of games with white people did she think i was a fool or something if you stood her up beside lena horne lena would look quite colored and you know lena looks whiter than a whole lot of white people well i thought if a couple of drinks could make this white woman declare that she was colored then that was her own business but she really ought to know what she was letting herself in for before she went shooting off her mouth i sure was the one to tell her too because i have been colored for a long time and it is no bed of roses she must have known about all of that jim crow stuff that you had to go through but it was alright with me she was free white and over twentyone and she sure had a right to decide to be colored if she wanted to besides i had read about how so many lightskinned colored people passed over to the white side each year i guessed there was nothing wrong with some white people coming on this side and declaring themselves to be colored i am not prejudiced so it is alright with me you dont have to talk so loud i said no use letting everybody know your business sylvia seemed more relaxed now as if she had just put down a heavy load which no doubt she had do you mean to tell me that you didnt know or suspect something back in the old days she asked a few of our close friends knew i took sylvias hand well that christmas spirit has a way of sneaking up on you no sylvia i never had the slightest idea you see i have always just taken people as they come if theyre white theyre white if theyre colored theyre colored it never bothered me i spoke nonchalantly i was not going to let sylvia know that her little confession had shaken me in the least my grandmother sylvia confided further was a mulatto halfwhite halfhaitian negro welcome on over to our side honey i quipped but you sure could have fooled me i guess you did but youve been white so long whats the use of doing anything about it now its just that so many times i have wondered whether i made the right decision or not i have relatives in haiti and some in chicago too it is lonely being cut away madge i knew my cousins when i was younger and they knew me but when i entered college we moved and went over on the white side completely i see i shook my head understandingly dad was scotchirish he knew about mother and didnt care but mother    sylvia was thoughtful i really shouldnt hold it against mother she wanted me to grow up having all the advantages she didnt want me to suffer all of the things that are just a way of life with colored people you really cant blame her for that it isnt easy but i sighed somehow or other we live prosper and overcome sylvias words rushed out like an unstopped fountain well bob knew and he didnt mind but he got a good job and i thought    well that was when we moved out of the interracial colony on thirtyfifth and stopped inviting our colored friends over even    someone might find out    you know how hard good jobs were to find then she took out a cigarette and paused while i lit it for her she inhaled deeply i know it sounds like crying over spilt milk i guess it is i remember how hurt bob was when i had the operation bob loves children hes always playing with them on the street the colored ones too but i was afraid you know what people say about throwbacks i have heard i said but science has knocked that theory into a cocked hat a child of mixed blood is never darker than the darkest parent i guess my fears were based on an old wives tale she said well its too late to think about that now here bob and i are approaching middle age or as they say early maturity and materially we havent done too badly she laughed bitterly why we have everything she banged the glass down on the bar yes everything including misery yes yes i know i said trying to understand how anyone could be miserable having everything even if it did include a smidgin of colored blood madge im tired of running moving into new all lilywhite suburbs acting the way i think a white woman should staying away from my own blood relatives im sick and tired of it if youre tired then stop it i advised you said your husband didnt mind stop running and moving and pretending and just be what you want to be but i dont know where to start how to start finding my own identity sylvia said what do you do where do you go you could start by looking up some of your kin people i said nothing wrong in that its fashionable nowadays for white people to have colored friends and vice versa thats called brotherhood and being christmas this is just the season for it i could try to find them sylvia said bob has often urged me to look them up but after i had rejected them i was afraid i would not be well received her eyes lit up ill take the chance she said ill look them up i hear there are a lot of little cousins i know bob will enjoy playing santa claus for them with me thats the spirit sylvia i told her i think youll be able to work it out from here on in i gathered up my purse hear the caroling up front lets join them lets do said sylvia i hope i havent spoiled the party for you by burdening you with a recital of my problems not in the least i said we started down the hall toward the living room i was laughing sylvia took my arm and i didnt mind it at all whats so funny madge you see syl my great grandfather was white and in our family were not too proud of the fact but since you have confided in me i guess i can reveal the family secret to you that he was white asked sylvia oh no i said not that well what was it she asked we heard he was a horsethief i said merry christmas someone shouted as we emerged into the living room merry christmas sylvia and i answered and we were both laughing fit to kill
lennie
pain never worried lennie much but this time it was bad lying on the canvas under the glaring ring lights his mouth and throat were choked with blood his nose was swollen and hotly clogged making it hard to breathe but still he wasnt worried he ignored pain and was only angry with himself for the blood pain was a way of life with him ever since he was old enough to remember he had known pain in one form or other anguish frustration and hurt were common everyday things to a black man in a white world pain was black and all the hardship that went with it it was his mothers working and sweating in a hot laundry trying to feed and raise her child who ran wild in the streets it was his mother sick and out of work it was the white lady from the welfare department with her fine clothes and arrogant charity without which he would have been even hungrier than he was it was being born illegitimate and black too it was leaving school to find a job watching his mother shrivel up and die too soon it was being a good young fighter who never got his chance until he was old and his reflexes had slowed it was working as a stevedore by day and training by night and never being at his best physically it was seven children a harlem flat and the need to fight it was a lovely colored girl who deserved a better husband and the thought of her pain when he would not quit it was one hundred and fortyseven pounds of tired human fighting equipment that couldnt quit pain was lennie johnson he pushed himself to one knee and wondered what round it was then he stood up the referee was brushing off his gloves asking him if he were all right lennie muttered something about being okay okay was normal normal was pain lennie felt normal he looked across the ring at the hot eager white face of dave holly his opponent the welterweight champion of the world the referee left him and holly was at him again tough young and anxious the pain became more intense lennie shuffled forward meeting those furious well trained fists doggedly ignoring the beating the blood and pain he had to win he felt it he must he told himself stay with him baby dont let this white boy lick you stay with him you have been hurt before dave holly met him up on his toes beautifully balanced and coordinated as he dealt out pain with cold sure precision the bell rang back in his corner his handlers worked him over frantically trying to stop the bleeding wading through blood and scar tissue in an effort to stop what they knew they could only prolong how do you feel lennie he answered okay they knew how he felt but they wanted to be sure how bad it was where are we lennie the garden man whore we fighting lennie stretched his swollen bloody face in a painful grin im fighting the meanest man in the world they all smiled a little then he was okay get him in close where you can hit him with the right lennie baby hit him with that good right hand im tryin man im tryin they gave him some mouth wash he spit the blood and water out in the bucket the warning buzzer went off he stood up and someone shoved in his mouthpiece the bell rang he went out to meet dave holly and the pain the champion began where he had left off he came and went like the wind delivering beautifully executed combinations with tremendous speed and timing lennie tried everything he knew bobbing weaving feinting and always coming forward he used all his experience but he still couldnt get close holly fought like a thief never getting in trouble never off balance lennie felt an odd grudging admiration for the champion the kind an experienced craftsman always feels when he meets a man who really knows his trade dave holly knew his he fought from afar staying away from lennies only real weapon a lethal right hand lennie couldnt figure a plan of attack he couldnt get close to deliver that one good clean shot holly was there then he was gone he hit lennie with swift hard punching devastation then in the ninth it happened lennie got hit with a hook that tipped him over backwards it was an awesome blow delivered with terrific force and precise timing lennie fell on his back his head snapped back violently against the canvas the roar of the crowd rang in his already pounding ears through bloodied eyes he looked up at the glaring blue and white haze of ring lights over head he felt nausea he wanted to throw up his head was on fire with a throbbing aching pain he was cold above him everything swirled crazily in a putrid mixture of blurred blinding yellow and blue whiteness that clashed sickeningly with the crimson smear of his own blood his mind screamed at him get up lennie get up dont just lie there please lennie please get up baby he fought with his protesting tired body he had to get up his heart told him to get up when life knocks you down you have to get up even though the white man beats you to your knees you have to get up and hit back to hell with pain fight back suddenly his head was clear it was though he were young again he felt sharp and invincible he stood up fast the referee was there then the champion was on him again he drove lennie back punching furiously hitting mauling as he tried to end it dave holly became cocky and a little too anxious lennie played possum he let himself be beaten and driven back holly threw caution to the winds he had lennie in a corner he thought he had him pinned down for the kill and then discovered with sudden awakening panic that it was he who was pinned down lennie had finally succeeded in leading him to close quarters lennie threw the works smashing through hollys frantic unsure defense he hit the champion with two clean wicked hooks and the prettiest right hand he ever threw holly went down hard bringing the crowd to its feet screaming in disbelief the smoke filled arena was bedlam people bellowed delighted and angry obscenities they pounded each other on the back this was lennies biggest moment never before had he felt like this even as the referee pushed him away toward a neutral corner lennie knew he would never again know this feeling standing across the ring lennie watched dave holly struggle to his feet lennie got set to end it his chest and spirits heaved violently with pain and joy he knew he had his man he knew it he saw holly wavering unsteadily as the referee wiped off his gloves the end was near never had lennie felt as much like fighting as right now his body and mind tingled with sharp clear thinking readiness it was just a matter of time lennie knew it holly knew it and so did this roaring maniacal fight crowd as it stood waving hats and coats grinning laughing shouting and letting itself go crazy lennie shuffled out to end it holly retreated desperately he stalled he hit lennie with several light jabs to the head then all of a sudden lennie johnson stopped sh fighting the champion kept retreating wary of another possum trick lennies eyes went glassy and his hands fell uselessly and heavily to his sides his knees buckled pitifully then he pitched forward and fell face down with his hands still at his sides when his face smashed into the canvas he was already dead the pain was gone

the revolt of louis e lomax
the negro revolt bring himself to abandon it when he found so little genuine evidence of honesttogoodness revolt as most of us understand the term instead he searched until he found in the britannica world language dictionary a definition that was bound to fit ie an extensive or drastic change in a condition method or idea a definition of revolt broad and vague enough to apply equally well to abstract painting the bessemer converter the invention of printing the social security system and the medieval guilds is surely broad enough to include louis lomax for what seems to have happened is that lomax has updated and adapted to modern communications an ancient and sometimes indispensable negro art fooling white people if in the process a few colored people are also fooled this is only to be expected his success in fooling his publishers appears to be total their conviction of his expertise in racial matters is such that they apparently felt it unnecessary to exercise even routine editorial diligence in processing the manuscript otherwise how account for such unnecessary if minor errata as seven naacp regions on page  and six on page  placing the  freedom rides in  p  dating the  civil_rights act in  p  misspelling the name of lomaxs friend otto mcclarrin in his acknowledgments lomax calls him mclaurin and references to the negro american labor council as the american negro labor council p  to cite a few it is barely possible of course that harper and brothers did not much care in their and the authors anxiety to get something out in a hurry that might profitably tap the current popular interest in negro affairs the niceties of accuracy and thoroughness may have seemed only bothersome hindrances to a fast market and speedy royalties it is distressing of course that matters of the greatest moment in which so many dedicated people are heavily and sacrificially engaged should be made the plaything of this kind of cynicism but there is an unhappily long tradition behind it in this country as well as in others aside from the moral distress there is reason for distress on practical grounds greshams law prevails in the world of letters as well as in monetary circles and every meretricious work on an important subject makes it harder for serious and competent treatment to get a proper hearing and finally there is the sadness of knowing that the author of the negro revolt might if he would write an analysis of real significance and of genuine value in the cause which he espouses with such apparent sincerity in his preface to the crucial decadeand after eric goldman describes a procedure he followed one which ought to be an inviolable text for the conscientious commentator  naturally in writing of events so recent and controversial i have been especially concerned about the danger of factual inaccuracy beyond the usual scholarly checks i tried to ward off error through a direct appeal to the participant in the story whenever it seemed to me feasible or sensible i sent a copy of the appropriate manuscript pages to the man or woman i had written about and asked for a check on my facts and i did this without regard to whether the person was a waiter or a world statesman and without regard to whether i had written about him favorably or unfavorably goldman of course retained his own responsibility for his work and did not necessarily accept the responses at face value but he reports that many genuine errors were caught lomax repeatedly seeks to give the impression that he consulted frequently and at length with the persons of whom he wrote and that if any misinterpretations have crept in the fault is not in any lack of diligence on his part but rather in the deviousness or confusion of his sources since he seldom departs from a tone of assured finality generally representing himself as privy to vast inside knowledge hidden from ordinary mortals this pose will undoubtedly convey extreme plausibility to many of his readers many of these also will be strongly persuaded by his veiled warnings that the objects of his criticism will of  course deny everythingafter all what would you expect if a personal reference may be forgiven there is a perfect example on page  of the kind of error which eric goldmans procedure would have avoided laboring at his untenable thesis that the naacp national leadership is antithetic or at best indifferent to the worth of direct action techniques lomax asserts that i regard sitins and freedom rides as incompatible with the fundamental philosophy of the association the basis for this is a somewhat garbled version of a statement in which i said that the naacp can hardly advocate a policy of mass civil disobedience under contemporary ie nonrevolutionary conditions the latter is indeed my view but all that lomaxs misuse of it shows is that he does not know what mass civil disobedience is it certainly does not encompass sitins or freedom rides which are efforts to make the law applicable not to defy it that they violate local and state law is simply an interim corollary of our federal system and a simple telephone call could have cleared up lomaxs confusion in a few minutes the foregoing is a single one of the scores of errors halftruths distortions and outright fabrications with which the lomax discussions of the naacp are loaded i do not apologize for my preoccupation here with his treatment of the association it is obviously his chief target and the stated object of his synthetic revolt by negroes against the established leadership moreover those portions of the book in which he momentarily dwells on other matters for example the rehashed capsule history of the negros struggle that takes up the first fiftyodd pages the two final chapters and the halfdozen appendix tables culled from government sources as an afterthought add nothing to his primary argument and bear all the earmarks of being there as padding it would require half as many pages as lomaxs book contains to correct all the perversions of fact to be found in the negro revolt there is a problem also in selecting certain of them to refute should the criterion be the enormity of the distortion or the inherent importance of the item being misrepresented the futility of hoping in any case to catch up with all the readers who will have been misled is equally apparent nevertheless conscience demands that attempt be made to set the record straight in at least a few instances and these follow chosen more or less at random lomax the precise legalism of the naacp  while gaining spectacular courtroom results had made relatively little practical headway p  this is a monumentally silly statement especially when taken together with the observation in the same paragraph that direct mass action had paid off handsomely for negroes at montgomery for on page  lomax notes that it was the naacps lawsuit which ended bus segregation in montgomery a year of mass action there tremendous though its broader significance was never succeeded in doing this the precise legalism was what turned the trick lomax the sitins and freedom rides have relieved more common indignities for more common people in two years than legalism has accomplished in a quarter of a century p  a quarter of a century goes back to  in that time the white primary decision of  relieved over a million southern negroes from the indignity of not being able to vote legalistic pressures brought freedom from jimcrow military units to hundreds of thousands of negro servicemen legislative pressures brought statewide prohibitions of racial exclusion from restaurants hotels and recreational facilities to millions of negroes in the north and west the  supreme court decision outlawing school segregation despite the intransigeance of the deep south has nevertheless removed enforced segregation from the backs of several hundred thousand negro pupils in such states as maryland missouri west virginia and the border states to say nothing of course of the  negroes of montgomery who were relieved at one stroke of the humiliation of segregated buses by the aforementioned naacp lawsuit the list could be extended but so preposterous an assertion should not require even this lomax he james farmer was the author of the naacps nationally voiced suggestion that negroes withhold their patronage from certain chain stores p  it does not detract from james farmers contributions to the fight to state unequivocally that this was not so roy wilkins directive of february   was exclusively a wilkins product conceived and drafted before anyone on his staff had any inkling of it lomax the major issue of the  naacp convention was whether the naacp would as a matter of official policy employ direct action to storm further the bastions of segregation p  on the contrary there was no such issue at that convention aside from the fact that the naacp has used direct action for years as a matter of official policy the  convention devoted an entire evening to eulogizing naacp youth units in wichita oklahoma city and st louis for successful sitin activity during  and early  there was a seriously contended issue at the  convention however the robert williams case and lomax typically twists it to fit his thesis according to lomax williams was dismissed as president of the branch in monroe n c for having advocated that negroes defend themselves by arms if necessary the national office claims lomax affirmed the right of selfdefense but did not feel that  branches should state this as a general policy p  but the issue in the williams case was never selfdefense and lomax knows this very well williams had called on negroes to meet lynching with lynching and had urged them when justice miscarried to declare and execute judgment themselves on white offenders he resorted to the selfdefense pretext only when it seemed that it might help him get out from under what he had actually said lomax in a desperation move when faced by prowilliams forces on the convention floor the naacp leadership called in mrs daisy bates then riding high as the heroine of little rock p  no one called in daisy bates who is nobodys trained seal her impassioned and effective plea for the leaderships position was her own idea and it owed a great deal to the revulsion she had felt two nights earlier while listening to williams speaking on a harlem street corner lomax only in the last decade have negro contributions to the naacp matched those of white people p  for at least the past thirty years the great bulk of naacp income each year has come from membership payments and branch fundraising and relatively little of this money has been of white origin lomax as evidence that the naacp is on the downgrade its  membership was several thousand less than in  and for the first time in years the national office is running a deficit and must draw on its reserves p  the net membership loss for  turned out to be around  a drop of about three per cent increases in southern membership largely offset losses in some recessionhit northern cities as for the deficit one would hardly boast about it but it was by no means the first in years  marked the fourth or fifth year in which the operating deficit exceeded   and it was a smaller one than in either  or  these deficits be it noted occurred in years of successive income peaks the association has consistently taken in more money in each of the last six or seven years the explanation of the deficits is simple every year the naacp has expanded its activity to meet the expanding needs of the civil_rights struggle and it has had to cope with the multiple rising costs of engaging in such activity one could go on and on but a halt must be called somewhere though strongly tempted to deal with lomaxs fanciful conception of naacp organizational politics i shall confine myself to a final item lomaxs considered estimate of what the naacps program consists of stripped he asserts of the prestige heritage and lore the program consists of an excellent lobby in washington a good research department an ability to lodge protests in high places some modest efforts toward school desegregation in the south and lending a helping hand to negroes with racial troubles this is all that lomax selfassertedly an active member of the jamaica n y branch one of our best can find after scrupulous search and inquiry so be it but lets examine a bit of this superfluous prestige heritage and lore for example the naacps voter registration work employing two fulltime southern field workers since  and costing by the end of  over  with fullfledged campaigns conducted at least once in each of more than  cities and towns resulting in a carefully estimated  additions to the voting rolls but for lomax to mention this would of course spoil much of his chapter  in which he alleges that the kennedy administration had to bludgeon the naacp into doing something about voter registration for example the endless daytoday job of keeping this organization viable so that the unquestionably excellent lobby in washington can have a punch behind it a score of state and regional field secretaries maintain constant vigilance over the state of civil_rights in their areas they stimulate and guide branches in the carrying out of action programs and they are always on the scene when trouble breaks for example the extensive program of school desegregation in northern communities active school integration programs in  cities with lawsuits under way in fifteen more for example the hundreds of job discrimination complaints investigated and filed with government agencies and the ceaseless pressure maintained by the naacp labor department on scores of employers unions and the presidents committee on equal job opportunity for example the career guidance work of the naacp youth department to say nothing of the work of its youth units in breaking down job bias by direct action in durham jacksonville savannah kansas city and a dozen other places to say nothing of the fact that the major portion of all the  sitin activity was carried on by naacp youth councils and college chapters for example the painstaking work of instructing and guiding local branches in the intricate business of combatting discriminatory practices in housing and urban renewal in the most effective manner requiring the full time of a special assistant for housing for example a public relations program which bears a large part of the responsibility for public enlightenment on the true state of negrowhite relations through its press and wire service and its dayin dayout counselling of those whose words must carry the message out via this and all other media of mass communication may heaven continue to increase such prestige heritage and lore for without them the common struggle would be increasingly desperate in all truth the negro has been in revolt against the physical shackles that bound him and the legal and social shackles that have hampered him ever since the first slave arrived on these shores there is no new revolt against secondclass citizenship although there is clearly in sight the massive involvement in the struggle which has been a cardinal objective and an endless hope of the naacp since its founding nor is there anything new about the negros questioning of his leadership this too has characterized his upward way from the beginning and god willing it will be so as long as the battle lasts to those who doubt i would say only that the naacp will let neither just pride in its monumental achievements nor momentary dismay at the carping of illinformed or malicious critics deter it in the slightest from going on with its job with speed and vigor until the job is done
the ole miss epic
here ive been saying all these rather unkind things about senator eastland of mississippi ancj turns out hes a champion of civil_rights in fact as chairman of the senate judiciary committee hes dispatched investigators to ole miss to see whether anybodys civil_rights have been violated by the federal marshals the investigators are experts as they happen to be mississippians themselves so it sounds like a grand investigation i figure the investigators will produce a great documentary film entitled operation abolitionist the villain of course is this great hulking pound negro named mr james meredith played by mr sonny liston the hero is a governor barnett played by mr tab hunter with grayed hair the federal marshals will all be played by that german actor who usually plays general rommel    as the movie opens mr meredith a mafia member on the lam is trying to bully his way into ole miss because he has secret orders from the kremlin to ravish every one of the  young ladies in the alpha  omega sorority played by miss ann rutherford along with their alumnae advisers miss greer garson and thereby convert all southern womanhood into black muslims who are really agents of the international jewish conspiracy in blackface at first mr meredith is on the verge of success by torturing and stomping on seven frail aged crippled registrars he seems about to storm his way into undefiled ole miss the students while loyal americans at heart are apathetic and do not exercise their inalienable civil right of lynching mr meredith but at the last moment in charges the governor on a white horse tadah he is a wearing a rebel cap and a confederate flag cowed by the sight alone mr meredith starts to slink away intending to return to his usual work of slipping heroin into the milk bottles of hospital nurseries when    disaster in stomp  goosestepping federal marshals wearing hobnailed boots nazi field jackets and spiked helmets they have been dispatched by the mafiacommunistblack muslimjewishnazi conspiracy which secretly controls the white house unloading their portable forge and collapsible steel ring they forge a steel ring around ole miss then in the dark of night a tiny pinkcheeked curlyhaired southern boy looking for his mommy toddles up to the federal commander played by genghis khan the federals immediately open fire with dumdum bullets wiping out the little lad and the entire alpha  omega sorority closeups the documentary closes with a moving peroration by general walker played by general walker who says this is not the way to cuba he  h not only will this be very believable in mississippi but it shows what a champion senator eastland is of civil_rights you know the whites get the rights and the negroes get to be civil or else
by sekou toure
objective interpre ck tations are at the root h  of one of the prow e found misconceptions that prevent a true understanding of africas problems and the concerns and activities of her peoples for the interpretations made by foreign specialists in african affairs are as a rule based on the conditions of their own social milieu and thus take little account of the specific conditions of the various african societies if the problems of africa are to be understood analyzed and solved we must take into consideration the historical economic social moral and cultural conditions which shape africas particular identity in the worldelements of the african evolution in which total emancipation of the african peoples remains the main objective an attempt to solve specific african problems out of context according to some halfunderstood universal concept neglects the especially important social factors such an approach assumes that science has reached its limits that mankinds present knowledge is absolute and immutable and that in these matters there is nothing further to be expected attempted or desired it implies that human society having reached maturity begins to decline on the contrary everything indicates that it is still full of contradictions and imperfections and that these are the causes of its difficulties its crises and its disequilibrium thus the course of progress far from being limited is infinite in time and space it is absurd to suppose that an american laborer can think and act in the same manner as the president of a great new york bank it is just as absurd to conceive of the african or the african nations acting in terms that are supposed to be universal but actually are only relative depending on particular historical or social conditions there are no simple solutions to human problems nor will there be while vast differences in living conditions keep peoples apart while agricultural and industrial overproduction constitutes a permanent problem in the most highly developed nations and while a tragic lack of consumer goods and equipment remains a serious peril for the peoples of the underdeveloped or undeveloped nations poor peoples underdeveloped nations have needs and demands which are essential to the fulfillment of their hopes and which have nothing in common with those of the highly developed nations and their rich populations it is not strange that all peoples want security and seek to improve their standards of life t  for mans universal aspiration is for progress social justice freedom prosperity and peace but each of these aspirations has a particular order of urgency for each people and draws on infinitely varied potentialities and capacities because of their historical past and their present state of underdevelopment asians and africans obviously have more in common with one another than with europeans however it is not from this point of view and with these given facts that we must study the problems posed by the relationships between peoples if we wish to avoid emphasizing the rift in the world and increasing the imbalance which already exists in society these problems it need hardly be emphasized concern all peoples nations and individuals powerful or weak rich or poor hence it is pointless to expect the african farmer with his rudimentary tools his pathetically inadequate productive capacity and his miserable living conditions all of which may be interesting from an exotic point of view but in human terms are tragic to think and act like a factory owner and it is pointless to expect the guinean wageearner whether whitecollar or factory worker to think and act like a general motors employee or like a worker in a metallurgical combine in a socialist country in different social conditions the same words refer to different realities and these differences sometimes are very great but to infer thereby that nations cannot understand each other does not advance the solution of the problem one inch the fact that african crows are black with a white collar does not keep them from being crows any more than the green plumage of africas pigeons keeps them from being pigeons to understand both the language of africa and its true content we must seek to find in its words expressions formulations not the abstract character of a dialectic but the substance and reality of the life they express this life is made up of human imperatives social demands and vital material needs and these become increasingly explicit and urgent as the awareness of the african peoples develops and is able to measure the social injustice that characterizes their human condition the extent of the movement for national liberation which has suddenly brought rebirth to a whole continent and made it part of international life bears witness to the volume and strength of this collective awareness it is not by putting angolan heads on bamboo stakes that the portuguese colonistsor for that matter colonialism in generalwill stem the tide of this growing awareness there would be too many heads to cut off for that actually an important evolution in history is taking place and its consequences direct and indirect will increasingly influence the evolution of world society as a whole indeed the liberation movement will modify the international structure more profoundly than did the two terrible world wars the colonial and semicolonial countries although containing the majority of the worlds population had only geographical existence they appeared on the map of course but their straitjacketed peoples were regarded as unimportant because they were dominated and enslaved by others in appearance they remained mute and motionless but in fact the conviction that a struggle for freedom was necessary was stirring within them today most of these peoples have won back their right to a free and worthy existence the shameful racial segregation rampant in south africa will change nothing on the contrary it sharpens the awareness of the african peoples and strengthens their character it will harden them still more when the inevitable showdown with the afrikaaners with their racist and reactionary views forces the african peoples to face up to this problem steel is tempered by heat will not the same prove true of peoples the more they are restrained and oppressed the more able they become to fulfill their historic destiny the more they are threatened in their liberty their personality their dignity their hopesin their very livesthe more powerfully they arm themselves for the battle to regain and keep their freedom and use their sovereignty in order to satisfy their needs and assure their survival and development thus the struggle for independence whatever the form whatever the means had just one meaning for the african peoples to acquire the first tool to open the way for them to solve their problems as human beings fully conscious of their responsibilities for anyone to imagine that everything is accomplished and that efforts can cease with independence which in any case can still remains to be consolidated in most of the african countries is to close ones eyes to the human evidence to contradict the evolution of history and ignore the existence of poor nations which realize what injustices they have suffered and burn to exploit their hidden potentialities the equilibrium to be thus attained is not one  between antagonistic forces so much as a harmonization of the worldwide levels of development for us the element of need prevails over more philosophical and even ideological factors for the human needs of which man is consciously aware and which are part of his very being constitutes the true motive force of history the intensity of this force is a function of the forces which hamper and combat it it is vain then to hope that africa will evolve according to any specific form which might be im posed upon her contrary to her own wishes or understanding she will evolve within her own authentic framework and in accordance with her own personality until her economic conditions lose their particular characteristics and become normal it is futile to talk of protecting africa or to give her alms which will salve the conscience of some blunt temporarily the awareness of others and perpetuate inequalities between peoples by maintaining differences in their living conditions and it is futile to try to trace any one path that africa must follow africa must be left free to follow her own historical path starting from the imperatives of her destiny and taking into account the requirements of a fraternal and united world in other words it is a question of affirming our africanity that is to say our personality without attempting to dress it up in western or eastern costume what must be constructed harmoniously and rapidly is an africa that is authentically african africa has her own needs concepts and customs she does not seek to deck herself out in borrowed clothing that does not fit this destiny while presupposing the total disappearance of colonialism the liquidation of imperialism and the establishment of a society free from privileges also opens new and inspiring perspectives of justice progress and universal peace need we recall that by hold ing onto their present privileges and technical superiority the highly developed nations are depriving themselves of the creative talent and productive capacities of hundreds of millions of people in the underdeveloped nations already the modem worlds scientific capacities can no longer be measured country by country more and more the utilization of recently discovered scientific methods calls for the cooperation of several countries indeed of all countries together in view of this it seems bitterly ironical that progress upon which mankinds greater happiness depends is hampered less by lack of knowledge than by the sealing off by certain selfish peoples of information about their scientific discoveries experiments and achievements as a result of their substituting the will to power for the will to progress human happiness and the interests of nations are deliberately and irrevocably sacrificed paradoxically it is in the name of safeguarding human happiness and the interests of peoples that men choose the perilous path of military power leading perhaps to the end of humanity so far as africa is concerned this situation leads to something that is tangible and easily grasped compared to other continents africa is relatively retarded but to what is this backwardness attributable to some natural inequality between black man and white no for there are black men who by their culture have an intrinsic value superior to that of certain white men hence in so far as individual capacities are concerned there is no such thing as intellectual inequality among men whatever their color or race inequality exists solely in living conditions in the accidents of history that is to say in the political economic and social conditions that have dictated and still dictate the levels of development in different parts of the world this is true of the political situation within a nation in which political considerations have hampered national development as in european countries like spain portugal and greece it is true of the economic and social situation where foreign intervention has resulted in exploitation and social oppression as in any country subjected to direct or indirect foreign rule but does the inequality exist in the realm of intelligence we say categorically no does it exist then in the ethics or social theory of the two groups facing each other again we say no africa is not backward in the moral and spiritual domain in truth the african is keenly aware of the difference between good and evil of justice of liberty of solidarity of the virtues of work and human charity as well as universal peace he has the same sense of his responsibilities as do the inhabitants of europe america asia or oceania he has with some slight variations the same scale of values hence we cannot consider that he is even provisionally backward either morally or spiritually if there is inequality then it can result only from economic conditions far from being an inherent defect it is the consequence of the low level of scientific technological and financial development of our countries and although in these respects africa is backward compared to other continents she must not on that account underestimate her human personality her economic moral and cultural values her spiritual force or the contribution she can make to world civilization in the past decade africa has become well aware of her lag in material things and is eagerly seeking to attain the level of development of the highly industrialized countries when we analyze the ills that have beset the african indeed the whole black race we are obliged to admit at once that economic factors are what have favored slavery the deportation of our populations racial discrimination colonization and today neocolonialism africa has been exploited and oppressed for economic motives her legitimate desire for rehabilitationsocial moral culturalmust be fulfilled by her economic development we of course know that the world today is interdependent and  africa which cannot live in isolation does not intend to remain at the margin of this modern world she thinks she is entitled to benefit from the experience of other nations as well as from the fruits of her own efforts in turn she must contribute actively to the creation of a world society in which each nation while retaining its own personality will be considered on an equal footing with the others and will like them take on its proper share of international responsibilities africa has been carved up and divided the evil of colonialism has not consisted just of exploitation and discrimination but of loss of liberty and seizure of sovereignty only when a people proclaims its independence therefore and exercises its sovereignty can it put an end to every form of exploitation by establishing democratic institutions freeing creative initiatives and assuring individual freedom by social progress colonialisms greatest misdeed was to have tried to strip us of our responsibility in conducting our own affairs and convince us that our civilization was nothing less than savagery thus giving us complexes which led to our being branded as irresponsible and lacking in selfconfidence our greatest victory then will not be the one we are winning over colonialism by securing independence but the victory over ourselves by freeing ourselves from the complexes of colonialism proudly expressing africas authentic values and thoroughly identifying ourselves with them thus the african peoples will become fully conscious of their equality with other peoples the colonial powers had assimilated each of their colonies into their own economy the french colonies were an economic branch of the french economy the british colonies were an extension of the economy of great britain between guinea and sierra leone between french guinea and portuguese guinea there exist common traditional bonds of custom history and economy yet no economic relations existed between them for each was a tributary of the colonial powers market exclusively we know that we must rebuild africa to win and proclaim a nations independence but keep its old structures is to plow field but not sow it with grain for a harvest africas political independence is a means which must be used to create and develop the new african economy our continent possesses tremendous reserves of raw materials and they together with its potential sources of power give it excellent conditions for industrialization this is why though it would be unrealistic and irrational to think of associating the african nations with the european common market or any other form of economic monopoly it is to be hoped that an african common market will be organized which eventually can cooperate on a basis of equality and solidarity with other economic zones african unity is no more a goal in itself than was independence it simply is a means of development a force of interafrican cooperation it is indispensable because of the unjust nature of the relationship between the underdeveloped african nations and the economically strong nations the equality of this relationship must be improved in order to overcome the social inequalities and differentiations in the present levels of development throughout the world the highly developed nations have economic relations among themselves either of cooperation or of competition but their relations with the undeveloped nations are those of exploitation of economic domination the direct colonial exploitation of former days is being succeeded by exploitation by international monopolies and this has a tendency to become permanent paradoxically it is the underdeveloped nations exporting raw materials and crude products which contribute an important share of the costs and the social improvements from which workers in the fully developed countries benefit the nature of our economic relations on the world market can be easily illustrated in the matter of customs tariffs for instance let us glance at a few figures in the period  to  the exchange value of raw materials and crude products in relation to industrial products fell  percent although from  to  this rate had already fallen  percent in relation to the  market the extent of the decline on the international market is shown by the following statistics  immediately after the war the average per capita income in the usa was  dollars per annum while in the underdeveloped countries of asia africa and latin america it was  dollars fifteen years later the average annual per capita income in the united states was  dollars and in the underdeveloped countries barely  dollars thus while in the most developed part of the world the average income was ten times larger than that of the underdeveloped countries which represent the vast majority of the world territory and population this difference has now risen to seventeen times  since the war the world average per capita production of food has increased by  percent but in africa the production per capita has fallen by  percent in latin america it has increased by  percent in asia by  percent and in developed western europe by  percent  immediately after the second world war the underdeveloped countries participation in world trade exchange was  percent  however by  its share was reduced to  percent in  to  percent and in  to  percent  in the course of the last ten years alone the prices of industrial goods in international trade have increased by  percent while the prices of raw materials have fallen by  percent in other words the underdeveloped countries exporting raw materials were towards the end of the fifties purchasing one third less industrial goods for a determined quantity of raw materials as compared with ten years earlier in the light of these circumstances it is easy to understand that the economic unity and monetary independence of africa do not signify as has been naively suggested that guinea will be permitted to sell its coffee to the ivory coast its palmkernel to dahomey and its bauxite to ghana it signifies that as africa enters the international market as a producer all steps must be taken to establish a fair relationship in the active forces which dominate international trade replacing the position of dependence to which the underdeveloped nations are subjected now the mere fact that there are cries of alarm about the production of coffee cacao or peanuts while there is silence about the products for which the demand is increasingly active but whose prices remain stable such as diamonds  gold oil radioactive ores zinc and copper illustrates the mercantile nature of the economic relations between the highly developed nations and the nations producing raw materials in  the total tax on coffee imported into france was  per cent of its import value it was  per cent in germany and  per cent in italy was it really a question of protectionist measures in the case of coffee or of discriminatory taxation it is a fact that in this same period the price of gold was lower on the french market than it was for instance at siguiri in guinea as a result of surtaxes designed to prevent its sale locally actually the difficulties appearing within the european common market with regard to the renewal of association agreements made by certain african nations prove that it is not the form of the economic relations that must be changed but their very nature here as in other realms the interests of the african peoples are one and the awareness of this unity is rapidly becoming more and more explicit the african nations are realizing that in order to solve their urgent social problems they must speed up the transformation of their trade economy and if this is to be done through industrialization it cannot be done within the limits of our national microeconomies but unconditional integration into a multinational market consisting of highly developed and  underdeveloped nations negates the possibility of industrial development in advance it could only be the association of horse and rider if they are to complement each other economically the development of all associated nations must be carried out according to their united needs and common interests any concept which imposes implicitly and a priori a particular orientation and framework on the development of the various nations cannot work for it does not bring a radical solution to the nature of the economic relationships involved or to the general problems facing integrated human communities the leaders of the european economic community seem not to be aware of all this at least as far as africa is concerned and make no secret of their desire to achieve a political community of europe which cannot be reconciled with africas desire for political independence africa remains as grimly hostile as ever to the division of africa which began with the congress of berlin in  the unity so much desired by all africans will not be achieved around any one man or any one nation but around a concrete program however minimal the rules of the union must favor and reinforce generally accepted concepts equality of all nations large or small fraternal solidarity in their relationships the common use of certain resources and respect for the character and institutions of each state not only must there be no interference in the internal affairs of any state by another but each must help to solve the others problems if we do not rapidly achieve such a framework of solidarity permitting the peaceful evolution of our countries we risk seeing the cold war enter africa and divide the african states into antagonistic forces and blocs jeopardizing their whole future in common the evolution of our countries in peace and harmony requires a high degree of cooperation we have always thought that africa should be considered like the human body when a finger is cut off the whole body suffers the growing awareness that we all share the same future must make us increase our efforts for this cooperation for solidarity and active and conscious african participation in world progress when we speak furthermore of rehabilitating the african man we do not indulge in a racist doctrine but act in accord with a historical and moral imperative we have suffered too much from the malice and scorn of others we must act so that they will respect us in the future and this we shall do by respecting ourselves and honestly and competently exercising our responsibilities it is a problem of human dignity and of conscience some have claimed to see political antagonisms in the formation of various african groupings actu ally these were the first concrete manifestations of unity and were inspired by human and historical necessity skepticism notwithstanding this tendency toward unity will increase political choices which do not correspond to the needs and aspirations of our peoplesand it is important that this be understoodwill inevitably fail as for what face a united africa will wear whatever the choices she makes in her orientation it will not be turned either against the east or against the west it will be above all and essentially directed toward the emancipation and progress of africa and her peoples in our struggle for freedom there is no room for negative choices but only for positive thought and constructive action what will be destroyed or defeated in this struggle are those things that historical necessities human needs and the forces of progress consign to destruction and oblivion to attempt to interpret africas behavior in capitalist or communist terms is to neglect the fundamental fact that africas present condition corresponds neither to the given facts of capitalism nor to those in the building of communism africas way is the way of peaceful revolution in which the morality of an action counts much more than its form and conditions that some believe socialism corresponds best to the aims of the african revolution while others suppose it is preferable despite the lack of national capital to espouse capitalist principlesthese considerations will not in the last analysis prevent our peoples from deciding their own fate it is they who are called on to make the sacrifices and the creative efforts necessary to ensure africas development their awareness is sufficiently keen to enable them to choose the way they want to go in deciding these matters our peoples will take account of the realities of the twentieth century the tremendous possibilities of future human achievement as well as the knowledge experience and discoveries accumulated in the course of past centuries their commitment will correspond to their hope of future benefits it will be one which makes a real contribution to general progress in peace and human happiness african neutralism then is not shameful indifference a sort of political demobilization on the contrary it is the expression of a lively faith in a happy future for mankind it is something active a participating force an active agent in the struggle for the achievement of a world societyemancipated fraternal and united let us hope that the highly developed nations and peoples can understand this historical movement in its universal significance and that they will take full part in it in the conscious desire to help build a free and prosperous africa in a world of peace and brotherhood
the south dissents from me
some say that i dissent from the south i p but as strange as it  sounds i am hardly conscious of dissenting from the south at all it dissents from me im reminded of the old marching song theyre all out of step but jim apparently i march to a drummer they dont hear or hear but fitfully and dimly if i thought they didnt hear him at all i wouldnt be trying to indicate his drumming i think they do hear him however because hes a southern drummer though with universal reverberations at least he seems so to me the music i march to is as southern as the scene beyond my window this late august morning a scene observed first more than sixty years ago the shadows among the pines the sunlight touched with a haze that betokens autumn the deep woods beyond and the steady high singing of cicadas in the trees so southern that it rises from the earth itself and from my heart on my fathers side i belong to the fifth generation of south carolinians on my mothers the sixth my fathers people were from the s i think small farmers my mothers from about  plantation owners historically this was the south farm and plantation balanced each other it was this uncertain and changing balance that helped to give the south its character with the marriage of my parents these two forces joined this might not have been significant if they hadnt been typical of their economic and cultural backgrounds w my father was the yeoman farmer on the make aggressive hottempered democratic impatient of the complacent plantation people around him in true jacksonian spirit he used to say every man is as good as every other man and maybe a dern sight better my mother was quiet assured with a warm paternalism appropriate to the plantation too richly endowed to be complacent but from a complacent background too vital to dream of the past but with the past clinging like an aura about her it was her brother who once remarked to an aunt ideals are a sin alice we should love god now it also happened that i inherited almost equally from each of my parents the acquiescence of my mother the aggressiveness of my father these two opposing attitudes have so fused in me that there is no conflict though there is perhaps a tension i am interested in the old and the new in continuity and change i do not expect the form of the future to copy the form of the past this would leave no room for creation i search the past for creative hints my mother and my mothers plantation gave me the sense of order attainment rest and though my fathers driving ambition never let me think that the plantation might be carried into the future unchanged it never blinded me to the kind of thing i sought order attainment rest i move into the future therefore unhampered by the forms of the past but guided by the spirit the past has revealed to me whenever my fathers urgency carries me forward too fast i hear my mothers quiet words now jamieshe was a mcbride and whenever the complacency of her people slows me down i hear my fathers voice all right son lets get on with the job but theres even more than this though my father and mother were of opposing temperaments and backgrounds and the air was sometimes tense between them i never doubted that they loved each other devotedly it was this enveloping love that fused within me the two so opposing parts of my nature creating thus a harmony from what might have been a fatal struggle i have therefore moved through the world seeking primarily the form of love i sought it first in individuals i seek it now more largely in the south and perhaps even in the world the main problem in the south is what is the form of love here what is to be loved here that there is something indeed much i have no doubt for i look backward through my father and my mother and see through and in them the south in spite of all its absurdities the balanced south and it is nonsense to think there is little to be loved here this is one of our great weaknesses we do not love the south enough i know were passionate about it we feel were devoted to it well fight for it at the drop of a hatand drop the hat ourselves but its a defensive love a love expressed too often as distrust and fear of outsiders a love that does not know its object a misdirected ignorant love what is loves true form in the south if we had more to cherish we should have less to attack as for my defending the south im too busy in the spirit of my father trying to bring it nearer to what in the spirit of my mother i feel it is im not trying to reform it i have little interest in such a moral problem im trying to form it to help it find its form for it can be argued that the south has never come into its own never reached maturity never become the great region the devotion of its people should have made it its problem is the aesthetic one  to imagine and become what essentially it is this problem the south should be able to face for she was always rather long on mannersand aesthetic interest and short on morals as for the souths failure to attain maturity this is related to the fact that the region began to become conscious of itself in about  at the time of the missouri compromise this political event made it clear to the south that it differed from the rest of the country but the awareness came chiefly from a sense of outside hostility a hostility shortly to become tense and vociferous under the leadership of william lloyd garrison the south had no quiet time in which to become selfconscious it really became so only at the moment of its destruction and as the lost cause it is impossible therefore for contemporary southerners to look backward and say that at such and such a time we were what we would like to be of course this is a foolish wish anyhow no individual or people can go back to an earlier day but our contemporary southerner cannot gain from the past even the image of what he once was for he never really was he was always under great pressure becoming until in his adolescence he was destroyed we are still in our adolescence of course from the european point of view all americans are here the south has the great advantage over other american regions she has a history of such tragic depth and varied nature that she stands now upon the very brink of maturity she could grow up overnight she could come to herself and then her deep and swirling emotions would take form then she would know who she is and where she is going she would distrust and hate the world less and love herself more she would find a form conducive to love her true form wherein perhaps would be combined as we shall see the urgency of my father and the peace of my mother i should like to help her do this my mothers people looked backward my fathers forward within twenty feet of where i now sit on the piazza here at rip raps i heard my mothers mother say shortly before she died in  that she had never been reconstructed and didnt intend to be one of her sisters a maiden lady was an early teacher of mine there was no u s flag above the schoolhouse but the inner walls of the tiny building were plastered with the various confederate flags and every friday after lunch we sang confederate songs for the most part however the lost cause aroused in me only a faint nostalgia which i still feel back at home however was my father his mother and her brother a graybearded confederate veteran and their eyes were on the present and the future my fathers mother wa still sitting on the piazza at ninetyfour watching the buggies pass along the public road at the far edge of the field waiting for ten oclock and the morning paper my granduncle the old confederate attending the charleston exposition in  was so enthralled by all the possible inventions sketched there that he wanted to live twentyfive fifty even a hundred years longerindeed he said hed like to live to see the whole thing wound up what was i to do balanced thus between the past and the future i did what the south more or less has always done i lived in the present of course every child does but i never got over it because of this emersons aphorism when i came upon it hit home life only avails not the having lived because of this at twentyeight i was examining the poetic experience under john erskine and at thirtyeight lecturing to a college group on the poetry of life though i did not know it then this was a basic southern interest the south has had few poets why partly because she was always trying to be poetic life itself living the present moment always appealed w j cash calls this our hedonism time which moved slowly anyhow through the hot summers and the mild winters moved more slowly because men enjoyed looking at what they saw and passing the time together if the south still possesses even for strangers some indefinable magic it is because southerners have cared for it observed it and however inadequately and foolishly loved it in brief have created it it is their poem when therefore i began to study the poetry of life trying to understand how certain moments take form and imprint themselves upon our mind i was only holding up for examination the moments the south had always cherished meanwhile i had been led beyond the poetry of life into its tragedy led again by john erskine who introduced me to unamunos the tragic sense of life led by unamuno who told me what was happening to me but led i am sure not simply as an individual but also as a southerner a romantic desiring the impossible a stoic awaiting the inevitable i remember my fathers saying to me approvingly in the spring of  when i was first in love son you make me feel young again youre as big a fool as i was but i also remember him sitting on the front piazza in a may of my boyhood watching the storm beating down the yellow oats and never saying a word still silent he got up and walked indoors but even before this when i was a little boy i had stumbled upon a strange sense of the sadness of life my parents spoke occasionally of someones having lost a child i didnt know what they meant but since if children were to be lost the dark endless woods back of the house would be the place for losing i imagined them there and not frightened but  each of them alone the woods starred with lost wandering children was this image some faint premonition against the time when i myself should be lost in the dark woods of the world was i inoculating myself against sadness long before its coming more important than this was i entering life with the pathos of an old defeat enshrined in my grandmother and in the still unfurled confederate banners hanging like a mist about my boyish head however i came to realize the tragedy of life whether simply as an individual or also as a southerner conditioned by southern history i came to realize it and finally to pass in some measure beyond it when my loss accentuated perhaps by my boundless romantic desire became great enough i put off the heavy armor of stoicism i had seen my father wearing admitted at least to myself my own defenselessness and chose to walk naked in the world with this came a kind of compassion both for myself and for every man poor devils all perhaps i became a christian at least as good a christian as i had been a stoic several years before this i had been called by the minister of our presbyterian church a good pagan this was after he had read an essay of mine the religion of a countryman i think he was right for the religion i described there as my own was the religion of a paganus a countryman who was deeply aware of the more than human forces that hung silent or clamorous in the sunlight or the storm but practically unaware of the compassion that according to jesus lies beyond all human expression even in the heart of god but now in my new sense of compassion for myself and for all men i came to feel that compassion was a universal quality now for the first time human hopes hung like bright veils in the air qualifying the sunlight now for the first time i understood a faint premonitory experience i had had as a boy of twelve it was a coldish morning in september the first day of school my brother my mother and i stood on the back piazza looking across the yard through the pines to the barn and the rosy dawn we had drunk a cup of coffee together mother having brewed it for us and she was now sending us out to do the milking as a little boy i had called her mother lady in this september moment there was something oh so faint of the lady in the dawn something of the dawn in the lady now twentysix years later i was sure of it one spirit pervaded them both the god of the fields and the god of the fireside were one therefore when some years later i came back to live in my boyhood community it was now not simply the site of the home wherein i had learned from my father urgency from my mother peace it was also mortised in the granite of the globe with a window looking out upon the universe it was the place where i had first seen and therefore most deeply felt though for a long time not understood the lady in the dawn and the dawn in the lady how could i dissent from all this that would be insanity i should be dissenting from myself my parents the south as i understood it even the universe itself but i do dissent from the south at least from much of the contemporary white southon the race issue perhaps it is clear now since i have listed the things i assent to why i am not disturbed by my dissent from so many white southerners on this issue the trouble is of course that dissent on this issue is for them dissent from the south itself i think they are mistaken though the race issue is related to practically everything in the south it is not the south nor is segregation that tentative solution of the issue our way of life as it has been called i think i have said enough implicitly or explicitly about the south to indicate why i cannot believe this though i am opposed to segregation i did not myself raise the issue im not enough of an idealist for forty years i went along with the custom of the country only occasionally aware of its existence and then with little concern but when timeto be exact the sraised the issue i faced it and decided against segregation why i had decided against it without knowing it a half dozen years before in that tragic moment when having lost as i thought all i became aware that in this tragic situation i was a human being and found myself moved with compassion both for myself and for all other men in that moment only people mattered there was no hint of race when therefore race became an issue for my fellowsoutherners it was not an issue for me i had learned that i was a man a destiny heavy enough without burdening it with the issue of race so far as i was concerned to be rid of segregation which emphasized race would be good riddance why does it not seem good riddance to so many southerners partly because they do not see the south as i see it to them segregation is the core of the south to me its an excrescence which is it regardless of the number of white southerners who believe or think they believethat segregation is the core of the south time and not too much of that will prove it an excrescence for this is the predominant will of the negroes of the nation in a sense of the world its the civil war situation all over again even after every confederate had killed his accepted quota of ten yankees the yankees still came so today the forces against the standpat south are too strong so far as the passing of segregation is concerned it doesnt make much difference whether i assent or dissent  but so far as the success of the south is concerned it does make a difference we are going into a future vastly different from our past even if we have to be forced into it but this is little comfort to one who loves the south i should like for us to go with heads up even with banners flying though not the dear confederate banners of my boyish days but in order to do this we must understand ourselves what we are and can become what part therefore we can play in the modern world we must shape ourselves in the form we desire i said earlier that the south with all its passionate regional devotion had never understood itself here are energies not only going to waste but also being used to shackle us to a frozen past we think we believe that segregation is the core of our life i do not think we really believe it we are using words if we could see the south for what it is a region where men have striven greatly endured greatly and yet have managed through it all to keep a sense of human values a sense of personal relationships so lacking in the modern world a sense even of manners in a world gone mad for material gain a sense of humor sometimes playful sometimes wryif we could see our tragic history whites and negroes involved together in more than two centuries of defeat partly selfinflicted partly inflicted by the world then we should come to realize that we have resources here valuable to both the nation and the world and that segregation is not one of them i dissent from this narrow limited view of the south i assent with all my heart to the south that my life here has revealed to me the incomparably rich south i have just suggested we have been haunted by a past lost beyond recalling but lingering still on the far hills of memory when we turn to the present especially if it be summer romantic sentimentalists still we fill the landscape with beauty queens a dime a dozen without ever realizing what were doing a womans beauty is a stormtossed banner it was yeats who said itand under it wisdom stands there is wisdom in the broad slumberous landscape of the south wisdom in the feeling we have for manners the way you do things the way you hold your mouthwisdom in the appearance and the carriage of men and women there was a touch of splendor in the old south though we paid too much for it perhaps some of it remains we are moving now into a world where we could have it without penalizing anybody have we forgotten the quality these are random suggestions poured out pellmell the point of it all is my belief that most of us even though intending the best are false to ourselves false to our history false to the great possibilities that lie around us defending segregation as our way of our life we sell the south short have we lived here three hundred years to accomplish only this i dont believe it can the south be persuaded to accept such an integration i dont know would i have come to it myself if life hadnt pulled me up and made me consider however much i was prepared both individually and by my upbringing as a southerner to receive this interpretation i came to it out of my own tragic experience through that experience i learned the power that lies in failure understood and accepted but by that experience i was prepared to recognize the enormous resources that have accumulated in the south through centuries of frustration and defeat can we understand the potential power that lies at hand for a defeated people unless we ourselves have been defeated again i dont know but then we have all been defeated in greater or less degree and we still face the sunrise this is one of faulkners themes endurance this the south has the white south and the colored south the south theres a classic story about one of jacksons famous footcavalrymen in which endurance and wry humor are incomparably mixed the general riding back along the column came upon a soldier too old to fight nearly gone but still slogging well soldier said the general i hope youll make out yes general yes ill make it but generali hopes to god i never loves another country committed to a cause ruined in its service he could still smile at his own devotion i am not ready to believe that the region that produced a soldier like thatand he was one of many cannot produce the men to lead us proudly into the modern world
