the desegregationintegration issue is clearly one of the most delicate and serious problems confronting society in the latter century it has been one of the most discussed analyzed and illuminated controversies to be carried by the media of public communication yet in spite of this mass coverage one aspect of the desegregationintegration crisis has almost completely escaped the f spotlight that of integration as a  threat to negro culture perhaps one of the major reasons for silence on this question is because it is a question on which it is extremely difficult to commu nicate without being misunderstood mislabeled or maliciously libeled it is a discussion that lies along a path paved with pitfalls of  potential misunderstanding v given this state of affairs it would seem unwise to plunge into such a discussion without prefacing it by a short explanation of the barrier to effective communication on the topic hopefully this will re duce the inherent tendencies toward misunderstanding and clear the way for a reasonable and rational dissertation on the issue how to be misunderstood without really trying one of the most potent barriers to effective communication on any aspect of the desegregationintegration issue is the failure of too many communicators to clearly distinguish between the concepts of desegregation and integration segregation means to cut off from others to isolate and collect together in a concentration at a particular placehence desegregation signifies a freeing of such compulsory isolation and restricted  concentration integration on the other hand   means to unite parts so as to form one whole integration therefore signifies an obliteration of differences and a forging of all distinguishable parts into one monotonous mass integration and segregation are the two extremes of a continuum of which the center portions can best be represented by the concept of freedomfreedom to integrate or segregate according to the wishes of each individual the primary objective of the current legal litigation is or should be to take this crucial decision out of the hands of the state and give it back to the individual its objective is not or should not be aimed at merely removing this decisionmaking power from one inappropriate place which happens to favor segregation only to lodge it in another equally inappropriate place which happens to favor integration desegregation and integration are separate and distinct courses of behavior and each individual who chooses to exercise a choice must recognize these differences and should he choose to communicate his decision to others he is sure to encounter some awful barriers to communication unless he and his listeners keep the two terms distinctly apart another significant barrier to intelligent communication on such an issue as integration as a threat to negro culture is the suspicious atmosphere that has been created by the loud and rowdy voices of the extremists and extreme antiextremists of various political shades while most of this has centered around the pro and con john birch society protagonists the desegregationintegration controversy has been similarly involved the extremists in this case however have been the rabid white segregationists on one hand and the rabid black muslims on the other he who openly and publicly identifies integration as a threat to negro culture runs grave risks of being lumped with one or the other of these groups perfectly reasonable pleas for the preservation of one of the countrys major cultural assets may and likely will be simultaneously construed as supporting the cause of the segregationists and voicing the chauvinistic sentiments of the black muslims the only safe position between the extremes nowadays it seems is the extreme middle which may be as harmful to a growing democracy as the other extremes a third though less serious barrier to communication on integration as a threat to negro culture is the strain and minor discomfort such public utterances may cause  for negrowhite interpersonal relationships negroes who want to integrate into the mainstream of predominantly white american society pay a certain tribute to the latter this is a form of flattery that most of the flattered secretly enjoy negroes who deny any ini terests in entering the mainkl streams are frequently viewed with suspicion by white associates as if not being for their mainstream automatically means that one is against it the last barrier to be mentioned here is identical to the one above except that it occurs as a strain on negronegro interpersonal relationships among negroes the we want integration position has become such a powerful partyline that one of that group who dares to publicly buck it may be in for a hard time from his negro associates instead of accepting dissent as a healthy sign of political and intellectual maturity a majority of ones negro associates would interpret deviation from the partyline as a form of race treason and a threat to the unity of the group the net result of this is the relegation of such heartfelt opinions to the intimate interactions between very close friendsnever openly vented in the free market of ideas these then are some of the barriers that prevent effective and open communication on the question of whether integration is a threat to negro culture after presenting such a catalog of potential barriers it is hoped that the way has been cleared for honest consideration of an admittedly unpopular view namely that integration does present a clear and present danger or threat to the preservation and growth of negro culture the contention here however is not that integration per se presents such a threat but that the pattern or model that the process follows when negroes enter the mainstream is one that is inherently destructive to that complex of distinctive attainments that constitutes the background of the american negro we propose to develop this thesis by describing the dynamics of the integration process which we dubbed the integration model and by pointing out those of its features that account for the conclusion claimed above the integration model it is said that we are forced to think in terms of models willingly or not whenever we wish to think systematically about anything a decade ago karl deutsch brilliantly described a model as a structure of symbols and operating rules which is supposed to match a set of relevant points in an existing structure or process a major disagreement between model theorists however centers around the question to what extent does a model perfectly correlate with the reality it represents the claim made here is that these descriptions of the integration model do not match their reality in every single case but that they are what the social scientists calls significant at the  level meaning that they are valid in  cases out of  the integration model consists of the following system of interrelated propositions proposition i negroes ini tial interest in integration is accompanied by feelings of cultural selfdenial proposition ii negroes initial experience with integration  is accompanied by reduced esteem for their own cultural background proposition iii negroes continued interest in integration and prolonged experience with integration results in further emotional and psychological detachment from their own culture and extreme imitation of what is perceived as mainstream values and behaviors the discussion and support of each of these propositions comprises the main argument of this dissertation it follows  negroes interest in integration  cultural self denial proposition i is supported mainly by the following crucial observation those negroes who are publicly associated with the integration struggle are seldom active in the promotion and preservation of negro culture those whose major purpose is to integrate this or integrate that give no evidence of being equally interested in gaining recognition for the distinctive cultural contributions of american negroes they base their arguments for integration not on a conviction that the negro has made certain contributions that deserve to be made a more integral part of the national cultural fabric but merely on their conviction that negroes are equal and therefore ought to be admitted to the mainstream of american society if the charters of the discriminationfighting integration organizations make any provisions for the development and preservation of the negros cultural contribution such pronouncements serve only as window dressing judging from the public concerns of the civil_rights group negro culture is a thing that is of no major importance or does not exist at all while it is true that negroes who are interested in integration deemphasize the significance of negro culture it is also true that negroes who are active in racial uplift are not particularly vocal on the merits of integration the nation is dotted with small little known study groups of negroes which are devoted to the study and preservation of negro history and culture if the charters of these bodies make any provisions for supporting the integration fight these pronouncements receive little if any program emphasis in summary integration and cultural uplift are two goals that appear to be incompatible as far as negro organizations are concerned the inverse relationship that is found to exist between the two guarantees that negroes interest in integration inevitably leads to deemphasis or denial of negro culture  negroes initial experiences with integration  reduced esteem for their own cultural background proposition ii is supported mainly by skilled observations of the interactions of negroes and whites in newly formed integrative situations usually when negroes become part of a predominantly white group the most interesting characteristic of the vast majority of these newly formed mixed groups is that discussion or even mere mentioning of any racial differences in the conversations between negroes and whites introduces a certain amount of strain into the relationship in almost all cases taik about race and race differences is more distressing to the negro conversationalists than to whites the net result is that all talk about race becomes taboo and this includes talk about negro culture these circumstances are responsible for some ironic interactions such as when whites who sincerely admire negro spirituals express this admiration and suddenly become suspect in the eyes of their negro associates the explanation for such behavior on the part of negroes in mixed groups results in the main from their attitudes toward the value of their own culture negroes initial contact with mainstream culture results in reducing their esteem for their own to a point where they are embarrassed by its mentioning in mixed company they seem convinced that what they have to offer culturally is so inferior that any evaluation of it in mixed groups jeopardizes their chances for full acceptance iii negroes continued experience with integration  detachment from own culture extreme imitation of main stream value and behaviors the observations that support proposition iii grow out of the occurrences noted in support of propositions i and ii only by now the process is so far gone that any chances of reversing it are all but nonexistent at this point integrated negroes detachment from their cultural background becomes so complete that they begin to resent being called negroes im not a negro im an american to remind them of their old environment of negro spirituals race music and rhythm and blues the forerunners to the integrated rock and roll and gumbo and chitterling dinners would do serious injury to the new image they have of themselves besides becoming fully detached from their own culture negroes with prolonged experience with integration begin to imitate what they perceive to be mainstream cultural values and behaviors to a degree that is ridiculous they in effect become whiter than the whitest white more american  and more conformist than anyone else in the group they come to the integrative situation culturally naked feigning a clean empty slate and grasping for traits of the new way some negroes become such convincing imitators that their white associates secretly refer to them as white niggers a term and concept familiar to remarkably few negroes in summary the integration model describes what is claimed to be the reactions of negroes to negro culture as they seek integration and experience various degrees of integration the outstanding fact of life of this process is that the distinctive attainments of negro culture get lost in the shuffle but need this be the case does it follow from what has been said that any significant change in the existing social order comprises an inherent threat to the preservation and further development of negro culture the answer is no absolutely not the current pattern of integration as described by the integration model is not the solution to what is wrong with negrowhite relations in america a much superior and more desirable pattern of change which does not destroy but fosters greater growth for negro culture is summarized below dubbed the desegregation model an alternative the desegregation model the desegregation model consists of the following phased events phase i negroes recognition and acceptance of the fact that americas greatness grew out of and is dependent on individual creativity and cultural diversity not conformity and cultural sameness phase ii negroes recognition and acceptance of the fact that negro culture is uniquely american and played a giant role in the building of this nation phase iii negroes recognition and acceptance of the fact that their becoming like whites culturally is not and should not be a requirement or price they must pay in order to receive the rights and privileges due them as americans phase iv negroes recognition and acceptance of the fact that the beauty and richness of negro culture is deserving of their maximal pride and efforts toward further development phase v negroes and whites recognition and acceptance of negro culture as a major national asset and of the desirability of its continued growth as a distinctive form on the american scene peacefully coexisting so to speak with the predominant mainstream culture the desegregation model offers a more fruitful pattern of change than that which is being pursued in addition to preserving a major cultural asset it also points toward the solution of a more basic problem for american negroes the quest for identity after all there are no rational reasons why this tenth of the population should sacrifice its cultural contributions as a prerequisite for first class citizenship there are no rational reasons why they cannot live in the nonsegregated communities of their choice and dine from tables of gumbo and other culinary specialties attend any public educational institution for which they qualify and maintain the rhythmic splendor of negro spirituals and jazz be employed strictly on the basis of merit and create the dissimilar dance forms of the texas hop the mashed potato or scotch the question of whether or not the american dilemma is solved on this basis is not only closely related to the survival of negro culture but equally related to the survival of the whole american culture and way of life as well
dear mr jennett every time that you see your blackness mirrored in the blankness of a white mans stare you are glad that you can go away from him and everything that he stands for away from him and back to your own kind where you can relax and lick your wounds and listen to the comforting sounds of frying fat dialect easy laughter and race music coming over a radio you sit there wherever it is you go to seek your solaceat home in a beerjoint in a real estate office or on a comer bus bench and you deplore the way that your blackness restricts your life you find many agreeable listeners they tell you about all of the distressing occurrences that they have had to face and you understand each others dismay you feel that you are in this country only on sufferance and you go armed with wariness every day of your life and smiling yet sure ignore it sure consider the source sure be bigger than they are sure keep on striving for a better world for your kids you know that you shall do all of these things but nothing alters the truth most negroes are afraid they suck in this fear with their mothers milk they hear the fear voiced while they are growing up the fear is masked by bravado or antagonism or cynicism or laughter the kids hear ol mista charlies got it and i got to get it they hear i cant quit ill just have to take his abuse and keep my mouth shut they hear she wants all of the floors waxed on your hands and knees what the dickens you expect me to do you know the baby  needs a pair of shoes they hear the bastard called me a nigger i hit him thats all they hear i hate em hate all of emno there aint no good ones they hear he loves colored peoplehe was raised with em and as you grow up you absorb the resentment and the anger that is based on the fear the fear isnt a physical fear mr jennett it is a sapping wasting wearying wariness that has kept an entire race of people apathetic and incapable it is a most complex emotion perhaps it began when the negroes discovered that they really had no emancipation to proclaim and when the white people began to forge the chains of their own slavery because as long as they stifle us they are emotionally imprisoned themselves it is true that there are more and more educated and effective negroes such as you sought to buy your home but they have not yet channelled their growing power it is a confusing time for them when they go gaily down from their hillside homes to buy gas for their cadillacs it must hurt to have a white attendant slap you with a hatestare while he signs the esti  mable credit card you hand him fl negroes who do live in the sub i urbs bend over backwards trying ¦ to behave themselves ive heard  them say this we have to be so ? careful no matter what we do somebody looks at us askance often however they find a cau f
your letter has a ring of real truth to it i can sympathize with all that you say i wish to god it were in my power to do something about it but apparently it is not those of us who were bom white can never really know what it feels like to be black but i can tell you this there are lots of white people more every daywho believe that color like beauty is only skin deep and that all the really important qualities about a person    such as character and compassion    lie beneath the surface in the heart and mind and soul i think the phrase color blind best describes those of us who feel that way but once we become color blind we still have our human feelings about individuals i dont care a hoot about a persons race or creed but i will continue to judge each person as an individual when a person    white black red yellow or brown    lives in such a way as to command my love and respect i will grant such love and respect to this person    negroes must learn to live good solid lives as individuals i dont mean perfect lives none of us is perfect and those of us who try become so stiff that we are dull i mean just normal and average i suppose lots of negroes feel it isnt worth the effort white people resent you for the effort and claim you dont know your place negroes who refuse to improve themselves resent you for it feeling that  you are by your actions implying that they are not as good as you all i can say in encouragement is that white people suffer the same problems they are problems involved in climbing they have little to do with your color although that makes you a special target i was bom in a charity ward myself my life has been a long climb and i dont plan to stop climbing until i die i ran into opposition from those around and above me but i also ran into people who helped with no thought of reward for themselves at first some friends resented my climbing i finally made them see that i didnt believe i was superior to them    i was just trying out the wings god gave me to see how high i can fly i still have most of the friends we had before our climb began they understand now that all i want to do is meet the challenge of life and serve my fellow man as much as i can im scared sure ive been scared every day since i stuck my neck out and tried to be different but ive found that everyone else is scared too thats why were all voting ourselves into the new form of slavery called the welfare state and i find that by meeting my fears head on they dont bother me as much this is the attitude taken by our pioneer forefathers including the negro who was the first man to give his life for freedom in americas revolution your battle will be a long one but you will win it i know you will
this story comes to me i think because it is spring and it comes in silence from the far edge of yesterdays as easter time approaches with reminiscences of old lang syne when much of what i recall was told me by my ancestors perhaps only the old can tell of onceonatime when in africa all slaves of whatever trend in religion made special celebration of whitsuntide or as it was called by the natives pingster perhaps it was the original of rock and roll the season was passed in what we today term wild dances with unusual contortions and complete lack of restraint however untamed or uncultured the natives the affairs seemed to prove a respite from their labor as they were not obliged to work during that season frederick douglass who with a great heart and great talents devoted much time in attempts to improve his downtrodden race once said from what i know of the effect of these holidays on the slaves i believe them to be the most effective means in the hands of the slave holders in keeping down the spirit of insurrection were they to abandon the practice i would not have the slightest doubt it would lead to immediate uprising among the slaves the holidays act as safetyvalves to the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity but for them they would be thrown into the wildest desperation and woe betide those who remove these operations or hinder their conduct i warn you that in such an event a spirit will go forth in their midst more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake in the following story i have paid reverence to dead fame which i have drawn from shadowflocks of memories i quote the words often repeated by sojourner truth and he moved from there and digged another well for the lord has made room for usuns and he says to usuns to be fruitful in the land
sometmes human features come to mind from almost fors £ gotten concealment in clouds of memory ralph w emert son once said that in the culminating hours of life memory  is associated with certain books which one has read and laid away for years and so it happened as i picked up a little volume given me many years ago as i opened it the picture of isabella looked out from a page at close range i recalled the admonition given me by the donor dont ever lose this for you know it is very rare she might have added in the language of the street you cant hardly ever get them no more the life of isabella will not be found in any story book today the title page of the little fifth edition reads as follows  the book was first published from stereotype plates in  and was entered recorded by act of congress in  for the author mrs frances titus who lived in washington she intended her manuscript for postscript only the narrative itself was written by olive gilbert an amanuensis isabella could we be transported to africa in the late  or early  period we would find but few white settlements apart from the north and western sections the natives were of the darkest type with characteristic high cheek bones thick lips and flat noses many natives of the egyptian sudan in the east had migrated to the westward and the family of whom i write came from upper guinea to liberia a colony on the west coast and there isabellas parents james and bettsey bomfree with their ten children were driven aboard a slave ship with a full quota of other negroes under command of white men to be taken to america to be sold into slavery upon arrival and they were sold to the highest bidders history relates that ships used for the purpose were returned to africa ¦  laden with indians for the same treatment it is reported in some accounts that isabella may have been born in ulster county n y but her age was never known nor were the ages of her parents and the other children the bomfrees were like other negroes of their day they could neither read nor write and their only language was the low dutch of their natal land upon arrival in new york the bomfrees and all their family were placed as a group on the auction block they were immediately sold to one col ardenburgh of ulster county who was of dutch descent and could understand some of their lingo isabella remembered nothing of the circumstances of their first master however he was considered to be in the main kind and considerate when he died all his slaves became the chattels of his son charles all the older bomfree children had by then been sold and taken away they were never again seen by the parents isabella could recall that charles built a new house and she and her parents were moved there the cellar under the building was assigned as sleeping quarters for all the slaves some twenty in number of all sexes ages and sizes their beds consisted of planks laid over the rough dirt base where surface water seeped in and settled adding offensive odors and dampness conducive to rheumatism and ill health tobacco quids and human excrements also added to the foul atmosphere isabellas mother died when she was perhaps eight or nine years old her father lived for many years but seldom saw his daughter as she had been sold many times and lived at far distances she was first sold to one nealy for  that experience she said was like being driven like dumb animals being condemned to death she was obliged to suffer every pain and indignity which her race at that time had to bear she was flogged while her hands were tied in front of her until her back was lacerated and bleeding and once she said she was whipped because she herself was cruel to a cat again she was sent to the scullery to bring a skillet and returned with a kettle and trammels her penalty was a terrible beating years dragged on and eventually brought romance to isabella she was to marry a young slave who came from a nearby estate but learning of their tryst his master forbade him to see her however he persisted in seeing her and was followed on his last trip by a gang sent by his master he was caught flogged into unconsciousness tied with ropes and hauled away isabella never saw him again time which is said by some to be a cureall went on crutches so to speak until ultimately love came again and in due time she married and became mother of a large family however the joy of motherhood was not hers for long her babes were seized forcibly and given into slavery while white babies were given places at her breasts designed for her own and she was forced under threat of dire penalty if she refused for one reason or another her freedom from slavery was not granted until  some ten to twenty years after she might have claimed it had she known her age when freed she had been working for a gentleman who had paid seventy pounds for her service in his household he was john j dumont who lived directly opposite hyde park on the hudson in ulster county new york after many years there in his employ she decided to go to new york city then having about  or  inhabitants there she labored at numerous jobs in households she cooked cleaned scrubbed polished brass trimmings doorplates and railings and all the time earning the very first money she ever had of her own and that amount was scanty indeed isabella seemed to possess a power of speech in behalf of her race and had gained quite a reputation in speaking to small groups she then decided to go on a crusade she started out with two york shillings in her pocket and a bundle tied in a bandanna she left the city on foot and unshod much of the way took a route easterly through long island she lectured where and whenever she could make arrangements sometimes in churches sometimes by the wayside she never lacked an audience and she received many donations of money which were freely given after a successful trip across the island she boarded a little boat which carried her across the sound to connecticut and pursuing her way she reached windsor fame had preceded her and she was accorded unusual cordiality she remained several days and people listened to her with fervor she declared her intention of going on to massachusetts so on she went afoot and alone along mere trails and roadpaths through wild sections stopping occasionally at some little cabin settlement if no sleeping quarters were available she could always crawl under the low branches of a friendly evergreen tree and rest like a homing bird peaceful as a dove then at dawn she would resume her journey until another sundown after many many days she reached her destination at springfield massachusetts work was secured for her at the home of samuel hill esq and there isabella remained for sixteen years always promoting the principles which coincided with those of the state of massachusetts which was the first commonwealth of new england to resist slavery while living at springfield isabella decided to go on further missions she also determined to change her name to do this she wanted names which would in some way signify her ambitions she chose sojourner as a term for one who dwells a short time in one place and then moves on to another in effect a traveller here and there for her last name she gave the matter a long time and then declared that truth would be the right word from then till her days were ended she became famous in more than twenty states and in washington d c and wherever she spoke for her race sojourners voice was not confined to her time and place for it breaks forth today and may still reach the high mission which she espoused for the rights of all races it has been said that the best in mankind lives in obscurity for ages and then comes out in a people the voices of whom cannot be forever stilled sometime in the s i believe sojourner left massachusetts accompanied by several abolishionists also the hon george thompson for a tour of lecturing in western new york state her cause at that time was both imperilled and dangerous for their meetings in public were often broken up by proslavery mobs sojourner and her aides went on into ohio where their cause was also unpopular at intermissions sojourner would rise and offer the first editions of her little book for sale the proceeds were given to her as a benefit she also carried a blank note book in which she asked people to write their signatures many signed and expressed their sentiments pro and con and there were many donations of from five to ten dollars her own personal sense of ignorance and nothingness overwhelmed and depressed sojourner at times and it seemed as though nothing could raise her spirits except her implicit faith in god as she said god only could make people hear me and he did it in answer to my prayers and added you wouldnt doubt it if you could see me in my ignorance and destitution trotting about the streets bareheaded and barefooted her perfect trust raised her above fear and shielded her from her enemies that faith carried her on to the consummation of plans which filled her mind her knowledge of events was remarkable for one who so keenly lamented her lack of schooling but her wit and repartee were boundless it seems almost unbelievable that the woman could become so shrewd and so widely acknowledged and reach such acclaim as a public speaker of her day all of which is evidenced in the words of the noted bishop haven of massachusetts who wrote there is no more deserving woman of her day than she as one of the famous women of famous times covering in her own experiences the emancipation period from the declaration of new york state in  to abraham lincolns proclamation she deserves special honor the nation could rightfully grant her a pension for her service since the war for the amelioration of those still halfenslaved about the year  henry clay then living in kentucky formed what he called an americanization society of which he was president its purpose was to form a colony of emancipated slaves and give them a chance to live free three acres of land in guinea was to be given to each applicant but the location proved unhealthful and another site was chosen vermont history points proudly to the name of one jehudi ashman who graduated with the first class of uvm in  and five years later led his first mission from america to liberia upon the sesquicentennial of that event the university of vermont made a notable celebration one of sojourners high hopes was to secure land from the northern part of the louisiana purchase as a reserve for freed slaves instead of sending them to africa her goal was to reach washington and present her plan there and so on she trudged bearing the scars and stripes of her slavedom a tall supple wellbuilt muscular figure never shrinking from opposition or danger her wit wisdom and humor with her strange dark personality brought her fame and popularity her activities became widespread and her talks more convincing harriet beecher stowe said of her i never knew a person who possessed so much of that subtle controlling power called presence  sojourner lectured in many small towns in york state and at rochester gowanda and buffalo while working her way on towards the nations capitol in various ways and byways she met much harsh criticism and censure with crisp and well directed replies while offering her little book for sale she was accosted by a man who asked in effect old woman what do you think youre doing we dont care no more about what you say than we do about a flea bite she replied well chile de good lawd willing ill keep ya scratching she faced many accusations in her travels a man in one audience challenged her to prove that she wasnt a man she told the people present that she was a mother of a large family but that all except one had been snatched away from her for eventual slavery that she had been forced to suckle many a white infant at various times at washington sojourner was guest in the best of homes and was received with unreserved cordiality at one occasion she was directed to a guest room which was furnished in the most sumptuous manner she had ever seen when ready for bed she concluded that such luxury as exhibited on the bed was not for her so without disturbing the rich materials covering the bed she lay down on the floor and slept underneath at next sunup she turned down the bed covers and mussed up a pillow a bit as if she had slept there so that her hostess would not know where she had really rested walking past the administration buildings with the stars and stripes floating overhead she folded her hands as in supplication and thanked the god of love that they no longer floated above the scars and stripes of her free people asked what her work in new york had been she told of housework washing cleaning scrubbing and polishing brass door plates and railing and then added now i go around scouring copperheads replying to a man who asked what she thought of politics she told him she had just come from kansas and witnessed the wheat crop failure where there was no grain in the heads just empty hulls and she believed politics was just like that too many weasels in it i recall a story of sojourner who had smoked a pipe from early childhood in her advanced years she became ill and in talking with a minister the conversation ran something like this the reverend speaks now you believe in the good book and how it tells of heaven what a clean lovely place it is and i wonder how you expect to go there with such a vile smelling tobacco breath as yours and she told him well chile when i goes to hebben i spects to leave my breff here on earff but when her physician advised her to stop smoking on account of her health and said she would stop if it killed her she did stop and lived on and on in  amy post writing from rochester n y sent sojourner these words of commendation dear friend sojourner the announcement in the antislavery standard of thy having laid aside the pipe is receiving considerable attention i received a letter from dr trask of fitchburg mass who rejoices greatly over thy grand and triumphant to cast aside the abomination also a letter has just come to me from our highly esteemed friend jonathan walker the original subject of the poem the branded hand he was captain of a small vessel running from new york to the gulf ports he secreted numerous slaves and brought them to the free states he was nabbed and imprisoned and the letters s s were branded on his right hand as a slave stealer the vessel was confiscated with its cargo and the crew and captain walker lay in a filthy jail in florida for several months jonathan walker himself wrote the following letter in  from muskegon mich my dear and venerated friend your earnest and effectual devotion for so long a time to the cause of human redemption from the first knowledge of your mission services to the present time impresses me as well as many others with the warmest fraternal regard for your welfare and usefulness  when i saw that you had abandoned the pipe at your advanced age i could form no other conclusion than that you had done it under the influence of keenest moral and religious sensibilities i have known ministers and professors of religion who have tried hard and long to abandon the habit    and yet could not conquer i distinctly remember also the tedious and desperate struggle i had to emancipate myself from the foul weed after years of slavery to it one of the finest letters printed in the little book of narratives was written by william lloyd garrison of boston who was a strong abolitionist in  he began publication of the liberator which he had bought from a quaker named lundy he had declared that he would neither think speak nor write with moderation he burned a copy of the constitution publicly to show his abhorrence of the legalization of slavery professional men and mercantile classes became as bitter against garrison as the southerners and demanded that such literature as that of the liberators incendiary type be legislated against the bitter attitude toward garrison resulted in his being tarred and feathered on boston common garrison wrote in  regarding sojourner having been long acquainted with her eventful life and marvellous experiences i heartily commend her to the respect hospitality and goodwill of those among whom her lot may be cast and because of the cruel wrongs and sufferings endured by her during so many years of slavery and because of her timely selfsacrifices laboring among the wounded and the destitute during the late rebellion    and for her venerable age and necessarily increasing infirmities calvin fairbanks who was confined in prison in franklin kentucky for aiding a slave was a signer in her autograph book charles sumner called the belligerant wrote his famous words equality of rights is the first of rights and signed his name james boyle md of new york signed as coworker in the antislavery movement he presented sojourner with the stereotyped plates for the first edition of her book a few other names signed in person were a lincoln u s grant parker pillsbury wendell phillips gilbert haven stephen and ann foster gerrit smith gen o o howard elisabeth cady stanton and mary mapes dodge during the administration of abraham lincoln a washington news paper published the following it was our good fortune to be in the marble room of the senate chamber when that old landmark of the past that representative of the forevergoneage sojourner truth made her appearance it was an hour never to be forgotten even in our magnanimous age of progress that we see our revered senators even he who holds the second chair in the republic vacate their seats in the hall of state to extend their hands of welcome their meed of praise and substantial blessings to a poor negro whose old form under the burden of nearly four score years and ten tells but too plainly that her marvellous strange life is drawing to a close but it was as refreshing as it was odd to see her who had served in the shackles of slavery in the great state of new york before these senators were even born now holding a levee here where less than a decade ago she would have been spumed from the outer corridor by the lowest menial much less could she have taken the hand of a senator surely the leaven of love is working in the hearts of the people pointing with unerring certainty to the time when ties of affection will cement nations and kindred of tongues into a common brotherhood sojourner made her mark in the world without any education or booklearning but if thought produces intellect that she certainly had in  harriet beecher stowe wrote a story of sojourner under the title the libyan sibyl which was printed in the atlantic monthly there is a statue of sojourner somewhere made by a sculptor named story he became interested in her while in italy working on a magnifint model of cleopatra and he was contemplating a trip to africa to id an exact opposite type to copy he had talked with the author of ijourners narrative which led to his producing some two years later e statue of sybilla libica which was exhibited at the worlds fair in liladelphia olive gilbert wrote the following letter from leeds mass in  how little we know of the world we live in you and i seem to move about as easy as soap bubbles i suppose here and there making our  mine is a very quiet one compared to yours i did not hink you were laying the foundation of such a worldwide reputation when i wrote the little book but i rejoice and am proud that you can make your power felt with so little education susan b anthony in her day wrote and asked sojourner to make her mark on a petition against the constitution shutting out all women from voting for president vicepresident and congressmen although they might vote for their own states officials sojourner truth died in battle creek michigan where she lived in a little hut built from donations of numerous friends and that was her final earthly home her last employment was in a large house built on the same property which the owners had bought with the agreement that sojourner was to remain living in the little home which her own hands had helped to construct on college street from the first marker placed at her grave are these words though now the etching is dimmed by time in memoriam sojourner truth bom a slave in ulster co n y in the th century died at battle creek mich nov   aged about  years and at the base of this data is the quotation is god dead history has recorded the words as spoken by sojourner at a meeting being addressed by frederick douglass for the promotion and liberation of negroes he was evidently discouraged and was speaking with deep emotion when sojourner rose and said frederick is god dead there is a later newer stone placed at sojourners grave by a religious sect which is tall and slender like the old one and bears only her name in the shape of a cross in memoriam sojourner truth the only clue to the age of sojourner appears to be in the following letter written in  which seems to refute the date on the tombstone the letter was written by waring lattimer a nephew of john j dumont previously mentioned whose dateline reads feb   having heard that many persons have expressed doubts as to the age of sojourner truth i feel it is my duty to make a statement of what i know on the subject it is already known to you that when she was a slave she was held many years by my uncle who lived on the west bank of the hudson    and it was during my frequent visits the last time was about  at which time she was still held in slavery though i have i no doubt she was entitled to her freedom some years previously  it  was impossible to tell her age exactly  as i now recall her appearance i at that time i feel quite sure she could not have been less than fortyfour  or fortyfive years of age which would make her from  to  or   years old and as extraordinary as it may seem i am firmly convinced the above is about her true age dear old sojourner yours respectfully waring lattimer
why racial peace is imperative
as governor of michigan i was proud that the bishop of my church was in the fore front of the fight for civil_rights and fair employment practices but by the same token i was more than unhappy when some of the parishioners used to ask why must the bishop have a colored man carry his insignia of office i was especially unhappy when they not only asked such questions but when some of them began to drift away from the cathedral church where there was brotherhood not only in the bible but in the pulpit and in the pews why i used to ask myself is there no corporate response in the church to racial discrimination why no ringing support of the bishops stand on human dignity why no positive affirmation in word and deed of christs brotherhood did not christ say if ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well but if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin     stung by these questions and of course i speak here in my private capacity and as an episcopalian you can imagine that i was filled with real joy when i heard the still small voice of conscience assume corporate strength in the episcopal society for cultural and racial unity i will be happy to be a shorttime member of this society shorttime i say because the challenge to each of us is to work ourselves and our society out of a job as it were in other words i trust that we shall shortly achieve that unity we seek and that there will no longer be a special need of any i group to remind christians of the second great commandment fthou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself just a few weeks ago in africa this point came home to me in another way when i heard an african comment when the white man first came to africa he had i the bible and the black man had the land now the black man has the bible and the white man has the land while there is no question of the good done by the white mans contributions in africa it is a great tragedy that although the white man brought the word of lifeand many lived and died for italltoomany white men didnt live by that word the result is that many africans converted to christianity by the word brought by the white man have been shocked to disbelief by some white mens acts the new generation of educated africans is examining closely christianitys claim to be a universal fellowship many of the younger africans have lived among large numbers of europeans in african cities they have lived among europeans in europe they have lived among us in the united states and those who have not lived abroad get their impressions of western christianity from their newspapers and radio both of which devote considerable attention to the problem of racial relations as a result of this exposure to many nonmissionary whites africans today are giving deep and serious thought to the fundamental values of christianity young africa stands waiting father trevor huddleston has written and his eyes are vigilant eyes we have baptized him into the fellowship of christs church we have told him that he is the child of god and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven we have taught him to say our father with us we have placed upon his lips the body of christ and told him that it is a pledge and proof of our communion with one another in every possible way we have driven home to him that truth which we recite every time we say the creed that we believe in the catholic churchthe universal church the church in which all barriers of language and culture are broken down and what do these vigilant eyes see as they look at the present along with sitins and freedom riders they see whites entrenched in the best lands and the best jobs they see their ambassadors turned aside at the doors of white restaurants on route  they see apartheid trying to reverse the course of the th century they see ghettos for the black man adjoining every white city as peter abrahams wrote in his autobiography all my life has been dominated by a sign    reserved for europeans only which in some parts of the united states could read whites only the question is how can african converts balance what they hear about christianity with what they see happening to black people in christian nations in many cases they cannot when they see us fail to live up to our religious principles quite often they will  waver in their religion and then cast it aside in disgust and become agnostics although many africans recognize that we in the united states are actively seeking to remove the cancer of discrimination from our societyand many recognize that we are doing more in this direction than most of the worldmost feel we are moving too slowly they are newly independent proud and prone to make quick judgments when their judgments of us are made on the basis of our racial discrimination it involves practical as well as moral implications for us to consider modern africa is young it is impatient and it is in a hurry to make progress africans aspire to move quickly into societies as advanced as our own and their aspirations center around three key areas they want genuine independence for all africans and those who have it guard it jealously they want rapid improvements in their standards of living and they want equality and dignity both national and individual both for themselves and for all colored people wherever they may live thus racial discrimination in the united statesin addition to i being wrong for its own sakeis a i serious detriment to a successful  u s foreign policy in africa and  in asia and latin america as well t typical of how seriously discrimination is treated in the african mind is this editorial comment from a west african paper if the west led by the united states of america and great britain loses africa to the east it will not be in the race between both blocs to possess more arms or to award more foreign aid rather it will be in the race problem    man does not live by bread alone a number of other things go into the making of man to lift him above the herd of beasts and chief of these is what the western world has sung through the ages as respect for human dignity it is the denial of this right to be accepted and treated as human beings to people of dark skin in both the united states of america and the united kingdom in particular that will cost the west dear and another but what has the west with all its religious trappings to show in practice to get ahead in the race for the friendship of africa discrimination in the bus discrimination in the bar and discrimination even in church and on african diplomats in america there is this comment it does not take long for them to discover that in the corridors of the united nations or at state department functions they are accepted as equals and even petted for the favor of their friendship outside this spherein restaurants parks swimming pools clubs and in busesthey find to their amazement and chagrin that white men are more equal than yellow or black faces jwhile the problem of discrimination in housing against darkskinned persons is in origin a domestic race relations issue it also is inextricably linked with the conduct of our foreign relations one prime example of this interrelationship is the situation where many darkskinned foreign diplomats from asia and latin america and especially from africaencounter great difficulty in obtaining suitable housing in washington it is not difficult to imagine the harmful effects of this situation upon the foreign diplomats estimate of our national capital from my own contacts with diplomats i know how distressed some of them have become with housing restrictions they have encountered another place where the question of the american racial situation never fails to arise is in my press conferences throughout africa that is one question i have to be prepared to answer the minute i sit down to face the press and i am always asked it this is also a matter of great concern among african youth just as night follows day i am asked about race relations in america whenever i speak to african students on this last trip i met with the faculty and students of the university college of sierra leone and among the first questions from the audience was one on racial discrimination these are the young leaders with whom we and our children will live for the next several decades the impact of our discriminatory policies on africans cannot be exaggerated this is an open wound in the tissue of africanamerican relations and every incident keeps it inflamed furthermore this impact is important because it affects not only specific problems but also the philosophy and very way of thinking of colored peoples the impact of white mistreatment of darkskinned peoples already has developed for them special definitions for general concepts thus independence to them means first and foremost getting rid of white domination in the same way colonialism for many africans doesnt mean domination of one people by another but the domination of black men by white men such definitions distort and obscure our whole fight for freedom and our struggle against communism to many africans therefore the soviet satellites do not represent colonialism because they are not countries of blacks dominated by whites it is hard too to interest the african in berlin as a fight for freedom partly because by definition there is no oppression of colored people by whites and partly because the black african has felt we have had alltoolittleconcern for the black man deprived of freedom sometimes thoughtful people wonder why the newly independent afroasian countries  are so little interested in some of the things that concern us so much and rightly so but i think we must also ask ourselves if we are interested in manifestations of the same things in their part of the world communists can use the line that the united states cant really be sincere in its interest in africa because of our discrimination at home our own transgressions make it extremely difficult for us to answer such charges in a way that satisfies many africans and the fact that the russians discriminate themselves doesnt seem to surface let me make clear right here however that neither the communist challenge or our need for friends abroad is the primary reason that we should be concerned with ending racial discrimination in the united states the important reason is that it should be ended because it is the right thing to do if we are to abide by the words of jesusthe reason that motivates escru and brings us together let me also make clear that there is a need for very rapid progress in the field of racial relations  this is pointed up by the comment  of msimangu the african priest in alan patons cry the beloved i country who said  there is one great fear in my ¦ heart that one day when they the whites are turned to loving they will find that we are turned to hating as of today the africans are not full of hate in fact while there have been a few passionate exceptions the africans are remarkably forgiving for the centuries of enslavement and mistreatment they have suffered at the hands of the white man nevertheless we must feel a deep sense of urgency to get on with what remains to be done if we are to attain our goal of dignity and equal treatment for all we cannot expect that the charity shown us by the darkskinned peoples of the world can last forever the challenge to christianity is to grasp the leadership in the fight to assure all people their full and equal rights this is a job that merits the best efforts of christians of all colors in all lands if we are to fulfill the highest principles of our religion a missionary who experienced the fall of china to the communists has said the root of our failure lies in an introverted religion we have forgotten that god must be the god of politics since he is the god of history and of the whole of life we have forgotten that christ died to save the world and not the church only and therefore as christians we have failed to identify ourselves with the rest of mankind in all its human misery and in all the legitimate desires which if unsatisfied clamor for revolution which brings me back to escru and the real tragedy of the white mans relations with the black the real tragedy oddly enough is not what has happened to the black man bad as that has been the real tragedy is what has happened in the corruption of the soul of the white man and the degradation of his character while there is no good to be found in the discrimination against the black man the ultimate loser before god is he who has sinned not he who is sinned against thus escru in hard point of fact is not a crusade to improve the life of the black man but to save the eternal life of the white man finally returning to the words of msimangu the ultimate sin would be if with unsensitive hearts we not only warped our own characters but turned the colored peoples of the world to hating this would be to them and to our children a legacy of horror as dreadful as the bomb as i see it it is our task to lead the battle to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of mankind thus is a task that we must be about without a moments delay and let us pray that with gods help we may be successful in this allimportant endeavor 
miscegenation is a phony issue
i have been £ cegenist  it a misseems for over a quarter of a century i am neither ashamed nor especially proud of this in fact im not even  £ sure im spelling the word correctly miscegenation is a phony issue a false tempest in the modem tea cup and the whole issue would be amusing if this new bogeyman didnt have such tragic meaning in our countrys affairs to give but one amusing example i recently happened upon a list of tv taboos along with rape child molestation and other real hideous crimes miscegenation was also listed the tragic side of this issue is evident in our daily headlines everything from education to drinking a cup of coffee in a restaurant in some parts of the u s a becomes an issue on the alleged grounds that it will all end in that horror of horrorsintermarriage it hasnt in the north the reasoning completely eludes me why should anyone assume their sons or daughters are such morons that they will swoon away upon sitting in the same classroom with a negroas though colored people were newcomers from mars during the depression years of the early thirties negro families invaded to use the real estate term our street living in a large northern city our homes were typical lower middle class private houses the white families promptly sold out and moved away there were no harsh words violence or even the hint of a mob most of the whites never saw the new buyers if anything we white families were rather happy about fleeing times were bad most homes had a large bank mortgage which in the case of my family we would never have been able to pay off suddenly via brokers there were buyers for the houses mostly show people we were told offering a price above the mortgageproving even then the fallacy about negroes lowering property values to this day the prices of these same wellkept homes have constantly risen there wasnt any housing shortage in those days my folks moved downtown and the money helped put me through a year of college but the depression remained a threatening cloud above our heads and i had to leave school after the usual barrage of no jobs and odd jobs i was fortunate enough to become a mailmana very big deal in the days when any civil service job was like winning the sweepstakes true it was only a temporary job but it lasted for several years one christmas a bunch of temps were sent to the post office serving my former home for the christmas rush yes i found myself delivering mail to the house id lived in for most of my life never having returned to the old street i was curious to see the inside of our house now i explained to the family i had formerly lived therewhich didnt make them overly happy as they were sweating under an even larger mortgage than wed had but they let me walk through the house to my surprise it was furnished in almost the same horrible stuffed furniture wed had except for fixing up the porch and a new fence in the backyard the place looked pretty much as i remembered it the family had a daughter a darkskinned yearold it turned out she was interested in art and commercial illustratingas was i i made a point of delivering the mail there as often as i could after christmas the daughter and i began visiting art galleries twelve months later we were married and this year well celebrate our th anniversary if i were asked to highlight the one thing about our marriage which sticks out id have to say its been a very ordinary average life understand im not advocating intermarriage not on the grounds that it is wrong but merely because marriage is a personal matter and it is ridiculous to urge anybody to marry or not to marry this or that person because they are fat or slim bald or hairy of light or dark skin the fact is i would not advocate any marriagefor some people nor am i a spokesman for anybody i can not speak for other mixed couples but i can state that weve had a very normal life weve had our high points and low ones like any couple but none of them have been due to a difference in skin pigment mainly our problems have been the same as yours keeping up the car payments wondering if we will be able to take a cottage for the summer if we can afford to send our daughter to college etc etc we have never lived a furtive life been thrown out of restaurants or cafes assaulted on the streets or even subjected to nasty remarks this is not to say that the threat of possible indignities doesnt hang over ussomething we are more aware of or more aware of the relief from it when we go to europe it is also true our choice of vacations is a trifle limitedweve  never considered going to miami beach for example which hasnt bothered us in the least as many americans became suddenly and sharply aware when it took the u s army and world indignation to get even a handful of colored kids into a little rock school our country suffers from a major infectionbigotry certainly this is far from native to the u s a its a world sickness but we seem to have open or belowthesurface prejudices against nearly everybody some of us hate jews catholics protestants indians foreigners northerners southerners progressives reactionaries the rich the poor the educated the uneducated fat people and skinny people while im neither being facetious nor trying to equate the viciousness of these hatreds the fact remains that everybody is a victim of prejudice in our nation to some degree which is also why this article is anonymousin addition to my love of privacy while it is a difficult thing to sum up i think in our case prejudice has hit us mainly in the matter of housing not that weve ever lived in a shack but neither have we lived in an apartment quite in  keeping with our income although j in the last year i think this has i changed somewhatthe trouble  now is all new rents are so darn f high it is also true some of my relatives still do not speak to me but then weve never been a closely knit family i have aunts living less than two miles apart who only meet at family funerals when i was in the army i probably would have suffered isolation perhaps even physically if it had been known i was married to a negro but the few lasting friends i made in the service visit our apartment to this i day as we visit theirs looking back i think we have had a full life it may be weve lost some white and negro friends because of our marriage but i doubt if we would want them anyway certainly weve never made color a criterion for friendship among our friends we have a few boyhood pals of mine and their wives some of my wifes and a number of people of various colored skins perhaps due to our being a mixed couple we have also met many negro and white intellectuals we would never have known on our own in addition i think our marriage has given each of us a deeper and more mature understanding of humanity and dignity i must add that we have also come across a few well meaning bores who felt our life not their i own should be one long hot civil i rights battle my wife and i have u been active and still are in many i community affairs including the v struggle for civil_rights but we t long ago realized life cant be only a battle there also has to be plenty of time for plain living but as a white person ive had my eyes opened to the many subtle shades  of discrimination most whites dont know or care to know for example very few whites can realize the true courage it takes for a negro family to move into an allwhite neighborhood never certain of the reception theyll meet of the physical and mental effect on their kids but happily if humanity has its brutes and fools we always seem to have our heros too the nuances of racial misunderstanding often leave me completely confusedon both sides of the fence i have negro friends who are well aware of my average financial income yet they often ask for outrageous and impractical loans for some wildhair ideas i sometimes believe the only reason they ask me is that they still cling to the oldfashioned idea that all whites must have money i have heard negroes bitterly condemn the hate they found in the south yet in the same breath they will spew out an equally stupid brand of hatein antisemetic and antipuerto rican remarks some people cant believe hate is hate no matter who says it in the course of my work i spend some time in a downtown hotel which has a white staff and about  per cent of their guests are negroes including a number of people in the music world on the surface it would seem a well integrated hotel the desk clerk and bellhops are most polite to the colored guests ive often seen and heard them go out of their way to give negro guests detailed instructions on seeing the city or finding a certain theatre with the permanent negro guests the white manager and desk clerks are on a firstname basis they laugh and exchange jokes yet ive also heard these same clerks say upon seeing new negro guests entering here comes a couple of dark clouds or a more bitter phrase i dont know even the socalled new wave french and italian movies with their sophistication and fairly high level for pictures of intellectual understanding still relate mixed couples with sin they will only show a negro man with a white woman for example in some bar or wild party as if their very presence proves what a dive they are picturing on the screen but then these are small shadings and i suppose of no real importance in fact i often think the white desk clerk says his chauvinistic remarks more out of habit than meaning our daughter will be old enough to think of marriage in a year or so to date she has gone out with young men of various skin colors i will be greatly dismayed if she decides to marry or not to marry a young man because his skin is or isnt a special color being a sensible young lady i trust she will decide on a marriage partner by one standard onlydoes her heart and mind tell her they can make it as for those idiots who frighten themselves into a lather over the whole idea of miscegenation both the hysterical dupes and those who use the dupes to keep the cushy for themselves status quo of white is rightlet me remind them that the days of ghosts and bogeymen are long over and ask them to really grow up but please dont tell me we have to grant equality to negroes or what will the russians think most of us never read our constitution but we have one stating all men are born free and equal and it is our own laws we must follow regardless of what any other country will think obviously the reverse of this silly tongueincheek agreement is that if there wasnt a russia it would be okay to keep jimcrow i dont think anybody believes that but sometimes whites have to take a roundabout way of saying things perhaps to allay their own sense of guil

the pale dusk of evening was settling over the jangling early night of black babylon as i cursed the lethargic battery in the old sedan damn little man i guess shes dead were gonna have to hoof it to the swanksters i told crow yeah well lets dont forget de juice huh momma he said throwing his skates over his shoulder and slipping one of the two fifths of wine i had bought into his hip pocket under his sport shirt i did the same thing with the second bottle as we got out and started walking up the street that dead battery was going to make my scheme a little tougher as i had first planned it it would be a fairly simple matter to get crow loaded at the swanksters roller rink and then instead of driving him back to dots house deliver him home to maxine and the folks he would never stay of course not with dot in her condition but at least he might be able to feel that he had ties beyond her something to keep his life from seeming so miserably hopeless then it would be no problem to get him home by the thanksgiving holiday how did you happen to get tickets to this place guy crow wanted to know as we headed for the swanksters ive never even heard of de joint its new i explained just opened up a couple weeks ago i hear dipper got his hands on four tickets and gave me a couple he had a date with a new broad so he went on ahead that dipper is one straight ofay crow said yeah i said thinking of the lone white boy we called friend man its hot walkin crow said when we had gone about four blocks he paused and took a long swig from his wine bottle good little man i thought glad to see him in a drinking mood youre doin fine we alternately walked and drank the rest of the way to the swanksters with me just taking small sips to encourage crow by the time we reached the lobby of the rink crow was feeling no pain as we approached the pimplyfaced tickettaker he stared at us momentarily then looked at our tickets before raising his blue eyes back to mine dig mani mean he started apologetically like i hope you cats dont take offense i mean i just work here but the fact is  mani mean i dig you cats the most and all that yeah you may have seen me dancin at the  vipers i looked at crow he was staring at the white boy with openmouthed wonder a hush had settled over the crowded lobby and a sense of shame engulfed me as i felt the play of many eyes upon us i returned my gaze to the white boy he was still talking its not me baby you dig its just why all the gab dad i interrupted feeling a slow anger building up within me just this man i cant let you cats in you dig he said i snatched the tickets yeah man i dig you the most and thats sayin the least i said with suppressed fury come on crow lets dust this democratic den of albinos ah hell guy why crow protested de tickets was bought on de square this is a public place and i wanna skate man grabbing him by the elbow i steered him back through the lobby running a gauntlet of resentful stares as we started to cross the alley a which led to the entrance of the i rinks parking lot a long blue auto i pulled into it and stopped block  ing the sidewalk i oh honey look at that funnylooking runty little nigger the blonde girl inside the car exclaimed pointing a redpainted longnailed finger at crow she wore more paint than a japanese geisha girl i grabbed crow as he lunged furiously at the car yanking open the door hands grabbed the girl as she started to tumble out i fought to hold the struggling crow let me go guy he yelled furiously let me lam de pig no bloody sluts gonna call me no no no for craps sake cool it crow were off the reservation man i shouted shaking him another car pulled up behind the first boyseight nine maybe tenscrambled from it hollering rebel cries the other three boys in the first car got out too they all formed a circle around crow and me i released crow he stared around with drunken belligerence the boy who had been driving the first car swaggered to within a foot of crow a cigarette drooped from the comer of his mouth and his eyes were halfclosed as he gazed insolently down at him say spade what was you intending to do to my broad i know you didnt mean to put your black paws on her the malice in his voice caused me to reach towards my belt whoa shine one of the fellows wearing a rebels jacket said stepping up and snatching the belt from around my waist that action will only get you to the graveyard a little earlier his movement toward me left a fairly large hole in the formerly tight circle as he turned the girl cried out slap that little black snot dont talk to him i reached up and grabbed my hat shouting cop and blow crow shouldering the boys aside and lunging through the open hole with crow close on my heels i ran as we raced down the street we could hear the girl screaming get the nigger get the nigger jake dont let them get away ah hell i came to skate not to play in mud after a couple of blocks of hard running i stopped for a breather satisfied that there was no pursuit i stepped into a doorway and called crow as he came charging by sliding to a stop he came back to where i was standing of all de damned and dirty luck he said finally what do you mean i asked were black yeah i said passing him the wine bottle well drink up crow and dont worry about it somebody had to be dark look not upon me because im black because the sun has looked upon me my mothers children were angry with me  i quoted in angry disgust then took a long drink of the sweet wine to clear the bitterness from my mouth yeah they were angry all right he said snatching the bottle from my hand to take a drink come on lets make it to the stick hall there should be some tricks there by now buddy if i ever meet that horsefaced tickettaker at de vipers his head belongs to »»

anguish in his tone i knew the great affection he had for the skates well i told you to cop and blow man why didnt you hold on the damn things yeah i know but what am i gonna do he asked wretchedly go to the cops for what i asked your best bet is to chalk it up to experience yeah but if i ever get my hands on one of those hunkey bastards im gonna he let the threat trail off ominously tilting the bottle he drank half of what was left noticing that he could hardly stand up i took his arm and led him into a nearby hallway we sat on the steps crow with his head hanging between his legs  and his narrow shoulders drooped in drunken dejection he muttered my skates damn then in a surprisingly sober voice guy have you seen my family lately the question and the loneliness in his voice were the last things id expected hiding my surprise i said yeah momma i saw maxine i promised to get her a thanksgiving present in fact i nodded at the bottle go ahead man knock yourself out hey baby i wonder

grabbed him by the arm and got to my feet come on man those tricks wont wait all night i said as we crossed the railroad  tracks he said guy you know i im trying to kick my habits thats i why i been drinking so much late  ly i figure after we have come f back from summer camp i might go back home just then a car came speeding by one of its satinjacketed occupants shouted hey black boy heres one of your skates the skate fell at our feet crow picked it up with tears in his eyes the leather shoe was slashed to ribbons oh de bastards ill get even he said as we watched the receding tail lights screeching tires caused me to turn around quickly the blue auto from the rink was coming up fast snatching the almost empty bottle from crows pocket i threw it as the car came even with me the force shattered one of the car windows brakes locked tires burned as the car skidded to a stop crow i said running for the car surging with rage as i neared the car heavily mascaraed eyes stared through the shattered window as i got within several feet of it the car pulled away in rapid acceleration i stood trembling as the tail light disappeared into the night crow caught up with me and we continued to walk down the street as we were getting ready to cross bishop street the blue auto pulled up again a sense of danger gripped me i made a desperate grab for crow as he lunged toward the curb his body slammed back against me knocking me down  a thunderous sound was ringing in my ears i tried to get up crow lay sprawled across my leg i shoved his shoulder roughly hey man get the hell off my leg crow raised his head a painful smile split his dark face ii cant momma the dirty bastards shot me i sat up quickly turning him over in my arms his hands gripped his stomach blood gushed from between his fingers coloring his white turtleneck sweater crimson i started to lift him hold it momma he croaked in pain of all thefrigging luck tell dot max thethe old folks ii his head slumped to my chest i raised it blood trickled from the corner of his mouth the dirty foulfighting bastardsthethe momma momma ththeha he laughed thethe he sighed his body shuddered into stillness i knew that he was dead too horrified to speak or move i sat and clutched him to me tightly staring at the hole in his stomach which the fall of his lifeless hands had exposed i realized he said the instead of de for the first time since i had known him he wouldnt say de or the any more yeah the de had been shot out of crow one boom and the des had begun to flow a whole lifetime of des flowing going going gone dead killed thou shalt not kill son    never let a blow from a white man go  i rocked back and forth with crows head in my lap as the voices rang in my brain finally there was a louder voice saying all right i said turn him loose well take care of him now i looked up in the direction of the voice white hands extended toward me i leaned away from their touch clutching crows body close to me i thought of my promise to maxine crow would be home long before thanksgiving let go boy well take care of him the voice repeated keep your hands off him i screamed leaping to my feet as the white hands touched crow blue eyes opened wide with surprise i jabbed my fists at them with all my might and felt my knuckles smack against flesh the eyes disappeared white faces began to pop up around me i lashed out at them again and again trying to empty myself of all the frustration id ever been made to feel hands  tried to hold me i bit at them the street lights reflected on a silver star a woman screamed as i staggered from a blow to the back of my head i reached out blindly for support and felt cloth guy guy for gods sake stop it before they kill you another blow to the head knocked me to my knees i felt

in recent years much has been made of the new generation when the spotlight turns to education and civil_rights the attention has been deserved for the young and the newdirected negro indeed has served notice that a new day is at hand what has not been noticed sufficiently is that the spirit which moves the young freedom fighter also has infected the artist and there is an excellent young writer musician or sculptor to match every martin_luther_king jr or diane nash the creative personality in short is keeping pace all over the country gifted young men and women are gaining recognition for their work in the plastic musical and dramatic arts and negro poets and writers have made a major breakthrough in recent months many of these bright young people are well known nowjames baldwin earle hyman and grace bumbry as examplesbut there are many more whose extraordinary ability demands recognition among these are sculptressceramistjewelry maker cledie taylor of detroit actress ellen holly and poet leroi jones of new york and bassist conductor henry lewis of los angeles on the following pages negro digest presents three members of the new wave of talented young people from whom much more will be heard
the current crop of negro actors are in an unenviable position they arrive upon the theatrical scene just as some of the high wide walls of racial  discrimination are crumbling and it inevitably must fall their lot to prove i they are deserving of the chance to simply pursue unfettered their chosen iprofession fortunately a battery of extraordinarily attractive and comipetent young people have been developing in the wings and they are meeting the unequal challenge with singular success standard bearer of the new wave i of thespians is a most uncommon young man with the somewhat common name of jonesjames earl tall sturdy and virilly handsome the youthful mr jones presently is engaged in a process of encirclement in preparation for a fullscale frontal assault on the bastion of broadway the past summer found him repeating his summer  stint as a key performer with the shakespearean festival in central park he left the cast of the blacks downtown to rejoin the shakespearean company prior to the blacks he had bedazzled the critics as ephraim in the shortlived moon on a rainbow shawl and for scoring triumphs all around he was named best actor of the  offbroadway season and rewarded with an obie at  mr jones has behind him a solid background in the dramatic arts after switching from medicine to drama at the university of michigan he appeared in campus productions and made his professional debut in christopher frys a sleep of prisoners he also played the leading roles in michigan productions of deep are the roots and othello before heading for new york in  for two years the actor honed his talent at the american theatre wing then in  he landed his first bigtime role in the play wedding in japan while some of the plays in which mr jones subsequently appeared received negative or indifferent reviews his own notices invariably were good the obie award is testimony in last seasons moon on a rainbow shawl mr jones had the signal honor of acting with his father robert earl jones in the distant future the younger mr jones hopes to work with a very good repertory company perhaps my own and there seems no compelling reason why he should not have his hopes realized in the meantime theatre fans are due to see and hear much from the not so common mr jones 
last summer with publication of the american literary scene the authe novel a different drummer a thor william melvin kelley just  radiant new talent was projected onto belongs to the current generation of youngoldstersthat breed which apparently is free of those preoccupations and conceits of the preceding generation interests characterized by feverish fraternity fetes struggle for social status and futile flight from the facts of race young mr kelley is a native new yorker a former student at harvard university and a dedicated writer his first short story spring planting was published in accent in  and his stories and articles appeared in the urbanite the harvard advocate and the new york times sunday magazine prior to publication of a different drummer at harvard in  he received the dana reed prize for the best piece of writing published in an undergraduate publication he was a  fellow at the bread loaf writers conference in vermont now variously involved in the production of several articles while working on his second novel kelley is a young man with a lot on his mind i hope only to write fiction until i youngoldstersthat breed which apparently is free of those preoccupations and conceits of the preceding generation interests characterized by feverish fraternity fetes struggle for social status and futile flight from the facts of race young mr kelley is a native new yorker a former student at harvard university and a dedicated writer his first short story spring planting was published in accent in  and his stories and articles appeared in the urbanite the harvard advocate and the new york times sunday magazine prior to publication of a different drummer at harvard die he says exploring until there is no longer anything to explore or until i become interested in other things the plight of negroes as individual human beings in america i want to understand it all but do not think i will ever venture any answers    and then the question put to this articulate representative of the new leaders what do you feel about the future of the negro in america and the answercool thoughtful assured this is a very personal view and though it may be right for me it can be completely wrong for the race though i think it perhaps will ultimately have to be done i feel it is time for the individual negro to come out from behind the shield of race each negro must realize that his worth as a human being comes from his being unique not a member of a race or party or club or group a sixteenth of an inch of skin is nothing either to crow about or to feel ashamed of if you are a human being and know it you will remain a human being even if you are brainwashed deprived of food clothes and shelter drugged beaten or shot you are a human being until you die any respect you get is because of your humanness i do not mean that the negro race should not weld itself into one great power to achieve equality in this country but what will happen to these people when they go home and are alone being negro is a relative thing each lone negro must find something in himself that he feels is worthy of respect and decent treatment and that in my view can only be his unique quality as one lone human being in death of a salesman arthur miller gives some lines to mrs linda loman she is speaking of her husband willy i dont say hes a great man willy loman never made a lot of money his name was never in the paper hes not the finest character that ever lived but hes a human being  so attention must be paid hes not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog attention attention must finally be paid to such a person and perhaps this is true of each man when thinking about himself attention must be paid by each one of us to what we really are human beings not simply members of a race
young alvin ailey is in a class all his own a superb dancer he is hardly less talented as choreographer and actor above all he is a pacesetter and innovator in his field exploring new areas of the dance with spectacular success last august he crowned a busy and meteoric career at the american dance festival at connecticut college the following is part of what allen hughes of the new york times had to say about mr ailey and his dances and dancers at the new london festival some of the most exciting dancing our country has to offer was seen at the american dance festival    when the alvin ailey dance theatre    appeared at connecticut colleges palmer auditorium    this second event of the festival season was planned to focus attention upon influences that ethnic traditions have wrought upon the dance of our time the chances are however that hardly anyone in the audience bothered to reflect on the origins of anybody or anything for the proceedings on stage were simply too engrossing most of the time to allow for any meditation continuing with his enthusiastic assessment of the ailey performance mr hughes wrote as it happens it is considerably easier to be enthusiastic about mr ailey and his dancers than it is to say just why they seem so good he and the five colleagues with him    are american negroes and their major work revelations is based on nine negro spirituals unfortunately these bare facts explain little if anything nor is it of much use to speak of the dancers infallible rhythmic sense extraordinary physical suppleness and inherent grace one must turn rather to the galvanizing personality of mr ailey himself there one might find sweetness and rage hope and despair the sacred and the  profane all battling with each other  for ascendancy weakness resigna  tion and compromise would hardly  have a chance  alvin ailey is an alumnus of the late lester hortons dance troupe from los angeles the troupe that also developed the dazzling carmen delavallade and the enchanting lelia goldoni in new york where fame awaited the trio ailey often teamed with miss delavallade in dance recitals and performances in the metropolitan area miss delavallade shared the spotlight with ailey on the state department sponsored tour of the orient from which the dancers returned just prior to the connecticut college triumph the tour of course was an unqualified success it was five years ago in the broadway musical jamaica that critics first realized a new star had risen in the person of alvin ailey since then he has appeared wherever excellent dancing is important in this country including the young men and young womens hebrew association dance center and jacobs pillow his brilliant ideas have been realized in such choreographic masterpieces as cinco latinos blues suite creation du monde revelations and the more recent gillespiana mr ailey has been featured on television notably on the red skelton and dave garroway shows but early in  he exposed an extension of his extraordinary gifts at which he had only hinted in the past he appeared as one of the trio of lead actors in the offbroadway call me by my rightful name and scored as a dramatic actor of power and promise but it is with alvin ailey the dancer and choreographer that this article is concerned for it is in the dance that he has forged new paths which it is his duty to explore more fully it is significant that alvin ailey achieves the first peak of what can only be a long and fruitful career at the very moment that his most famous predecessor katherine dunham returns with a new revue in another era it was dunham who showed the world how ethnic traditions could revolutionize the concept of modern dance from the dancing in on your toes to the sensational choreography of west side story the dunham influence has been everpresent it is fitting then that at an ailey performance hardly anyone in the audience bothered to reflect on the origins of anybody or anything    this is the goal toward which the long hard bitter struggle has been directed to the moment when talent needs no recommendation except itself

tuesday the allimportant day to james henry when the art supervisor made her once a month visit to the abraham lincoln elementary schoolnow no longer for just colored children but which still had rv just coloredon the outskirts of town the building was a hastily reconverted warehouse in need of painting again with windows so constructed that james henry could easily peer out without turning his head and see miss higgins five year old ford make lined tracks in the road in his own way james henry knew it really wasnt miss higgins who sparked this tremendous wave of excitement within him there were times the short plump white woman unnerved him by the way she hurriedly talked and looked into the chalk flecked space above their heads as if she were anxious to be somewhere else other than the always stuffy room with too much heat in the winter and burning sun warmth in the spring finally if she did deign to concentrate for a moment on one of the small heads before her she seemed to look through but never quite at the little one there no it wasnt miss higgins that caused him to often lie awake sleeplessly the night before but the longer art time enabling him to make things real from his mind to his hands onto paper after what appeared to be an eternity of time he saw miss higgins drive up the graveled lane and park beside the school all right class his teachers voice broke into his reverie were going to put up our readers and prepare for our art supervisors visit the heavy sound of desk tops being raised and books carelessly thrown into them were almost one now remember boys and girls were going to act very nicelike intelligent little people when miss higgins comes miss cain always said that and james henry often wondered why since to him they acted like nice people all the time carefully miss cain began to pass out the scarred paint boxes used by too many small hands in the past along with the coarse looking drawing paper of which there never seemed to be enough from the way she counted the eager dark eyes over and over again to be sure when the last tin of water had been apportioned miss higgins opened the door she perpetually arrived billowing a heavy shower of lilac perfumeher face powdered too thickly beneath the black felt hat worn throughout the school year good afternoon boys and girls good afternoon miss higgins they unisoned miss cain smileda different smile from her regular classroom one her mouth appeared jerky and tight making the thin coffee tinted cheekbones more prominent without taking off her hat only pausing long enough to quickly shut her purse and jacket in miss cains tiny locker miss higgins began today were going to try to do a spring scene now what do you think about when you think of spring a collection of multihued hands assailed the air since miss higgins j did not know their names or even seemed interested enough to askj voices tumbled out and over onj another  flowers y warm weather birds yes all of those and were going to put down our thoughts of springa nice warm southern spring like we have hereright on paper first lets james henry began to feel the familiar surge of excitement causing a tingling sensation to course through his body he picked up his brush staring at the small half dips of red blue green and yellow colors in the opened paint box before him already he could see touch and smell his spring on this chilly april day the spring he would soon like to see in his yard along the narrow wooded path to school and by the bank where the grass grew tall and cool smelling fresh and feeling damp beneath his outstretched form it was his yard he began to shape the flowers he had planted around the house and the old gnarled bent tree older than time shading the ground in the summer and warding off the wind in the winter oh this is delightful miss higgins exclaimed beside him then he looked up james henry paints very well miss cain said pride in her words maybe youll grow up to be an artist someday young man miss e liggins said someone like remrandt or michelangelo rembrandt and michelangelo lames he had never heard of but yet they were artists people who drew to live and lived to draw vaguely he wondered if they were colored much too soon miss cain said class im sorry but our art period is over over and to him it was just the beginning tell miss higgins good afternoon class good afternoon miss higgins they chorused politely on the way out of the room miss higgins suddenly turned to miss cain with a tiny surprised gasp oh my dear i almost forgot the community art league wants to enter some of the schools pictures in the state childrens art festival in all fairness they asked me to get a few representative pictures from here of course they just cant be any old thing and im not promising theyll even be accepted i understand miss cain said with the funny tight smile around her mouth again well see what we can do wonderful well goodbye class goodbye miss higgins when school ended james henry ran all the way home to the grey shingled house with the jagged yard around it his mother was in the kitchen busily frying the perch they had every friday for supper look mom look excitedly he clutched the paint box and piece of smooth white cardboard miss cain regretfully had said was all she had miss cain let me have these for the weekend who son my teacher mom what for to draw with she said james henry you take these home and paint whatever you feel like  wiping her hands on the wide apron the woman squinted curiously at the tightly clutched box and paper thats nice son thats certainly real nice miss cain says maybe ill be an artist when i grow up maybe she said sighing looking at and beyond him like she was already seeing him grown up she reached over the stove and put a heavy iron lid over the huge skillet covering the fishgolden brown hard crisp git ready n eat son you got to take your daddy his dinner hes got to work late tonight wonder what i can draw mom up to you n god son clear up to you n god after dinner he sat at the window gazing out trying to make the picture thought come i got it all ready son he took the brown bag his mother handed with the fish sandwiches and thermos of hot black coffee be careful now your daddy aint eaten since this morning i spect hes awful hungry all right mom he walked quickly down the dusty road beginning to loom dark in the twilight shouts of partly clad children playing in the road  dust around the rows of shot gun shacks raked the air further on he could soon see the railroad track and knew it wouldnt be long before he reached the canning factory where his father would be waiting by the gate ahead he saw a car approaching and moved closer to the side of the road suddenly the car pulled over beside him and stopped two white men peered out the one closest stared directly into his eyes hey you boy cmere tentatively he walked towards them wonder what hes got in that bag hes holding like a pot of gold the nearest one said james henry could smell the beer on his breath as the man pushed his face out the window he knew the smell from passing the taverns while shopping in town on saturday with his mother especially in the summer the smell would come out the door and blend angrily with the hot pavement damned if i know the driver said maybe it is gold boy you got gold in that bag his mother always told him to answer white people quick and polite then get away as soon as you could  no sir james henry said shaking his head its my daddys dinner sir  the man leaned over the bag hummm he said wrinkling his nose smells more like his mothers youknowwhat the second man laughed uproariously body pressing hard on the car horn thats a goddam good one a goddam good one its fish sir james henry said softly eyes a little frightened now your daddys dinner hey well  dont believe it  think its a pot of gold here gimme the bag n lets see instinctively the boy hesitated moving back slightly you hear me nigger boy gimme the bag the arm reached out quickly grabbing sandwiches sprawled over the road into the dust and the thermos fell and broke spilling hot coffee over his feet and ankles the hotness burst into hard pain well ill be damned it was his daddys dinner the first one said in mock amazement yeah and not his mas youknowwhat hawhawhaw then just as hurriedly the car roared forth with the laughter and the motor sound quickly gone first he wanted to cry and then he did all the way to the factory where his daddy was waiting in the grey dusk hey boy whats wrong a reassuring sound of a familiar voice in spurts gasps and in between tears he told him well dont worry bout it boy itll be all right them things happen to people like us best thing to do is forgit it i can wait only four more hours anyhow you go on home now ill be there directly the next evening he walked to miss cains house and gave her the picture carefully covered with brown wrapping paper he didnt wait until she looked at it but silently turned and left no more was said about the picture and soon spring came and june quickly followed then just before school was out for the summer miss cain took him to the principals office miss higgins was there and when he went in she looked at him very strangely for the first time he noticed her eyes were greyjust greyand that was all james henry the principal began coming from around his desk youd better brace yourself for a big surprise you won the first prize in the state childrens art festival ridiculously his tongue felt weightless and immovable after a while all he could say was yes sir the principals round brown face was smiling broadly and miss cain looked is if she was going to cry you know miss higgins said the award presentations will be made in our new museum and art institute in the state capitol the program will mark the official opening of the institute and your picture will be displayed there still smiling the principal patted james henrys shoulder itll be a big big day for you son only the big big day got all tangled up first his mother and father dressed up in their sunday clothes that monday his daddy looked different in the blue suit he seldom wore that was too short at the ankles and his mother looked odd in the one good black dress black hat and white gloves but they seemed very happy his mother kept flashing warm smiles at him and brushing imaginary lint from his blue suit when his daddy looked at him and said im sure proud of you son im sure proud he felt better than he had ever felt in all his life together they got in the car with miss cain to drive the fifteen miles to the state capitol after they got to the sprawling new museum and art institute with the two stone lions on each side of the iron gates and a confederate general in the middle of the steps they were stopped by the institutes guards the guards were sorry but they couldnt come in because it wasnt julythe one month in the year set aside for negro visitors just at that time miss higgins and a man dressed in a white linen suit hurried out of the building toward them thank goodness we were wondering if youd get here on time miss higgins said breathlessly the programs about to start well the man said staring  down at james henry is this the boy why yes miss higgins murmured glancing fleetingly at james henry thats james henry miss cain supplied hand lightly brushing his shoulder quickly the man extended his hand congratulations im mr rusick chairman of the state art festival committee you people should be mighty proud of this boy mighty proud we are suh his father answered softly eyes focused on the center of the white mans black tie we certainly are james henry was surprised that it was his father who had spoken and not his mother his father didnt have much to say especially to white people but neither did his mother for that matter lets go in before we hold up the works mr rusick said taking james henrys arm these people cant go in there the guard repeated blocking their path what do you mean cant go in there mr rusick said frowning i told em the institutes rule is for colored in july i miss higgins and mr rusick i stared at each other in amazement i both turning a deep red  this is ridiculous mr rusick f finally managed to say absolutely ridiculous why this boy won first    prize sorry mister rules are  rules  didnt make em groups of welldressed white people began climbing the steps and entering the building a small number of colored james henrys minister friends and a few relatives who had heard about the picture prize started up the steps saw them and paused nearby then the orange and black school bus bearing his classmates and the fifth grade teacher drove up the students got out quietly and stood beside the other colored and they all made one big shadow in the sun  god mr rusick mumbled angrily wiping his face with a clean white handkerchief this is preposterous he glanced embarrassed at the colored waiting out of hearing but somehow knowing this program was planned for this particular time to commemorate the opening of the new building we just assumed everyone would be welcomedregardless besides miss higgins said in a tiny awed whisper almost as if to herself but not quite to herself we had no idea a colored boy would win  dont care if a green eyed toad won mr rusick said this boy won the prize and he should go in there and get the award like everybody else well miss higgins began ive lived here all my life and its been like thiscertain times for colored at the state placesand will bei suppose but this is a joint school project mr rusick protested the schools are integrated i just dont understandi just dont understand he said over and over again the neat white gloves didnt conceal the quivering of james henrys mothers hands nor was the sun shining too brightly in his fathers eyes which kept blinking like he couldnt see or didnt want to see im going to call the governor mr rusick said turning and stalking pass the confederate statue from somewhere a newsman appeared and quickly snapped their pictures while it was being decided what to do with them later mr rusick came back shaking his head hes out of the state and cant be reached nobody else will handle it ratherfunnyisnt it miss higgins laughed shakily suddenly james henrys father spoke up quietly distantly mouthing words he had echoed over and over again at other times and places we dont want to cause no trouble suh well miss higgins interrupted smiling graciously at the bent colored man the programs been delayed long enough ill just have to bring the prize to the boy at school next week maybe miss cain can think of a nice little assembly program and then miss cain spoke up a hint of tears in her eyes lips trembling slightly nono we wont do that james henry earned that prize and it should be awarded by the committee as its supposed to be miss cain was tall but when she drew herself up like she was doing now it seemed she was tall and straight and brave as a warrior mr rusick go in there and get that picture and bring it out here tell that committee it can either come to us and present the award or the boy will reclaim the picture mr rusick looked at her quietly for a moment and all the world stopped in that moment then when he smiled the world came alive again youre quite right young lady quite right thats exactly what well do in a few moments the steps and yard were surrounded with guests award winners and the committee the small colored group did not move but remained there quietly impassively until james henry was given the silver cup prize with his name on it then the group broke into restrained applause faces lighting like multiple lit candles when the picture was unveiled there was a stunned awkward silence as they saw a small naked black boy standing in the dimmed greyness of a twilighted road looking toward the sky and crying large red blood tears while there was nothing around him except the penetrating dusk later they hung the picture in the art gallery but james henry never went back again after that to see his little black boy crying in the twilight not even when colored were allowed
short story writing in black south africa
the short story by black and controls restrictions and prosouth africans is the hibitions the principal feature of literary record of the these stories is the analytical study system of apartheid it of the african character the psymirrors the total im chological adjustment the accompact of that system upon the af modation to the system this charricans the coloureds mixed acter is conceived as a hero far rebloods and the indians caught in moved from the standard code the complex mass of regulations of moralitythe antihero concept the heroes of these short stories are pickpockets hijackers payroll robbers beggars and other generous assortments of social maladjusts acts of heroism are marked by games at beating the law stealing from whitesa calculated defiance against law and order the police and whites in general are the villains or the victims this short story hero is invested with a birdofpassage morality concentrates into every minute or every hour the feverishness of intense living our hero abandons himself to the lower freedomsthe freedom from morality and the freedom of vice and because of the dichotomy of the social structure of south africa the hero functions on the fringe of a culture which is rejecting him in a society which has labelled him pedigreed him and then discriminates against him to understand this character the motives behind the seemingly irrational behaviourit is necessary to understand the psychological mores of the kind of society which produces this state of mind nadine gordimersouth africas most perceptive writeris illuminating in her analysis of it the greatest single factor in the making of our mores in south africa was and is and will be the colour question it is far more than a question or a matter of prejudice or discrimination or conflict or loyaltieswe have built a morality on it we have gone even deeper we have built our own sense of  sin and our own form of tragedy we have added hazards of our own to mans fate and to save his soul he must wrestle not only with the usual lust greed and pride but also with a set of demons marked made in south africa a colourcaste society like south africa must establish definite identifiable groups with consistent group attitudes in a society like britains where the visibility of the social groups has been lowered by the commercialization of the uniformity of dress and the democratization of social institutions it is still the establishment which is surrounded by the symbols of opulence they dominate the economy and therefore the social structure but in south africa where the different social groups have high visibility the whitesa numerical minorityhave arrogated to themselves all the symbols of wealth and authority and have arranged themselves as a political majority the nonwhite groups africans coloureds indians form the numerical majority which is invested with symbols of inferiority and are a minority politically against the background of this social dichotomy the short story highlights attitudes between blacks i and whitesextragroup relations j and the attitudes among the i blacks themselvesintragroup re y lations the problems of race the attitudes and the relations that go with it are present in all life in south africa we are born into race prejudice we live with it we die with it and are buried with it with all these groups arranged against each otherthe one dedicated to maintaining it the other committed to smashing itforce becomes implicit conflicts arise and since race prejudice is written into the law there is no common arbiter the parties must decide for themselves the arbitrament of the sword becomes if not the moral but the real arbiter and thus force becomes the expression and violence the clarification of the society the tone of the short story is primarily that of protest the african character must arrange himselfsurviveunder the system with some personal dignity his reaction is implicit in his behaviour to the white man and this behaviour will be determined by the circumstance and the situation in which he finds himself his behaviour is changeable and his pattern of behaviour may be analysed into these three forms submission and accommodation aggression and escape or flight in the first category the attitude of the african to the white man is that of servility he observes the proper forms of address using the appropriate terms of reference he exploits these proper forms of address when in trouble or when seeking to extract favours from his overlords the africans whole existence his personal safety depends on depth studies of the south african white thus the african understandshe has tothe white man more than the white man will ever know the african the white man mourns with lyricism the passing from the scene of the good native thus the african in trouble will obsequiously resurrect the image of that noble savage this character merely accommodates the system without in any way beginning to accept it the african character differs from the other nonwhite characters in that he acceptsrather than regretsthe blackness of his face in my own short stories the characters accept the physical reality of their colour and then proceed to exploit it in exactly the same way that a beggar needs to be horribly deformed to be able to milk peoples sympathy in the short story the professional beggar to the disability of being black is added physical deformitya kind of double indemnity nathan serurubele is educated to highschool level but is condemned to being a beggar for a living not that he is unable to earn a living but because he is crippled he submits to their construction that to be disabled is to be necessarily dependent upon the charity of a society which will destroy a mans pride rather than set aside the charity mentality nathan serurubeles pride is too humiliated by the degradation and it is this humiliation which sustains him he becomes a professional beggar organizing himself into a commercial enterprise he is arrested and the scene before the magistrate is a cynical exploitation of peoples sympathy the disability is used mercilessly as a weapon to assault the sensibilities of the whites your lordshipmy honour most of us beg because we have been ostracized by our parents    by everybody people treat us like lepers they have trained us conditioned us to look up to them for all the things we need no one wants to employ uspeople are more willing to offer us charity rather than give us jobs all they ever do is show us pity we want to be given a chance to prove were as good as anybody this character has realized that ability is rejected inclusively with the colour of his skin that being black is analogous to being deformeda physical handicap in the athletics of earning a living his personal philosophy becomes thus if anything is worth doing its worth doing well nathan serurubele accepts this condition and the commitment to it in south africa privilege is white and nonwhites are placed on different levels of underprivileged the indians and the coloureds are situated on a higher level of privilege than the afri cans psychologically the indians and the coloureds tend to gravitate further and further from black nearer to white to them it is a misfortune not to have been born white and they emphasize this by their own brand of rejection of and discrimination against the afri cans these two groups are obsessed by a white complex this is perhaps understandable in a society where white is the positive standard and black the negative as it is implicit in the label nonwhite in the short story the bench j by richard rives whose story the strike appeared in the april negro digest an indian schoolteacher living in cape town the indignation at being nonwhite instead of white is shown as the motivation behind the social protest it is not white domination which is being protested against but its singling out of those who were not born white it is the effect it has and not the condition itself which is under fire being white and being privileged are confused to mean the same thing richard rives captures the essential tone of the ambivalence to the colour white the scene is a political meeting and a speaker says we form an integral part of a complex society in which a vast proportion of the population is denied the very basic right of existence a society that condemns a man to an inferior position because he has the misfortune to be born black a society that can only rej tain its precarious social and ecoj nomic position at the expense of an enormous oppressed mass  the coloureds and the indians  are a lighter skin colour than the africans a pigmentorial quality which places them closer to white the coloureds in particular since they are publicly described as the appendages of the whites requestby commensurate approximation  proportional privileges improved conditions in their social status and gradual integration acceptance and accommodation as a reaction to social prejudice is determined by the situation as illustrated in the short stories themselvesthe individual finds himself in thus the african policeman the teacher in bantu education schools the people who serve on tribal councils school boards etc have to accommodate the system even if it is implied that they are the instruments of their own oppression the next pattern of behaviour analyzed by the short stories is that of aggression directed against the system like america south africa has a frontier or voortrekker mentality a savage throwback to the days when the law dangled in the holster or the shot gun and justice was swift informal and prejudiced lynchings and horse whippings are deep in the traditions of these countries both are compulsive addicts to horse operas under stress the average man in america and in south africa will resort to violence in south africa violence exists as the expression of the public conscience this violence is contained in the law it is the instrument of maintaining law and order the african character lives in the screaming wake of this violence and unlike most south african attitudes violence is truly colour blind compulsively driven by frustration the african directs his aggression against himself this ingroup aggression is directed against the more successful afri j cans who are by and large re sented for being successful because success is seen as the quality of being white on the surface the motives for this aggression may be for material gain or just lawless rebellion against form and cohesion where form and cohesion are symbols of authority which is white this african character lives so close to death that death becomes the reflection of the empty gestures of the living a defiance against his life death revenges the african character against life it is both sides of a single reality death is the master who must be paid and although this character may fear death he is fascinated by it because he is familiar with it he courts it he jokes about it he dares it he surrenders himself to it and then death becomes a refuge from the burden of being black in white south africa in the short stories of arthur  maimane a journalist on a london news agency death purges bis characters from being black his m characters defy death they run from the police ignore the order to stop and defy the warning shots compulsively runningrunning away from south africa into death arthur maimanes stories just a tsotsi and a manner of speaking probes the depths of desperation which his characters have reached in the story just a tsotsi his character is arrested for a pass offence and during the assault upon him by the police he breaks from them and starts running he is ordered to stop but he continues running  now hes asking for trouble hannes said seeing a chance to vindicate himself with one fluid motion he grabbed his rifle from where it was leaning against the wall and fell down on one knee he wont be cheeky any more after this he fired deliberately low the bullet hitting the ground between the running boys legs and ricocheting at an angle with a whine the boy yelped and ran faster dont kill him hannes the corporal said in a low tight voice hannes laughed this is what ive been waiting for his next shot whined close by the boys ear with another frightened yelp the boy crouched down and started running zigzag fashion he had almost reached the gate now he straightened up to grab at the post and swing round it hannes grinned and fluidly shifted his rifle to the hand holding the post he fired two quick shots smashing the hand vith the first and hitting the boys head with the secc id as it came round and above the t ost the violence strikes out against  everybody and perhaps with more eroticism against ourselves the incidence of drunkenness crime and violence in urban black communities is alarmingly high the anger of the african character is always a going to extremes we love parties nicetimes noise and people we are sweating in a world where death is all around us a world in which only death has value in our attempts to obliterate timethe minutes of our lives we intoxicate ourselves with orgiastic pleasures noise and people and then when we are dizzy we annihilate ourselves we kill each other for pleasure for revenge for caprice aggression directed against the whitesthe outgroupsis more complex and variable it may be physical as demonstrated in the high incidents of crime and violence or more overt as on the personal level where insolence against the white man is common there is always some sort of rebellion against the race attitudes in the story a manner of speaking by arthur maimane the character is aggressively insistent on maintaining his dignity by being courteous but refusing to conform to the ster  eotype of the african being in solent or cheekyby south afri can standardsbecomes a game which at the end of the story is to cost him his life after a minute he coughed the young woman turned her head slowly her eyes narrowed as she recognized him she looked out of the window again he coughed louder ja what do you want she asked without looking at him two tuppence stamps please she took the four steps towards the counter slowly hands on broad hips and head stuck out ahead of the body she stood across the counter from him her grey eyes boring into his say missis  she said quietly the middleaged woman looked up from her novel and studied the two he remained silent if you dont say missis youre not getting your stamps look mevrou all i want is two tuppence stamps ive said please and that should be enough say missisor get out he stared back for a moment shrugged his shoulders and walked out physical violence strikes out against everybody the african character is always reacting scratching at the wall of colour prejudice accommodating it being aggressive to it or looking around for escapein compensationor taking flight from it  going to other parts of africa or i running away to europe in search of a gentler political climate escape from the colour bar is the subtlest of the reactions of the african character the coloured and the indian the south african public image is white the values of that society are white and all the sex symbols are white and consequently the africans and the coloureds have to arrange themselves under the code of this standard since to be white is to be privileged the coloureds with low visibilityfair enough to pass for whiteescape into the domain of the whites and the africans of lighter skinthe less clearly visible africanssteal into the structure of the coloured group for the coloureds it means the end of living in social igloos the end of discrimination it means sliding into white society access into white restaurants cinemas theaters bars and other symbols of white privilege it is freedom to the lightskinned african it is an end to the regulations and the strangulations of the document called the pass passing himself off as a coloured will give the african freedom of movement the opportunity to select and accept the job of his own choice and the relief from being at the black bottom of the colour scale this escape into another colo »r the rationalizations for it are illustrated in my own short story the havenots why go all sentimental this is a battle between the haves and the havenots the haves have made being black too much of a burden and the only way to survive is to fool them by playing their own game they made white a symbol of privilege and comfort so i decided to be as near white as i can bleach its not my fault im lightskinnednothing like enough to pass for lily white that isbut sufficiently to masquerade as a coloured okay okay i said raising my hand as a sign of peace whats in being a native anyway black devil black pitchforking devil black thats alljust black black black well i dont wanna be blacknot any more youll never be a white man steve said contemptously i dont wanna be a white man i shouted i just want to be white just white  of particular interest is the way in which the nonwhite groups particularly the africanswill live with this situation and even retain their sense of humour without in any way beginning to accept it the nonwhite groups have been educated into an acceptance of their own inferiority and in some insidious way this educating has had some effect for this doctrine to be acceptedor even suspected the education into this accommodation or even acceptance will be directed towards elevating whiteness as some unattainable ideal some unobtainable standard all ambition will be directed physically towards or to an association with it the coloureds especially the ones with a darker skin have a psychosis about marrying coloured girls with a much fairer complex ion this woman becomes the substitute for white alternately the african man seeks to marry a lightskinned african girlpreferably a coloured girl this preoccupation with skin colour is a feature in the story forbidden love by d can themba the african character falls in love with a coloured girlhis personal substitute for white his psychological rejection of black comes into conflict against the coloured girls physical rejection of black the question of colour foreshadows the conflict she turned her head and placed her chin on his chest somehow mike she tried to explain softened again now i feel trapped by a doubly guilty shame im ashamed that its my people who are in the foreground of every move against your peopleashamed of my father whom i love but whos violent in his hatred of africans ashamed of my sister louisa who ought to feel nearer your people but hates them so unreasonably ashamed of my brothers shame for having been reclassified as an african ashamed of my mothers silence when i suspect i know it that she disapproves of their attitudes and then sweetie sometimes when i listen to them all iii am ashamed in a queer way thatj i hate myself for this secret love of ours  another form taken by escape behaviour is one expressed by means of compensation the african character is obsessed with easing his condition he surrounds  himself with the symbols of the society which is rejecting him he wants to be accepted he wants to qualify to be civilized so he develops a love for academic trappings and the related trinkets of opulence he flaunts his wealth he drives in big cars prefers publiclibrarysized houses filled with enormous pieces of furniture he erects these monuments both as a symbol of success and to his own sense of insecurity in south africa where opportunity and wealth are white such an african reasons that if to be white is to be wealthy then conversely to be wealthy should be to be white thus the african buys not a car but a status symbol the car must be big and flashypreferably a cadillacfor success has to have a high visibility this reaction is also manifest in the vulgarity of the makeup african women wear if to be white is to be painted with makeup the african woman in her search of this ideal adds on the paint with generous vulgarity straightens the tropic curl from her hair by burning the hair with a hot comb and she bleaches her face with lotions it is necessary that this should be done with vulgarity whatever she does must be better than the best in a tedious succession of escapist short stories published in drum zonk and other south african popular magazines the african indian and the coloured characters are paraded as gaudily successful boxing promoters tough private detectives and other cardboard images of romanticism yet even against this background the escapist short story hero is seldom if everon the side of formal law and order his efforts are directed at flaunting the law but in the short stories of ezekiel mphahlele famous educator and writer the characters do not easily fall into the categories defined in this analysis primarily because the author believes that the african character should be portrayed as a purely fictional character and not as a mould cast in racial tensions in his stories the african exists on a level far removed from the tensions of the colour bar which is not necessarily a hazard in his life author mphahlele insists upon the african portrayed as a human character wrestling with the basic hazards of man greed lust and pride in the story i the suitcase ezekiel mphahlele  emphasizes the motive of greed be  hind timis action of claiming the suitcase abandoned in a bus but behind every motive is cause and effect the position of the individual in any societyin particular that of south africa and to a lesser extent that of britainis determined by the colour or social caste into which that character is born that timi is black is implicit in the young white typists impersonal attitude towards him the same attitude is seen in the foreman they are not addressing themselves to timi the individual but to a black mask timi reacts by smiling knowingly this reaction is particularly interesting in that timi accommodates the depersonalization the grim reality of his situation returned to him with all its cold and aching pain today he had been led on something of a wild goose chase he had been to three places where the chances of getting work were promising he had failed at one firm he was told weve already got a boy john at the second firm a tiny typist told him youre too big jim the boss wants a small boyabout eighteen you know then she had gone on with her typing clouding her white face with cigarette smoke at the third place a short pudgy white man put down his price in a squeaky voice two pounds ten a week three pounds ten a week timi had said take it or leave it my boy was the proprietors final word timi chuckled to himself as he thought of the mans face his fat white cheeks and small blinking eyes ezekiel mphahleles white characters in the suitcase are not just human characters they are south african white the human character in any fiction has to function within the society which produces that character in the story down the quiet street also by ezekiel mphahlele there is no mention of the white figure nor is the colour question implied the characters come to life vividly with all the humour that is african the orchestration of the characters is flawless it is a recount of the story of the endless funeral processions which trailed down nadia street week after week short ones long ones poor insignificant ones rich snobbish ones there is a kind of escapist romanticism in the setting of this short story and but for the smuggling of liquor the story might be set outside south africa the reasons behind the liquor smuggling is not because prohibition is general but that it operates against africans only the african must drink and to do this he must be one jump ahead of the law no device is left unexplored even the sanctity of the funeral ritual is violated during one of those inevitable human accidents an incident reveals the se¦ cret of those funeral processions one of the coffins cracks and a miniature avalanche of bottles came down to the ground in his more angry moods ezekiel mphahleles characters protest against the colour bar and against white attitudes all life in south africa is dominated by the impact of one colour upon the other the colour bar motivates all our actions all our reactions and all our attitudes the whites act in a manner determined by the roles they have to play in a dominant society the africans the indians and the coloureds react to one another and towards the white man in the various forms outlined in this analysis they may accept or accommodate the colour bar in accordance to the situation they are in they may be aggressive in their rejection of the situation or find a way of escape or take flight from it but there is always the physical presence of the colour bar examined in this essay are the social conditions and group attitudes which shape the pattern of the south african black short story all nuances of life of human relationships are contained in it perhaps in time other influences will insinuate different attitudes order a new society which will have a more fluid social mobility with a new set of relationships the short story will be there to interpret the new society meantime for so long as the social structure in present day south africa persists for so long will the africanrather the south african character wrestle with a set of demons marked made in south africa 
in june   a delegation of six quakers representing o the annual meeting of the progressive friends came to the white house lincoln told them he was relieved to learn that were not °ffice seekers for his chief trouble was  from that class of persons sensing their mission lincoln informed his visitors that his next most troublesome subject was slavery in the discussion that followed lincoln matched his visitors in earnestness but he did not promise them that he would issue a proclamation of freedom as they wished sometime within the space of the next three weeks however the president decided that the time had come for an edict of emancipation lincoln did not take lightly the wishes of religious groups but more important in shaping his determination was the military situation things were not going well on the war front in late june and early july  richmond the confederate capital had withstood a bloody siege thus sending aglimmering the hope that the south would soon sue for peace a prolonged war now became inevitable which meant calling up additional troops and evoking a fresh source of inspiration for this latter moralebuilding component lincoln took the course that had been urged upon him for so many months by church groups abolitionists and negroesa presidential decree of freedom during the first days of july lincoln began to put together the first draft of an emancipation proclamation the writing was done in the cipher room of the military telegraph office at the desk of superintendent thomas t eckert    sixtytwo days were to elapse before lincoln could issue the proclamation during this period he had to keep his intentions secret worse still he had to endure the jibes of the abolitionists and the more restrained but equally pointed criticisms of other reformist groups lincoln had to listen to the vehement antislavery views of his friend cassius clay returned from his post in russia he had to receive religious groups who urged immediate emancipation such as the large delegation of chicago clergymen who spent an hour in earnest and frank discussion at the white house on september  what good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do he asked the clergymen i do not want to issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be inoperative like the popes bull against the comet i the most influential of the lincoln critics during the two months while the proclamation lay in the darkness of a desk drawer was the energetic horace greeley editor of the widely read letter dated august  and printed on the editorial page of the next days tribune was a piece from mr greeleys own pen bearing an impressive title the prayer of twenty millions addressed to lincoln the editorial complained of the seeming subserviency of your policy to the slaveholding slaveryupholding interest loyal americans wrote greeley demanded that lincoln enforce the second confiscation act liberating the slaves of rebels on the face of this wide earth mr president there is not one disinterested determined intelligent champion of the union cause who does not feel that all attempts to put down the rebellion and at the same time uphold its inciting cause are preposterous and futile greeleys public letter was welcomed by lincoln it gave him a chance to do two things restate his own position and prepare the public mind  for an emancipation proclamation issued upon military necessity on august  in one of his most important state papers lincoln released his reply to the press his opening lines were eventoned and conciliatory if said he greeleys letter was impatient and dictatorial in tone he overlooked it in deference to a long friendship he did not mean lincoln continued to leave anyone in doubt as to the policy i seem to be pursuing as you say my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union  if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union    these added lincoln in a final short paragraph were his official views and were not intended as any change in his repeatedly expressed personal wishes that all men everywhere could be free    by saturday september  lincoln was assured of the withdrawal of the confederate forces on the next day he went to the soldiers home and wrote out his second draft of the preliminary proclamation and then read it aloud to vicepresident hannibal hamlin with the document much as he wanted it lincoln was now ready for the historic day of its promulgationseptember   on noon of that monday lincoln met with his cabinet in special session with everyone present it was evident that this was an important occasion lincoln sought to reduce the tension by reading a passage from humorist artemus ward then abandoning his light tone lincoln informed his solemnfaced and attentive associates that he had vowed he would issue an emancipation proclamation as soon as the rebels were driven out of maryland that time had now come he had brought them together explained lincoln to hear what he had written he did not solicit their advice on the wisdom of the step he had determined that for himselfbut he would listen to any comments on style or wording lincoln then read the document through making remarks wrote chase on several points as he went along this preliminary emancipation negro colonization the act of march   forbidding officers to return runaways and the second confiscation act of july   but the heart of the proclamation was the opening phrases of the third paragraph that on the first day of january in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtythree all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforward and forever free after he had finished lincoln waited for comments chase and montgomery blair made brief statements seward suggested two modifications to which lincoln had no objections then the cabinet was dismissed later that afternoon lincoln and seward signed the proclamationas negroes and their wellwishers read over the preliminary emancipation proclamation they could not fail to note the complete absence of any abolitionist fervor or pronegro sentiment plainly lincoln had not followed the abolitionistnegro line that the favor of the almighty was to be gained not by force of arms but by the panoply of righteousness indeed this document of september   sounded like a cross between a military directive and a lawyers brief its opening sentence set its tone in it lincoln called attention to his authority as commander in chief of the army and navy and he stated that the aim of the war was the restoration of the union moreover in the edict lincoln stated that efforts at negro deportation would be continued and of course slavery was to be abolished only in those places in rebellion not in places where the stars and stripes actually flew to abolitionists the proclamation had another drawback it gave the rebellious states the opportunity of keeping their slaves if they would lay down their arms by january  but nobody the abolitionists included made much of this alternative inasmuch as nobody high or low north or south believed that the people of the confederacy would listen to lincolns terms despite the proclamations limitations negroes hailed it with much joy the war wrote frederick douglass was now invested with sanctity a few celebrations were held the largest was one of new york city negroes at shiloh church on september  the man who called this meeting and organized it was henry highland garnet who simply could not wait until january  as he had already been waiting for nearly two decades i do pray garnet had written on september   from troy new york to g a thatcher that you and i may see that great dayi mean the emancipation day o that the lord may hasten it on at the enthusiastic and crowded meeting at shiloh church garnet presided was one of the main speakers and delivered the benediction most negroes were too prudent to follow garnets example preferring instead to wait until january  when the final proclamation was due for negroes while ever hopeful were also ever realistic they knew that lincolns preliminary edict was little more than the declaration of an intention they knew that there was nothing in custom or in law that could compel him to follow it up would the president issue the final proclamation this was the momentous question before the negroes during those fourteen weeks from september  to january those fateful one hundred days of the countdown during this period the negro listened intently for telltale sounds from the white house but lincolns words and actions seemed to take on all the ambiguity of a delphic oracle   entering into lincolns deliberation and fixing his determination about issuing an emancipation proclamation were considerations of a varied naturemilitary political and diplomatic to lincoln the first of these was preeminent military necessity required that the enemy be deprived of his slaves lincoln knew that the black population of the south was one of its greatest assets the confederacy had not actually put a gun in the hands of the colored man but tens of thousands of its slaves saw frontline service being employed as orderlies teamsters and military laborers slaves who remained on the home front supplied the skills for the factories and the brawn for working the mines and it was the labor of the plantation slave that produced the cotton the south hoped to sell in england to weaken this black arm of the confederacy had become the first order of military business a blunt fact from which lincoln could not flinch  in the late summer of  on september  lincoln told secretary chase that the emancipation proclamation had been issued solely as a military necessity and not because it was politically expedient or morally right nonetheless political considerations had influenced the issuing of the edict himself a republican lincoln was obliged to make concessions to the point of view of his party including its radical wing as the war went on with no end in sight these radicals became more insistent than ever that the abolition of slavery become an officially avowed goal of the war the support of these radicals was important to the lincoln administration and this support could be jeopardized without an edict of emancipation    the extent to which political considerations shaped the issuing of the emancipation edict becomes evident in lincolns dealings with the altoona conference governors andrews of massachusetts had called a meeting of loyal governors to be held at altoona pennsylvania during the last week of september  as announced in the call the chief aim of the conference was to press for action against slavery lincoln was not asleep by a shrewd stroke he proceeded to undercut the scheduled conference he summoned governors curtin and andrew to the white house and told them of the emancipation proclamation lying in his desk awaiting a battlefield victory curtin and andrew realized that they had been outflanked they had also been won over  fortunately for lincoln the victory at antietam enabled him to issue his proclamation before the altoona meeting after their conference the governors came to washington in a group and called at the white house on september  they congratulated lincoln on the issuing of the proclamation and lincoln with a straightfaced solemnity matching theirs told them that their approval of the measure assured him more than anything else that he had done the right thing a third important factor in bringing about and supporting the proclamation was european particularly english opinion in england the governing and aristocratic classes were antinorth and would have been glad to extend diplomatic recognition to the confederacy but the masses and the middle class in the british isles were union sympathizers and disliked the south as slaverys strongest bastion in the western world in large measure the groundwork for this british antislavery sentiment had been laid by american negroes who for a quarter of a century had been touring england ireland and scotland many of these negroes were escaped slaves like william wells brown who in five years abroad made over a thousand addresses william and ellen craft moved british audiences to tears with the story of their dramatic escape from macon georgia with ellen disguised as a young slavemaster the procession of negroes did not abate with the war american negroes like j sella martin acted almost as if they were ministers without portfolio in furthering the union cause far from her salem massachusetts home the young eloquent and earnest sarah p remond always effective on the platform exhorted her listeners to stand firm let no diplomacy of statesmen no intimidation of slaveholders no scarcity of cotton no fear of slave insurrections prevent the people of great britain from maintaining their position as the friend of the oppressed negro the greatest drawing card among the american negroes during the autumn of  was william andrew davis the escaped excoachman of confederate president jefferson davis these negroes like their counterparts before the war did much to intensify the antislavery sentiment of the british masses lincoln knew that reformist groups and workingmens associations in england would hail an edict of emancipation he was aware too that such a proclamation would be a heavy blow to the foreign policy of the confederacy striking king cotton diplomacy in a most vulnerable spot after the emancipation proclamation was issued the confederate agents stationed in european capitals were no longer able to play down the slavery issue by asserting that the north had no intention of changing the status of the black man    member of parliament and reformer richard cobden who was interested in free men as well as in free trade was sure that lincolns edict turned the tide of public opinion in the british isles you know he wrote to charles sumner from londons athenaeum club on february   how much alarmed i was from the first lest our government should interpose in your affairs    this state of feeling existed up to the announcement of the presidents emancipation policy from that moment our old antislavery feeling began to arouse itself and it has been gathering strength ever since    the final emancipation proclamation was signed on the scheduled date considering the widespread discussion of it during the preceding one hundred days the signing ceremonies were quiet and undramatic indeed almost offhand on the afternoon of january  the document was ready for the presidents signature after he had spent nearly half a week on and off working it over he had held cabinet meetings on each of the last three days of the year on december  reading the proclamation to the heads of departments on the next day furnishing them with copies for their criticisms and on the last morning of the year reconvening them for final revisions the afternoon of that december  lincoln spent in reviewing the notes and memoranda submitted by the cabinet members and in framing his language he then began the rewriting of the entire document making sure that his penmanship was spencerian in clarity if not in slant up early the next morning and clearheaded after a new years eve without revels lincoln completed his writing and sent the finished product to the state department to be engrossed shortly before eleven oclock the document was returned to the white house lincoln was on the point of signing it when he noticed an error in the attestation as a clerk had used the phraseology common to a treaty rather than to a proclamation staying his signature the chief executive rushed off to the blue room to undergo a threehour ritual of handshaking the reception at the white house on new years day was a long established custom lincoln and his wife stood in the short receiving line to be wished a happy  the first hour was reserved for officialdom diplomats high army brass navy officers congressmen and federal judges then for two hours came the general public    by midafternoon the reception was over and lincoln could return to the executive office waiting for him was the properly engrossed proclamation spread out on the desk by secretary seward not more than a dozen informally gathered witnesses were present as lincoln reached for his steeltipped pen its inksplattered wooden handle rough from gnawing lincoln feared that his signature would be tremulous and uneventhree hours of hand shaking he explained to schuyler colfax that evening is not calculated to improve a mans chirography but if his arm was limp and his hand was unsteady his will was firm to himself but loud enough so that it could be heard by frederick seward the secretary of states son he remarked anyway it is going to be done carefully and slowly he traced abraham lincoln not abbreviating his first name as he so often did 
why lincoln freed the slaves
abraham lincoln was a great american and a great president in the civil war crisis one with a vision of freedom for his nation a pioneer in political freedom one who was devoted to duty and to his ideals one who sacrificed for his achievements and gave his life in martyrdom for his cause but even in explaining the emancipation proclamation lincoln did not regard himself as a great man but rather modestly said i claim not to have controlled events but confessed plainly that events have controlled   » me it is in this spirit that we approach the subject of abraham lincoln    in the first place while there is considerable difficulty in discovering the real lincoln it can be said that abraham lincoln was not an abolitionist and he was not a proslavery advocate there were several types of antislavery men there were radical abolitionists i such as william lloyd garrison almost in a class by himself and such men as wendell phillips and gerrit smith there were educators and ministers with antislavery views horace mann and theodore parker there were statesmen with antislavery views salmon p chase and charles francis adams there were also many hundred whose views were antislavery but who were mild in their expressions what was lincolns real attitude and opinion in early years his career in early years was similar to that of a politician who was a rough product of pioneer parents in early rural kentucky and who had married into a slaveholding family he broke openly with the abolitionists and even declined to go along with the free soil party the influence of environment had considerable value upon his career he shared with southerners some of their views concerning the negro    the fact that abraham lincoln was born in kentucky taken to indiana at the age of seven years and from there to the great state of illinois had its influence on his lifes attitudes toward colored americans buttressed by the moving events of the civil war the fact that there were antislavery sentiments expressed by him is very clearly shown in one of his early speeches when he said if slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong i cannot remember when i did not think so and feel so attempts have been made to show the origins of lincolns opinions on the negro and slavery they have moved all the way from a belief that god endowed abraham lincoln with a dislike of slavery and used him as his instrument to destroy it to the belief that he was merely an instrument in the hands of events however the official biographers of abraham lincoln nicolay and hay state that these attempts seem an idle waste of labor these sentiments came with the first awakening of his mind and conscience and were aroused into active life and energy by the sight of fellow creatures in chains on an ohio steamboat and on the wharf at new orleans    however it is well to note that abraham lincoln differed sharply with abolitionists in reference to slavery at one time it is reported that he appeared as a councilor for a kentucky slaveholder seeking the return of a fugitive slave his first public avowal on slavery was made as a representative in the illinois legislature in  this was the period following which congress had declared that all abolition petitions should be laid on the table without discussion the proposal being for the purpose of decreasing acrimonious debate when similar resolutions were presented in the illinois legislature in  abraham lincoln and daniel stone his colleague from sangamon county protested against this on march   this attitude was further revealed in the lincolndouglas debates in  stephen douglas was wont during these debates to accuse lincoln of endeavoring to establish what he called social equality and on one occasion he used the expression abe lincoln and other abolitionists wanted to i marry negroes lincoln answered j on september   spurning the doctrine then known as social  equality in his fourth debate with i douglas i am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black racesthat i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intimacy with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black faces which i believe forbids the two living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of the superior and the inferior and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race and again lincoln answered i protest against the counterfeit logic which concludes that because i do not want a black woman for a slave i must necessarily want her for a wife he criticized the dred scott decision because it decreed that a negro could not be a united states citizen and yet he said i told douglas very frankly i am not in favor of negro citizenship however it was lincolns view that the states had the power to make the negro a citizen and said he if the state of illinois had that power i should be opposed to the exercise of it lincoln later changed his halfslave and halffree declaration to the effect that all states have the right to do exactly as they please about slavery but yet he opposed the spread of slavery to the territories he also emphasized the moral evil of slavery joining fc the same with his moderation and tolerance and yet as a politician he permitted his law partner herndon to keep in touch with antislavery people    lincolns opinions on slavery were maturing gradually with the passing years it would be difficult to prove that lincoln changed his ideas about slavery but it is evident that they were maturing developing and following events of war and that he was not the uncompromising and outspoken opponent of slavery the great emancipator as hero worshipers would conclude however nothing is more compelling and more plain than that one of the background motives of abraham lincolns career was his antipathy to slavery when lincoln assumed office as president his policy was again a conservative one he assured a kentucky democrat that he would administer the fugitive slave law as honestly and as fairly as mr buchanan had done to alexander stephens he wrote do the people of the south really entertain fears that a republican administration would directly or indirectly interfere with the slaves or with them about the slaves if they do i wish to assure you as once a friend and still i hope not an enemy that there is no cause for such fears the south would be in no more danger than in the days of washington in the inaugural address of  he disclaimed especially no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists and any design to violate the rights of the states on the subject of slavery this statement was in accordance with the republican platform of  which proclaimed the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states to control their domestic institutions it may be alleged that these were the shrewd observations of a politician used by a man who was a master politician to prevent a more decided opposition from the border states to secure to his administration the support of many doubters at the north and to express the view that he would not ally himself with the abolition wing of the republican party not long after he had been in office president lincoln was forced to deal with the practical questions of slavery the movements of union troops released slaves and made them free at first the commanders were permitted to decide the question as a local one when general fremont in  had undertaken the declaration that confiscated slaves were free in missouri lincoln overruled him when general hunter in  declared the slaves free held by their owners in georgia florida and south carolina lincoln vetoed the measure saying that he reserved to himself as commanderinchief of the army and navy to declare the slaves of any state or states free and when it shall become a neces sity indispensable to the maintenance of our government lincolns policy was a policy of discretion and of expediency which he declared i reserve to myself the important policy of lincoln toward slavery was based on compensated emancipation he believed that the states should emancipate the slaves the slaveholders must be paid for their property in slaves the federal government must bear the cost in bonds the states should have time even until  and that the colored people should be persuaded to be colonized in a foreign land with federal aid when horace greeley through the tribune issued his prayer for twenty millions urging freedom for the slaves and that president lincoln should strike boldly at slavery lincoln replied my paramount object is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do also that and yet he said that he expressed his personal wish that all men everywhere could be free here then was the president of the united states speaking not as a man who was necessarily an advocate of negro freedom and negro equality but one who spoke as the president of the united states this is fundamental to the understanding of abraham lincolns attitude toward the negro congress was ahead of the president in emancipation policyand this fact is too often ignored the dramatic announcement of the preliminary proclamation and the emancipation proclamation which seized the popular imagination and has been kept alive by orators and writers has dimmed the emancipation acts of the congress of the united states these congressional activities were prior to lincolns action and were evidences that congress was ahead of the president and also that he ignored the action of congress and acted when he issued the proclamation as if congress had done nothing on july   lincoln advised secretaries gideon welles and seward according to welles that he had about reached the conclusion that a proclamation of emancipation was absolutely essential for the salvation of the union two days later secretary chase states that he announced that he would issue such a proclamation finding that he could gather influence from northern elements for there was increase of war radicalism the presence of thousands of negroes within union lines recognizing that the international aspects of a northern antislavery policy would cause distress to the south t particularly in england and supported by general lees retreat from pennsylvania to virginia and general braggs retreat from kentucky the preliminary proclamation of emancipation as a war measure was issued on september   this preliminary proclamation was welcomed with acclaim by the abolitionists and by the people of color in the united » states but was received rather coldly by the nation as a whole and it was said that states would be turning away from the president in the ensuing elections the emancipation proclamation declaring slaves in the rebellious states then thenceforth and forever free was a war expedient it was a war measure which lincoln said was an act warranted by the constitution upon military necessity it was intended to affect enemy territory for it also declared that the executive government would not act to repress any efforts that negroes in slavery would make for their actual freedom and yet he urged them to abstain from all violence unless in selfdefense this proclamation was not an encouragement to violence but it meant that colored men might fight for their freedom as soldiers the picture of an emancipator breaking the chains of slavery in the united states through this proclamation is false the proclamation exempted parts of louisiana tennessee and virginia and in states under union control it proclaimed emancipation where there was no power to execute it lincoln himself admitted that measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful by be coming indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation however the proclamation was a symbol of the fact that the war was not only to save the union but also to free the slaves for in the freedom of the slave was also the saving of the union he also admitted in a letter to secretary chase september   that the proclamation had no legal justification except as a war measure and that he regarded it as expedient and right    we do well to commemorate the years of the civil war and the year of emancipation and  and we do well to honor one hero who stands out predominantlyabraham lincoln however we should not overlook frederick douglass and the thousands of negroes who were abolitionists and emancipators in their fight against slavery and the subordination of man to man the  negroes who gave their best in the cause of freedom and emancipated themselves and the hundreds of thousands of white citizens who believed in freedom and all those of both groups who continue to believe in it the cause of emancipation is one therefore in which millions should join throughout the land for just as slavery had enslaved the black man it had also enslaved the white man for both were in bondage and are still to the concepts of color we now await freedom from color domination freedom from prejudice freedom from false concepts as they relate to population groups and the realization of the freedom of which lincoln was an exponent and for which he became a martyr the great emancipator then and now must have many lesser ones who motivate events and give to him the chosen opportunity
