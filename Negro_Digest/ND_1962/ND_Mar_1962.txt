the tragedy of teenage marriage
a few weeks ago i was a v stopped by a negro man who had just witnessed divorce proceedings involving his yearold son the mans eyes watered as he said to me what a tragedy for that boy god if only i could have convinced him a year and a half ago that marriage is more than one long grand passion this mans son a brilliant student had given up a promising career to marry a dimplecheeked brownette who was the doll of the high school junior class the couple learned after the wedding that her tastes for clothing and entertainment were richer than his income that his idea of the role of sex in marriage was a lot more liberal than hers that religion was a source of constant irritation between them and that his circle of friends and hers were not in the least compatible now the father complained with alimony and child support payments to make my kid hasnt a ghost of a chance of continuing his education it hurts me so because ive spent all my adult years trying to open doors of opportunity for that boy i wanted him to amount to more than i did but this is what its come to its a real tragedy i told my friend that that courtroom drama probably was a tragedy for the girl tooin that she was a mother and a divorcee at  i knew that it would be no solace for this father but i added that his unhappiness was being shared by millions of parents educators clergymen judges and others who see the parade of bitterness and misery that is being generated by a recent upsurge in teenage marriages i mentioned also that no one should worry more than negro parents and civic leaders about this rash of youngsters barely across the physical threshold of adulthood who are joining the rush to the altar they should worry because it can be shown in a dozen ways that these marriages constitute one of the major barriers to the negros march to firstclass citizenship i consider it a truism that a people who would be free must destroy the fundamental enemy of freedom ignorance there are far too many negro youngsters of vast leadership potential who today are deserting the war against ignorance for what they assume foolishly are a only the endless ecstasies of marriage we cannot afford to let the gallant efforts of a few students involved in sitin demonstrations and other protests against racism blind us to what is happening to thousands of other negro youngsters former federal education commissioner lawrence derthick said recently that  youngsters of high school age will not get their diplomas next june and for many of these the reason is that they have decided to accept a marriage certificate instead derthick adds that of the nations avi million andyearolds a million are not in schooland for at least  of these early marriage is the reason school authorities point out as informed negroes already know that a shockingly high percentage of those missing from the nations classrooms are negroes not that this problem of teenage marriages is primarily a negro problem the question why do they marry so young is an agonizing one in every economic racial and cultural segment of the american community it is a fact however that a slightly larger portion of negro marriages are in the teenage category than is the case for white marriages it also can be demonstrated that a disproportionate number of these negro teenagers are exchanging wedding vows without the slightest preparation for with barely a remote under standing of the responsibilities of family life perhaps the primary reason for negro concern is that colored youngsters and the colored community in general are less able to afford the repercussions of these premature marriages than any other group in our society this is illustrated i think by the story about three young aristocrats who were trying to outboast each other with regard to their fathers wealth my father is so rich that im going to groton and yale said the first my father is so rich im going to do my prep work at harvard and then go to the sorbonne cracked the second my father is so rich that i can afford to stay ignorant boasted the third many white youngsters may be able to afford the loss of education the stunted earning power that almost inevitably goes with a teenage marriage but the negro struggling in a hundred ways for equal status in a predominantly white society simply cannot afford the luxury of ignorance and of unexploited potential president howard bowen of grinnell college has said education determines the degree of our capacity for foresight and our ability to plan for the future a mark of primitive people is that they lack this capacity to look ahead they live from hand to mouth the future is for them dim and vague education on the other hand helps people to become aware of the future and prepares them to plan ahead it enables them to carry out longterm projects and to make sacrifices for distant ends the magnitude of the educational deficit among negroes is well known by most negroes and need be stated only briefly here we are turning out fewer than half the high school graduates much less than half the college graduates that we would produce each year if negroes were being educated to the same extent americas white population is there also is no need to detail here the ways in which educational economic and other discriminations have made it extremely difficult for negroes to alter this situation but as dr eli ginzberg professor of economics and director of the conservation of human resources project at columbia university points out in his book the negro potential the negro cannot expect the schools alone desegregated or otherwise to erase the handicaps under which our youngsters labor parents the churches communications media within the negro community all have a role to play in imbuing these youngsters with a deeper understanding of the opportunities and responsibilities that lie before them ginzberg explains better preparation for work involves much more than a formal equalization of education opportunities for negroes as for whites basic preparation for school and for work occurs within the family the neighborhood and the community the habits the values and the goals that the child acquires i provide the basis for his later accomplishments in school and at work because of his history the american negro is not prepared in the same way as the white population to take full advantage of the economic opportunities that exist the negro must alter many of his values before he will be able to cope effectively with his new situation i can think of no better place to begin this alteration of values than with todays teenagers and preteeners what negro homes of tomorrow are will be determined by the success that can be achieved today in convincing able youngsters to delay the rush to what they think are the infinite romantic pleasures of married life in order that they can get the educations essential to the economic moral and general family stability that is so lacking among so many negroes several weeks ago i talked to ellen an yearold negro in chicago who already was the mother of two children separated from her yearold husband and being supported by the aid to dependent children adc program this young woman who had wed during her sophomore year in high school explained how she got into this predicament i was miserable my parents were so old and countrified and our  furniture was so horrible that i was ashamed to take my friends home even if i had i was sure my mother would bore them to death talking about the bible all she did was talk about heaven and hell and about how i had to stay home because i might get consumption from the night air or get into some other kind of trouble well davehe was a grade ahead of mewas miserable too his father was drunk all the time i couldnt believe a boy as smooth as dave could have such hicks for parents dave and i felt nobody really cared for us but us and we decided to sort of strike out on our own after  months of marriage dave decided to strike out on his own so here i sit with the kids ellensthese are not their real namesstory pinpoints one of the major reasons for the upsurge in teenage marriages many youngsters are running away from unhappy homes fleeing in search of love and affection family experts say that a disproportionate number of negro youngsters are involved in this rather desperate groping for love and happiness one reason the experts say is that unhappiness finds it a bit easier to get inside the door of homes beset by poverty and a lack of education another reason they say is that many negro parents find it virtually impossible to strike that happy medium of firm but loving discipline that leaves enough latitude for teen agers to make the transition from adolescence to adulthood sociologists say that a disturbingly large number of negro parents dont know where their teenagers are from one night to the next and apparently do not care at the other extreme is a group of parents who are so fearful of embarrassment to the family name that they make virtual prisoners of their girls a detroit mother told me recently i was so determined that my children would not contribute to those horrible statistics that the white magazines keep throwing at us negroes that i practically forbade my daughter to take a deep breath in the presence of a boy this created horrible conflict between us but i was certain i was doing the right thing a few months ago my daughter eloped with a boy id never met she lied about her age in order to get married i went to the family service people and they told me i could get the marriage annulled and have her committed to a detention home as an incorrigible but they said they doubted that anybody in the detention home could undo the damage that i had done over the last few years i guess we negroes can try too hard to be perfect parents this detroit mother still had the hope that her yearold soninlaw will turn out to be a good husband more ready to settle down than most teenage boys are but the odds run heavily against this for the bureau of census reports a very high rate of failure for all teenage marriages and an appalling failure rate for nonwhites paul c glick reports in his volume american families based on the  census that for every  negro teenage girls who marry about  will be separated from their husbandsa rate four times as high as for white teenage girls another  of the negro girls will get divorces and  will have their marriages terminated by the death of their husbands this means that a pitiful  of these  negro teenage girls will make marriages that are stable and permanent the other  face one form of heartbreak or another glick points to one ironic racial difference the divorce rate among white teenagers is actually higher than among negroes the reason for this is that white girls who rush into a mismatch take advantage of legal aid services offered by the community or the courts and get the protection afforded by a legal divorce on the other hand most negro girls wind up like ellen separated or deserted left without even the alimony the child support payments the opportunity to move with honor towards a second marriage that a courtsanctioned divorce would provide negro youngsters who today may be flirting with thoughts of marriage ought to take serious note of one thing that these marriage statistics show quite clearly the girl with the least education usually my lap as i talked to this colored youngster i had to say to myself my little boy has got this kid beat already hes got him beat by a mile i knew from the fathers record in high school that the little lad couldnt be inherently dumb i couldnt assume that my boy had an iota more of native intelligence than he did but i could see that because of the negro lads environment because of his less intellectual surroundings my boy already had him beat when it comes to being able to make your way in our society i believe that one thing most american negroes want passionately is to make sure tomorrows colored children dont get beat by a mile because of poor schooling poor environment poor home life one of the ways that this can be avoided is to convince the teenagers who will produce tomorrows generation of children that they owe it to this coming generation to postpone marriage long enough to get the education the understanding of and respect for family life that will enable them to be adequate parents every negro who really has turned his face against the indignity of racial caste has to realize that eradication of this system involves fighting a thousand kinds of battles on a thousand kinds of fronts the lawyer in the courtroom the man in the voting booth the platform lecturer the novelist at his typewriterall these and many more are soldiers in these battles but none can win any final victory except through the vastly expanded intellectual and moral strength of the negro people as a whole it is imperative therefore that we get more soldiers in the battle to convince our youngsters of their special obligations as husbands and wives mothers and fathers it is essential that our youngsters be convinced that marriage for the new negro cannot be merely a yielding to raw emotions it also must be an intellectual decision made with the realization that the negro family too is a major link in our new chain of freedom

tere is an old nurst f ery rhyme about six men  of indostan all of them blind who wanted tq jnvestigate he de phant each of them encountered a different part of the animals anatomy and as a result each came to a different conclusion about the creature as a whole in the race question one of the biggest difficultes with most people both white and negro is the number of blind spots in their outlook because of segregation few white people know the american negro but this has not prevented a lot of generalizations about the whole racegeneralizations based on very limited experience or even on what one has read in newspapers and magazines among educated people such things are passing away but one can still hear in some circles sweeping statements such as negroes are dirtythey are criminally inclined they are ignorantthey are oversexed  they are musically giftedand so on i have even heard a white person say that all negroes look alike as a matter of fact most of the conclusions are justified if they are restricted to a segment of the negro racejust as the same conclusion can be justified if they are applied to segments of any other race or nationality the first point i want to make then is that the word negro embraces a group of people with differences from each other just as great as in any other similar large group of people the second point is that the negro in america is american and wants to be regarded as such he is not african and until recently regarded himself as having practically no connection with africa there is no reverence for the mothercountry such as one might find in an american of irish or polish or italian ancestry just recently the american negro has begun to express interest in and sympathy for the africans as they struggle for freedom and negroes here are beginning to feel some racial solidarity with negroes there being an american the negro wants to be judged not as a group but like other americans for what he is personally how he lives works raises his family keeps his home participates in civic affairs pays his bills conducts himself in public and in private as a neighbor friend human beingthese are the important things and on these the negro wishes to be judged individually he does not want to have to bear the burden of the crimes and excesses of other negroes nor does he want to ride on the achievements of jesse  owens or ralph bunche he is unable to see how the color of his skin demands that he be treated as if he came from another planet most americans are aware i am sure of the rising tide of the negro demand for recognition both in the us and in africa no amount of wishful thinking on the part of white people is going to stop this tide from achieving its goal and the sheer magnitude of the negro population makes it an issue which cannot be ignored experts on population trends for example predict that chicago will probably contain a nonwhite majority within the lifetime of most of us the implications of the negro problem are so wide that no catholic be he priest or layman can excuse himself from being interested on grounds that he or his neighborhood is not affected first of all a person in any urban area can scarcely avoid coming into contact with some negroes at least casually as a priest who is a negro i know that if more priests and white laity were aware of the presence of potential converts on these occasions more converts would be made chances are only one in twenty that the negro in question is already a catholic and secondly areas that have not been touched by the negro migration may be hit suddenly at any time a couple of years ago i gave a talk to a group of catholic women in a chicago suburban area most of them said that they had little contact with negroes and were wondering what they could do to promote interracial justice and charity last year one of the women telephoned me father she said when i heard your talk i thought that the whole thing was pretty remote from me but i live in deerfield   what exactly does the american negro want the answer is simple he wants what most other americans want he wants a good job a job which is equal to his ability a job where he can advance if he has the ability a job which will give him and his family some security he wants a chance at decent housing and i do not refer only to public housing projects although these are indispensable for the lowincome groups he wants a house or apartment of a quality and in a location such as white americans of similar income can have he wants to give his children an education comparable to what white children receive so that they can compete on terms of comparative equality a casual observer might say the negro has all these thingsat least in the north what is he complaining about lets admit right away that tremendous progress along these lines has been made in recent years and it is going on constantly but there are still gaps to be filled and the average negro thinks much more  about these gaps than about the progress already made it has been nearly a hundred years since lincoln freed the slaves but complete freedom is not yet a reality for the descendants of the slaves up to now the negro has been kept almost completely out of the professional fields and private industry except within the negro community itself he has to depend upon government jobs to give him any real opportunity to display his learning or natural ability even after a considerable amount of education he often has to drive a municipal bus or work in the post office in order to have steady employment in business few executive positions are open to him in a bank he is lucky to be hired as a broompusher even big companies which do tremendous business with negroes will hire negroes only in their lowest ranks of employees this is true even in northern cities among which chicago incidentally is regarded by some as the most segregated city in the nation speaking of job opportunities we would expect that at least in the catholic church a negro man or woman would be given ample opportunity to try a religious vocation or aspire to the priesthood but even here there is sometimes a color bar especially where girls are concerned one superior told a girl i know that the community would pray the holy ghost to guide her somewhere elsealthough the community was desper ately praying for vocations itself and in a certain parish grammar school the sisters still dare not talk about religious vocations for girls for fear that a colored girl might want to join the order that is teaching there the conditions in which many negroes live come in for a lot of criticism from white people it would be a shock to some of the critics to find out that the people most dissatisfied with slum conditions are the people who live in them who are forced by racial segregation to live in them the average negro wants a nice home in a decent neighborhood and is willing to work hard and to pay a lot for it when he has it furthermore he will generally be just as interested as anyone else in maintaining the standards of the neighborhood where he lives  as job opportunities have improved the negro has more money to spend on better housing this is why such a tremendous pressure has built up in cities where negroes are confined to a ghetto this is why negroes are trying so hard to escape the segregated housing which can only result in the spread of slum conditions segregation causes slums in several ways in the first place it limits the amount of housing open to the negro and therefore causes overcrowding of houses and apartments overcrowding obviously is directly connected with slum conditions moreover as long as housing is segregated and limited in quantity the seller can demand a higher price for it the buyer or speculator in order to pay off his mortgage or to make a quick profit is inclined to subdivide his property to produce more rents and to neglect upkeep again slums will develop cardinal meyer archbishop of chicago stated last year that it is high time the pattern of segregated housing in chicago be broken down the negro in chicago and elsewhere wants this not so that he can run down a neighborhood but so that he can find decent conditions in which to live and raise his children it is a great scandal when he finds priests or catholic organizations blocking his way all indications are that the negro in america is going to reach his objectiveshousing education work opportunities  and that he will achieve a large part of them within the next decade or two he will reach them with or without the help of the catholic church if he reaches them without the church it is easy to imagine what his attitude toward the church will be at present however the church finds itself in what can generally be called a favorable position as far as negroes are concerned most american negroes who belong to a church are protestants either baptists who have the largest share or methodists about six per cent of negroes are catholics the ninetyfour percent remainder is largely in ignorance about the church for most of them it is just a namethe name of one of the white mans churches but the catholic church has two attractions to draw the negros attention its schools and its claim to be the one universal church many negroes are aware of the forthright statements and actions of some of our bishops in racial matters and the elevation of an african to the college of cardinals drew wide favorable notice the reason for the attractiveness of our schools even for the noncatholic negro is mainly that if he is ambitious for his childrenas most parents arehe wants to preserve them from the moral corruption which so often accompanies life in the ghetto if he cannot escape the ghetto he does the next best thing he tries to immunize his children by giving them a religious education even if the negro escapes to a good neighborhood he is still attracted by the superior moral training and discipline which catholic schools offer the reason why the catholicity of the church attracts negroes is obvious it is in harmony with the urgent need of the negro for acceptance by the society in which he lives the church and its members however must practice what they preach otherwise this becomes just another disappointing mirage in the negros struggle arbitrarily dividing negroes into three classes we can detect  certain differences in their attitudes toward the catholic church the poorest class often thinks of the church as the church of charity they know that christ was kind they see kindness in catholic priests and sisters who are known to be effectively helpful when someone is in trouble this makes it easy for such negroes to identify the one true church the middleclass negro is satisfied when the local parish fulfills his spiritual needs and educates his children but he is often hurt when he emerges from his own parish into the larger catholic world as an example two colored couples attended a precana conference in a parish in a part of chicago rather far from the negro community the other couples attending treated them with obvious coldness and hostility as a result one of the negro couples dropped out after two sessions the other couple more sophisticated and experienced felt the same hostility but had the courage to complete the conference along the same line many an enthusiastic convert has been stunned and baffled when he discovered that some fraternal organizations have no negro members that he will find difficulty in being accepted as a patient in some catholic hospitals that it is practically impossible for a negro doctor to get on the staff of a catholic hospital that there are catholic high schools which do not have and do not want colored students such a convert was told when he took instructions that he was becoming a member of a universal church a church which regards all men as equally precious before god he sees that the teaching of the church and the performance of its members do not matchand naturally he feels that the white man has betrayed him again the upperclass negroto get back to our threefold divisionis critical of the church and skeptical of its claims he knows that his race is making great progress in many fields he sees that the color line is breaking down rapidly everywhere and he sees that the church which ought to be leading this progress is lagging behind or even fighting it he experiences the racial prejudice of white catholics including sometimes priests he observes that we preach against many kinds of sin but seldom about the sin of hating our neighbors if they happen to be negroes he notices the silence of the catholic church in his struggle in many places and remembers it his conclusion is that the catholic church is lying when it claims to be universal and that it is hypocritical when it tolerates racial prejudice and segregation he will not accept such an unchristian i version of christianity consequently we find among the number of converts fewvery few who are doctors or lawyers or university professors being a priest and a convert to the church myself i am naturally interested in bringing other negroes into the church this does not mean that we catholics should be alert and active in the field of social justice and charity only as means to conversions charity and justice are virtues which make us godlike virtues demanded of us by god if we are to save our own souls but when the negro sees that bishops priests sisters catholic laity understand his problems when they prove by their actions that they are sincerely on his side and are not just reluctantly assuming that position when it is too late to do anything else when he sees that the white catholic laity are given a firm and decisive leadership in the direction of interracial justice and charitythen the negro will begin to see the church in all its beauty as the worldwide society which reaches down into his own city his own neighborhood to raise him up to god

the warm june air was electric with excitement the unbelievable was about to occur for the first time in history an allnegro theatrical troupe had been commanded to appear before the reigning monarch of the british empire bert williams the inimitable and his partner george walker were about to add another first to their lengthening list of achievements they had the previous season opened on broadway for the first time in a hit show in dahomey and now the show which had been appearing in london since midmay at the shaftsbury theatre near piccadilly circus had been selected by king edward vii to highlight the celebration of his favorite grandsons ninth birthday the child who was called david was the eldest son of the prince and princess of wales later king george v and queen mary behind buckingham palace surrounded by high walls and railings the magnificent palace grounds stretched over forty acres and included a private lake for this event a special theatre had been erected on the velvet lawn parquet flooring had been laid for the stage which was perfect in every detail the scenery had been brought out from the shaftsbury and even special lighting had been installed at the foot of the terrace the royal band under the direction of herr gottlieb was in place waiting for the signal to begin the national anthem behind the drawn curtain that covered the stage the members of the cast fidgeted nervously the women patted their hair in place again and again smoothed already smooth skirts and shifted from one foot to another the stage director and the author of the play jesse shipp bustled like a mother hen he had been there since early morning giving last minute instructions to the carpenters and electricians fixing props and adjusting the footlights naturally a meticulous and nervous person jesse was not about to have anything go awry from lack of attention to detail the principalsbert williams george walker and georges wife ada overton walkerhad remained in their dressing rooms until almost the last minute and then like the rest of the company found themselves unable to resist a peek through the curtains to see the royal family bert williams tall handsome even in the burnt cork which darkened his naturally olive colored skin felt that this must in some way be a dream it seemed just a while ago that he and george had been hungry urchins scratching for a roll and a tossed coin from the drunks who made the san francisco barbary coast their hangout those were the days when one unhappy experience followed on the heels of another the list of the failures seemed endless they had worked their way east from san francisco in piecemeal fashion staying in a town only long enough to make enough money or a connection that would enable them to move on to another at this time many of the white stars of the minstrel stage worked in cork or blackface it was when bert finally realized that in cork makeup with a comic costume he could be funnier than any of the blackfaced whites then at the zenith of their popularity that they began to hit their stride as a team george walker was unsurpassed as the dandy dressed to the height of fashion with manners and speech that would do credit to one to the manorbom playing straight man to the somewhat naive and always gullible character that became bert williams trademark unhappy unlucky mournful and melancholy with shambling gait and quizzical expression bert was the epitome of the sucker his song im a jonah man introduced a new word in the american language as a jonah became synonymous with a hardluck character the senegambian carnival and the policy players followed by sons of ham paved the way for their reception on broadway in in dahomey in dahomey written by jesse shipp with music by will marion cook and libretto by paul laurence dunbar was the first broadway show to be written staged and acted by an allnegro group after opening night at the new york theatre when the tumultuous applause of the crowd greeted them bert and george knew that the two minstrel boys who had sung and danced for the amusement of the barbary coast riffraff had made the grade they were in and now suddenly the strains of god save the king filled the air and the royal procession with the king and queen and the young prince of wales in front started moving down the stairs and terrace of the palace to the lawn where chairs had been placed for the king and queen the other members of the royal party found places on the grass still peering through the peep holes in the curtain the female members of the cast let out excited whispers regarding the handsome king edward vii was an impressive figure tall and portly he carried his weight with grace and authority it was no accident that the edwardian era became noted for the glamor of male dress on this occasion the king was attired in grey frock coat and topper as were the other males in attendance the ladies following the lead of queen alexandra were gowned in pastel silks and gauzes with large picture hats and umbrellas alexandra was an extraordinary beauty and though long past middle age she looked many years younger buckingham palace which had not been used for the last forty years of queen victorias reign had come to life with the ascension of the pleasureloving edward to the throne an army of carpenters and painters had moved into buckingham palace and the gloomy rooms which had been jokingly referred to by members of the royal staff as the sepulchre became the scene of splendid court balls and the lovely gardens were often in use for parties during the king and queens residence the world of edward vii was the world of the theatre music horse racing and cards the pleasures of the sensesenormous cigars fine liquors beautiful womenwere the pleasures he demanded widely traveled and extremely sophisticated though not an intellectual edward lacked the prejudices that had characterized the reign of his mother his queen alexandra who idolized him found her pleasure in his pleasure therefore it was not surprising that he had selected the most recent importation from america to entertain the royal family and their guests at davids birthday party that the entertainers happened to be negroes was not as important as the fact that they were new and exciting that he was establishing a precedent concerned him not one whit he had heard about the cakewalk that was done in this show and he wanted to see it he ended up learning how to do it himself with none other than george and bert as his teachers the cakewalk which had swept the united states at the turn of the century was a rollicking and rhythmic strut that had all of the more adventurous londoners talking and trying now the anthem ended the williams and walker orchestra under the direction of will marion cook took over the musical chores and sounded the overture for the act of in dahomey the curtain rose on a scene in dahomey where brightly garbed native dancers twirled to stirring tribal music the main action of the play was laid in a small florida town but the opening scene established the mood for the rest of the action the story dealt with a colonization scheme in which some fast talking operators from boston trade upon the credulity of an unsuspecting old man with lots of money but very little experience in dealing with this kind of chicanery bert a happygolucky fellow was the heir to the old mans fortune and it was he on whom the wily george concentrated his attention the machinations of the unscrupulous george and the resulting dilemma in which bert friendly trusting and unsuspecting finds himself was summed up in one of the final moments of the comedy george as rareback punkerton asked bert as shylock homestead for an additional sum of money to finance the outrageous scheme to colonize dahomey shylock had finally realized that when its all goin out and nothin cornin in he must put an end to the drain and so he refuses rareback the following dialogue then took place shylock i really must have the ten thousand dollars and i say no do you mean to say that you refuse no i dont refuse no and refuse is two diffunt words they dont sound alike you dont even spell em alike i say no noe no with that williams gave walker his inimitably droll look and walked off the stage the songs the dances and the byplay between the two comedians carried the afternoon off with great success champagne and strawberries little sandwiches and tea were served to the cast following the curtain and afterwards the young prince of wales persuaded the kindly bert williams to sing with him im a jonah man it was only after the group had gathered back at their strand hotel rooms that jesse shipp revealed the secret that could have canceled the performance before it was given as he recounted the events of the morning shipp said that during all the hustle and bustle when everyone was tripping over everyone else in an effort to get the show properly launched a stout gentleman in a red vest had strolled down from the palace and inquired from shipp if he had found anything wrong with the english way of doing things shipp exasperated with problems in having things done his way had unleashed all his pent up frustration on the questioner whom shipp took to be a glorified flunky it wasnt until the royal family had put in their appearance that shipp recognized the flunky as his majesty king edward vii

dick gregory the racenik comedian
since these are times s g when people tend to r weigh up comedians in carats of social significance it may be said of a young man named dick gregory that he constitutes a highassay vein of meaningful risibility or risible meaningfulness a lode moreover he is peculiarly qualified by birth let alone disposition to mine further you really want to have some fun he sometimes tells a night club audience with the deceptively degage air of a gourmet about to pick apart a squab make out youre colored some day i suggest you do it on a weekend you do it during the week you might get fired it is when life looks whitest however that he rallies hopefully way things are he will add ten years from now youll have to be my color to get a job well beyond the facts that gregory is a negro and very funny or even that the burden of his material which he carries with extraordinary lightness is concerned with the doubtful brotherhood of whites and negroes are a number of circumstances making him unique historically at any rate as unique and historic as a comedian can be for one thing he is the first negro standup comedian in half a century or sosince the late bert williams was in his primeto be so widely accepted by white audiences more important unlike williams or any of his successorsstandup sitdown or walkaroundhe has been so entirely on his own terms he has made his mark without resorting to tomming or being what negroes call a handkerchief head two of the milder terms of opprobrium for those perpetuating the stereotype of the race as laughingly servile sly stupid ignorant improvident untrustworthy in an amusing way and so on williams not only conformed but being light in color obliged by putting on blackface a negro comedian looking for white wages in those days had no alternative there are good negro comics around today with gregorys singlemindedness some bitter or broad others simply so oriented toward negroes that their work takes on the nature of an ironic exclusivity among them redd foxx nipsey russell slappy whitedewey pigmeat markham and timmie rogers from time to time they play for white audiences but they earn their living mostly in negro night clubs and theatres rogers as an instance performed in a white night club in hollywood as long ago as  and his experience was pretty much typical of what a nontomming negro funnyman might expect prior to becoming a comedian rogers did a songanddance act with another man the props for which included a greenandred zoot suit costume he got a twoweek engagement at a sunset strip place whose owner had not seen him in anything else on opening night rogers turned up in a dinner jacket wheres that suit the owner asked gone down the drain rogers answered you put that suit back on he was told or you havent got a job rogers refused he was allowed to work a week in the dinner jacket and then fired nor have negroes unanimously endorsed such independence gregory claims that early in his career an influential negro performer with whom he had second billing in a negro night clubits clientele consisted largely of slumming whites warned him his act would not sit well with whites and swung enough weight to have gregory canceled out some less fearful negro comedians feel that talent aside gregorys success is partly the result of a fortunate conjunction of events relatively liberalized racial attitudes rogers could thus be described as prematurely unstereotypedly funny and accident he happened to be the only comic of any complexion available one night in chicago when another irwin corey was taken ill gregory went on for a single performance at the playboy club and was found to be so hilarious that he was reengaged later for a longer period john levy a negro and an important independent talent manager likens gregorys emergence to the advent of jackie robinson a conspicuously unservile man himself in baseball and as redd foxx put it the other day greg opened the door somebody had to be first theres room for all of us he cant work pittsburgh and glocca morra the same night negro comedys untapped if it doesnt happen for me now ill take to driving a truck gregory who is  is a dark slender but powerfully put together man of middle height but looks just as phthisical as any of his likeminded white contemporaries in the same shoulderless threebutton suits they wear he was an outstanding track man in college and ran through most of four years on athletic scholarships before running out on a diploma he has round innocent eyes a round ingenuous face mouth and voice and a small crescentshaped mustache nothing in his appearance or delivery is at all in consonance with what he  says the result is that at first hearing the effect he creates is as unexpected in its way not to say disarming as might be the spectacle of albert schweitzer rigging the stock market a further result is that he attracts several kinds of audience the comparatively few negroes who can afford him lately are one of course then there are shadings of solvent caucasians a group whose beliefs genuinely square with gregorys a second reasonably wellmeaning whose guilt at harboring prejudices can be temporarily assuaged by laughing with himin the safety of chic night clubs a third that lives by restrictive realestate covenants but is sophisticated enough nevertheless to enjoy what it knows to be gallows humor for it and an odd fourth numbering a high percentage of southerners that nurses the unshakable notion that gregory must be kidding bellicosity is to totally lacking in gregorythe trait seems to be personal as well as professional that to repeat a joke older than he is his victims are unaware their heads have been cut off until they try turning them shouldnt be any race problems he may say guilelessly everybody i meet some of their best friends is colored gregory fires up one cigarette after another at work and his pauses are usually punctuated by great wreathing clouds of violently exhaled smoke behind which he stands like gautama buddha smiling in a joss house now lets face it he continues theres just not that many of us to go around we take over the world though the snows gonna be black try driving home on that at night he also has a sly bottomless capacity for understatement that now and then leaves his audiences behind i dont know he remarked plaintively one night at the blue angel why everybody wants to ask me questions about the congo there was an instant of silence as though he had left something out it was followed by a tremendous prolonged wellingup of laughter gregory waited anxiously for it to subside a man trying only to explain himself i have never been out of the country he pointed out this brought on a thick spatter of appreciative applause people ask me he went on how come they dont send white troops only way i can fig ure it out is they dont want em coming home with those war brides the grin on his face had nothing of the sardonic in it it simply expressed the complicity of goodfellowship his faith in the nation was boundless i can tell we making good in the congo seventythree witch doctors joined blue cross there is something a trifle eerie in watching gregory run on considering that what he is actually doing is a kind of immemorial unchurched racial lament a cataloguing of wrongs a reading of indictments the sterner the indictments the more convulsed are his listeners i was tricked into the army he insists the recruiting sergeant says join the army the armys integrated that meant i had to sleep with puerto ricans a guy comes up to me says im from mobile i sure enjoyed your act you ought to bring it to mobile i need to take my act to mobile like custer needed more indians like the rev martin_luther_king needs a convention of dimestore managers i wont even work the southern part of this room the blue angels tiny stage as it happens is south of the customers he wouldnt mind paying his taxes if i thought they were going to a friendly country and he is wont to tell people on occasion trying to make you laugh is like trying to explain integration to a lynch mob he has an intricate story about a transatlantic plane flight during which it becomes necessary for three passengers to jump to save the rest an englishman goes out the door invoking the name of the queen a frenchman with vive la france on his lips ahm from texas says a third he walks back to that door gregory relates picks up a mexican andwhoosh and the guy really was hawaiian he remembers the day swimming pools were integrated in his home town st louis ah but they were nice to us that day in  he says they hired a new lifeguard for us he was blind we got up on the new diving board and jumped they drained the pool riding in the back of buses doesnt bother him next time you get on a bus he points out you notice where that emergency door is located and he has a fine explanation of why so many negroes own cadillacs he himself saves  on the country club he cant join and  by not taking his family to florida for a winter vacation if he gets hit by a bus he wont be taken to the best hospital where they going to charge me  so i go to the city hospital for free pick it up save  plus general motors sell me anything some aspects of television annoy him just as they do everybody else i wrote hollywood he says  damned if i can see one colored cop on the untouchables  they wrote me back theyre mak j ing a picture called stagecoach  south they offered me the leading part and i turned it down cause i know the first time they make a negro western the indians gonna win i he is naturally preoccupied with current events having had eight years of piano playing with harry truman and eight of golf with dwight eisenhower he settled for four years of bingo with john f kennedy we put him in he observes voted six or seven times apiece didnt mean we were cheating either just making up for the times we couldnt vote gregory also makes a conscientious effort to remain no more than a few hours behind the news one n piece of his material notes that he volunteered for the outerspace program and that when asked why he responded well i cant go to school down here on the evening of the day the russians announced they had put a man in space gregory was ready with some new lines thing that amused me most he said was ¦ when that man reached a state of weightlessness he floated out of his chair and he was able to write but he had to hold on to the pad i get like that every saturday night and it dont cost this country no two billion any night club performer will be afflicted with hecklers gregory has had a surprisingly small number none in new york and has handled them gently but firmly to a woman who stood up and stated flatly i dont like you he replied christ had twelve disciples and two of them welshed on him so what do you expect out of a room of  people a drunk who wanted to know what he did for a living was informed that gregorys father was a millionaire if you ever get to little rock he added tell faubus his son says hello very likely the most dangerous situation he has ever been in was set up in an indiana club by a woman who was drunk rather than hostile my god she bawled at gregory youre good looking i sure would like to love you a thunderous quiet filled the place gregory took a deep breath what nationality are you madam he asked im hungarian said the woman take two more drinks gregory raced on and youll say youre colored run up here and kiss me and well both leave town in a hurry the relief felt was nearly as loud as the laughter

must live for human  man beins s anc not jjyl  this damned color vl a mans color is no    africans equally as much as europeans must realize the falsity of any color bar      you cannot base a constitution on wrong w these are the words of an african nationalistperhaps the only politician in east africa to have surmounted the mental obstacle of thinking of independence in terms of blackvswhite he is julius nyerere prime minister of tanganyika since may  the selfgoverning trust territory he leads completes the final phase of its transition to full independence this friday nyereres dream of a democratic state in which there is a place for whites as well as blacks goes beyond tanganyika to embrace the east african federation he hopes to see created with neighboring kenya uganda and zanzibar and if these ideas prevail they can hardly fail to influence other parts of emerging africa as well in  during a visit to the united states nyerere was given an honorary doctor of laws degree at duquesne university as a statesman and scholar whose vision and determination have given new hope to men long weary of racial strife and unresolved national differences in achieving that status nyerere has been helped enormously by certain factors in tanganyika ever since the british captured it from the germans and it came under league of nations trusteeship after the first world war it has been thought of as a country that would eventually govern itself five years ago this idea was not exactly at the forefront of administrative thinking and nationalist agitators were not welcomed but by the time britain had freed ghana in  officials were positively looking out for nationalists they could encourage since there are very few european settlers in tanganyika there were no strong settler voices to obstruct such encouragement it became relatively easy for african leaders to gain recognition of their aspirations and nyerere himself the outstanding leader suffered little that might have embittered him  as nationalists go he had it very soft nyerere is a slightiy built man with wideopen friendly eyes and a neatly clipped toothbrush mustache receiving a recent visitor he wore slacks and a gaily patterned beach shirt the clothes he prefers though lately he has felt obliged to wear a suit increasingly often he wears native dress only for public celebrations the air about him was relaxed and amiable he has a way of listening attentively watching closely with his head on one side giving a halfserious laugh as a point is made and then coming back with a deliberate but nonetheless whiplash answer he had been explaining the pitfalls of european patronage in african politics and referring to the idea of federation had said seriously my fear is not of european support in tanganyika europeans are more doubtful of federation than africans asked how europeans who did want to help could best do so he smiled slowly leaned forward resting his head on his hands and looked up eyes twinkling by saying nothing he said this wry and penetrating humor rare in africans is one of his greatest traits it comes out often whether he has just settled down rather shyly to discussion with a small group of strangers or whether he is at his most formal in the legislative assembly he uses humor to cool people down to make a point forcefully without emotion and it is a potent weapon speaking after a heated debate on independence in october of last year he said now i recall more than one member saying of our independence that it is something we must demand    i am not sure that the word demand is not too colonial a word for october     our independence is no longer a question of demanding but of planning and the planning is really a question of decolonization    but i venture to suggest that one of the most difficult things to decolonize is going to be the minds of some honorable members here his audience who had been half expecting a sting of some kind roared with laughter nyereres point was made the ability to turn ideas inside out putting them subtly but clearly into a new perspective is one of his best qualities as an orator it is with his choice of words that he controls a crowd rather than with gestures when he walks into a big rally he will raise one hand lightly in greeting and acknowledgment then sit down on the platform looking rather small and insignificant light a cigarette and wait his moment to speak as kenyas tom mboya justly remarked he is more patient than most of us this applies to nyereres policies as well as his behavior though in his demands for independence he has been patient only by comparison with other african nationalists by normal european or american standards he has moved at revolutionary speed he has wanted freedom for his country just as soon as it could possibly be considered ready he has lobbied and argued for it nonetheless he is different from other east african leaders he may have concluded a speech to the pan african freedom movement for east and central africa with the cry peoples of east africa unite you have nothing to lose but your chains but he lacks the panache of his contemporaries he doesnt even carry a symbol like mboyas flywhisk and he also quoted to the conference behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity from the psalms his trademark is quietness and informality but once nyerere starts to speak he dominates his voice drops to a lower key than normal a burning gleam comes to his eye and he talks slowly and deliberately elaborating and explaining until satisfied that he is understood he is still the same person thoughstill humorous and as one man put it he calls forth a lot of happiness in spite of this geniality he can be tough and unflinching there was a notable occasion last year when he advocated federation before a highly emotional rally of   africans he attacked opposition to it telling the crowd bluntly that they were becoming bigheaded and no longer cared about their neighbors then he told them to go home quietly they went and they accepted his ideas another time he heard that provincial leaders of his party the tanganyika african national union t a n u were using their position to extort money from asian traders he called a meeting of the national executive and accused them i see faces here of people who have been known to be corrupt finally he declared that rather than see t a n u corrupt he would end the party when nyerere says the function of leadership is to lead and if necessary to tell the bitter truth he means it it is hardly surprising that this plain speaking has made him enemies opposition in the tradeunion movement is growing the tanganyika federation of labor wants more positive action on hehalf of the workers to them his hardwork and nononsense policy is far too reminiscent of the capitalist colonialists he is supposed to be fighting in recent months the organization has become seriously split on this issue meanwhile groups of young tanganyikans in london and moscow are preparing for political action in the future when the newness of independence has worn off and opposition is really growing their accusations that nyerere is bourgeois and westernoriented are nonetheless threatening for their familiar ring and their elements of truth could convince ordinary tan ganyikans that they were being sold back to the colonialists far though it is from the real truth at the moment there is only a tiny opposition party within the country with only one seat in the assembly but t a n u cannot be expected to keep its allbutabsolute majority forever even thoughor perhaps becauseit is so much nyereres own there might one day be a split in it it was as the leader of t a n u that nyerere came to power born one of the many sons of the chief of the small zanaki tribe he was educated at makerere college and at edinburgh university while studying he became a devout catholic and after graduating in scotland came home to teach at a mission school from this he entered politics creating t a n u out of a modest social organization for africans founded by english civil servants back in  as president he gave it a policystill the same todaythat tribal consciousness must be replaced by national consciousness if tanganyika is to become a real nation in  and again in  he went to new york to address committees of the united nations in  he was elected a member of the legislative assembly and in october that year he publicly accepted a new governor sir richard turnbull as the man to guide the country to independence after turnbull had made it clear that he was going to give africans an increasing say in affairs from that moment the struggle of nationalist against colonial administrator began to turn into a classic example of how the two could cooperate previously nyerere had burnt his fingers a number of times becoming involved in cases of sedition being fined though never sent to prison british officials had recognized his potential by  and desired to rap him over the knuckles but not to put him away evidently he realized that it would not pay to overstep the bounds for he began to respect them he had learned perhaps from gandhis example that violence is seldom necessary or justifiable and least of all in gaining concessions from the british soon after his acceptance of turnbull nyerere had a european derek bryceson now minister of health as his deputy on the opposition benches later he was to snap up kenyas able minister of finance sir ernest vasey whom kenya europeans had voted out as being too proafrican finally after tanu won the general election of september  nyerere was called upon by the governor to form a new government and take office as chief minister the first in east africa he later became prime minister nyerere has set out since then to create an african democracy in which minorities are protected when it seemed likely before the elections that minority communities might be swamped in the african vote  minorities of europeans asians and others total only  per cent of the populationhe insisted that they should have reserved seats in the assembly and when from a platform beneath the green and black tanu flag he introduced his new cabinet including both european and asian ministers to a wildly cheering crowd he said we will continue to show the world that it is possible for the peoples of different races to live together as one nation not that he wants multiracial government on principle he wants the best people available to take part in his african democracy and he will not let prejudice deny him the abilities of europeans while africans are training nor will it be easy for nonafricans to qualify for citizenship but equality there will be for all who are citizens he is explicit on what independence really involves what is freedom he asked his fellow members in the assembly it is the power we have to decide what is going to happen in tanganyika and when it is going to happen and that power we have all that remains is hard work   we are not going to be frightened to tell the truth to our people because building a nation is not merely building roads and hospitals and schools it is building the character of a people and we cannot build the character of a people if we fool them and tell them it is easy because it is not easy life is not easy and we as their leaders
reveille in rhode island
he tall thin boy wearj rip £ ing the greasy cap the  j k dirty tshirt and the faded suntans slammed a foot down hard in the center of the sagging old porch floor his brown face which needed its first shave twisted up in a scowl he pushed his hands into his rear pockets and swaggered over to the creaky railing he narrowed his eyes and stood there brooding down on prairie avenue in south providence this boy was angry but he was not as angry as he pretended to be he was perhaps the leader of the other rough young negroes on the  porch however they did not compose a gang they were not organized there was silence i had asked the boy at the railing a question and he was taking his time about answering the others probably remembering bruises suffered for talking out of turn watched him respectfully and waited he turned slowly and looked at me with the coolness such fellows feel for outsiders you dont want to know what i think about rhode island man he said shaking his head no sir i want to know exactly what you think you cant write what i think in the journal man i dont have to write it i want to know rhode island is a good place for white people its worse than the south for me in some ways let me ask you a question how come negroes in the south stick up for their rights and they dont around here theyre beginning to where man this was just after the trouble police had with a crowd in the area during the summer i had been trying to find out what these fellows thought about policemens use of dogs to disperse the crowd and about things in general they didnt seem to be thinking much but they were feeling plenty running through their talk was a theme of admiration for the southern negro and contempt for the northern one in some vague way too they had been influenced by african leaders although they knew practically nothing about them they had gained a certain amount of information from television shows and glances at captions under black faces in newspaper photos it seemed to me that much of their militancy was a pose they were behaving the way they thought negroes are supposed to behave these daysthat is except for negroes in rhode island they had joined the openly defiant ones but they had joined without direction without leadership and for this reason were potentially dangerous a young negro in the south would find it hard to believe that these boys in providence rhode island have the same feeling of being isolated from the general community that he has and it probably wouldnt occur to the young southern negro that psychologically he is far better off these days than the rhode island boys he is for this reason he can walk downtown and see the most respectable people in his race raising hell with officials about the way he is treated he is an actual witness to a mass assault against racial discrimination and more than likely he is in some measure a participant in the attack he is doing something about his isolation and consequently is less frustrated by it the young providence negro seldom has known the people who were working in his behalf because the most prominent of them have been white people generally of a high intellectual and social standing and they have been few the question raised by the south providence boy covers a multitude of halftruths that have been passed around for years and it makes a joke of the souths contention that the regions negroes are happy until stirred up by agitators from the north if there is truth in the boys argument and there is then how can the northern negro who does not fight much for his own rights lead a southern crusade of course one does not need to resort to abstract logic to answer the southern contention the facts apparent refute it what then is the attitude of the rhode island negro community in a country painfully undergoing vast social change it is of course an attitude shaped by the communitys traditions which are breaking down the fact that the push for racial equality in the state has been directed most effectively by a small number of white citizens is not a criticism of the negro community rather it is a criticism of the community as a whole almost any negro will tell you that for a long time many bright young negroes left this state as fast as they finished college because they could not find here jobs commensurate with their training the state had the worst reputation in new england in race relations says george lima president of the providence branch of the national association for the advancement of colored people i remember when i was a kid in fall river i used to hear the old folks telling each other not to go to providence looking for anything unless they intended to change color with so much of the talent being drawn to other places there was not left here a pool from which much leadership could emerge the smallness of the negro population has had a bearing on these things in the total providence  population of almost  there are little more than  negroeshardly enough to support much of a professional class it is true that some professional negroes here and elsewhere serve white people as well as colored but any young negro who started out in a profession gambling on serving enough white people to support him would be out of his mind even now providence proper has only one negro physician and two dentists there are three or four lawyers and a handful of schoolteachers there are some social workers one or two in executive capacities but the list of providence negroes who have achieved professional success elsewhere is quite impressive the small size of their group also has discouraged negroes from seeking public office as a forum for aiding their grievances and it has worked against their obtaining legislative relief from discrimination for equal rights legislation to get anywhere here an awful lot of white people have to stand up and be counted or at least indicate they dont care one way or the other as they eventually did in a case of fair employment legislation legislators who opposed fair housing could not have been on safer grounds politically and they knew it any negro who has gone househunting in providence knows it too the movement for racial equality here also has been shaped by the subtle form discrimination takes in the north generally it is hard to strike at what you cant see clearly and moreover as long as things arent too bad a man may tend to put off correcting them until tomorrow another possible hindrance to the development of the solidarity negroes need for mass social action has been the pattern of urban redevelopment here it has kept them off balance bogged down in the intensely personal problem of finding individual shelter relocation has undermined the morale of some proud longestablished negroes by throwing them out of their traditional sections and into areas with southern negro migrants whose ways are strange to the new englanders this is not a question of anyones being a snob it is a question of his being human white friends have asked me why the older colored settlers dont do more to help the newcomers from the south the answer i think is that such a sense of group responsibility is rare it is especially rare among people who have all they can do to take care of their own families where it exists it usually is rooted in cultural origins foreign to american negroes i have a friend whose answer is considerably ruder than mine he says they are more the responsibility of the whole society than they are mine after all i didnt make them what they are none of this should be interpreted as discounting the valuable service of individual negroes and negro organizations to their group and to the community as a whole ministers have afforded sound leadership the urban league under the direction of james n williams has been one of the states strongest forces working for equality the league however again points up the contributions of white people who make up most of its members the naacp here has been relatively weak until recently its current operation illustrates one of the changes which i told the south providence boy is taking place thanks largely to the urban league and the states commission against discrimination better jobs gradually have been opening up to negroes and the youngsters who go to college are beginning to come back home to fill them and they come back home to join george lima himself a young man in a kind of protest that sets some of the older leaders teeth on edge a young man like john maddox doesnt waste time worrying about whose official feelings are going to be ruffled when he says flatly that police have brutally used some south providence negroes he lives over there and hes an naacp officer and not even the staunchest opponent of fair housing legislation could have failed to be impressed by alton wiley a young lawyer when he bitterly described his experiences with housing segregation in testimony before a general assembly committee the naacp in the past two years has staged mass demonstrations on the state house lawn and held all kinds of meetings to protest job and housing discrimination if george lima had had his way negroes would have refused to budge from lippitt hill until guaranteed decent housing and ralph allen a field worker for the commission against discrimination doesnt seek the soothing phrase to report injustice that he uncovers if the action of these men is not entirely new in this community then the tone is the tone is impatient and it is determined officials and many of the public often as not shrug these fellows off as hotheads who lack responsibility the way they go about things is not considered very polite it is for some negroes as well as white people somehow not quite respectable but their sound is the sound of the students who demonstrate at the lunch counters in the south and it will grow louder if rhode island gets annoyed by the noise were going to make then let rhode island give us a reason to keep quiet says george lima perhaps by now the south providence boy knows that some  young men from his area have formed an organization called the south providence athletic association the idea for the association came from south providence without any prompting from outside although the charter was written by ralph allen but ralph allen  didnt write the bylaws which among other things take the trouble to ban drinking and the use of profane language during any activity sponsored by the association this is no insignificant development considering recent relations between police and south providence residents it is also interesting to note that the  fee for the organizations charter was contributed by the fraternal order of police    the members say they intend to work in fields far broader than their organizational name indicates they are interested in the guidance of youth and in working with agencies that try to offset the special social deprivations to which negroes are subjected there are other signs of increasing social awareness in the negro community for example scitamard dramatics spelled backwards is a popular negro play group they are preparing to produce raisin in the sun a highly successful broadway play that did not depend on racial protest for its impact however scitamard says that the plays strong plea for equality in housing was a main consideration in the decision to produce it in some ways the rhode island negro has been like ralph ellisons invisible man kept off the community stage by a complexity of historical and sociological circumstances what we are beginning to hear is his cry for a leading role
negro subculture the white mans problem
a few months ago i  a heard a distinguished  r f anthropologist refer to the community life of the american negro as a subculture within but quite apart from the main cultural life of the american people this was quite shocking to me and at first evoked feelings of resentment on my part as a negro however when one surveys life in the united states and particularly in the southern and border states one must admit the existence of this subculture the framework of living to which most negroes must submit one notices for instance although legal standards of marriage and family are established for the entire community departures from these standards such as common law sex relationships childbirth out of wedlock and the like frequently find acceptance and respectability among segments of the negro community by reason of residential social and even religious ramparts which shield them from the light and censure of the community at large in economic development the motive and drive for selfimprovement and achievement among negroes are largely squelched by these same racial barriers which prevent employment of negroes on selfrespecting levels or advancement to higher positions in education the segregation barrier permits application and acceptance by the community of false standards of accreditation to substandard negro schools furnishing substandard negro education which is seldom openly and honestly recognized as substandard until the unfortunate negro graduate attempts to compete on an equal basis in an unsegregated educational institution or until some local board finds it expedient to use a twograde differential in achievement between negro and white children as an argument for continuing segregated schools in recreation and culture the negro subculture develops most negro children and adults in segregated churches a few segregated  playgrounds and in loitering around segregated bars nightclubs and street corners the main community on the other hand develops its white children and adults in wellfitted ymcas ywcas clubs and playhouses school scientific fairs symphony concerts in park and school sports competition mock state governments and other such activities sometimes attempted by negro schools as training in citizenship are almost completely emasculated of reality or educational value by a segregated environment with segregated characters far removed from real life for many years the fact of this substandard subculture has been usually either ignored or rationalized along lines critical of the negro as an ethnic group not only by the white population but indeed by probably the greater portion of negroes likewise its consequences upon the whole life and development of the community have been largely ignored except in accusations attempting to stereotype the negro group on the basis of these consequences thus our politicians and others frequently decry an alleged disproportionate amount of crime births out of wedlock social diseases tuberculosis and other symptoms of social maladjustment said to be prevalent in the negro community seldom discussed however are the more basic problems of the extent to which racial segregation helps to create and perpetuate these conditions and the adverse effect of such conditions when allowed in one segment of the community not only upon the people comprising that unfortunate segment but also upon the community as a whole aside from the general contagiousness of social disorder and maladjustments the symptoms may have even more direct and practical effects breakdown of the family usually results in increased public expenditures for aid to unmarried mothers and dependent children as well as in greater juvenile delinquency and crime unemployment or low income from employment based solely on racial discrimination clearly adds to the social and economic burden of a community loss of manpower and brainpower through restrictive and inadequate training and education of any portion of our educable population is loss of one of our most valuable resources when the southland is competing for industrial and cultural development in the nation and the nation is competing for survival in the world the main thrust of the relatively few negroes who have escaped to some extent the crippling effects of the negro subculture upon their initiative and intelligence has been mostly toward elimination by lawful means of the legal bases by which the segregated subculture was imposed and maintained with the help of many enlightened dedicated white people who recognized the dangerous impact of enforced racial segregation and its concomitant negro subculture upon our society these efforts of negro leaders largely through the courts and more recently through the sitin demonstrations have met with some success in recent years but the experience of the last few years has demonstrated acutely that the efforts of a few leaders negro and white are not enough a man can remain in a dungeon for so long that he is reluctant fearful and momentarily unprepared to meet the beauty of the sunlight our enlightened leaders went and are therefore confronted with two major problems first the attitudes and habits of fear timidity indifference selfdeprecation deference to a mythical white superiority and lack of civic and community responsibility engendered among a tremendously large portion of the negro people by thiir continuous subjection for decades to the negro subculture and to the white supremacy propaganda superimposed thereon second the tendency of probably the majority of the white population to view the situation as a negro problem wherein the negroes as a sort of unwanted poor relation are seeking to enter schools parks and other community facilities which really belong only to white people seeking to acquire jobs that really belong only to white people and seeking to live in residential areas and in a social climate which is owned solely and exclusively by white people these twin attitude obstructions are illustrated on the one hand by negroes who refuse to accept the advantage of sending their children to a desegregated school and on the other hand by decent law abiding white people who look the other way in large numbers in implied approval when public officials spend thousands of dollars in public tax funds contributed by both negro and white citizens solely to prevent one negro child from enjoying his legal rights i submit that this is a community problem rather than a negro problem its likewise apparent that although negro leaders in the time that is left from fighting in the courtrooms and at the lunch counters can and should do much by persuading and educating the negro people to accept the duties and responsibilities of full citizenship in a free democratic society nevertheless even with the assistance of the white people who have helped them in the past these few negro leaders should not be asked to solve the white mans share of the problem when negroes demand the right to accept the responsibilities of and participate in the life of the community it seems a poor answer to say the majority of the white people of our community are prejudiced and selfish they do not want you to enjoy citizenship on the same basis as other citizens they do not want your dollar to be earned as easily or to buy exactly the same merchandise or privileges if community progress means having you participate in community life the same as they do then they do not want community progress its up to you to convince them that they are wrong the time has come when responsible political civic business church and social leaders in the white community can no longer continue condoning or participating in either expressly or by implication such attitudes and habits even though they themselves may be privately victims of the arbitrary racial prejudice which nurtures and sustains such group attitudes i sincerely believe that these many white leaders who have for so long held back must now come forward and take an open affirmative stand for truth and for total community progress whatever the personal consequence may be they must work to change the attitudes and habits of their white brethren which are inimical to progress and the betterment of our community they must attack with all their hearts the white mans side of the problem in so doing they will help immeasurably in the solution of the whole community problem if they miss this golden opportunity we shall not be

was one of those late summer afterp noons that would have d been pleasant ordinar££jicssw a r   ily as it was our unit of the nd infantry division negro had been tramping fullpack plus over the tuscany mountains since dawn and the sun bore down hot and merciless suddenly as is common in the italian hills our path opened upon a little village snugly stuck between the hills a small island of ancient stones stucco huts and narrow winding alleyways in the ocean of endless mountain peaks our spirits rose for in these tiny villages there was always cool spring water and shade for restingand sometimes even a few bottles of wine but as our column moved into the village square we found we had been beaten to the punch sprawled out wearily in the shade of the gray crumbling buildings were white u s infantrymen who had apparently just settled there for a break in their long trek to or from the front at the head of the column of white soldiers eager little italian children were collect ing and filling canteens from the village springs those soldiers toward the end of the column were waiting impatiently calling the chattering group of boys and girls and offering bribes of chocolate and cigarettes to get water in a hurry then the bustling youngsters sighted the column of colored soldiers moving into the square they stared at us in astonishment much to our bewilderment they quit the white soldiers and came screaming and howling to us collecting our canteens and rushing off to fill them with precious water we were stupefied and so were the white soldiersand resenting the injustice of the whole thing several of them cornered the busy little deserters as they hurried past and demanded to know why the newcomers should be given preferential treatment but paisanos we heard the peasant children explain surely you do not mind these are your comrades soldati americani like youbut see they have been walking in the sun so long it has burned them black there was no persuading the children against serving us first it was the firstand onlytime i had known being colored to be of special advantage

west indian literature y tstkt yin the making is the  vv  name given to writing g in english by writers native to the british colonies in the caribbean which include besides the island units forming the present federation of the west indies the two mainland territories that have opted to stay outside the federation namely british guiana and british honduras west indian literature born of a region surrounded by french and spanishspeaking peoples is historically very much the result of english education and british institutions however comprising as it does numerous races and religions and having been influenced by centuries of european imperialist rivalries in the caribbean the west indies bears many marks in its physical and mental life of its divers origins and the historical events it has witnessed the west indies had been written about from the outside for many generations before the first upsurge of local writing at the beginning of this century it is a popular fallacy that west indian writing sprang suddenly into existence during the last decade or so jamaican writers like herbert de lisser and tom red cam were active at the beginning of the century and in the thirties c l r james and alfred mendes were prominent figures in trinidad jamess black jacobins is still the most moving account of the haitian revolution under toussaint louverture and alfred mendes black fauns can hold its own beside more recent novels on west indian backyard life aldous huxley wrote a preface to the first novel of mendes in  pointing out that the mixed population of trinidad was a gift to any novelist after these writers there was apparently a dormant period but in fact west indians continued to write and publish locally although the seal of quality and acceptability was not set on their efforts by uk publishing houses until the postwar resurgence of west indian writing with several names of novelists well known to many readers of english today this resurgence of west indian writing was due principally to the effects of world war ii when the caribbean was brought directly into world affairs with lendlease agreements between britain and the usa almost overnight tracts of tropical jungle were transformed by bulldozers into army and air bases and sleepy little villages were rudely awakened to the presence of british and american troops in their midst samuel selvons first novel a brighter sun gives an authentic account of this awakening and transformation of the mental life of trinidad peasants several west indians went abroad to america canada and the united kingdom to support the war effort by joining the armed forces or working in munition factories these west indians men and women were kept in touch with one another and their homeland by the bbc programme calling the west indies a sense of solidarity of being west indians instead of natives of rival islands and territories of the caribbean began to emerge and it was in  that the bbc caribbean voices a literary programme was started with miss una marson a jamaican as producer this programme more than anything else helped to discover and encourage west indian writers after its inception and to stimulate the growth of west indian literature as it is known today contributors to caribbean voices began to feel a sense of community through the weekly broadcasts which stimulated further creative effort and selfcriticism in this way too the little magazines in the caribbean were given a fillip and two which started then are still in existence bim in barbados and kykoveral in british guiana short stories and poems which were originally broadcast by the bbc were occasionally printed in bim recent collections of short stories like selvons ways of sunlight and the one edited by andrew salkeywest indian stories contain some that were first published in barbados the verse broadcast in caribbean voices is to be found in bim and the university college of the west indies caribbean quarterly also in england during the war years were cricket ambassadors like the great allrounder learie constantine who was ostensibly reading law but was soon drawn into welfare work among west indians in england he contributed two books on the history of west indian cricket though not in the same class as neville carduss books they deserve a notice in any survey of west indian writing for their breezy quality like the irrepressible gaiety of learies performance with bat and ball and when one recalls the apocryphal match in which jingle of the pickwick papers took part in more than  years ago it seems proper to include constantines books on cricket in the corpus of west indian literature like cricket literary activity had been going on for some time and finding an outlet in local sunday papers and ephemeral magazines and little reviews side by side with printed matter there was folk poetry in the form of the calypso but there was no stationery office in trinidad the orig inal home of these extemporaneous ballad compositions to keep a record of even the titles the corpus of these oral ballads often composed on the spot in carnival competition would serve as a social commentary on west indian life combining the topicality of the elizabethan broadsheet and the piquancy of the continental fabliaux bold bawdy satirical and sententious these compositions were generally in the idiom of trinidad english though they may have originated as ballads in the french patois of the island similar to the st lucia patois in parts of derek walcotts play the sea at dauphin there is no doubt that the calypso has been grossly neglected by the official purveyors of west indian literature there has also been a tradition of local drama but no serious attention was paid to west indian drama until the founding of the university college of the west indies the extramural department tutors stationed in the various territories advise in the production of local drama and at the college itself in jamaica the poet and dramatist derek walcott has had his playsthe sea at dauphin and henri christopheproduced in  he was commissioned to write the festival play drums and colours for the inauguration of the federation the university college has also published plays by walcott and other west indian dramatists nothing however has appeared in print in the united kingdom except errol johns prizewinning observer play moon on a rainbow shawl which was produced in the west end other west indian and west african plays have of course been produced at the british council centre in london but it seems necessary for one to be on the spot to follow the progress of the work being done in drama by west indians and west africans in the caribbean africa or the united kingdom it is easier to keep in touch with developments in the novel on both sides of the atlantic since writers have caught the eye of united kingdom publishers and critics with the advent of such writers as selvon lamming and mittelholzer from the west indies and amos tutuola chinua achebe and d o fagunwa from nigeria the west indian novel starting out as mainly descriptive and autobiographical has tended especially of late to move towards the sociopolitical and satirical lammings four novels move along this line from the largely autobiographical in the castle of my skin and the emigrants to the more introspective and politically biased of age and innocence and season of adventure naipauls mystic masseur and suffrage of elvira are unmistakably satirical and the work of john hearne combines the purely descriptive with sociopolitical  analysis in such novels as a stranger at the gate and the faces of love bearing in mind the political emphasis of the recent novel from sierra leonewilliam contons the africanand the more detailed analysis of achebes no longer a t ease as compared with his first novel it is quite reasonable to suppose that the novel in west africa will follow a trend similar to that of the west indian a comparison between west indian and west african writing reveals that of recent years similar influences have been at work the great difference of course is that in a country tike nigeria there have been compositions in several languages whereas in the west indies writing has been almost entirely in english french and english writers in contiguous countries both in the caribbean and west africa are only now beginning to exchange ideas this literary dialogue between french and englishspeaking peoples and the establishment of a west africacaribbean cultural liaison is likely to produce very interesting results already african themes are emerging in west indian poetry but the french antilles haiti and cuba have been quicker to explore the literary possibilities of cultural affinities between africa and the caribbean it is difficult to estimate the influence of such french writers as aime cesaire leopold senghor and camara laye on readers of english but there has doubtless been a leavening of the intellectual life in west africa generally since the appearance of black orpheus the literary journal that has done more than anything else in english to establish cultural contact between french and english writing in west africa and the west indies there are also signs of a growing vernacular literature especially in nigeria and ghana drama in twi fiction in yoruba notably the stories and novels of fagunwa the publication of olokun a literary periodical in yoruba new translations of the bible in mende and twi the oxford press projected series of african literature texts with translations all these are clear indication of a vigorous literary life beginning to blossom in this part of the world a crossfertilisation of vernacular and englishfrench writing will ensure the uniqueness of west african literature the existence and growth of a west african literature owes a great deal to the work of pioneers who tend to be forgotten in the present upsurge of creative writing in nigeria ghana and sierra leone henry swanzys voices of ghana  is a good sample of writing that has been going on for longer than most people imagine short stories translations essays dramatic pieces sketches of everyday lifeexamples of these are to be found not only in swanzys anthology but also in the files of newspapers and magazines throughout the west coast from nigeria to the gambia and as in the case of the west indies although little has been published in the way of plays there is a strong tradition of indigenous drama in nigeria and ghana at least the university college ibadan has been encouraging with great vigour the writing and production of plays and the presence of the young nigerian playwright wole soyinka as rockefeller research fellow in drama attached to the english department of the university college ibadan is helping to give nigeria a living theatre his own plays produced in the arts theatre and oneact plays written by students and produced by themselves on improvised stages in the various halls of residence are exciting events at ibadan some interesting work in comedy is being done with the pidgin english of nigeria but to return to the earlier writers of english and west africa there was gladys caselyhayford of sierra leone whose poems sketches and short stories some of these are to be found in back numbers of west african review must have influenced such compatriots of hers as william conton the novelist and abioseh nicol short story writer and manofletters dedicated to the idea of a west african literature tutuola ekwensi and achebe were preceded by denis osadebay whose prince of utete seems completely forgotten and by the ghanain r e obeng whose eighteen pence was once hailed as a classic verse in krio by thomas decker and gladys caselyhayford and osadebays use of pidgin in africa sings were antecedent to present experiments with pidgin english in verse and prose finally this is the moment to pay tribute to henry swanzy who for many years as editor of african affairs in which he published several pieces broadcast in calling west africa and as producer for the bbc caribbean services and for radio ghana has done more than any other single individual to foster the growth of west african and west indian literature during the last two decades

the south african underground
it was  oclock at t night when the telephone jangled in my johannesburg hotel room an unfamiliar you came here to study apartheid you should meet the people who are fighting itthe voice said underground then came an order to be outside my hotel at  am i waited nervously outside the hotel fingering my homburg and stick this had not been the first mysterious telephone call i had receivednor would it be the last a small car drew up and a well dressed indian held the door open for me with him were two afri  cans we were going i was told to an anniversary ceremony for the seventyone africans who were shot down at sharpeville a year before we drove mostly along bumpy unpaved roads beyond the vast beigecoloured slagheaps of the goldmines that surround johannesburg it was nearly  am when we reached an isolated group of houses and stopped beside a dilapidated stuccofinished cottage i was led down to a basement surprisingly large and jammed with more than  men and women they were nearly all africans in native dress the women barebreasted squatting on the floor they fell silent when they saw me in chairs at the far end of the room a dozen white men sat obviously in charge of the meeting on one otherwise bare wall hung a portrait of nikita khrushchev draped with red flags on another a picture of one of the leaders of the bloody sharpeville gathering a tall fairhaired white man about forty appeared to be the leader he wore a smart brown suit he told me quietly dont be afraid were not going to hurt you we have brought you here to show you that our movement is the only hope for africa you have been talking about communism and your hatred of it but after seeing this meeting we believe you will change your mind and will tell your people the true facts  the meeting then continued in an african tongue there were pauses to translate into other native dialects i gathered it was a discussion of plans for unified action for some future time when not taking part in the discussion the tall man explained that this was a group of freedom fighters who were working to unite all parties in a common struggle for an allblack africa how i asked do you propose to oust verwoerds government he smiled thought for a moment then said ill show you something but first you must swear in the name of black africa not to reveal to a soul in africa what you will see his voice hardened and his entire countenance changed as he added if you do we will track you down and kill you at one end of the cellar was a wooden partition the tall man leaned over pressed a short steel rod into a small hole on the floor and a section of the partition swung open inside i could see a large room he rose took my arm and led me inside while the others watched the inside of the partition including the door was faced with steel stacked against the walls were wooden cases made of pine he lifted the lid on one and inside it were riflessomewhat like the leeenfields i had handled during the warin one corner stood two barrels like rum kegs and in them were hand grenades wrapped like apples in foil when i lifted one and unwrapped it the tall man recoiled and shouted a warning i reminded him that i had used many of them during the war and that i had not removed the release pin im afraid i spoke scornfully when i asked if this armament was intended to free africa the tall man smiled and said there are many places like this one day we will use them all back in the meeting room the gathering had begun chanting the welldressed indian who had brought me said its time to go as i left the tall man said someone would contact me later no matter how much you may hate communism he told me we are the only hope of africa next evening i heard another voice on the phone it was an african voice it said our leader told me to contact you you will say nothing of what you saw when you return to canada you will be reached again goodbye i tell this story not because it indicates the intent of all black africans but to show the ends to which a desperate and hopeless people can be driven my second story begins at the railway station in johannesburg i bought a ticket at the nonwhites wicket entered a whites only coach and took a seat in a moment the conductor appeared and with a sneer demanded cant you read you know your kind belongs back there he pointed along the train to the noneuropean coaches i said im staying here im a canadian a dozen white passengers watched quietly some sympathetically as he barked the sign says this coach is for white passengers only when youre in south africa youll have to learn to read i sat tight and told him in my country i may sit in any coach for which i paid my fare i thought this was a commonwealth country too i pointed to my war veterans british commonwealth service league badge but the conductor ordered me off the train at the next station to walk back to the coloured coaches so i wouldnt pass through other white coaches when i refused the train superintendent appeared they talked about me in afrikaans then they left from every side white passengers spoke up they smiled and several shook hands an afrikaner said ive been trying to get my houseboy to do this for years but hes too frightened an english woman said if more of you would do that you could break apartheid thus i began to learn of black africas white friends when i applied for a visa to visit south africa it was granted on condition that i agreed to be met by government officials and visit the places they selected the south african high commissioners letter to me granting the visa explained this was necessary in order to enable you to obtain a complete picture of south africa at jan smuts airport outside i johannesburg i was met by white representatives of the south african governments information bui reau i was greeted warmly and courteously in a motorcar with a white driver i was taken to the carlton hotel where my registration caused considerable excitement but it was apparent they expected me i was ushered to an excellent room but was requested not to enter any lounges bars or other public rooms i would eat in my room i was soon interviewed by reporters i told them i had been impressed by the south african governments programme for the education of africans for the establishment of their own communities for a form of local selfgovernment i had said and repeated that these things should be seen and evaluated fairly with guides and escorts provided by the government i toured the townships or locationsthe vast sprawling native communities in which south africas nonwhite populations must live my first visits were to the johannesburg townships of orlando and meadowlands these are comparatively new some townships in the very shadow of huge power developments had no electricity children  scurried everywhere ragged yet surprisingly clean on every hand were pathetic evidences of pride tiny patches of struggling lawn flowers in windows spotless washing hanging above the pitifullysmall backyards and despite my realisation that i was seeing the best my horror grew in the knowledge that these were prisons camps of captive and subject people here was obvious deprivation malnutrition poverty in the rags clinging to the clotheslines but still pride in the carefullypainted doors and bits of salvaged furniture the worst slums of the western world fall far short of conditions in many of the native townships in many there are only a few central points where water may be obtained it must be carried in buckets a great distance open privies are a source of infection no one can question that south africa has spent vast sums in an attempt to provide housing and other necessities for its native populationpoor though these remain but one has only to talk with the people to realise that the governments proposals for gradual development of the native peoples their education and eventual local selfgovernment and so on are starkly and cruelly reactionary here is an example we were to attend the opening of the new native agricultural college in zululand mr m d c de wet nel minister of bantu native administration and development was made to frame me on trumpedup morality charges and i was threatened with injury or death once i walked down the street with the wife of a white lawyer i was stopped by a policeman and threatened with a criminal charge when her husband who was to meet us arrived his intervention prevented my arrest many times my taxis were stopped and i was threatened with a search for liquor or weapons if i ate with a white personexcept those officially approved by the government guide it had to be done secretly one sunday evening i was called to the telephone in my hotel a woman said she wished to meet me she was anxious to go to canada and hoped i could advise her how to seek permission would i come to the following address puzzled i was on the point of going when caution stopped me instead i called a friend a clergyman he asked me to remain in my room an hour later he arrived with his wife and my caller the latter was a white woman he explained that he had gone to the address sought the woman who had given me her name and brought her to talk to me we talked for a long while when suddenly she broke down and confessed she had no interest in coming to canada was an employee of an hotel where i had stayed once and had agreed to lure me to her place where police would rush in to hear her accuse me of an attempted assault i was amazed but i was also terrified when i remembered a minister of the government had said in the assembly in capetown that not one black man has raped a woman in this country and avoided the gallows i had known discrimination at home no one can say it does not exist in north america but what i saw and felt in south africa was something far more horrible after a month i came away frightened and disappointed i was frightened by what obviously lies ahead further betrayal of democracy and if something is not donecommunism

although an image is q a  only a surface phenom enon which merely a  outlines how one is t      seen by himself or by another person and images may fail to reflect the true character of the person images are powerful social determinants because they condition the way a person behaves toward himself and how others respond to him the same behavior evokes different responses depending upon the image of the person engaged in the behavior eating watermelon is an example imagery is one of the most powerful social factors in these united states and how images are manipulated is of significance to the whole world in these serious times a social image then is an appearance or set of appearances which is imputed to a person or group and becomes so ingrained in the social setting as to command acceptance whether or not it truly characterizes the person or group racial images in the united states have taken on a character of sacredness and inviolability in a very short period of less than  years the myths underlying these images have given coherence to a highly elaborate and institutionalized system of prejudicial attitudes and behaviors all of these myths have economic reasons for being and they support an economic arrangement of which we are a part during  years americans of african heritage have been successfully subdued humiliated enslaved exploited degraded freed segregated and now discriminated against the last two racial segregation and racial discrimination are not the same there is a distinct difference segregation is overt physical separation which is subject to legal and economic control discrimination is covert subjective and deceptive so it is more difficult to isolate and more elusive of control by regular legal and economic measures it is in the area of racial discrimination that imagery is of pivotal importance because the image which supports discriminatory attitudes operates with equal detriment upon the victim and the perpetrator of discriminatory practices in the united states the awesome fact is that the survival of this nation and the peace of the world may largely depend upon the elimination of discrimination in the united states  moreover it is quite conceivable that segregation may be eliminated without discrimination being eliminated witness many northern states but it is inconceivable that discrimination could be eliminated without segregation going by the board this makes discrimination much more important to us than segregation the ingrained attitude patterns of racial discrimination historically worked interchangeably with a whole framework of myths to justify the establishment and perpetuation of racial segregation racial segregation has worked reciprocally to condition and reinforce attitudes of racial discrimination the three main image myths which have been most damaging to the american negros selfimage and have done most to deprive him of the opportunity and capacity to conceive of himself as an equal of other americans and to live as a free equal american are the following  the myth that american negroes have no cultural past  the myth of negro biological and social inferiority and  the myth of negro poverty i shall not address myself directly to an analysis of these myths but the mention of them constitutes a necessary background for any discussion of the negro selfimage today to use a biblical metaphor which has a genuine appropriateness for those who are imageconscious we are in the second millennium of the development of a democratic american life the first millennium was introduced by a violent raid on harpers ferry in  and lasted ninetyfive years to the supreme court school desegregation decision of  the main character of the first millennium was that it started with the painful sixyear process of emancipation of africans by now called negroes and forged back together a divided nation the war that eventuated in the emancipation brought on segregation in the wake of that emancipation only eight years later the signal for the end of that period came with the legal decision to eliminate segregation the supreme court decision of  which introduced the second millennium pointed to the damage visited upon its victims by the inherent evil in the reciprocal relationship between segregation and discrimination the court addressed itself directly to the question of racial discrimination when it declared that segregation is inherently unequal and that equal physical appearances of school buildings and equipment do not constitute equality for the human constituency the important thing about these two junctures in american history is that the survival of the nation rested then and does now rest upon the resolution of a national problem in which negroes were and are of key importance moreover what negroes did during the first millennium was pivotal to the survival of the nation but what negroes do in consequence of the beginning of the second millennium may very well determine the survival of the world as we know it this is a tremendous responsibility and i think that not enough negroes are aware of the enormity of the task or the meaning of their historic role although we talk about it daily to each other let me begin the heart of the discussion by saying that these are hard and crucial times this is the first time in the history of mankind that the prospect of freedom and the concept of universal freedom have been treated on a world wide basis the freedom of mankind in africa in asia in south america in latin america and indeed in europe is for the first time treated in one universal context of approach to mankinds problem such hard and crucial times require that we negroes take a crucial look at ourselves for we may be the midwives of freedoms birth or the nurses of her maturation provided we do not permit her to arrive crippled and become warped at an early age as we did in  because of our incapacity to utilize a historical opportunity to nurture freedom to her full maturity incidentally the old adage goes that opportunity knocks but once but this is the second time within a century that the opportunity to be free has clearly knocked upon our doors what happened during the first millennium why did not emancipation eventuate in real freedom the plain fact is that negroes were so consumed by the burdensome effort to carve out a bare subsistence and to gain relief from physical degradation that they had neither time nor energy nor courage to respond to frederick douglass call to continue to struggle until they were completely free they could not hear his warning that physical survival was being paid for at the cost of human dignity and that the loss of dignity would usher a regression to a condition of being not less than half slave nor more than half free we even now talk about dignity without realizing that dignity must be undergirded with some kind of power or else it becomes a weak and surface sham douglass described the ironical social process of the relationship between dignity and discrimination about a hundred years ago in a remarkable parable which i can only paraphrase this parable also pointed up the main distinction between his philosophical approach to the achievement of freedom and the approach of those who advocated conciliation gradualism and obsequiousness under the duress of the necessity to eke out a bare physical and economic survival frederick douglass put it this way injustice can become so firmly established that the perpetrator cannot distinguish it from justice consider that you the peer of another pass him on the sidewalk and you yield in courtesy  as befits your gentility he thanks you you yield the second time and he thanks you but with less enthusiasm you yield the third time and he begins to think that you do this either in consciousness of his superiority or in awareness of your inferiority you yield a fourth time and he begins to think it is his right to your part of the sidewalk about the eighth time your inferiority and his superiority become laws of nature and your claim to access to sidewalks becomes an affront to his rights and violation of the laws of nature he paralleled this message with a ringing philosophical observation that went unheard then and has continued to go unheard by the majority of negroes even in the wake of the sitins and freedom rides of the past months of  listen to douglass speaking in response to urgings by negroes to go slow and not rock the boat because it made a bad image for negroes and it disturbed race relations  if there is no struggle there is no progress those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground    this struggle may be a moral one or it may be a physical one or it may be both moral and physical but it must be a struggle    power concedes nothing without a demand it never did and it never will so here we stand again on the threshold of a second great opportunity we stand here with only a partial realization that if we had had the resources during the first millennium to get beyond the quest for physical relief to demand that we be really free the institution of segregation would not have emerged in the s nor would it have been crystallized in the supreme court decision of  i say partial realization because now segregation has become so imbedded in our own thinking that for the most part we ourselves contribute to its perpetuation and do not distinguish it from discrimination and worse we do not realize that segregation initially adopted in the s as a political expediency in the short time of eighty years has come to be treated as if it were a law of god and nature by exactly the process that frederick douglass described indeed this is how it is projected by segregationists both negro and white how do we get beyond segregation in this second millennium and at the same time avoid regression into the pitfall of discrimination which depends upon the perpetuation of an inferior image negroes of a century ago got beyond slavery only to fall into the trap of segregation we must deal with both segregation and discrimination the legal and the attitude and get beyond both we must frankly begin by remaking remolding recreating and reevaluating our own selfimage the greatest need that we negroes have at the moment is for cultural mirrors that will magnify ourselves to ourselves in such wise as to enable us to stand foursquare before ourselves clearly and reflectively this cannot be just a legal mirror because we must come up with  profound social and moral answers about our own selfimage before we can use the image to demand equal equality in dignity instead of mere legal equality we must literally transform our j own myths which have supported the image of the american negro j as a spontaneously generated in  minority group which has no past and whose members are by i nature inferior in behavior in j ferior in mentality inferior in culture inferior in value standards and inferior in biological station where do we start we must obviously begin by removing the ingrained mote that segregation has placed in our own eyes and has made us look confusedly upon ourselves this is no easy task because to many of us the occasional irri  tation of the mote is not nearly so  troublesome as the awesome prospect of the responsibility of freedom many of us have adjusted quite well to the blurred image because we have not allowed it to deter our pleasures nor disturb our pocketbooks but for the few who must bear the mantle and the armor of the next generation there must be a threefold look into the mirror of this day the first look must disturb us perturb us and make us restless to do something i mean something much more than  scholarships and  freedom fund dinners and something on a continuing organized coordinated scale which looks beyond the piecemeal year to year campaigns otherwise we will not be seeing the truth about our responsibility the second look must encourage us or we are not geared to the reality about the real impact of the legal and political work of the naacp the educational and employment pioneering of the national urban league and the charismatic inspired moral and social demonstrations of the sitins and freedom ride movements of core the third look must sober us to our opportunity and discipline us to the responsibility that the survival of this nation and maybe western civilization has placed in our charge let us review these three reflections in some detail the look that disturbs presents us the oldnegro selfimage and the painful necessity that is upon us to divest ourselves of it i do not mean old in the chronological sense of age i mean old as a designation for the product of the segregation period that image has the following content it begins with the baffling falsehood that negroes are a minority race even in full knowledge that twothirds of the people of the  world are colored and that no other group of people in the united states has as many members as that group which is classified as negroes this is just the beginning the oldnegro selfimage looks upon the american negro in exactly the same way that whites look upon the negroas inferior the oldnegro believes that he is inferior and all of his social actions and responses start from that assumption there are interesting behavioral byproducts of this selfimage which have been detrimental to himself first he has elected to grow in the shadow of and mainly in imitation of nonnegro european cultural values instead of cultivating and preserving his own african and american cultural values he has been very contented to be the main supporter of the myth that negroes have no past because he in his ignorance about african culture did not maintain our historical continuity now as we view the tremendous resurgence of african culture we occasionally pause to regret that he did not maintain our historical identity and occasionally we even get angry with africans when they say that they are not negroes there is more here to disturb us as we look at the oldnegro he always believes that the next generation will be a little better off and he will think about making efforts towards that end but he does not really believe in his own capacity to live as a free equal unsegregated undiscriminatedagainst american who can be proud to be both a negro and an american moreover although he wishfully believes that the next generation will be better off he does not devote his attention to preparing an economic base and a historical or cultural image which are the necessary foundations for the freedom of that next generation american jews bought back their past when they invested billions in israel bonds and millions in the revival of hebrew and near eastern studies in the united states negroes have not yet seen fit to invest more than token conscience fees either in the independence of african countries or the revival of negro culture studies the economic picture is the most paradoxical here his selfimage is that of poverty and deprivation there are three interesting facets of this economic image first he thinks that he is poor yet he spent   billion last year he is spending  billion this year and his spending is rising toward  billion at the rate of better than  billion increase per year this  billion is mainly earmarked for consumer products and for companies which do most to discriminate economically and socially against negroes moreover it is simply amazing that negroes who cling to the poverty claim whenever they are asked to give for group improvement or for investment in the necessary economic foundation for future freedom are most conspicuous users of luxury consumer products of these companies the same man who cannot afford  for a freedom fund dinner  for the united negro college fund  for the tom mboya scholarship fund or even   for a patrons of the arts membership will spend  extra for a golf bag to carry his new set of  golf clubs simply because his three or fouryear old bag does not look good enough for his new clubs and if the salesman is the least alert the man will toss in another  for a new cart when he buys a new car he thinks nothing of adding a  accessory which may be more decorative than efficient moreover he will pay   to  more for a sports car or a luxury model and consider this a social necessity but he would not consider it a social responsibility to buy a good comfortably equipped car and use the  difference to invest in the consolidation of his own freedom the most damaging byproduct of this poverty image is that the only economic right that the oldnegro guards zealously is the right to appear wealthier and freer on the outside to hide what he feels on the inside oldnegroes are as dutifully concerned about this as whites are concerned about the right to appear superior the main problem is that the oldnegro has no real drive to earn the wealth and to be free so that the appearance will be unnecessary we do not yet realize that a cadillac does not dignify the man if the man does not dignify the cadillac we have not become fully aware that such luxuries can make us look absurd when we depreciate among ourselves the value of investment in the struggle for the very freedoms which will gain that measure of dignity that will make the luxury trappings unnecessary to prop us up it makes us look even more absurd when we can spend so much for so many costly things and then have to go begging others to support our students our educational institutions our civil_rights campaigns and our cultural enterprises the second byproduct of the economic image is that we genuinely perceive ourselves as mass consumers not as producers we do not produce in any large measure we do not support producing negro enterprises we believe negro products and services are somehow inferior and we will not organize subsidiary enterprises to support our main enterprises we would not buy an investment interest in a single negro production enterprise with any degree of confidence there is not a single bond drive for any negro or african country which is producing we will not organize a single country club or combination business and social club where foreign and domestic dignitaries can be entertained contracts can be consummated and invitations that we get from comparable organizations can be reciprocated on a basis of equal dignity this is because we think we are poor not because we are poor this is a heavy indictment of the oldnegro but it is a social reality which we must face up to quite frankly in order to purge ourselves of its insidious effect upon our social and economic welfare the third and equally devastating byproduct of the economic image is that negroes have produced some of the greatest artists scholars statesmen scientists professional men entertainers and athletes as individuals but negroes as a group have not supported them neither have they supported the educational institutions and cultural enterprises in which they received their own education and professional training moreover where there have emerged great negro imagemakers the negro community has ridden upon them in the glory of their achievements but failed miserably to sustain their images when they were over the hill ironically when the joe louises and the ethel waters and the e frederick morrows are at their peak we are all with them but when they lose their lustre we find some way to blame them as individuals for their decline
the lonely wait of andy razaf
andy razafs name is £ a distinguished one in the history of american p°pular music  admired his lyrics long before my own songwriting career began and have known him as a friend for  years perhaps my indignation in his behalf is personal bias but i doubt it razaf who wrote dozens of globally known hits was stricken in  by a still unexplained form of paralysis since then he has lived mainly on faith hope and the merciful security provided by the ascap and royalty income from his early successes recently i visited him in the quiet los angeles house where  alone except for a nurse he spends  hours a day bedridden and four hours strapped to a wheelchair meeting him is not a cheerful thing for one who knew him when he was a lithe and busy figure around tin pan alley but if it is not pleasant to see him wracked by the pain spasms that hit him a dozen times a day it is a great deal less pleasant for him to endure them pain and loneliness are his constant companions as we talked andy showed me how he occupies his time answering mail from penfriends all over the world writing letters to newspaper editors dreaming up an occasional poem he writes few songs nowadays disgust with the rock n roll fad and the physical restrictions that keep him from promoting new works are the chief deterrents bom andreamenentania paul razafinkeriefo a grandson of the united states consul in madagascar andy was born in washington d c the shows for which he wrote were those that made broadway and harlem glamorous in the ebbing years of prohibition blackbirds keep shufflin connies hot chocolates fats waller was his most frequent collaborator incredibly while the major record companies chum out album after album of joe doakes sings cole porter annie zilch salutes irving berlin and heaven knows who sings jimmy mchugh not  one company not one single artist has bothered to assemble an album of hits by the man who gave us to name a few at random sposin honeysuckle rose memories of you aint misbehavin my fate is in your hands massachusetts in the mood keepin out of mischief now gee baby aint i good to you youre lucky to me how can you face me christopher columbus and on revival day the reason i suppose is that andy has no big publishing house backing him no highpriced promotion men to arrange such dedications and is physically incapable of meeting the right people in the right places to the countless artists who owe at least part of their success to the razaf songs they have sung and to the record companies that needed men like andy when good songs represented a growing rather than a dying art i say what the hell are you waiting for for andy to die so that you can start the mad rat race to see who can come out fastest with a memorial album give the man a tribute while hes around to enjoy it though andy cant help feeling a trifle bitter about old friends who have deserted him and about a couple of famous and very wealthy singers who live nearby but have never taken the time to drop by and relieve his solitude he is a man of deep religious faith and contents himself by thanking god that he has been spared the great contribution that andy razaf has made will be a little more permanently remembered and his morale immeasurably lifted if and when somebody gets around to a commemorative lp
the ugly face of hypocrisy
when negroes were displaced by a chicago hotel fire the last week in june the red cross called the rev albert h constien of holy cross lutheran church with a request for hospitality mr constien immediately agreed his church stands in one of the numerous white islands on chicagos south side not far from the residence of mayor richard j daley when he found that his churchs supper guests were negroes mr constien continued to act in a hospitable manner but much of the neighborhood particularly its teenage element did not soon a crowd of indeterminate size gathered threatening to vandalize the newly decorated church in the ensuing confusion all parties agreed that for the safety of hosts guests and church building it would be wiser to move the negroes all chicagoans were not villains in this incidentjust as all the citizens of little rock or jackson are not villains the villains were the toughs who gathered around the church the silent many who create the climate in which the mob unrest is produced andmost of allthe chicago police of the deering district who resorted to that frustrating inventiveness police can show when they want to evade responsibility chicago is shamed its police are being investigated the parable of christian hospitality has been lived out once more the ugly face of northern hypocrisy has again been unmasked as a nation we are learning that we cannot play around with the racial issue without coming upon its ill effects everywhere a passing note conservative lutherans who pride themselves on their customary distance from the social gospel and the days issues officially and unanimously backed up mr constien not long ago a lutheran vicar in alabama was beaten up by the ku klux klan after he had invited negroes to attend an affair at his church from such incidents all denominations are learning that the gospel is very much related to all life and that non involvement is its own kind of dangerous involvement
