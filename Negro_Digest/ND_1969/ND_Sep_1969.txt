black poetrywhere its at 
in the amount of black poetry being published we have also seen a change in style and subject matter at this point  being written that is to say all brack poets dont write the same kind of poetry or all black poems aint the same kind they differ just as white poems differ do and ju st as white poems come in sonnets ballads or whatever i have attempted to place all black poetry in several broad categories all of which have variations on the main form very few poems are all one type or another it is possible and probable that a poem will be three or four different types of poetry at one time that is a signifying poem will be a teachin spaced py ramid poem here are the main head mgs  signifying a open b sly c with or about  teachin rappin  coversoffa rundown b hipto c digupdcoatpull  spac

acetoface two faced warningconfrontation irony  jazz a rifiin b cosmic trane  c groun ded lewis  du­wah a ditty bop b bebop  pamid  getting us to gethe i buildingnationhood some of these categories are self explanatory and familiar most poems as previously stated fall into more than one category which to my way of thinking attests to the flexibility of black writers unconsciously i think poets fall into their bag or bags and it is no discredit to a writer if he chooses to deal with only one form or two or three     however a black writer will be classifiable in at least one of these categories although it is conceivable to me that black writers are creative enough to uncover forns which are yet to be acknowledged we will know if the writing is black briefly i am going to give examples of several of the headings and then devote a large amount of discussion to signifying poetry since it has reached an exciting unprecedented level of sophistication in the written word the teachin poem is a poem which seeks to define and give direction to black people the two examples chosen and quoted in part here are ronda daviss towards a black aesthetic and barbara mahones what color is black if tomorrows black poetry will not explain what is but be it then pens will be electric with feeling igniting and the paper shall become the poet and the poets shall be earthclouds    and mahone black is the color of ronda davis my little brothers mind  the grey streaks in my mothers hair black is the color of my yellow cousins smile the scars upon my neighbors wrinkled face    the coversofj rundown hip to dig up or coatpull are basically the same type of poem so the terms can be used interchangeably there are many many examples of this kind of poem today for example cleveland webbers poem from his recently released book of poetry afica africa afica in america the people are in all the areas we occupy little parts of air telling little lies taking little trips at least  days a week    or don    ghetto streets get empty while internalized in a suffering too old to l lees poem on nigerian unity the pig be is little niggers killing little niggers the weak against the weak the ugly against the ugly      these poets hip you to something pull the covers off of something or run it down to you or ask you to just dig it your coat is being pulled the spaced poem is very beautiful and many black poets after writing a lot of signify ing coversofj or shoutin poems find that an inner calm becomes and inherent in that a mystical and positive way of looking at the black mans relationship to the universe ameer baraka leroi jones has a poem called black people this is our destiny  and i quote from it here    we go to meet the realization of makers knowing who we are    knowing how to live and what life is       we must spin through in our seven adventures in the endlessness of all existing feeling all existing forms of lif e the gasses the plants the ghosts minerals the spirits the souls the light in the stillness where the stortn the glow the nothing in god is complete except there is nothing to be incomplete the pulse and change of rhythm blown flight to be anything at all    vibration holy nuance beating against itself a rhythm a playing reunderstood now by one of the st race the primitives the first men who evolve again to civilize the world    the space d poem returns to the spiritual wisdom of our egyptian african forefathers returns to the natural laws the natural state of man before subhuman massacres spaced poems say that our ancestors are in the air and will communicate with us as is the case in jones no matter no matter the world is the world a broke dead genius moved on to dust will touch you one night       and the stacked dust of a gone brother will hunch you some father you needed who left you    we speak of the vibrations positive and negative and we believe again in what we have never truly deniedthe power of nommojuju and the collective force of the positive spirits moving in time with the universe in our poetry we sing of sunra and coltrane and their lifemotion which is sound the new black poets believethatwe are the seventh dimension as the seventhsun son   they further believe in the overallimportance of the astrologicalsigns of people the writer is sagittarius no   the dream is to utilizeour beginning to conceptualize and direct a black endthatisas beautiful as our beginning the mindblower poem may seem similar to the spaced poem but the two are not to be confused there are basic differences mindblower poems seek to expand our minds to break the chains that strangle them so that we can begin to imagine alternatives for black people they seek to ridicule and mutilate that which may have formerly been esteemed often these poems predict an awful or glorious future and are gorier 
than the spaced poem sometimes the a w ful predictions are for black people oftener for subhumans larry neal in his book black boogaloo in an untitled poem says we gathered in the open place piled their symbols one on top of the other their flags and their death books took their holidays rolled their platitudes into nice burnable heaps gathered and piled this stuff from the stink pots of the earth which they have made so in the distance their cities burn    we piled their histories skyward with destruction acknowledgement to our ancestors and gods then we light it singing by contrast is jewel latimores folk fable    but the niggaswadnt hip wadnt hipped until they was copped too to work in the mines on the moon     the ships had promises had names that all the niggas knew names like jesus  heaven  freedom to take the niggas to a new world        when they was shipped to the moon mainland sold to companies who was bidden while the chasemanhattan bank supervised the auctions    or ebons poem the statue of liberty has her back to harlem two other alternate titles excluded isaw them bayonet her spine and pin her th birthday to a cross whereithung dank and slimcy it hung like stagnant death in shallow pools vomiting blood on poets  and mothers 
and flower children    surely he was talking about them  and he is a master of the gory every poet has written a bein poem in fact most poets start off writing them just writing about the way they be they friends be they lovers be the world be    an example presented here is one of my own from my book songs of a blackbirdits me bathed and ashy smellin down with revions aquamarine  me with my hair black and nappy good and rough as the ground me sitting in my panties    itsme inthe sky where pharoah and coltrane playing    and its me screammmmmmmming into the box and the box isscreammmmmmmming back   inkuluse  karma    and allpraise is due allah we are now getting more more  more lovepoemsfromaboutblack men and women such is this fragile jewel of barbara mahones the poem with your permission  combines skin  space spiritual aspects as they should besmooth surf aces are easy    i would rather deal with what moves you explore the fire and texture of your soul with your pert nission i would chart a course across your skin and travel all day all night up and down that rocky road and one black warrior william wandick writes spears of honey  my eyes took your slender fingers  dreamed on them they thinned imagination to a queen called shebanefertiti deeming you royalnessmakinga fetish of your hand    and there are love poems for all black people such as ronda daviss poem about the wine dipped woman and we need more and more more    the shoutin poem is perhaps at this time the most familiar to us all for awhile it seemed to be the only kind of poem being written it usually tells the subhuman off or offs him with word bullets an example of the fa cetoface poem which is an aspect of the shoutin type is one written by sonia sanchez in her hardhitting book of poetry h omecominggit the word out now to the manboy taking a holiday from murder tell him we hip to his shit and that the next time he kills one of our blkprinces some of his faggots gonna die a stonecolddeath yeah the last category with which i will deal briefly is the two­fac ed poem as kids we used to call a person twof aced if they grinned in our faces and talked about us behind our backs in poetry this concept takes on similar but broader meanings for example i will use my poem you name it  will write about things that are universal so that hundreds maybe even thousands of years from now white critics and readers will say of me here is a good black writer who wrote about truth and univesal topics i will write about people who eat as it was in the beginning i will write about people who sleep   s now i will write about people who fuck and ever shall i will write about babies being born world without end  i will write about black people repossessing this earth ahmen iwould hope that everyone who reads the poem catches the two facededness irony implicit in the theme signify ing poetry holds a specialfascination for me probably because icould notcan not signify and have always admired those who can from a literary point of view it is a significant exciting aspect of todays poetry iknow and you know that we have always signified on the corners in the poolrooms the playgrounds anywhere and everywhere we have had the opportunity we sig with somebody about somebody and if we cant be open about it we sig on the sly langston hughes character simplesignified with his landlady his partners his girlfriend everybody    and richard wright deals it in black boy  however to my knowledge no grotlp of black writers has ever used it as a poetic technique as much as todays writers it is done with polish and the audienceslove it too much signifying can be negative ithink however most of todays poets are very conscious of how important positive vibrations are and few have carried signification to an extreme in the main it is being used for constructive destruction a quick or lengthy look at the poetry of don l lee nikki giovanni or sonia sanchez shows that these three poets signif y with their readers and the objects of their poems signify­ fuh days    wallace for president his mamma for vicepresident don l lee andmemorial the supremes cuz they dead soniasanchez or nikki giovanniever notice how its only the ugly honkies who hate    and of course the master of it all ameer baraka leroi jones on wigs starter   why dont you take that thing off yo haid you look like miss muffet in a runaway ugly machine imean like that signifying is a way of saying the truth that hurts with a laugh a way of capping on shutting up someone getting even talking bout peoples mammas  such its a lovehate exercise in exorcising ones hostilities its a funny way of saying something negative that is obviously untrue like you look like you been whupped wid uh ugly stick or saying something that is negative as    niggerstanding on the corner thought him was cool him still standing there its winter time him cool signifying is very often a bloody knife job with a vocal touch it moves in progressions sometimes and it is both general and specific in black boy by richard wright we are taken through a dozens scene or signifying scene to me they are the same  and each phrase is labeled in terms of its significance you eat yet uneasily trying to make conversation yeah man idone really fed my face casually  i had cabbage  potatoes confidently i had buttermilk  blackeye peas meekly informational hell iaint gonna stand near you nigger pronouncement how come feigned innocence cause you gonna smell up this air in a minutes a shouted accusation nigger your minds in a ditch amusingly moralistic ditch nothing nigger you going to break wind any minute now triumphant pronou ncement creating suspense yeah when them blackeyed peas tell that butternilk to move overthatbuttermilk aint gonna wanna move and theres gonna be war in your guts and your stomachs gonna swell up and bust climax  as you see every line leads up to the cap the final one and the last statement is based on a reality that all blacks know peas buttermilk cabbage  potatoes will cause you to fart it is a fourtofour balanced way of mak ing love to while poking hurtfun at ones self and ones lifestyles a great deal of what todays poets do is hit  run signifying or another way of saying it  spot­signif y ing that is they do not usually sustain the length of a standard signifying circle but they are traveling too fast they hitand keep on moving to the next pointyo mamma your daddy too or booing senator ribicoff no pretty man himself but at least out of the beast category nikki giovanni the poets signify withabout a whole lot of people in one poem hitting one then another and usually though not always one theme holds the poem together when two people signify with each other one feeds the other for progression dramatic buildup to impact but the object of ridicule doesnt have to be around or vocalresponses can be imagined or drawn from the poets own experiencesyou followed him niggers all of youyes you did isaw ya implied response no i didnt don llee now because signifying often contains such a broad base of truth it has been known to cause in fact it is famous for causing a fight or a death it can get too down too real so true and personal it uncovers too much if the signif yer can really get down and in grammar school the last word was yo mama is uh man    the second party who cannot move his tongue to balance the scale may use his fists to do so or his knife or both and it is a matter of pride no black person wants to be sigged about or capped all over    no black person can listen to some jignifying without responding in some way it pulls us in and we identify with the bad signifyer obviously this style of poetry has the power to involve black people and to move them it is a familiar mover and is probably the most dynamic type of poetry i have mentioned up to now itrust thatihave initiated here arather complete incomplete picture of   where black poetry is at some may quibble with the actual attempt to i label what black writers are doingothers may take issue with the labels   i we do not it cannot be said too often  want subhumans defining what we be doing there is no human reference point and objectivity does not really exist in criticism  there is perhaps reason tempered by a good strong sense of what is reasonable what is fair ultimately ones lifestyle is his point of view black poetry is becoming what it has always been but has not quite   beedand we have love and the spirit of our ancestorsto guide us
