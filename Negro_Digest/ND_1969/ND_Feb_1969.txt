on a day in early august  william o still of philadelphia was approached by a man who gave his name as peter freeman and said that he was looking for his long lost father and mother levin and sidney former slaves like himself still was an underground railroad operator and hence familiar with dramatic incidents but as peter unfolded his story he stood almost transfixed for it happened that levin and sidney were his own parents and therefore the man talking to him was an older brother he had never seen before such human interest stories about slaves who journeyed northward looking for relatives or in pursuit of freedom or both made effective propaganda for the abolitionist cause fugitive slaves on the wing tended to arouse sympathy and to stir the public conscience slavery was weakened far less by the economic loss of the absconding blacks than by the antislavery feeling they evoked by their flight and the attempts to reclaim them sympathy for the runaway slave was created and sustained by the fugitive slave act of  heavily weighted in favor of the master this measure offended the popular sense of fair play without first obtaining a warrant a master had only to seize his slave bring him before any judge and prove to the courts satisfaction that the person in custody was guilty as charged the judge would then issue what was in essence a certificate of repossession the alleged slave was permitted no trial by jury and given no opportunity to present witnesses to give testimony on his behalf the abolitionists attacked the measure on the dual grounds that it was unconstitutional and that it legalized kidnapping the latter contention was the more readily provable as in the instance in which the churchman richard allen was seized as a fugitive and his claimant was spared a court punishment only through allens intercession the law was onesided but even had it been more fairly drafted there would still have remained a great reservoir of sympathy for those who made the dash for freedom a blend of the desperate and the heroic their actions could hardly fail to win the admiration even of the great mass of people who did not care for the abolitionists and to whom the free negro was someone to be tolerated rather than welcomed hence the work of assisting runaways was in popular favor in the north many whites being drawn into the work possibly the best known of these was the quaker levi coffin whose year record of slaves assisted ran to well over  formerly from north carolina coffins success as a storekeeper in newport indiana and then in cincinnati afforded him the means for underground railroad activities two other abolitionists with long and almost as notable careers in helping fugitives were thomas garrett whose wilmington home was perhaps the best known station in the east and canadianborn alexander m ross who took time from his career as a physician to recruit escapeminded slaves in richmond nashville selma and new orleans any balanced analysis of underground railroad operations must include its negro workers in ohio for example black people  were particularly active abolitionist leader james g birney noted in february  that slaves were escaping in great numbers to canada by way of ohio and he added such matters are almost uniformly managed by the colored people i know nothing of them generally till they are past the fugitive slaves who made their way through sandusky were aided almost wholly by the towns  negroes led by barbershop owner grant richie the state as a whole numbered not fewer than  negro underground railroad workers in missouri the loose network included a cluster of allnegro associations in st louis which sped the fugitive to chicago and points north of the variety of ways to assist fugitives one in particular was suited to the negro operatorthat which entailed going into the south and making contact with those who were escapeminded the slave was more likely to place his trust initially in a black face moreover some negro conductors were former slaves who were familiar with the territory in which they operated some of these secret returnees were willing to run this special risk in order to rescue their wives and children the most renowned of these black conductors was harriet tubman who like nat turner the slave rebel of an earlier generation was given to dreams and to prayers herself an escapee from dorches ter county maryland in  she made some  excursions into slave territory and brought back more than  fugitives short and spare she hardly looked like a person with a price on her head but she was as skillful in avoiding detection her coolness in a tight spot matching her courage to her abolitionist associates she became something of a legend thomas wentworth higginson calling her the greatest heroine of the age a less noted and less lucky conductor was leonard a grimes a free negro grimes became a hackman in washington dc eventually owning a number of horses and carriages all as available for rescuing slaves as for conveying paying passengers in one of his ventures in virginia his native state he was seized after spiriting a slave family away in a hack grimes spent two years in the state prison at richmond he then went to boston becoming the pastor of the twelfth baptist church but as in washington he neglected no opportunity to assist a runaway most of the conductors whose names are lodged in the record were based in the free states and hence were engaged in speeding the slave on his way rather than leading him out of the south these middlemen included george l burroughs of cairo illinois whose job as a sleepingcar porter between cairo and chicago gave him an unusual opportunity for smuggling slaves the most enterprising conductor in salem ohio was george w c lucas whose falsebottomed wagon conveyed fugitives to cleveland sandusky and toledo at elmira new york former slave john w jones secreted slaves in baggage cars bound for canada  t for some black conductors the water was the freedom route slaves were carried across the  ohio on skiffs from kentucky to indiana negro crewmen might bring slaves aboard as stowaways on vessels leaving southern ports and bound for the north elizabeth barnes who worked for a  ship captain at portsmouth virginia hid slaves on vessels sailing for boston and new bedford new      yorkers edward smith and isaac gansey of the schooner robert centre were charged by the virginia governor thomas w gilmer with having abducted slave isaac and  was offered for their delivery to the jailer at norfolk a prominent feature of the ne  gro underground was the providing of overnight accommodations for the escaping slave a white host might well be an object of suspicion to a newly fledged fugitive upon reaching philadelphia where they revealed their true identities william and ellen craft were placed with barkley ivens a nonnegro much to ellens alarm i have no confidence whatever in white people she told william they are only trying to get us back into slavery levi coffin noted that the fugitives who passed through newport indiana generally stopped among the colored people although the latter were not always as skillful in concealing them as they might have been but carelessness could hardly be charged to chapman harris of jefferson county and his associate elijah anderson despite the fact that their cabins were well known stopping places for fugitives coming to cincinnati in  levi coffin found that there too most of the fugitives who landed in the city soon vanished into the colored quarter some of those who were taken to the negro section wound up at a place most unlikely to be suspected of harboring fugitivesthe wellappointed dumas house famous for its ornate saloon where one might find the biggest colored faro game in the country at ross ohio the reverend william m mitchell gave overnight housing to some  fugitives over a span of  years mitchells lodginghouse activities ceased in  when the american baptist free mission society engaged his services as a missionary to the former slaves in toronto runaway slaves reaching detroit could find asylum at the residence of george debaptiste who had worn out his welcome in madison indiana because of his underground railroad activities a slave coming to chicago might be lodged with the welltodo tailor john jones at philadelphia the physicianclergyman james j g bias gave his bed freely to slaves directed to his house by the white abolitionist charles t torrey not stopping with his bed bias also gave to his overnight guests a quick medical checkup just outside philadelphia the byberry residence of robert purvis a wellknown station on the underground had a special room reached only by a trap door another wealthy black abolitionist william j whipper of columbia a port of entry for fugitives from maryland and virginia resided at the end of the bridge leading into the town he put up as many as  slaves in one night the next day sending them west by boat to pittsburgh or by rail to philadelphia in the false end of a boxcar he owned in one instance whipper alerted jacob c white at philadelphia that the fugitive he was dispatching was in a perilous situation having seen his master that very day at west chester abraham d shadd fairly well off but not in a class with whipper or purvis

only black new yorker to be so blessed one hundred and fifty in a single year have lodged under my roof wrote henry highland garnett and i have never asked or received a penny for what  gave them but divided with them my last crust negro abolitionist leaders in upstate new york knew that runaways would be directed to their doors jermain w loguen at syracuse fitted an apartment in his house for these unannounced visitors those who came to rochester made their way to the office of frederick douglass on buffalo street early morning arrivals sitting on the steps until opening time in albany the home of stephen myers was an overnight sanctuary for black dropins on the last leg of their northward journey the buffalo home of william wells brown was a station on the underground railroad brown himself conducting  to canada over a period of seven months in  in the northeast the best known rendezvous for runaways was the home of lewis hayden in downtown boston hayden himself was a fugitive from kentucky his rescuer calvin fairbank having been arrested and jailed for helping him escape hayden had turned down an earlier opportunity to escape because he could not bring his future wife along with him as if to prove himself worthy of fairbanks sacrifice hayden welcomed fugitives to stop under his roof when the owner of william and ellen craft dr robert collins of macon georgia sent two deputies to reclaim them william took lodging in the hayden dwelling temporarily barricaded for the occasion one day when harriet beecher stowe visited the haydens she was surrounded by  escaped slaves upon settling in newport rhode island in  george t downing quickly established himself as the friend of any fugitive alighting in that city o o o individual assistance to runaway slaves was supplemented by the work of vigilance committees and here too the black people in the north played a distinctive role a vigilance committee aided the fugitives in a variety of waysboarding and lodging them for a few days purchasing clothing and medicine for them providing them with small sums of money informing them as to their legal rights and giving them legal protection from kidnappers a primary function of the vigilance committee was to help a slave establish himself in a new location to furnish him with letters of introduction to help him find a job and to give him guidance and protection while he was thus engaged in getting started hence a vigilance committee was a combination underground and upperground railroad the latter comprising its efforts to help the slave locate within the united states the time has come to stop running announced jermain w loguen manager of the fugitive aid society of syracuse many of the vigilance committees had a totally or predominantly negro membership the greatest of these negrorun organizations was the new york committee of vigilance founded in november  with david ruggles as its secretary and general agent at its monthly meetings the committee listened to speakers like james emerson a seaman who had almost been sold into slavery after accepting work on a ship running to petersburg virginia appearing at committee meetings were speakers like the wife of kidnapped peter john lee her fatherless sons at her side the committee listened to stories of colored children who had been hired as domestics and then carried into the south and sold the committee publicized descriptions of missing negroes and informed its members as to the arrival and departure dates of ships suspected of harboring slaves at one of its meetings three destitute africans were introduced with a t plea for funds to help them return to their native land on one occasion isaac wright told his story of being rescued by an agent of the committee after having been sold into slavery at new orleans by the captain of the newcastle j d wilson it was through the committee that wilson was arrested and detained for the illegal sale of wright and two other negro seamen to attend a meeting of the vigilance committee tended to tear at the heart strings at the annual meeting in  at the zion church alvan steward founder in  of the new york antislavery society was deeply moved by the strong emotions of gratitude expressed by the fugitives whom the committee had assisted i could submit to become a slave for the privilege of making such a friendship he said to the gathering during its first year the committee protected  negroes from slavery and this figure was a sound approximation for each of the succeeding years the committee also won public acceptance of its contention that persons claimed as fugitives should have a trial by jury a measure they had sponsored from their opening meeting much of the success of the new york committee of vigilance could be credited to david ruggles he is a general marion sort of man wrote a contemporary editor for sleepless activity sagacity and talent ruggles personally gave assistance to hundreds of runaways frederick douglass being a typical case ruggles sheltered the young douglass for nearly two weeks made his marriage arrangements and sent the newlyweds to new bedford massachusetts with a fivedollar bill and a letter of introduction to a locally prominent negro nathan johnson ruggles boarded incoming ships to see whether slaves were being smuggled in he went from door to door in fashionable neighborhoods making inquiry as to the status of black domestics new york law freeing any imported slave after a residence of nine months in one instance ruggles went to the brooklyn home of daniel k dodge and brought away a domestic charity walker a former slave negroes in boston and detroit had allnegro vigilance groups although neither had as dramatic a figure as ruggles founded in boston in  and lasting for five years the new england freedom association aimed to extend a helping hand to all who may bid adieu to whips and chains it solicited donations of money or clothing for the fugitives and places of residence temporary or permanent for them and advertised in the abolitionist press for persons who would give them jobs two of its seven directors were women founded in the same year as its boston counterpart the colored vigilance committee of detroit was headed first by william lambert and then by george debaptiste in the absence of competing white abolitionist organizations the detroit group maintained an independent existence until the civil war reaching its peak in the midfifties in one twoweek period in  the committee gave assistance to  freedombound blacks a figure which grew to  for the period from may   to january   cleveland had an allcolored committee of nine of whom four were women which sped  slaves to canada from april  to january  in boston and new york the allnegro vigilance groups were succeeded by racially mixed prototypes in boston in september  a committee of vigilance was formed by samuel gridley howe following public indignation over the return of a slave who had secreted himself on a vessel bound from new orleans to boston the committee included robert morris and william c nell along with many prominent white reformers and literary figures ralph waldo emerson sending word that if the economic wellbeing of massachusetts depended upon making boston a slaveport he would willingly forego such prosperity and turn to the mountains to chop wood the boston committee of vigilance performed its most conspicuous services in the early s following the passage of the fugitive slave law new york city was the headquarters of another racially mixed group to assist the runaway slave the new york state vigilance committee founded in  with the quaker isaac t hopper as president but with a membership over  percent negro the committee assisted  fugitives during its first six months in  the committee was reorganized with white philanthropist gerritt smith as president and charles b ray as corresponding secretary one of the committees accomplishments during its first year was the instigation of action in the federal courts in nine cases in which a person was held as a slave in a slave state but who nonetheless was entitled to his freedom by the laws of the state from january  to april  the committee assisted  former slaves many of whom received little more than periodic counseling but of whom  were freed after being brought into new york city by their reputed masters upstate new york had two interracial slaveassisting organizations although the one in albany might well have been called the myers vigilance committee its guiding spirit stephen myers held few meetings although acting in the name of the committee but myers was able and honest thus muting any criticism at syracuse the abolitionists founded the fugitive aid society with jermain w  loguen as its manager engaged in helping runaways since  loguen devoted full time to the work beginning in  he wrote letters to the local newspapers urging their readers to hire fugitives in their shops and on their farms how many jobs he found for the more than  former slaves that passed through his hand each year cannot be known but it earned for syracuse the title of the canada of the united states loguens good work in syracuse was overshadowed only by that of william still in philadelphia the secretary of the general vigilance committee this organization had a predecessor the philadelphia vigilance committee which had a career of six years beginning in  this parent group was interracial on paper whites comprising  of the  members of the first socalled standing committee but the president was robert purvis and the agent executive secretary was another negro jacob c white moreover after  the monthly meetings were no longer attended by whites thus making the committee allnegro in its operations and increasingly so in its personnel this committee assisted some  fugitives a year its high for one weekthe first week in september running to  it dispatched the fugitives to canada or to david ruggles in new york the committee expired in  although many of the former members purvis white j j g bias daniel payne and stephen h gloucester among them continued to assist slaves in an individual capacity the successor of this pioneer organization the general vigilance committee was more consistently interracial robert purvis was made chairman of the new organization seven of whose  founders were negroes but most importantly black william still was made chairman of the fourmember acting committee thus becoming the executive secretary of the organization and its dominant figure a more resourceful and hardworking operator could hardly have been found the full scope of stills activities may be gleaned from his page work the underground railroad published in  in this factcrammed semidocumentary work still produced scores of letters from workers in the field such as joseph c bustill from harrisburg describing the beginnings of the local fugitive aid society still exchanged fruitful letters with such white supporters and colleagues as thomas garrett in wilmington sidney howard gay in new york levi coffin in cincinnati and hiram wilson at st catherines in canada still received scores of letters from fugitives he had helped such as the one john j hill sent from toronto i am as free as your president pearce only i have not been free so long it is true that i have to work very hard for comfort but i am happy happy the general vigilance committee aided hundreds of black bondmen the number running to  from december  to february  but the episode that still was least likely to forget was the delivery of henry brown shipped in a box from richmond to philadelphia by adams express when the shipment reached the antislavery office still one of the four receiving agents pried off the lid whereupon the marvellous resurrection of brown ensued wrote the author of the underground railroad raising up in his box he reached out his hand saying how do you do gentlemen 
figuratively speaking the concept of black_power and v £ black history are twins that were fathered by the same his h £ torical experience this concept was created to counteract jsl an°ther concept that the people of african descent had no m history worthy of respect the europeans who started the slave trade and the colonial system that followed needed to propagate this concept in order to justify their action the presentday young black militants are asking in many ways why the word history is so limited when it is applied to their people they are beginning to learn belatedly that history depending on how it is manipulated can be either an instrument of oppression or of liberation in most cases what is called african history is only the history of africas contact with europe beginning with the slave trade what is called negro history is generally the history of american slavery and subsequent effects  the europeans who started the slave trade in the fifteenth century had to forgetor pretend to forgetall they had previously known about africas contribution to the development of mankind the presentday black_power and black history advocates are trying to restore what the slave trade and the system of economic oppression took away their fight has long roots and it was not started by stokely carmichael or h rap brown in a formal sense the concept of black_power started in the nineteenth century concurrent with the many attempts to restore black men to an honorable place in history the concept of black_power confuses most people because they are looking for a complicated system black_power means no more or less than the right to determine your own destiny starting with the control of your own communities this is the same thing that every ethnic group in america hasor is trying to get black_power without a respect for black history is meaningless until the essential manhood of a people is respected no power in their hands is effective in a speech made in cuba last year stokely carmichael while addressing himself to the subject black_power and the third world said this since  the cry of the rebellions has been black_power in this cry there was an ideology implied which the masses understood instinctively it is because we are powerless that we are oppressed and it is only with power that we can make the decisions governing our lives and our communities    black_power is more than a slogan it is a way of looking at our problems and the beginning of a solution because our color has been used as a weapon to oppress us we must use our color as a weapon of liberation this is the same as other people using their nationality as a weapon for their liberation    this coming together around our race was an inevitable part of our struggle we recognize however that this is not the totality only the necessary beginning then while emphasizing the need for the cultural restoration of a people he said black_power recognizes that while we are made to feel inferior this is only that we can be easily exploited color and culture were and are key in our oppression therefore our analysis of history and our economic analysis are rooted in these concepts with power we will take our birthjpght because it was with power that our birthright was taken from tis   black_power not only addresses itself to exploitation but to the problem of cultural integrity the nineteenth century black militants and some before them were saying essentially the same thing in different ways the fight against the distortion and suppression of the true history of the africans and afroamericans was started long before the civil war by free negroes and escaped slaves who had learned to read and write the backtoafrica idea has been a recurring theme in the lives of black americans for more than a hundred years the thought was strong during the formative years of the colonization society and some of the most outstanding black men of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries came under its persuasion in the middle of the nineteenth century while the issue of slavery was being debated in most of the country the feeling for africa among american blacks was growing stronger publications like freedoms journal and douglass monthly edited by frederick douglass called attention to the plight of the people of africa as well as the black americans as far back as  the renowned scholar and benefactor of west africa dr edward wilmot blyden speaking on the occasion of his inauguration as president of liberia college sounded the note for the organized teaching of the culture and civilization of africa and decried the fact that the worlds image of africa was not in keeping with africas true status in world history i quote from his address on this occasion the people generally are not yet prepared to understand their own interests in the great work to be done for themselves and their children we shall be obliged to work for some time to come not only without the popular sympathy we ought to have but with utterly inadequate resources in all englishspeaking countries the mind of the intelligent negro child revolts against the descriptions of the negro given in elementary books geographies travels histories    having embraced or at least assented to these falsehoods about himself he concludes that his only hope of rising in the scale of respectable manhood is to strive for what is most unlike himself and most alien to his peculiar tastes and whatever his literary attainments or acquired ability he fancies that he must grind at the mill which is provided for him putting in material furnished by his hands bringing no contribution from his own field and of course nothing comes out but what is put in the great human drama now being called the black revolution in the usa has long historical roots and it cannot be fully understood until it is seen in this context in his  book capitalism and slavery dr eric williams places the origin of this revolution in historical perspective and calls attention to its early development when in  columbus representing the spanish monarchy discovered the new world he set in train the long and bitter international rivalry over colonial possessions for which after four and a half centuries no solution has yet been found portugal which had initiated the movement of international expansion claimed the new territories on the ground that they fell within the scope of a papal bull of  authorizing her to reduce to servitude all infidel people the two powers spain and portugal to avoid controversy sought arbitration and as catholics turned to the pope a natural and logical step in an age when the universal claims of the papacy were still unchallenged by individuals and governments after carefully sifting the rival claims the pope issued in  a series of papal bulls which established a line of demarcation bettween the colonial possessions of the states the east went to portugal and the west went to spain though the announcement of the fact came much later the european scramble for africa and subsequently asia and north america started with this act the labor and raw materials of africa asia south america and the west indies financed the european industrial revolution the africans who were brought to the new world against their will were dehumanized and in most cases deculturalized they were neither respected africans nor accepted new world americans they were renamed and became a marginal branch of the human family now referred to as negroes the europeans needed a rationale for their actions and a rationale was created with supporting concepts the crudest concept ever devised by the mind of man was created to support the slave trade and the colonial system that followedthe concept of race and the assumption that there are superior and inferior races the africans were depicted as a people without a history who had never properly handled power and who certainly had made no contribution to the development of human cultures and thus the seeds of the presentday conflict were planted  the american federation of teachers conference on racism in education held in washington d c on december   and   set in motion much of the present action and the debate about black history and how it should be taught in the public schools the noted actor ossie davis addressed the conference on the first day his opening remarks were those of us who are concerned who are caught up who really want to be involved in the revolution must be prepared at this conference to tear aside our most private thoughts and prejudices    the tone for the conference had been set for two days more than  teachers and educators examined and indicated the american educational system they were told that a curtain of ignorance hangs over the school systems of this nation and that our children are not being  i  educated to face the realities of this nation and this world cases of deliberate distortion of the role that the black americans have played in the making of this country were pointed out and it was further stated that everyone from professional textbook writers to missionaries had participlated in this distortion ossie davis cited the english language as a basic transmitter of prejudice in his speech entitled the english language is my enemy he said that he counted  synonyms for the term blackness in rogets thesaurus half of which were grossly unfavorable davis argued that right from the time a black child learns the english language he learns  ways to despise himself and a white child learns  ways to aid and abet the crime keith e baird a new york school teacher who followed ossie davis talked about the importance of ethnic identification for afroamericans mr baird who is a teacher of languages spoke of the respected place in history as celebrated in the jewish holiday of hanukkah of the maccabees of biblical times he also pointed out that in the process of ethnic identification not only a persons individual attributes are considered but the cultural identification of this group baird presented to the conference a resolution that he urged it to adopt the wording of which was to say that the slaveryconnected word negro should be abandoned and in its place the words afro or africanamerican be applied to persons of african descent in the united states in all places where such reference to ethnic descent is appropriate at a later conference session concerning resolutions this one was unanimously adopted in his presentation mr baird had defined what the cry for black history is aboutit is about the search for a peoples identity and their need for a new image of themselves the black americans are trying to locate themselves on the map of human geography this explains the growing preference for the words black african and afroamerican these words show how the black americans relate to a land a history and a culture in a number of other conferences sponsored by the local branches of the american federation of teachers and the uft the teachers agreed on plans to implement courses in black history the main conferences were held in detroit may   and in chicago march   and conferences in denver and st louis followed while many of the white teachers clearly admitted that racism is rampant in the american educational system very few of them had any basic plan concerning what to do about it their reluctance to commit themselves to the correction of this racism caused a lot of black teachers to form separate organizations some within the framework of the american federation of teachers and the uft the chicago black teachers caucus was one in new york city the afroamerican teachers association was another still another organization the conference of afroamerican educators which met in chicago in june  shows the best potential of becoming a nationwide force to affect change in the educational system at this conference donald freeman who renamed himself baba lamumba defined education as it relates to black people what we understand by education is the application of all ones knowledge for the benefit of the collective which in turn will benefit each individual within the collective to this end what must constitute a basic part of ones education is the understanding of people rather than things we realize that once people understand themselves their knowledge of things is facilitated that the exclusive knowledge of things does not guarantee knowledge of people and in fact contributes to the erosion disintegration and destruction of the creativity of man therefore education must  teach black people who they are  teach black people what they are fighting for  teach black people who they must identify with  teach black people where their loyalty must lie  teach black people what must be done  teach black people how to do it and  teach black people that the destinies of all black people are inseparably linked whether we are in north central or south america the west indies europe asia or africa broadening his explanation mr freeman continued m now there must be a complete unity of all aspects of ones life and in particular education must be indelibly linked with ones life processes for the benefit of each black man and woman and all black people those who have knowledge primarily from books must be linked with those who have knowledge from the streets and vice versa to confront and solve all the problems of black people education must assure that all of what one learns can be and will be applied to concrete practical problems and their solutions if our people can throw molotov cocktails in white stores we can certainly throw molotov cocktails in our minds mathematics physics electronics sociology religion and other sciences must not be viewed as abstractions but comprehended as the concentrated experiences of mans interrelationships with man nature and the universe to mold and control his own destiny it is obvious that the american educational establishment is not ready to correct itself and implement these suggestions that it would consider extreme this would not only be tantamount to correcting itself it would also be tantamount to repudiating itself at the base of the grievance of the black teachers and growing numbers of black people is the fact that they have been educated or miseducated in a system that has yet to acknowledge that they are an integral part of american or western civilization both the clamor for black_power and black history are the clamor of people to enter the mainstream of a society and to institute dynamic social reformor to replace that society the most farreaching reforms will be in the field of education control is the key word in the school situation because it implies power to act in ones best interest at a time and a place of ones choosing the educational establishment could digest or tolerate decentralization because the school system would still be run in the main by the educational establishment which is a force operating outside of the local community when community control is added to decentralization a whole new area of power is defined this means that the community will have the right to hire and fire teachers and to control the massive budget of the school system that is now a major american industry in an address in ann arbor michigan on may   dr grace boggs said in effect that the question of black control of the schools has now become a question of survival for all black people urban school systems are disintegrating before their eyes to the point where their actual physical and mental safety are at stake black children and their parents have lost the traditional respect for the teachers and principals of their schools because of the growing alienation between the school and the community the mass media principally television have taught these children to become suspicious of most large establishments especially police forces and governmental agencies that make promises which they do not keep many of the white teachers in the large educational systems in cities like new york detroit philadelphia chicago and los angeles come to the system with preconceived notions about the ability of the black child to learn instead of teaching him they spend a lot of time convincing themselves that the children are unteachable they do not bring their best teaching ability to these communities because they do not respect the children or the community well enough to do so in addition to being poor teachers for the black community these teachers are not even good babysitters in a lot of cases they are arrogant unfulfilled and insecure people long overdue for analysis very often the black child and the black community become whippingboys for their neuroses community control would mean that these teachers can be transferred or fired once their lack of qualifications have been proven there is no attempt to drive all white teachers out of any black community however teachers who fall within the above description will not be secure under any form of community control keith e baird director of the afroamerican history and cultural unit of the board of education gave the following explanation of decentralization and community control at the summer forum at columbia university in august of  on the black experience i am going to talk about decentralization in the public schools and its implications i use the term decentralization largely because it is the one that is generally used now most words that begin with this prefix de suggest a kind of fall from grace and i think that discussion about the changes that are being sought in the school system suffer somewhat from this semantic difficulty i rejoice however to see that in this booklet the decentralization   means reforming the present school system in new york city into largely autonomous school districts joined with the central education agency into a citywide federation now this is a fairly decent and workable definition but what does it actually mean in terms of the black experience the context in which we have come together to discuss this matter we seem to have two separate questions before us decentralization and community control of course the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive you can have decentralization without having community control and you can have community control without having decentralization now there is no problem about white people controlling the schools because that of course is what has always happened the schools are run by white people the majority of the teachers are white and the people who administer the schools are in great part white thus we have what are essentially white schools reflecting white interests a white selfconcept and white culture the question of community control comes in because certain enclaves certain new ethnic enclaves will now be having greater control or at any rate be in a better position to exercise control over the schools their children go toprovided of course that the rules and regulations of the new york city board of education actually permit this to happen thus we come to what is really the crux of the situation namely the control of schools in afroamerican and puerto rican areas by the afroamerican and puerto rican communities particularly because these communities have not been significantly represented until now at the policymaking level in educational affairs what community control boils down to is simply this are we or are we not going to let black people and puerto rican people really tell teachers what to do especially tell white teachers what to do and so on that is really what this whole thing boils down to and we may as well face up to it because most of decentralization and community control talk in new york city is centered around i s  in harlem and ocean hill brownsville in brooklyn it would be well to show the essence of the background of this conflict the crucial issue of the i s  controversy is the poor quality of education in ghettos such as harlem from the first through the twelfth grade an increasingly larger proportion of ghetto youth perform below their grade level in reading and math eightyseven percent of the pupils in the harlem school district are below grade level better than twothirds of the pupils drop out before graduation from high school daniel schreiber the former assistant superintendent of district  in which i s  is located verified these figures the parents of school district  were willing to accept the promise of the board of education that integration would help solve the problem of poor education for their children when  was proposed as a junior high school as far back as  parents objected on the grounds that construction of a school at the proposed site would create another segregated school as late as  dr bernard donavan maintained that  would be an integrated school he even alluded to having the school related to a university accompanied by special programs by february of  daniel schreiber maintained that  would be integrated but by this time integrated had come to mean representative groups of black and puerto rican children as early as march  community representatives were demanding the establishment of a community group to which teachers would be responsible in addition to the demand for an integrated school parents opposition to the board of educations response or lack of response to these demands canceled the scheduled opening of  for the spring term of  the school district was gerrymandered without the consultation of the community to create a student body of puerto ricans and negroes integration gives way to quality education by the end of the summer the board of education had to admit that it had no plan for truly integrating i s  the parents realizing that the board of education had no intention of integrating the schools of harlem focused attention on the basic problem of improving the quality of education in harlem with the realization that it would in reality have to be segregated there is agreement between the parents and the board of education that the board has failed to integrate the harlem schools there is also agreement between the parents and the board that the quality of education in harlem is low the disagreement lies in the means used to improve the quality of education the parents place the full responsibility of poor education in harlem upon the board of education whose present structure they feel is incapable of providing or administering a quality educational system to meet the needs of the ghetto community the composition of the board how its members are selected and its source of power indicate the distance that exists between the body that makes educational policy and the community for whom the policy is made the ocean hillbrownsville decentralization experiment in brooklyn new york was spoiled by success the local school board consisting mainly of parents from the community took their jobs seriously and asked that a number of teachers who they deemed incompetent be transferred this move seemed to have shocked and angered both the board of education and the head of the united federation of teachers this abrupt exercising of power by the local school board and their unit administrator came unexpectedly the two large black ghettos of brooklyn merge at ocean hill its inhabitants include a growing number of puerto ricans nothing of a dynamic nature was expected of these slumdwellers in september  the controversy around i s  in harlem had a profound effect on the ocean hillbrownsville school district that month a group of parents in harlem demanded that the board of education respect their right to select the principal for i s  these parents were asking for the first time to have a voice in the administration of the schools in their community the contagious cry for community control was now spreading beyond harlem it did not bypass the ocean hillbrownsville school district in brooklyn after some protracted agitation the board of education allowed the people of ocean hill to form an administrative unit with the understanding that the board would relinquish some of its authority to this unit the administrative unit and the local governing board succeeded and began to exercise the authority that the board of education never thought it would use this is the basis of their trouble with the board of education and the united federation of teachers the dispute between the people of ocean hillbrownsville on one side and the board of education and united federation of teachers on the other side might well be a sad indication of what will soon be a national crisis in education the cry for black_power and black history has rekindled a long smoldering fire that will no doubt affect major changes in the educational political and economic structure of the united states 
late show addicts and the older generation know that hollywood deserves no thanks for its portrayals of black americans in the s what few people know is that the black community tried to produce movies that would make important statements about life in the black world low budgets inadequate distributing facilities lack of experience and low audience potential limited their success but the two decades between the world wars must be granted several achievements the black world revealed by its loyalty to the performers from its ranks that it would support honest depictions of black life the small independent film companies operating chiefly out of abandoned studios in fort lee new jersey and astoria long island gave experience to such laterfamous performers as lena horne and pigmeat markham the movies that they produced gave a number of credible and relevant selfimages to black folk at the same time that the larger white companies in hollywood ignored or demeaned them they gave honest work to actors who needed « respite from the unrewarding grind of playing maids and butlers in california and they helped train a generation of independent black entrepeneurs who founded movie  houses in southern and other provincial cities where it was all the more important to create positive role models the black filmmakers were not without some aid and comfort from white producers in the years before d w griffiths birth of a nation that infamous yet artistically significant racist view of postcivil war reconstruction negroes appeared in varied roles in american movies in that era  when films were usually no more than visually stimulating newsreel items strung together like sausages negroes were photographed by early pioneers such as thomas edison and thomas ince true black people bore more than their share of the stereotyped roles but types were important because without sound there was no surer way to establish character than by exaggerating traits thus canny jews blustering irishmen inscrutable chinese and happy negroes all seemed larger than life yet blacks appeared as soldiers in the spanish american war the philippine campaign world war i and their march up fifth avenue after it ended even in comedy sometimes the black character emerged triumphant in a short onereeler a bucket of cream ale for example a black waitress irritated by her white customers nagging dumps a bucket of ale over his head even in the bad timethe three decades after the enthusiastic reception of birth of a nation black fortunes did not fall to absolute zero one of d w griffiths most successful films was one exciting night a mystery film in which a hero is a black african detective later in  king vidor tried to capture the mood and temper of black religion in his artfully done hallelujah blacks also had important roles in  s movies which attempted social comment such as frank capras sullivans travels and william wylers beggars of life and in the s the war against fascism provided a reason for black characters to enter the plots of white movies ben carter in crash dive rex ingram in sahara dooley wilson in casablanca canada lee in lifeboat and kenneth spencer in bataan each broke the old stereotype mold in obvious ways there were frequent interracial and even equalitarianroles cheaply made series movies in hal roachs our gang comedies farina and buckwheat the two black characters frequently shared the humor and plot lines with the white members of the gang for a brief while the dead end kids comedies enlisted a black gang member but generally forces combined to deny black folk access to white screens these forces in the white world consisted chiefly of the attitudes of hollywood producers and executives some of whom such as s a lynch and edward kuykendall were southerners they accepted uncritically the notion that there was a monolithic and powerful southern boxoffice that could ruin the revenues of films which broke racial taboos thus in producing films they sacrificed black characters on the altar of the southern mystique which formed the basis of such moneymaking pictures as gone with the wind in the black world also there were ironic forces that helped to deny blacks access to the screen the success of the naacp in throttling distribution of birth of a nation had a feedback effect on producers at the same time as the naacps insistent demands for the censorship of odious racial characterizations the filmmakers concluded that negro protagonists would not sell movies in the south thus they tended to exclude all but the most comic negro charactersthe first major attempt of black men to produce their own films emerged out of the conflict over birth of a nation in  failing to prevent the showing of the film in most parts of the country naacp executives agonized over the decision to commit the organizations funds to a propaganda movie but decided to rely on legal actions against birth of a nation on the other hand emmett j scott personal secretary to booker t washington at tuskegee contrived to get a film project off the ground to counteract the ill effects of griffiths picture at first he and washington hoped to merely tack a prologue of negro attainments onto birth of a nation then they turned to a professional writer elaine sterne to write lincolns dream an optimistic prophesy of negro fortunes when universal of hollywood failed to buy the scenario scott decided to raise funds among the black bourgeoisie with whom he had hundreds of contacts through his administration of the national negro business league eventually it took scott over three years to finish a picture the birth of a race an artistic failure yet with striking implications for the future scotts promotion and stock selling campaigns fell on hard times although he tapped the negro community for thousands of dollars to finance the venture but the rigors of producing a lengthy reel film by a new black company shooting in florida and chicago rather than in hollywood proved too great a burden in midcareer the company needed new capital and turned to a white group which denied that the film would be exclusively about black achievement despite the promotional literature which proudly announced for the basis of our photoplay we have chosen a race which has become american through and through it has helped fight our battles clear our land build our cities and worked shoulder to shoulder with all other races ah you guessed it the first time the negro the new backers also denied that there were black owners of the company the checkered history could not help but produce grotesque results the movie that eventually opened at the blackstone in chicago the  most fashionable theatre in america proved a flop there were beautiful sets next to shoddy backdrops pacifist themes interspersed  with a few shots of blacks mass battle scenes set against cheap stock shots obviously the surviving company had the products of three years work and buried the original theme in a welter of unrelated shots if the movie failed it at least showed the way to succeeding black motion picture producers many of whom continued to be thwarted by lack of capital subsequent producers learned to stick with attainable goals and to maintain some control over white backers and technicians by the late s some estimates placed the number of available ghetto movie houses at  as the number of houses increased new companies sprang up ebony film corporation in chicago with j luther pollard at the helm began producing onereel comedies that were parodies of popular stories the first film was a black sherlock holmes later walton the manager of the lafayette in harlem and drama editor of the new york age produced the first of an intended series the brute starring the boxer sam langford for his second feature he tried to get charles gilpin to repeat his stage success in emperor jones gate city film corporation opened in kansas city the first black company in its region madison corey and charles anderson earlier the federal internal revenue collector for the wall street district formed constellation films for the purpose of producing black cinema a year later in  the actor leigh whipper formed the renaissance company to produce allnegro newsreels famous artists with white backers in  attempted similar movies for showing along the black vaudeville circuits by late  the colored players film corporation owned by a black washington impresario opened at tempo studios in philadelphia with an optimistic vision of creating a black hollywood just outside of the capital in  dunbar pictures began shooting in the old vitagraph studios in brooklyn and roseland pictures and recording laboratories of new york both announced series of allblack tworeelers in  by far the most famous and best of the black silent filmmakers was oscar micheaux who operated from th street his greatest coups was the signing of paul robeson to do body and soul robeson an allamerican football player at the beginning his career in singing and acting needed the work and did a creditable job body and soul was sophisticated for its day yet it went unnoticed outside of the ghetto theatres it was the first successful film with black performers made for a black audience robeson seemed to be playing a dissolute and venal black preacher for the plot line cut back and forth from the two sides of his double life on the one hand as an habitue of a seedy speakeasy with its petty gamblers and crooks and on the other as the preacher attempting to dupe a pious matron into allowing him to marry her daughter the two worlds are symbolized by two photographs hanging from the walls of the two sets in the former a worn cover from a police gazette and on the other a portrait of booker t washington gazing benignly upon the household the denouement comes when the viewer realizes that both roles are the nightmare ramblings of a young girl and robeson is really the opposite of his character strong powerful resolute and perhaps even a detective sent to close the speakeasy thus by the end of the movie black audiences have seen the symbolic emergence of a black character rising from the decadence presumed by whites to the autonomous masculinity demanded by negroes the success of such films and the growing awareness of the emerging ghetto box office receipts led a few whites into the same film market jack goldberg as early as  had attempted a documentary on africa during world war i the creel committee performed its propaganda function by releasing our colored fighters and a full onereeler of the th black regiment our hell fighters return distributors raided the vaults of european producers who were less timid about doing themes of blacks and whites in conflict the white hope an english movie about blacks and whites fighting for a championship and a white barbarian which was a tale set amidst an east african tribe ruled by a carthaginian royal line were two such films the germans contributed dark alleys starring the african boxer battling siki josephine baker the coffeecolored rage of paris represented the french with siren of the tropics independent white producers missed the point of the movement through the s few valid black characters could be found in its products the producers assuming that the new market could be served by the old stereotypes octavus roy cohen for example  formed birmingham pictures in order to produce movies of his own darkey stories while the ku klux klan muddled through a patriotic movie that was so poorly lighted from having been shot in someones garage that eventually it was abandoned the major hollywood producers despite their more calculated eye for box office receipts made some allblack films and spread rumors of others but they rarely departed from stereotypes many of them simply shot vaudeville acts movie men read in their weekly variety that deforest phonofilm would shoot the club alabam show in its entirety vitaphone did onereelers of noble sissle and eubie blake the three pullman porters the cabin kids ethel waters jules bledsoe singing spirituals and buck and bubbles as two northern blacks who ride south only to find not soul brothers but snobbish black servants who look down on them as crass yankee town negroes a few of the white companies made distinguished movies pool films with kenneth macpherson directing made borderline on location in switzerland with paul and eslanda robeson and the poet hilda doolittle as stars dudley murphy directed bessie smith in st louis blues a superb tworeel vignette and king vidor directed an inconsistent hallelujah with many sensitive portrayals of southern black life unfortunately interspersed with stereotyping so broad as to evoke unintended laughter from harlem audiences by the end of the silent film era the black community especially in new york had become conscious of its own box office potential and critical of both black and white movies in one year  three new houses in chicago alone added  new seats black managers and owners took over theaters in the ghettos from chicago to arkansas while a variety editorial speculated that black theaters would rush to wire for sound because they were the only market in america that could make profit with both black and white movies black vaudeville circuits had stabilized enough to provide regular bookings for movies even in the south and in the exciting time of flux critics such as theophilus lewis of the tatler demanded better acting from the black companies the first allblack sound film was oscar micheaux the exile financed by frank schiffman the white manager of the lafayette theatre in harlem it revealed both the virtues and the needs of black filmmaking even though no white man appeared on the screen the plot still moved on white terms a black girl comes into possession of a mansion which he turns into a cabaretbrothel her fiance learning of her decision abandons the city for a farm in south dakota where he meets a white girl who is the soul of puritan virtue at the end of the movie they can marry because the hero learns that the white girl is really a negro in varietys opinion only donald hey woods jazz combo livened the essentially dull picture everything seemed to be wrong the tedious story suggested that to be lightskinned was to be virtuous the sound track was only partically dialog the rest of it being synchronized music the harlem audiences giggled in the wrong places at the absurd plot variety analyzing the film from the point of view of box office returns concluded that the black companies should make only comedies for a while at least until budgets allowed them to use better equipment and to get out of the old studios such as metro in fort lee where the exile was shot  probably another important factor was that the trained actors unwittingly made the patois of some of the amateurs seem out of place and awkward a year later in  two other movies were more ambitious southland a black company in fort lee produced the black king a potentially important social drama about the leader of a backtoafrica movement led by a charlatan preacher it was ruined by the same weaknesses that undermined the exile so that the statements that might have been dealt with such as the division of black loyalties between america and africa the place of the church in the black world and the mean  iqg of the stillremembered garvey s movement were lost in the laughter at a comic ending that sees the protagonists scampering back to mississippi dressed as hoboes however lincoln films harlem is heaven starring bill robinson with a budget of under    m     proved what could be done robinsons long experience helped the thin plot bridge the gaps between his songanddance numbers   harlem is heaven made   in its first week in harlem a striking figure for a neighborhood house despite the jagged editing which was inevitable in a quickie movie it was clearly so good that it got successful bookings in the ghettos of baltimore washington pittsburgh chicago and smaller towns in between such gems as robinsons harlem is heaven many other allblack pictures ran in the ghettos their sole virtue the power of being black drums ovoodoo a louis weiss allblack production suffered from the usual low budgets and inconsistent acting but it was one of the few movies of the s that depicted black voodoo and christianity as being on the same side against evil a popularization of a historically accurate syncretism of west  v  african religions and roman catholicism   some of these movies simply depicted the old racial stereotypes which harlem and south side auj      diences seemed able to enjoy without resentment in the privacy of a ghetto theater one such film was eddie rochester andersons comic eyerolling fear as expressed in jed buells lucky ghost another variant on criminal typing occurred in ralph coopers dark manhattan a  gangster movie which acted out the ritual of good versus evil with the conflict centered on two rival mobs fightingm over control of the numbers game in harlem however without the presence of police in the allblack film the audience was left with the image of blacks as crooks but with no counter image of black cops the only documentary film of consequence came from lincoln productions although the whites alan bunce and robert rossen contributed narration and script the unknown soldier speaks was an intensely emotional film which strung together war newsreels showing the black mans contribution to the american effort in the world war the unifying device was the ethereal voice of the unknown soldier who describes the heroism of black soldiers despite the survival of ghetto movies by the mids variety began to report the end of the era all major studios are planning films to include colored performers predicted a  story about green pastures former fears of southern box office losses began to disappear when some executives saw that the losses might be made up in the overseas market where paul robeson had carved out a career making borderline big fella solomons mines proud valley jericho and other movies the most striking instance of white awakening to the box office power of black themes was the emperor jones with robeson in the title role which did surprising business and helped persuade hollywood to reexamine its racial policies shot on a low budget in astoria long island the picture grossed an amazing  in one harlem week but even more astonishing was the  it made in washington dc where distributors had predicted failure because of white apathy and black resentment of the term nigger nevertheless despite the success of such s independent productions as the emperor jones and of major hollywood productions such as green pastures with its ambivalent combination of fineedged characterizations and stock types variety in its new yorks anniversary issue for  summed up what seemed to be the most remarkable new phenomenon on the cinema scene with the headline story negro and yiddish film boom the story revealed how the major companies watched such trends by black independents as trial balloons before investing their own swollen overhead and budgets in what might have been merely a transitory fad thus the prosperity of independent black companies was often only the storm warning before being swamped by a wave of major company imitations despite such a shift in white attention the black independents managed one last wave of pictures in  sackamuse contributed two gun man from harlem a quickie designed for distribution in the southwest while grand national released spirit of youth a boxing romance that could not overcome the wooden acting of joe louis despite the presence of clarence muse and mantan moreland jed buells associated pictures f contributed harlem on the prairie a low budget comic western which variety considered valuable to both white and black film markets lena horne made her movie debut with ralph cooper in million dollar pictures the duke is tops which failed to overcome its slow build toward a series of excellent vaudeville production numbers a year later louise beavers gave her professional touch to million dollars reform school an argument in favor of boys schools based on the honor system the harlem tuff kids lent comic touches to a social drama the early s witnessed jack goldbergs jubilee productions attempted allblack version of othello both the older and new companies kept up a stream of gangster pictures but other kinds of films continued to emerge the bryant company did a semidocumentary of george washington carver in which the old argronomist played himself surrounded by a cast of tuskegee students dixie national with jed buell directing finished mr washington goes to town a kind of black grand hotel which variety predicted would be a healthy grosser all american news released weekly topical newsreels about the black world and the war but the best of the last wave of black productions was million dollars one dark night directed by a sensitive white man leo c popkin variety as usual found the acting of the lesser players wanting and the techniques weak because of the low budget but more important mantan moreland turned in another performance which departed from his white movie typecasting the plot concerns the brown familya negro version of the andy hardy family whose eternally jobless father provides the motive for a matriarchal family unit but once one of many schemes pays out he assumes a patriarchal role and in the accepted middle class manner saves his daughters honor from the villain thus the film realistically suggests unemployment as a casual factor in black family structure the reviewer found it far more entertaining than many hollywood bs low budget pictures and with tighter editing a possible box office success in white houses but the small independent companies in the market of black movies were finally defeated by hollywoods drift toward their territory the s audiences saw such major hollywood productions as lena horne and bill robinson in stormy weather a musical treatment of the black soldier in world war i ethel waters in cabin in the sky and gjon milis evocative jammin the blues in addition importers continued to fill big city houses with robesons english movies such as michael balcons proud valley the story of a black miner who is accepted by and sacrifices his life for a village of welsh miners the united states department of agriculture contributed henry brown farmer with canada lee narrating a story of the negros contribution to world war ii j thus the black independents could not survive the war traditionally unresponsive white rulers of hollywood already were turning their attention to the ring of cash registers in the ghettos they also could piously feel that they were striking a blow for democracy in the war against fascism and racism walter white of the naacp darryl zanuck of twentieth century fox and wendell willkie the republican candidate in  all jl   f   attended the annual academy awards banquet and talked about racial questions varietys headline writer accurately predicted that better breaks for negroes in hwood would come from such discussions but such a result in the war movies of the s the social message movies of the postwar era and the welllaundered negroes of the harry belafonte and sidney poitier period could not obscure the achievement of the black independent producers they had struggled with both superb and indifferent results to keep upon ghetto screens the dignity black humor the soul that were absent from hollywood movies even today they are missed if one heeds the complaints against the the major film companies that continue to see black folk as social problems rather than people
there were four  i   of us children nori man thirdchild jy lory secondchild k davey firstchild and me and of course there was moma moma was a thin hardworking domestic worker with facial squints and frowns that made her seem forever pondering difficult questions her hair was windblown suggesting the woman of perpetual motion she was her hands were thick and severely chapped from long and persistent exposure to disinfectants and detergents and her palms were hard with calluses from having gripped too many electricirons and scrub buckets in the domestic service her grip was strong and while she was a gentle woman she sometimes held our hands too tight when she guided us across a street looking at moma now moving beneath the slogan twenty dollars and consideration which davey printed and hung in the dining room moma surrounded with platters of pigsfeet chitterlings chicken heaped a mountainhigh with potato salad coleslaw ready for sale the proceeds to be donated for the betterment of the lot of general maids and chambermaids so overwhelmingly represented here moma weaving around them greeting them her hair combed severely from her face and pinned at the back of her head in a modest bun severity being required to control it looking at moma now i am a child again looking at moma now and thinking of moma as she was i again see the four of us wideeyed children on holiday running to keep abreast of her quick direct steps she turning now and then to see if we were following and calling hurry children and stepping into the race again the wind lifting her hair sometimes laying it down again sometimes not and moma not minding either way we began our journey imagining the mountains and rivers we would crossalthough we never saw any mountains and the only river we  crossed was the schuylkilland we expressed so much enthusiasm that moma had to restrain us almost we ran ahead of her and back again and ahead until we met the crosswalk felt the gnawing urge to race across the street exerting our urge with leaps and yells until moma stood beside us and guided us across the street her large warm hand engulfed ours and our hands explored the warm hard roughness with insatiable curiosity sometimes we giggled we said her hands tickled she said ours would tickle too if we worked as hard as she did the best recreation moma could afford was a train or bus ride into the shopping center where we looked in the store windows or savored frankfurters with mustard and root beer in the fiveanddime then home again w sunday was another special day moma polished our shoes dressed us in our sunday clothes and sent norman and davey next door so that mr cunningham our neigh w  w bor could tie their ties then moma dressed herself and asked us girls if she looked presentable and we went to church old and young women smiled at us and at moma and remarked to her that we were wellbehaved some of them said moma looked as young as we and of course moma was proud to hear that moma confided that she was thirtyfive and we children began to notice how long moma remained thirtyfive the neighbors said that moma took excellent care of us and that she had taught us good manners moma replying that she did the best she could moma was proud of us and proud that she was managing to care for us after popa died now and then we could see a moment of sadness pass over momas face when she sat alone in the living room where she and popa used to sit where popa died of a heart attack the living room was filled with apprehension the day moma called us together in the urgent way she had when she had something important to tell us or when she was going to reprimand us the insurance money she received after popa died was almost gone she had to find a jobperhaps housecleaning because it was the only way she knew to earn a living her finding a job meant that we would not see her as much as we used to that we should not feel abandoned or neglected she would make us her little helpers maryellen could do the errands at the neighboring stores norman could scrape the dishes and discard the scraps lory would wash the dishes and prepare our breakfast of cereal and milk and davey would take his wagon to the supermarket and earn money by carrying the ladies groceries home things would be difficult for a while but if grandmoma was able to manage a houseful of children moma could manage a house of four ? ? ? moma worked long hours scrubbing floors washing and ironing clothes she even washed walls and windows evenings she returned from work tired and cross scolded us for having used too much milk or too much sugar or for burning too many lights we were not allowed to have lights in any part of the house other than where we were at the time we could not watch more than two television shows an evening she scolded us for running too much water letting water run down the drain when no one was using it was a waste moma said we watched moma with bewilderment and sometimes tears in the backs of our eyes as she changed to a person we no longer knew one evening after having discovered that each of us had eaten an apple reserved for the next days lunch moma scolded us so severely that suddenly the four of us at once began to cry all the tears we had restrained so long moma was taken aback children she said children and we buried our heads in the folds of her clothing children look at moma let her see those big pretty eyes she pried our hands from her body and embraced us sit down children moma wants to explain something to you you want to hear it don you we nodded and slid rthe sofa and listened to her explain that she worked hard that sometimes bad things happened at work that made her cross she said that she loved us and tucked us happy into bed nights when she thought we were asleep moma sat telling mr cunningham how humiliated some of the women made her feel they planted silver dollars and quarters around the floors moma said to see if she would steal them one woman planted so many quarters around the floors that moma left a note describing the places where the quarters lay and said she hadnt dared to move them and that since she couldnt move them she wasnt able to clean sufficiently she told mr cunningham that the women should have been more daring with their moneyplanting and dropped some dollar bills something that would have done poor folks some real good had they been tempted they seldom gave moma enough to eat one of the women used to fill her refrigerator with steaks hams and every kind of meat poor folks forgot existed moma said but all she could give moma was a cheese sandwich and a cup of tea moma said that at the weeks end the woman had meat left over and spoiling the woman didnt want to throw it away so she wrapped it up and gave it to moma moma said she thanked her for it and when she left the house she threw it away being rich should make vou feel good moma said but she wasnt going to get sick from rich folks bad meat moma took some chitterlings the next time she went to work there whats that olivia the woman asked chitterlings chitterlings for my lunch but i give you lunch its not like im used to eating whats this chitterlings oh its the part of the pig nobody else will eat so they sell it to the poor folks moma said the woman didnt say another word but stared at her with a strange smile on her face like she was paralyzed then there was the woman who reserved a set of cracked plates for moma to eat from moma ate in the kitchen while the family ate together in the dining room moma said the deepest hurt came when she saw the dog eating from the same plate reserved for her we whispered among ourselves the hope that moma would stop working altogether and come home forever but we knew that there would be no money even though davey earned as much as twenty dollars a week carrying groceries at the supermarket moma worked for a woman who was sick with an incurable disease she didnt know what it was but she tolerated the womans ill temper because of her condition and because she felt sorry for her but she cursed moma one day and moma said her throat became so filled up that she couldnt say a word but stared at the woman hot tears running down her face and she must have looked pitiful because the woman apologizedthe first time moma said that she had acted humanly towards her but it was too late moma finished the days work and never returned miss olivia we heard mr cunningham say you can put an end to all of this you knowyou wouldnt have to work if youd marry me and the children would have a father but moma said mr cunninghammr cunningham and we imagined moma patting mr cunningham on the hand in a gesture of appreciation which she could not otherwise express    mr cunningham was a nice man he repaired leaking pipes unclogged the plumbing tended the cracked plaster replaced electric fuses or cut norman and daveys hair and refused to accept money so moma invited him to sunday dinner mr cunningham was a big conscientious goodlooking bachelor he had white hair that he said he poured white shoe polish on he smoked lots of cigarettes and had a foggy laugh that sounded as if the smoke had collected in his throat and he had laugh wrinkles he coughed a lot and moma said he smoked too much moma spoke of mr cunningham with pride and respect and wondered why he never married she guessed he never married because he spent half of his life in the united states army i loved to stand and look at mr cunninghams white hair and to watch the wrinkles around his eyes deepen and spread when he laughed he laughed all of the time as if he enjoyed laughing moma admonished me for staring but mr cunningham laughed and took me onto his knee pressed my cheeks to his so that i heard the rattles of laughter in his throat and giggled that girls got a funnybone lets shake it up and he lifted me into the air shook me gently and put me down maryellen im going to marry you when you get just a little older when will i be older lets seetomorrow nooo the next day hmm i giggled and ran into the kitchen to tell moma what mr cunningham said davey he yelled come here man to man he flexed his arms and sent a mock blow to daveys jaw davey aimed for his stomach good man mr cunninghams light aim to daveys stomach caught him by surprise aw davey i praised you for a good defense so what did you do you dropped your guard spare the rug called moma its got to last a while yet wheres that scholarly younger brother of yours norman where you hiding out im here mr cunningham well come out of there and lets see those fists with spirit man now see if you can hit me hard man boys moma said the rug there was new excitement in our house when the doctor suggested that davey and norman be circumcised moma made arrangements to send them to the hospital mr cunningham cut their hair and put sweetsmelling lotion on it moma dressed them in their best clothes and packed a suitcase of pajamas and clothes and funny books lory and i were envious because of the fun and ice cream and cake davey and norman would be eating moma always gave us ice cream when we had to stay in bed and they didnt try to make us any less jealous we asked moma why we could not be circumcised too of course the reason being that we wanted ice cream and cake too she said nothing for a moment then she said it was a long story that took a lot of time to tell and promised us that our brothers would be home in a few days mr cunningham carried the suitcases and davey and norman followed like two boys going on holiday     christmas time arrived wearing an unbuttoned winter coat over a cotton house dress moma set out against the wind and frost often forgetting to powder her face and neglecting her hair she never protected her head against the weather not even against the march wind which she said thinned the hair and her face was a taut expression of perplexity where has the time gone she sighed revealing large hands reddened by the stinging wind as she wearily set a large bag on the table only a few months ago it was summer time flies she sat upon the sofa and slowly pulled off her coat bring moma a basin of hot waterand the salt these feet have done some walking today davey went to get the water while lory norman and i stood watching moma pull off her stockings and rub her feet with her hands moma had the funniest looking toes they were thick short and arched and looked as if she had been in the habit of wearing shoes too tight for her feet tonight is christmas eve moma i said obeying a compulsion to touch one of her toes yes children tonight is christmas eve mr cunningham will be along with the tree soon and before momas children go to bed they can hang a ball or two on the tree we jumped up and down each of us shouting something children momas ears moma davey said setting the basin of water beneath momas feet why dont you and mr cunningham get married married moma said startled what do you know about married where did you hear that just marrieddavey mumbled ashamed of having suggested it dont be ashamed son mr cunningham is a nice man hes good to the children but it wouldnt be fair it would be taking advantage if the children were oldermarried my boys got a new word in his vocabulary moma said easing her feet into the warm water christmas morning we scampered downstairs to open presents mr cunningham stood hands in his pockets smiling as we eagerly ripped the wrappings from our gifts of model airplanes and guns and sewing kits and bingo sets from mr cunningham and we ripped the ribbons from corduroy pants and wool sweaters wool jumpers blouses socks candy from moma i hope you children will take good care of your new clothes moma worked hard with the help of the good lord well manage if we take care she held up a package and squinted an eye i dont remember wrapping this one she turned the label over until she saw to moma printed on the label by lorys hand she opened the package and made such contortions of her face that we were frightened she looked from one to the other of us tears racing down her face the childrens first christmas present to their moma a pair of rubber gloves and sweetsmelling hand cream come here children sniffing away her tears she put her arms around all of us at once dont cry moma davey begged and nearly cried too momas not crying children momas just happy put some on your hands moma not now children lets save it to put under the tree until after christmas all right children we nodded our heads and replacing the bottle and rubber gloves under the tree she embraced us again while mr cunningham stood watching and chuckling with the same pride our father would have shown we had moma all to ourselves most sundays she shopped for food saturday evenings and davey brought it home in the wagon she lengthened the hems of lorys and my dresses and lengthened norman and daveys pants cuffs exclaiming that we grew taller every week when lory outgrew her clothing they were passed to me and davey passed his to norman once moma could not afford to buy a pair of shoes for me so she let me wear a pair of lorys to school until she could do better they were too large and too wide for me and it was obvious to anyone looking at them that they were not mine i remember children stared at me as i stood in the line outside a class room they whispered i tried to tuck my feet under me so that they could not see but i knew that it was impossible to hide i wanted to die right there or to disappear through the floor a girl stepped out of the opposite line whose shoes you got theyre too big for you oh no i said my feet are just large for my size she stared at me and at my shoes for a while without saying anything i wished she would laugh and get it over with but she said my sisters feet are large too mother said she thinks she stopped growing so that her feet could grow and her shoes are so expensive are your shoes expensive too then the line she was in started moving and i didnt have to answer    to help moma i began collecting empty perfume bottles and hiding them among my playthings when i thought i had enough i began filling them with water and a drop of momas perfume i was going to earn lots of money for moma so that she could afford to buy things and stay home i put the bottles into normans wagon and transported them to the corner drugstore where i lined them on a ledge outside the window and hung a sign with the price of five cents written on it  hold out your wrist i said to the first lady i saw what you selling little girl hold out your wrist oh perfume she said and raised her eyebrows whats the name of your perfume no name its brandnew i rubbed the liquid on her wrist smells awfully good she said it costs five cents ill tell you what little girl ill pay you a nickel now and if you have any perfume left when i come back ill take one home she patted me on the head and continued her walk a neighbor stopped does your mother know youre out here trying to sell that maryellen what is it perfume i said timidly perfume sniffing it it has no scent where did you get it i made it come along your mother wouldnt allow this she said leading me home maryellen moma said in a horrified voice your moma never taught you to do anything like that why did you do it i dont know you dont know momas going to have to punish you maybe then shell get some reason out of you dont moma teach you not to beg yes moma then why on this earth did you do it stop wringing your hands and talk to moma i dont know i said crying you should have cried before you did it now ill have to send you to bed without your dinner i did it for you i cried and threw my arms around her burying my face in her apron moma lifted my head and stared at me go dry your eyes you wouldnt want mr cunningham to see his big girl with wet eyes would you and she held me so tight that it frightened me now go she said    it was our daily game to see which one of us would be the first to recognize momas footsteps upon the pavement outside when she climbed the stairs her footsteps sounded like the labored footsteps of a person bearing a heavy burden we rushed to the door happy to have her home each of us trying to be the first to take hold of her carryall and to pick up her discarded shoes her hair was ruffled and her breathing quick she gave us the usual startled look children she said as if she was seeing us for the first time and barefooted she walked to the sofa sat heavily upon it sighed looked around the room and back to us how are the children finish your school work and before we could answer she said lory fix momas salt water so she can soak her feet hurry momas feet are about to kill her its a sure sign that were in for some rainy weather moma got all kinds of signs she knew when we were going to have a visitor and whether it would be a man or a woman depending upon whether the left or right side of her nose itched she had even gotten a sign that papa was going to die the picture of him that hung on the wall just fell one night moma said the nail was still securely in the wall and the wire was not broken from the frame she rehung it and it fell again moma said i was born with a veil over my face and that i used to see things she couldnt see that grandmoma and grandpopa had special vision too grandpopa could neither read nor write but he could open the newspaper and turn to the horse betting section and predict the winner and he could drive a car anywhere and never had had an accident and grandmoma could tell when we did something wrong she didnt have to see us do it shed just get the belt and of course she had to catch us first we stood near moma and stared wondering how she could tell that it was going to rain lory looped an arm through momas while davey norman and i sought to touch an equal part of her did you work hard today moma we asked and waited for her to reveal strange tales no harder than usual children davey give momas back a little rub my my my boy is getting stronger and stronger every minute thats too strong now son youll rub the skin from momas backgentle gentle thats the boy bring moma a cup of coffee norman that new woman i worked for today is as stingy as a cipher you would think coffee was rationed lory set down the basin of salt and water and moma eased her feet into the water children does that feel good she wiggled her toes in the water we laughed and she wiggled them again just to make us laugh what did the children do today nothing we answered more interested in what had happened to her during the day well you must have done something ill start with you maryellen give moma a full account of what she missed today    we were watching television one evening when norman rushed into the living room and told us that moma had come to stealing you never saw so much toothpaste it tastes like thousands of flavors where asked davey in the medicine closetall kinds of sweetsmelling soap too we ran upstairs to taste the toothpaste lory opened the jar and we stuck a finger into it it tastes good enough to eat we vigorously brushed our teeth stopping only to plunge our brushes into the jar or toothpaste and to marvel at its abundance it tasted delicious and we were glad that we would not have to use bak ing soda to wash our teeth any more we smelled the fragments of soap rubbed them together in our hands and let the water run into our hands and vigorously rubbed our hands together to the most exciting bubbles where do you think moma got this i asked oh from those rich people they use a different piece of soap every day every day thats wasting so moma didnt steal it cant you see these are left overs it would only be wasted they never use all of the toothpaste from the tube they use it two or three times and they throw it away wow we wont have to brush our teeth with baking soda its so scratchyand we wont have to bathe with that brown soap any more its not good for the complexion moma said its more economical lets take a bath davey suggested we got into a tub nearly overflowing with water and had the most delicious bath in a tub filled with miraculous bubbles like wed never seen moma came home in the evening and shouted to us to turn off the television and come upstairs each of us reluctant to be the first to mount where are you moma one of us called knowing full well that she was standing in the bathroom door her hair stood wildly over her head and her face was stern here whats the matter moma stand tall she said staring at the guilt on our faces what ducks have been splashing in here pointing to the puddles on the floor and the mirror streaked with toothpaste and water is this the way you behave when momas away we stood like criminals in a lineup our chins practically in our chests now i want all of you to get busy and clean this room in record time she commanded and left the room time pushed on bringing many changes moma worked sundays serving dinners little by little she was able to get things for the house she had not been able to get before davey norman and mr cunningham laid new tile in the kitchen and painted the interior of the house norman and davey had grown very tall and muscular and moma did not go into the bathroom when they were bathing any more and lory was acting strange one day she called moma into our room with what seemed like hysteria and moma didnt ask her what the matter was but embraced her and in a comforting voice whispered that it was all right and told me to go downstairs for a few days afterward moma treated lory in a special way as if there was something between them that the rest of us could not share often during the day she called lory upstairs or questioned her in a manner that we could not understand and then the day came when i awoke started to get out of bed sat rigidly on the side and said lory my voice quivering and she said dont tell me tell moma with knowing indifference and i yelled for moma with all my strength    i baffled that woman i worked for today moma said one day not long ago easing her feet into the basin of salt and water she was chuckling and in the best spirits we had seen in a long time she even looked younger the woman gave me the upstairs to clean and i finished before noon i told her i was finished before she expected me to be finished and she just gaped at me you finished the whole upstairsthe baseboard beds everything she asked me i said yes and she asked me if that included the windows i said i didnt wash windows any more that that was a mans job but i said i could do it this time if she was pressed for labor for twentydollars and carfare i didnt know i was going to say it children but you know i felt so good afterwards if they cant stand cleaning their own houses they ought to be willing to pay the price for somebody else to clean it a woman should keep her own housewell children she brought out a big bundle of ironingclothes from last year and the year before she didnt want to pay twentydollars for washing the windows but she was going to keep me busy for the rest of the daywhether id finished what i came to do or not did she really give you clothes from last years wash moma almost that much children almost moma smiled rocking her body back and forth because of the throbbing in her toes i finished the ironing by three oclock and she was beside herself she said i was supposed to work until six she found some silver and told me to fill the salt and pepper shakers until she could find something else for me to do she came back with a defeated look and said she guessed that was all and fumbled with the zipper on her purse you ever noticed that rich people have zippers on their purses and the poor people have snaps on theirs moma said laughing moma davey said laughing its mostly true moma said well she counted out twentydollars and handed them to me as if i was a poor relative asking for charity youre getting so independent she said so i said my children are growing up ones going to be a doctor and the others going to be a nurse really she said and children i dont think she believed that it would be possible  she told her neighbors that i was charging twenty dollars and carfare and that i refused to wash windows before i knew anything maizie was congratulating me for my gumption and saying we ought to organize soon you wont have to work at all moma davey said my children grown up already right out of momas sight and theyre working good jobs ive got an accountant a secretary and im going to have a doctor and a nurse they dont have to scrub floors moma made certain of that where have the years gone children its a sure sign you and your signs moma she looked from one to the other of us smiling and nodding momas never wrong rub momas back will you baby moma sniffing the aroma of chitterlings flowing through the house smells good dont it children its going to be some benefit dinner moma let me style your hair and manicure your nails make you a glamorous maid theres nothing glamorous about being a maid but very soon children were going to give it a little dignity just look a little glamorous never mind id just as soon remain moma let me do it please moma let her moma tonights a special night itll be like introducing you to society if society asks why you are so late arriving you can explain you had a lot of making up to do brilliant davey thank you lory this is only a sample of my brilliance how about printing a sign that says twenty dollars and consideration thatll be good children the girls will like that moma lifted a foot out of the basin and began drying it with a towel momas got some bad feet but theyre the only ones i have so i shouldnt complain too much    remembering moma then and looking at moma now gallantly pressing those feet into action stopping of a sudden to rearrange her toes in her shoes i can still hear her asking does moma look presentable is the hair combed too severely from my face and looking into the mirror and patting her hair and smoothing her dress baby i dont like this red on my lipstoo gaudy moma now darting here and there replenishing paper plates with chitterlings pigsfeet potato salad dont be bashful buy two and three plates and help the cause twenty dollars and consideration were poor and we have to work but we want to be treated human moma is saying and she never stops scooping up the chitterlings twenty dollars and consideration from someone in the room with a side order of chitterlings mr cunningham as handsome as ever and never letting moma out of his sight pushing a forkful of chitterlings into his mouth moma now and the four of us children looking back in our concerted memories looking on with concerted hope
everything south of canada malcolm_x once said is prison and knowing what we do about canada we may even include canada however the physical reality of prison as opposed to the mental detention we all suffer from has not been totally negative to black people beginning with malcolm_x we find a number of negroes who graduated from that institution of black artists among them etheridge knight eldridge cleaverand now we are blessed with calvin c heard author of howard street dial  in reading black rage the section on education gave us an insight into the meaning of time school is pitting black time against the white time we all must face sooner or later drs william grier and price cobb say our black men purchase black women time by sending us to school and putting themselves on the firing line prison is a black mans school it is the time he has nothing more to worry about than the guards and poor facilities which can easily be compared with the police and poor facilities of the outsidewith the added component that in prison he is completely dependent which is not speaking on the need for imprisonment or to indicate in any way that it is a desirable state but only to relate to the fact that in a state of complete dependence ie having no responsibility for physical well being the black man can relax and deal with his mental and emotional needs in this context we would not think it at all unfair to compare four years at fisk with two at the new jersey state prison and though we took different trails we all have ended at the same state and this time a main stop and not some little way station howard street nathan heards first novel is a masterpiece for a single work we would compare it to the flagellants which we compared to many thousands gone which we link to invisible man and on into classic black literature for just the sheer technical skill and black understanding he brings us in the book nathan heard not only knows but also loves every one of his characters  and he doesnt waste himself or our time trying to justify it perhaps we mention this because our middleclass approximations require that he indeed should judge them and justify his love but through howard street we find that all black people are beyond judgment heard simply says we aretake it or leave it and he isnt belligerent about it angry yes who could help but be able to place responsibility for there can be no blame without a judgment most definitely but it doesnt matter what the white man thinks or what we think or even what nathan heard thinks about hip gypsy pearl or franchot because the only reality is how they feel and how they relate to that feelingand we can look or not like or not it has essentially nothing to do with their lives anyway amoral we would simply think a new morality how can any of us dare to judge hip franchots junkie brother on the old terms as hip so ably defends himself from rosemary i aint bothering nobody i aint no cop and i aint no soldier i dont build no bombs and i dont fly no planes to drop none i aint no redblooded american trying my damnedest to spill the red blood of other countries and i aint responsible for none of the mess in the world    sure i make an illegal dollar here and there and i dont follow no christian ethic but then i dont claim none yall hypocrites cant say as much can you no we cant we all play a gross game that they at least hip and gypsy pearl the best prostitute on howard street have moved beyond take it or not theyre real we run around trying to win fame and fortune while decrying other folks for achieving some degree of it we largely suspect some lean hungry young people are coming to lunch whenever the counter is openedwearing brooks brothers  danshikis carrying the latest pronouncements from an intellectual who probably thought w e b du bois was french and decided not to deal with him we all hope for a star that we may be the ones to shoot it down we hate our mothers for being strong and our fathers for being weak we sit in graduate school hating undergraduates for having faith and envying professors for their degrees we are discontented because we have not allowed ourselves to be who we are and as close to what we want to be as we can we are more afraid of being laughed at and losing our cool than we are of innovating and discovering our warmth we are afraid to love because we are afraid to hate we are loathe to hope because our fear may consume us we shout no war cries because we sing no love songs we sit in the shadows in our sunglasses firmly convinced that black is beautiful but how will we know unless we come naked into the sun we are afraid to feel because to feel is life and to live is to kill we dont want to kill but to kill is love and to love is our national manhood and our natural birthright when hip breaks the capsule and shoots up he is killing for all times or at least until he comes down the worldmost especially the hypocrites when gypsy pearl goes out for hip shes doing what every school teacher or social worker does for her husbandmanworking to help them both meet another day its so easy to condemn a prostitute for selling her body but who doesnt what is it but prostitution when we sit somewhere for eight hours a day and make the proper responses to people and things that have no meaning for us we are placing ourselves at the hands of the same whoremonger as she only she has the whoremongers disdain while we have his praise and of the two we are the most likely to contract his social diseases hip and franchot had a beautiful relationship hip accepted franchot holding a straight job while franchot accepted hips illegalism each offered the other what he hadto be accepted or not sartre or one of those people would call that existentialism we call it love rosemary franchots girl was the only one unwilling to give and take in that manner rosemary didnt want gypsy pearls in franchots house because she thought the competition would be too stiff rosemary attempts to make hip jealous but hip only offers rosemary the same position in his life as gypsy pearl now occupies rosemary got insulted and complained to franchot that hip propositioned her did you accept it he asked no well then dont worry about it rosemary thinks franchot doesnt understand but he understands all too well that after a certain point we are responsible for what we are no man as he points out can put a woman on the block if she doesnt want to turn out and howard street is peopled with memorable characters who have turned out many times jackie the one who almost made it off the street gets philosophical and explains you cant make it on the street until you learn to say i dont want to hear that st and little jimmie who adores jackiebut in his adoration never saw jackie but only the glory then the degradation never the strength never the love miss it and miss thing were delightful if transvestites can be delightful cowboy mcnair emma dee and all the people who are in the final analysis just people trying to fill as many of their needs as possible wed like to say it but in light of how it affected us we ask instead please read it nathan heard has given us another look at the whole scene lets take it now so that we can be ready nikki giovanni
the major difficulty with the negro almanac published more than a year ago by bellwether publishing company in new york is the price the big plus page book retails for  which puts it out of the hands of most potential consumers and even of some community libraries it is a pity the book is very nearly what its jacket blurb claims an indispensable reference work for home school office the market is being deluged just now with books dealing with various aspects of black life and history and many of them are very much worthwhile but few of them manage to bring together within the covers of a single volume so much useful information much of this information is backed up with maps and charts there is an extensive selected bibliography and there is a rather comprehensive index nevertheless there also are many glaring errors of omission some misinformation and misplaced emphasis the two gentlemen responsible for compiling and editing the negro almanac are dr harry a ploski and dr roscoe c brown jr both of the faculty of new york university on the evidence of the book drs ploski and brown need considerable exposure to what has been happening in the past decade their selections of who and what is of significance suggests that they dwell in an era other than the revolutionary age of the sixties for example neither kristin hunter nor ronald fair is listed among the negroes in literature although both authors had produced two important novels at the time the book went to press and leroi jones and william melvin kelley are the only two under authors in the ploskibrown list excepting a supplementary list of other negro literary figures which does include such younger poets as julia fields and clarence major the lists of national negro organizations and famous negro personalities also are highly selective with emphasis on the donetodeath people lou rawls is not even mentioned among the performing artists in the entertainment department the editors chose photographs as though they were doing a special issue of fan magazine too much gloss and space in the section on the negro press the editors somehow managed even to omit negro digest from the list of commercial magazines and journals although such obscure publications as ivy leaf and on the ball magazine were noted of course they also ignored liberator one of the few important black journals about there is in short much to quarrel with in the negro almanac but to quarrel is to miss the point the book represents a valuable contribution to the literature of black people and as was stated at the beginning it simply is a pity that it costs so much perhaps the publishers will consider in the near future bringing out a paperback edition of the negro almanac selling for a dollar or so by that time the editors will have been able to bring their material more up to date and to arrange to fill some of the important omissionshwf 
who is esteban montejo well he is a yearoid cuban he is black he is proud and he is an extraordinary man this autobiography the autobiography of a runaway slave by esteban montejo is a unique item for it is doubtful that we shall ever again hear such an authentic voice from the past his editor miguel barnet is a cuban poet and anthropologist and he has captured with considerable skill the flavor of this man and his time the book is divided into three parts slavery abolition and the war of independence in the first part montejo tells of the bleak misery of his childhood he never knew his parents negroes were sold like pigs he states and they sold me at once he refuses to accept sympathy for this fact since it is not sad because it is true his description of life in the barracoons slave quarters is a recital of torture and deprivation and even humor life was based on watchfulness and the whip but there were also games and drinking bouts and lovemaking in the cane fields any student of anthropology would find the vivid descriptions of life in nineteenth century cuba invaluable for montejo treats us to a feast of festivals african rituals medicine and superstitions this is a carnival without real gaiety in which slaves cuban born blacks whites and mulattoes chinese servants the odd gypsy filipinos and spanish overlords play their particular scenes montejo rebelled against slavery and escaped into the thick forests of cuba he lived there for years without any human contact until he heard the shouts of freedom then he left his hideaway and reentered the world he had left but he never gave up that reserve that independence lots of negroes wanted to be friends with me and they used to ask me what i had done as a runaway i told them nothing i have always been one for my independence idle gossip never helped anyone i went for years and years without talking to anyone at all life after emancipation was really the same litany of woe as it had been during slavery it was the pretense of liberation without freedom the same backbreaking work with little hope of advancement the real joys then were listening to the old ma lucias stories of an africa he did not know of hearing the elders talk about the land africa animals and apparitions of participating in the festivals of remedios and ariosa of learning about spirits and witchcraft this was what he knew until the cry for independence sounded throughoul cuba until he knew that this war against spain was also his war the fact is the war was necessary the dead would have died anyway and this way they were dying for a purpose    the war was needed it was wrong that so many jobs and privileges should fall into spanish hands or that women should have to sleep with spaniards to get work none of this was right you never saw a negro lawyer because they said negroes werent good for anything except the forest you never saw a negro schoolmaster it was all kept for white spaniards even the white creoles were pushed aside i saw this happen a watchman with nothing to do except walk up and down call the hour and put out the lights had to be a spaniard it was the same everywhere there was no freedom i realized this when the leaders explained it all to us this was why we had to go to war the cuban war for independence from spain lasted from   and when it ended the americans were firmly in control of the country in this historically fascinating section montejo speaks movingly about his hero the black general maceo who was killed during the war he thinks that the cuban patriot general maximo gomez has been given too noble a place in history he suggests that gomez might have collaborated with the americans in the sinking of the mainean act that brought the americans to cuba above all he enunciates the contempt americans had for blacks their disregard of cuban customs their abuse of cuban women and their spread of racist venom among the cubans he remains convinced however that truth will always triumph for now he sees that cubans have become masters of their country it is irrelevant to say that one system of slavery was more humanethan the other when people are deprived of their freedom when they become goods that are geared to the machinery of production it makes no sense to compare systems yet there is one striking difference in the panoply of slavery in cuba and in this country african culture remained deeply entrenched in cuba during slavery montejo emphatically states that the strongest gods are african and so he cannot understand why they permitted slavery he further observes that no person is one thing pure and simple in this country because all the religions have got mixed together the african brought his which is the stronger one and the spaniard brought his which isnt so strong but you should respect them all that is my way of thinking he has great respect for the old men of his youth who were born in africa and were therefore special people who had to be treated differently because they knew all about religious matters he notes that they were called the muzzled ones by the creoles because of their inability to speak spanish but for him they were the essence of gentility fortitude and good manners they taught me many things without being able to read or writecustoms which are more important than knowledge to be polite not to meddle in other peoples affairs to speak softly to be respectful and religious to work hard esteban montejo knew from whence he came he had the myths the superstitions and the festivals of a strong culture and these were enough to sustain him to tell him that the symbols of inferiority heaped upon his race were a travesty of the past his ancestors knew it was this knowledge that enabled him to live like a hermit in the siguanea forests to say of slavery it was repugnant to me it was shameful  it was like a plagueit still seems like that today it was his confidence in that past that made him deride the whites who believed that the blacks were created for locks and bolts and whips and with whom he refused to truck since they believed they were the lords of creation and it is precisely his belief in that noble past that enables him to say today at  that even if i had to die tomorrow i would not give up my pride he throws down the gauntlet to those who would limit human freedom who would dare to set limits on a mans aspirations thats why i say i dont want to die so i can fight in all the battles to come and im not going into the trenches or using any of those modern weapons a machete will do for me this is the voice of a man and it is the resonance of this voice that must reverberate on our psyches for black men must be proud again they must reach out to grab the world by its balls and fashion it to suit them it is this stubbornness this refusal to admit defeat in the teeth of a racist system designed to destroy them that should be the rallying call of american blacks for the black mans history in this western world is nothing if it is not one of indestructibility of his tenacious belief that he would not die but would confirm his humanity until his children were strong enough to proclaim it from every rooftop and that belief has not been in vain for there are now loud echoes resounding from the voices of the last poets
