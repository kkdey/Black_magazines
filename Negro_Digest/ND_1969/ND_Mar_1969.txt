dear brothers and sisters this letter may touch on sensitive and painful areas but it is based on the assumption that every contradiction within our struggle must be examined with relentless care and discussed with total cardor throughout the brotherhood of our blackness on the other hand it must also be clear that i do not assume that those of us who work out in the academic halls of the south are any more free from powerful and ironic inner confusions than vou who operate in the north nevertheless there are certain current developments among you which appear dangerousindeed disastrousfrom our perspective we are convinced that no meaningful building of the black university can take place unless at least some of these issues are resolved so i have taken it upon myself to try to articulate our general concerns especially as they are directed to those of you who study and teach on northern campuses let me get to the point in the most brutal manner first and then attempt to elaborate with greater precison as i go the center of our concern is this do the black student and faculty brothers in northern schools  realize that much of your motion over the past year has often appeared to encourage the destruction of those colleges and universities where some  black students study in the south besides do you realize that such action towards destruction puts you in league with many white northern academic administrators who are ready to deny the future of black southern education ready to manipulate the death of potentially powerful black institutions now let me say more fully what i mean over the past several years for dozens of good bad and indifferent reasons the schools of the north have been discovering that they need black students faculty persons and various levels of blackoriented curriculum as you well know the current commercial value of blackness has not been one of the least of the reasons for the belated and somewhat sudden awakening as might have been expected these white institutions turned increasingly towards the black campuses of the south there they found a readymade supply of black faculty and discovered the presence of some afroamerican curriculum which had not been destroyed by integration in addition they began to enter into serious competition with the southern schools for the best black students all this action was facilitated by the ready access such institutions had to the very financial sources which had been traditionally parsimonious in their help to black schools for some of the same tasks of course it should also be said loudly that the braindraining process was significantly aided by the great hesitancy on the part of many faculty persons and administrators in the predominantly negro colleges to realize that our experience as a people was worthy of serious academic exploration and by their failure to offer the younger black scholars those encouragements which money cannot buy but that is another article then came the assassination of our brother in april  and many of you stepped up the pace of your action a hundredfold wherever you were gathered on the northern campuses whatever your numbers you demanded more faculty more courses more black students than ever before freedom now became blackness now so you rapped with articulate vigor boycotted threatened all kinds of things took over meetings classes and buildingsand generally raised hell meanwhile we watched from the south we applauded we laughed at trembling white administrators who seemed ready to offer you everything you demandedsometimes before the words were dry on the leaflets occasionally we joined in the action on your behalf and strengthened our own students in their resolve to their own southern thing as a matter of fact when an increasingly large number of us were wafted through the skies to visit your campuses as consultants and lecturers and to become objects of tempting salary offers some of our egos were momentarily bolstered or our minds momentarily deranged beyond description our black academic forefathers had never known such high adventure we thought now for a variety of reasons a blessed but painful clarity has begun to break into our euphoric white visions we realize now that this situation is clearly neither a matter for laughter nor for selfgratification rather it seems evident that we wereand arebeing tempted to sell out the black colleges of the south and it appears no less evident that many of you wereand areunwittingly acting as agents in the process being used by persons who are not unwitting at all what we see in the new black light is that we are being called upon bv the northern administrators though your voices are often the ones on tie phones to give our energies our course outlines and finally our fullt me talents to these institutions so for instance programs in afroamerican studies begin to spring up from the ithaca to berkeley and we are invited to help staff them all again it also appears that northernbased financial sources are more ready to fund afroamerican studies in rural ohio and upstate new york than in the heart of the black south this means of course that it is possible for the northern schools in the postassassination period to offer salaries sometimes fifty to one hundred per cent higher than the black schoolsto say nothing of space time atmosphere and assistance for research and publishing not only is this happening to us a faculty persons but we watch as you count your numbers on the campuses we hear you demanding more black company especially from among the ranks of the brilliant brothers and sisters on the block and it becomes clear what this means for us it means that recruiters now often black from the north move more fully than ever before into the traditional southern territories of the black schools and offer fabulous scholarships and other financial aid to the best black students available they also offer of course the prestige of their names to a still prestigeconscious black community when collegebourd brothers and sisters weigh these offers against those of the black schoos often latemoving black schools it is understandably hard for themfor you to resist thus the southern colleges face increased deracination on every level by now it should be clear that this southern exposure provides a different perspective therefore it is not a matter of our begrudging you the blackness you so sorely need in those bastions of whiteness rather it is a matter of letting you know how it looks to us for instance as the white administrators of the north and south explain their newly discovered love for black students and faculty and their sudden conversion to black studies we who are the objects of that bulldozing love had to hear move than the words which are spoken we think our southern position allowsus to hear essentially these sentiments from the keepers of the embattled educational establishments we are determind to get our black multitokens up here they say if we dont do it quickly well lose money status and perhaps some of our nicest buildings therefore we have learned well our lessons from the black communitys hero and we are determined to get students courses and faculty members by any means necessary if that involves the destruction of the black schools of the south so be it we never thought very much of them anyway weve got the money and the prestige they havent as everyone knows money and prestige buy everything even loudtalking guntoting black militants indeed just as this letter to you was being completed two black students from northwestern university came into my office at spelman i had met them during one of my visits up north two years before and now they were in atlanta returning the visitand recruiting black students for northwestern just as i was presenting to them some of the central concerns of my letter the phone rang and the long distance operator introduced the voice of an old acquaintancea dean at a prestigious white institution in pennsylvania he said he wanted to know if there was any directory of black scholars available or if i had a list i could give him because his afroamerican student organization was demanding black faculty representation in every department of the college he had already seen a piece of writing in which i had decried the raping of black schools but he was calling anyway he said i told him that i was quite serious in my published position and therefore had no intention of giving him such a list when we needed in the black schools every excellent black scholar we could find at that point he produced a fascinating and revealing response one worth reporting he said you realize of course that there are many persons in the northern schools who have serious questions about whether those institutions should continueat least as black schools and that is one of the reasons why they have no hesitation about attempting to draw from them whatever faculty they can the conversation came to a more or less abrupt halt after that and i reported it to my friends from northwestern for the same purpose that i report it to you to ask whether you have pondered the implications of such attitudes as you make your moves of course when we consider the past performances of the colonizing world the attitude of the white administrators should not startle us the metropolitan areas have had no more qualms about sapping the human creative resources of their colonies in a later period than they did about claiming the physical resources in an earlier more blatant time nor should good intentions becloud the issue for if they do exist anywhere they do not in any way lessen the impact of the attitudes which make the socalled braindrain possible whatever has suited the purpose of the colonizers has been defined as good and necessary whether it takes place between brussels and leopoldville or between new haven and atlanta nor does it matter that the term has sometimes been assimilation and at other times it has been integration ultimately it spells destruction of the heart of the colonized people if it is not stopped ultimately it is reminiscent of harold cruses lament for the cultural now followed by the physical destruction of the heart of harlem finally when we remember the historical attitudes of white northern institutions towards the black schools of the south we are not surprised for the current action fits well their pattern of basic unconcern about the needs of black life what does surprise and trouble us is the way in which many of you brothers and sisters on the northern campuses are participating fully in the patterns of our common destruction i say common destruction out of a conviction that whatever diminishes the life and vitality of any significant black institutions especially those which have been rooted in our history and which are now being pushed to an encounter with our essential blackness is a destroyer of us all so this letter comes as an urgent fraternal message raising what is for us a crucial set of concerns assuming that we are no longer committed to the individualistic ethos of america nor to integration as it has so far been defined and assuming that one of our major goals is the building of new levels of solidarity within the black community i wish to raise the following questions for serious discussion   as you assess the total struggle and your own particular situations in the north in what ways may those of us who teach on southern campuses be of greatest help to you how much of our energies should be spent in consulting and lecturing in the north at your request when there is so much business to take care of down here many of you have been involved in attempts to recruit us to teach fulltime on northern campuses urging us to take the to year appointments which we have been offered how do you reconcile this position with the needs of the thousands of black students in the south though i have no inclination to play the numbers game it is important to consider the fact that the black student group usually numbers less than  on most northern campuses and  is an unusually large figurethough it often represents a miniscule percentage of the total student body on the other hand you ask us to leave campuses with black student populations ranging from  to more than   if we really intend to make the search for the black university more than good rapping material for a hundred conferences then where can we take the best concrete first stepson a white campus or a traditionally negro one especially when we consider the service the black university must render to its immediate community is it contradictory in the extreme to consider such nationbuilding service coming from black universities in overwhelmingly white institutions  one former professor at a wellknown negro university recently announced to the world that he will do his black thing from now on at a predominantly white school he made this decision he said because black schools eventually will be more likely to imitate a good thing if it happens in a white context first without using such words other black faculty persons have evidently taken a similar point of view how does that way of producing blackness fit into our rhetoric concerning the needs of the community is it really more imitation that we must have now  considering our sadly limited resources can there be more than a few really excellent programs or institutes in afroamerican studies in this country is it possible that the recent announcements of the creation of at least two dozen such programs will lead to even more dispersion of our black talents rather than to the consolidation we so badly need for this period if only a few such black research and teaching centers can live with significant integrity where should they be developed indeed where will they find nurture during a period of prolonged struggle  to move to an even more directly personal level have any of you considered the possibility that it might make more sense to bring  black students to a blackoriented professor in the south than to take him away from his campus in other words have you questioned your own locations seriously in the light of our need to gather ourselves together  have you given serious thought to your own sense of vocation the building of the black university whether it be realized in one or a dozen locations demands totally committed teachers organizers and administrators who have moved beyond jiving to real work what about you perhaps you dont know that black students in the south on the negro campuses are also calling for more black faculty when will we find them these are as i said questions for discussion though they may sound rhetorical and loaded at points they are not meant to stifle debate if they seem unfairly weighted they simply bear all the freight of my own fullest concerns for our future in this strange land even as i raise the questions though i am well aware of the fact that many of you may have currently excellent reasons for staying on the northern campuses where you are so as we develop those discussions which must question and reexamine both the southern and nothern black academic positions i wish to add a few concrete suggestions for action action which may make it possible for us to serverather than destroy each other where we are now l on the recruiting of black faculty for northern schools if this must be done during these days when the supply of wellequipped blackconscious brothers and sisters is so limited then why not work for the establishment of special visiting professorships rather than outright raiding of black schools under such an arrangement faculty from the south could be invited for one year we could teach one course in our specialty each quarter or semester and be available for many kinds of counselling there would also be freedom from the many ordinary academic pressures of our southern campuses and time as well as secretarial and research assistance could be made available for more research writing and publication at the same time we would not be wrenched away from the southern schools on an indefinite basis in a sense this would be no more than a token presence of course but it represents a temporary measure which might have some mutual benefit while we discuss the questions  above and while we seek to increase the supply of brothers and sisters who can do the job  on the recruiting of black students there are obviously hundreds of thousands of black students outside of the colleges who ought to be involved in some meaningful experience of higher education since your institutions have obtained funds from many sources for some of this task why not make at least part of that money available in more creative ways for instance a consortium of one or more white and one or more black schools could be created solely for the purposes of recruiting black students through some pooling of funds mostly yours in the north black students could then be approached with this offer here are the funds you need to go through college you can use the money to attend for example morehouse dillard cornell or the university of illinois if you choose a black school we ask only that you agree to spend one of your years on the predominantly white campus strengthening your brothers there if you choose an overwhelmingly white school you will have the privilege of going home for a year in this way black students could take the money from white schools and use it in any way they choose besides under the new conditions now prevailing in both black and white institutions the exchange could not help but be fruitful  the issue of finances is a crucial one especially as it relates to the future of black colleges some institutions would obviously serve the cause best if they merged with other schools to create new strengths and expanded facilities but even those which remained need to be enlarged and endowed in ways that black schools have not known up to now why for instance should it not be possible for prestigious northern schools to use their prestige to help obtain special research grants for certain work which can be done well only by black scholars or why should your more affluent northern institutions not be pressed to make other significant financial contributions to the life of these schools they now so blithely seek to rape the united negro college fund might be one general depository others can be found perhaps an autonomous but well funded black educational foundation ought to be established with its single mission the financing of creative ventures in black education this would not exempt the existing white foundations of course it would simply mean that this black institution would be able to give all of its time and energies to the task so far it has been relatively easy to get white institutions to perform certain kinds of moneyproducing acts on behalf of black education on their own campuses perhaps the time has come to press them to use part of their budgets even sections of their endowment funds to help establish such a foundation or otherwise to make longterm substantial investments in the black academic institutions these would of course constitute no more than preliminary steps towards restitution certainly it is no accident that such proposals fit the pattern of what the former colonizing nations must do to be of significant assistance to the areas they crippled  finally it is apparent in the current rush to blackness on the part of white institutions that there simply is not the beginning of an adequate supply of persons trained in afroamerican studies it is imperative for usand for youthat we move urgently to fill that gap in ways other than the stripping of the southern black campuses the various institutes and phd programs in this field which have appeared over the past year are obviously meant to meet the need as well as to satisfy you and to keep you off certain backs but i would argue that most of them cannot and will not do the job indeed some of them may die as soon as you stop blowing on the other hand it is only logical that black institutions in the black community if properly funded organized and led could probably do the best job of creating new scholars in the field of afroamerican studies this seems especially likely in those places where traditions libraries and faculties seem at least adequate even now and where students are pressing sometimes reluctant others towards blackness in atlanta that has been our basic assumption and a group of us have moved towards the creation of such an institute for afroamerican studies we think that black students throughout the nation should know this and should ponder its possible meaning for your own presents and futures as some of you know there are in the atlanta university center six negro institutions in various stages of their search for blackness on the faculties are more than  persons whose training experience and teaching in the field of afroamerican life and culture are at least significant the slaughter collection of negro literature the georgia state archives and the newly begun martin_luther_king memorial library a documentation center for the movement combine to present unusual library and archival resources on the black experience apart from such tangibles we are also beneficiaries of the spirit of the great pioneering work in black studies done in atlanta by such persons as w e b du bois e franklin frazier rayford logan e s braithwaithe ira dea reid and many others it is against this background of past and present resources that we are now in the process of creating an institute for afroamerican studies under the umbrella of the martin_luther_king jr memorial center research teaching celebration and action are to be the central driving forcesall focused on the life and times of the peoples of african descent i mention the institute here because it will need many things which you can help provide it will need millions of dollars the best staff from every part of the african diaspora students who are ready to take care of business and it must have continuous exposure throughout the black community the schools you attend could help raise funds for this institute for they will need our products both human and informational if they are to be transformed into viable situations some of you will ultimately comprise the staff and student body the plans you now have for afroamerican studies in white settings must be reexamined and challenged by atlanta in short i am proposing that you help this institute become the major black educational creation of this generation you have a kind of leverage in the white world which must not be dissipated in minor ambiguous victories more importantly you have a power which must not be turned against meaningful black institutions the challenge to help create such an institute to break down the many brittle assumptions of conventional american education to move consistently towards our intellectual roots in the struggle for liberationthis is i think a challenge more appropriate to your power as you ponder these matters i trust you will remember that my questions and proposals are meant to be only some of the ingredients in a dialogue which must take place among us the letter is written in the spirit of black ecumenical concern as we move towards a new humanity the words are my own but the concerns are shared by many other persons on the southern campuses we look forward to appropriate response from the north east and west
most black people who £ are seriously concerned about the nature of the black struggle in education automatically embrace the black university concept this thought process is usually based on a taste for the term the security of being included and the assumption that black must necessarily mean liberation but it is a dangerous process unless we as black people discipline ourselves to neverforevenamoment stop our analysis of the man and his subtle forms of oppression and subversion we must require of ourselves honest scientific analysis immersed in our spiritemotions of how educational activities can lead toand be a part ofthe struggle for the liberation of all black people one of the best ways to understand this is to pin the ideological basis of the term as it is used by different people the dangerous uses of the term fall under the ideological position of revisionary neocolonial racism while the progressive forces of blackour strugglemust beare guided by revolutionary panafrican nationalism these are descriptive terms that conveniently cover polar opposites though clearly a systematic analysis would yield more precise types of each however this article is not meant to be merely a methodological exercise but is intended as a working paper for all black people interested in that ideological struggle to understand more fully the correct direction toward liberation we are mainly concerned with four basic questions  what are the ideological bases of conflict concerning the liberation struggle for black people whathowwhy are certain institutions playing significant roles in the development of the concept of the black university  what are some of the dangers of neocolonial racist pacification and  what is the correct ideological basis of our black struggle toward liberation after providing a working definition of each ideological position the meaning of each will be examined through the workings of five institutional contexts related to the concept of the black university by examining several major trends based on the two opposite positions we hope to clarify certain dangers to our struggle and also we hope to begin to underscore guidelines for our liberation struggle  the ideological bases of racial conflict in the united states most previous formulations of the ideological bases of racial conflict in the united states suffer from liberal assumptionsillusions black people were to be dealt with as either a topic of intergroup human relations or of minority group relations this was somehow related to the white mans message that everything would be cool anyway since we all live in a melting pot also the only acceptable responsible approach to change was limited to the dictates of the system obviously the same system responsible for our oppression strange forms of racist social darwinisms lurk through this society and haunt us as we will to be free this type of formulation is inadequate surprise surprise because it is simply a function of this society and its white owners and has little to do with where black people are and where we want to go but black nationalism has never been legitimate in the united states since legitimacy was also a function of white nationalism serving to support white supremacy so a major illusion was to propagate integration as the only legitimate goal for black people the integrationists used tostill say that the problem is that some white people who are from the old school will learn in time and will support what is right every major alternative pointed essentially to the whiteisright theory while much of our black reality was either suppressed or ignored black nationalism is an idea whose time has come and with it has come the obvious need to reformulate the structure of our ideological struggle struggle throughout the third world has helped free us from the american integration myth we have come to know of colonial ism and we are becoming aware that we are a colonized people living in the very bowels of the monster our presence in this country is the result of an illegitimate political process whose most damaging contemporary effect is to convince us of our birthright to citizenship ha to call us to be patriotic and to put us eagerly to work to uphold this system many of us have merely been made to internalize the overseers whip and thus to control ourselves indeed we are a colonized people the key problem then is to isolate the major ideological forces which undergird the system and those opposing it our ideological forces today we know the american system for what it is neocolonial racism functioning to pacify black people and to influence black affairs with revisionary subversion the system is racist because white is still right and black people have never been dealt with as peopleslavery has not been paid for which means that we are interpreted as either just becoming white enough to be considered people or that we are merely being tolerated until someone figures out what to do with us or does it a simple example of neocolonialism is when a negro is sent to manage and control black people in place of a white cat though the basic job assignment is the same for either the most progressive black ideological forces constitute revolutionary panafrican nationalism nationalism is beliefsemotions of racial solidarity and pride panafrican nationalism emphasizes two important points for our identity and struggle  all black people are african wherever they are we are africans colonized in the americas  all africans must unite against our common enemy and join third world liberation struggles our ideology must be revolutionary as we fight a colonialist system our goal is to destroy it and to replace it with a system that speaks to our needs to quote a brother we dont believe that what we want is better than what others have we just believe it has got to be better for us and if two arent possible well fight to the death for ours since death of a kind is our fate in any case so the ideological conflict is between forces designed to keep us loyal to the system oppressing us or to make sure that we cannot get ourselves together to do something about it and the forces of liberation designed to reunite a separated people to mobilize the will of a people to liberate itself from racist colonial bondage with giant steps toward new africa  role of institutions the ideological conflict is best understood by examining the role of certain institutions and not the role of particular people as we are so often tricked into believing this is particularly true when were concerned with concepts like the black university we can describe three kinds of institutions two representing the forces of oppression direct colonial control conies from agencies of the federal government private foundations and white universities these colonial forces combine to influence and to direct their neocolonial extensions the predominantly negro colleges the third really shouldn t be called an institution but a growing number of organized thrusts emerging from the black community with the sole purpose of making education relevant toforwithin our liberation struggle colonial forces employ the twofaced approach to black people using one hand to actively suppress us while using the other hand to urge the vanguard forward into full view for the slaughter some see this as a paradox but it is really a vise one that is closing faster all of the time why is it that institutions like princeton harvard yale rockefeller and the u s congress will sometimes encourage small groups or individuals who are to them black nationalist extremists while at the same time refusing to rid their investment portfolios of south african stocks or economic interests supporting racism throughout the usa  how can the congress pass civil_rights legislation to help black to become like whites and then persecute adam clayton powell for being just like them you surely can fill in additional questions for yourself neocolonial forces are virtual laboratories for negro citizens who want the security of a place in or at least of white society while at the same time becoming masters of survival culture fun and games here the vise is cloaked in hues of brown a coloration meant to confuseif not to convinceus into acceptance demands for a program more relevant to black needs are usually met with two responses which clearly reveal their position  we have always been interested in the study of the negro we have a good library collection and we have a tradition of research and teaching what is left out is that this tradition stopped  to  years ago and exactly the opposite trend has reached its summit a brief search for current materials and a look at course catalogs will demonstrate the reactionary reality of this sickness  we will not support racism and reject as racist the demand for black history especially if it is stipulated that the instructor be black however there is normally no argument when choosing negro presidents for predominantly negro colleges but holy hell explodes when demanding black teachers for black courses new agencies for black education association of afroamerican educators new school of afroamerican thought affro arts theaterschool university system of the nation of islam etc are now developing around the country these agencies do at least three things  illuminate contradictions about the education provided for black people  prepare people for the struggle and  immerse our children in the saving grace of blackness however the new black search is quite obviously in danger of being subverted by the abovementioned colonial forces the positive thrust not only includes the goals being sought but also involves the very process and basic assumptions of education itself and since we have yet to see who will succumb to or reject the seductive hustle of white resources we must proceed to discuss its dangers before we begin to chart our course toward liberation  dangers of neocolonial racist pacification since we were taken political prisoners over  years ago and are still in bondage we can safely assume that a thorough analysis of the forms and methodology of past oppression will at least provide the basis for perceiving future dangers in a summary fashion there are at least four devices at work for colonial and neocolonial institutions although they are often applied in different ways in the typology of dangers facing the black university concept there are four types of dangers listed each appears to be relevant to both the colonial and neocolonial institutions the term inflated expectations 
refers to the dangerous possibility that advocates of the black university concept will be lured into the trap of believing in the devils actually believing that fundsresourcespositions will be made available for creative work i was tricked on two occasions in as many years though my action was considerably more naive than what i really believed and was told over and over and over again whew the colonial institutions especially major universities and the ford foundation use their vast resources to blow peoples minds and to cop and while the neocolonialist predominantly negro college has pull here it is not resources but traditions which often trick folks what one discovers is that these traditions are often more manufactured than real and when real frequently have been abused by the colleges reference group conflicts often result from inflated expectations not to mention the serious ego problems facilitated in the process simply put the problem concerns who or what groupblack people are to think of as they prepare to move this is often related to what audiences they speak to where they send proposals for funding where they choose to publish who they relate to as far as colleges are concerned etc the colonial confrontation is classic in that it presents the best traditional form of confrontation blacks directly facing white authority and  power the neocolonial problem is ambiguous here as blacks move toward a common analysis and hold onto the goal of liberation as manifested in the black university negroes of all ideological persuasions and experiences move to neutralize to polemicize and to expel blacks from their schools often brotherhood alone prevents a san francisco state type struggle from emerging at morehouse though this pattern is subject to shift at any moment note the recent unpublicized burnings around the atlanta university center following martin_luther_king jrs funeral and a recent campus visit by stokely carmichael an increasingly important concern is how the limited resources committed to the black university concept are being diffused throughout the country dig it the following together brothers are scattered at white schools throughout the country nathan hare alvin pouissant robert browne charles hamilton st clair drake harry edwards price cobbs william grier edgar beckham and those negro schools with black faculty are unique even when every effort is made to stifle their work and to get rid of them there is consequently no center for revolutionary black education and that shouldnt come as a big surprise only the most secure white colleges are announcing grandiose plans for the recruitment of black faculty note the recent ucla announce ment of a plan to hire  black professors by fall  last there is the problem of definition if lyndon johnson could coopt the civil_rights thrust deceitfully smiling as he proclaimed we shall overcome then black people ought to watch out if the united negro college fund could place an ad in the new york times portraying a negro in cap and gown with the caption black_power then black people ought to watch out but normally colonial forces are the first to move in on ideological concepts note the emasculated verison of the class conflict as compared to what karl  marx meant in the manifesto    only after a few foundation grants and a few conferences for whites is it normally possible for negroes to use the termand then it is often psychologically difficult for them to sav it without perjorative gesticulations terminological cooptation is a process to confuse the ideological struggle for popular support we must always be aware of the need for clarity and we must never hesitate to provide an understandable analysis for any group of our people and now having looked at the dangers we ought to examine the positive ideological basis for our struggle  ideological guidelines for struggle there are five ideological guidelines that fit these discussions though it is in the course of struggle itself that we will define what is ultimately necessary for our liberation these must be as free as possible of the above listed dangers a african identity no other  identification is as close to our history and as far from our oppressors the term afroamerican still somehow legitimates the hell of america and separates us through generations from africa our identity as africans is based on the utility it has for struggle only by recognizing the alien character of this country even though it is sometimes tolerable because of our contributions to it can we ever hope to successfully wage the revolutionary struggle b operational unity while it is obvious that one allinclusive organization for black people would be impossible to build it is not impossible to move toward coalitions of groups most national liberation struggles have been based on the operational unity of a diverse set of organizations and we can see moves in this direction with the black congress in los angeles the united black front in washington d c the black congress in chicago and the attempt to build a black peoples alliance in atlanta we must work cooperatively on common goals in order to utilize all resources and for their thousand blows deal one death blow mentioned earlier the whole black revolution is a reaction to grievances too often ignored and promises too frequently forgotten thus there is the possibility of overreaction on both sides it is a painful experience for both the majority and the minority in a society to understand that so much of its fabric is interwoven with racism the desire to eradicate it or to forget it this is a much less feasible possibility in the context of modern society with its mass media and mass communication can lead to many false starts and wellintentioned mistakes the majority of blacks do not want an apartheid society but many will stand with black only causes until society shows that it really means to include blacks in the society on an equal and meaningful basis the black students are quite justified in demanding more coverage of black history and the contributions of blacks to society although some of the black students dont believe that white students should be admitted to these courses black history courses will be of considerable value to white students also certainly the relatively inane treatment of slavery and the reconstruction period by historians deserves correction in the minds of all some definitive works on reconstruction such as that of john hope franklin chairman of the history department at the university of chicago have been written but to a great extent these are not included in the basic history courses that are taken by most students black students are justified in asking that more black counselors and advisers be appointed not that only black counselors can counsel black students but black students should have black counselors available if they want to talk with one also black and white students should be able to see blacks in a variety of positions in the university demands of the type that i have just mentioned are not to develop an apartheid university rather they are to provide for a valid recognition of black people and black students as a part of society and a part of the university the consideration of the black student as a special case in the university particularly at an institution that prides itself on its democratic traditions might appear to violate principles of equality and nondiscrimination but the university as one of the most important institutions of society has a responsibility to help blacks and other minority groups achieve the position of social and economic equality that is implicit in our system president james m hester of new york university for example says that nyu intends to discriminate positively in favor of black students to help eradicate the effects of racism on them although it can be argued that the university should merely reflect the values and traditions of society and create knowledge for the sake of knowledge many people in society look to the university for leadership and guidance in the solution of a variety of social and intellectual problems the universitys concern with black students is clearly within this framework certainly mistakes will be made the black students will make mistakes and should be allowed to learn from them university administrators will make mistakes and should also be allowed to learn from them the black student awakening and the contemporary student activism on americas campuses point the way for the enhancement of the university as an important institution in our society those of us in the university should really hold ourselves in their debt for so forcefully bringing this challenge to us
the concern of africanamerican educators must be first with education and only secondarily with those structures set aside for educational activities ie schools this is because the goal is a relevant and productive education for our people education has no absolute standards and can therefore not be limited by any predetermined or already extant systems or structures rather education is an experience in concentrated enculturation which always takes place in the most feasible and culturally expedient location realizing the shortcomings of white american schools the fundamental approach has to be either to make those schools adequate through change or to move elsewhere to administer education and before considering whether or not american schools can be altered sufficiently we have to first recognize the essential need for a new approach to education from a black perspective any educational system must be a viable cultural cell in its particular social complex and must work in conjunction with other such institutions in the society religion legal codes social organizations etc towards affecting coordination and continuity of culture and values in afroamerica most schools have not been such a viable cultural institution established by our people to promote our own general welfare but rather a substandard distortion of white americas idea of education the latter serves as a valid institution in the broader other society and as such has always had to justify the historic and contemporary subordination of africanamericans it has unfor   tunately forced many of the same such values of inferiority both intellectual and practical upon us in ways both subtle and overt it has aided in our oppression intellectually it has perpetuated a white lie over black truth in a more practical sense it has given us broken and outmoded tools with which to operate in the larger society thereby insuring our traditional position of economic political and social impotency the normal role of education as a lever for cultural enrichment has lunctioned improperly in our community black students returning to the community hoping to develop its positive aspects have ioand themselves unequipped to operate effectively very little in the educational system has dealt with afroamerica from either a positive constructive or realistic framework the massive unrest among black students today reflects the recognition of this fact the long overdue need for school systems to address the most pointed problems of american society especially as they relate to africanamericans as well as the failure to accurately reflect the history and culture of black people has precipitated this hightide of legitimate discontent hence increased student activism around this issue represents a last call for commitment on the part of american academia towards real and meaningful education  nevertheless some african ¦ americans have accepted education as the answer and what of them can they not be used as examples of what america holds for the black man first of all they are decidedly in a great minority and can therefore not be a legitimate index by which to assess the present state of afroamerica as a whole and although an increasing number of negroes hold quasimiddleincome jobs this does not obliterate the realitv that although most of the poor people in america are in fact white most of the black people in america in fact are poorfailures in even the american sense a nar » row spectrum of economic acquisition and stability moreover the socalled successful negro middleclassman cannot be held up as a symbol of black americanism because in a broader social sense he is also illegitimate laying aside for the moment the whole question of practicality and possibility let us just consider the relation of the middleclass negro to the broader africanamerican community although he is recognized as respectable by the white society sometimes black youth for the most part reject his brand of social success they simply cannot relate to him the questions to which he presents answers are not the most relevant ones in their lives black children are quite aware of the potential insecurities of their lifestyle yet they persist in their ways to attribute this to psychological maladjustment is to assume that schools are more inherently correct than people most black students dont want to be like their family doctor physical education teacher or their case worker they dont want to sell insurance be lawyers or even work in factories as apprentices the social sacrifice inherent in achieving these positions is too great for them they must be offered new alternatives not just alternative ways to become middleclass negroes in addition it is unrealistic to concentrate on enlargement of the black bourgeoisie  for this group has its classic creation as a buffer zone between the masses of blacks and the masses of whites it cannot exist without the existence of the other two externally to itself in fact if the masses of africanamericans were to become middleclass negroes they would have negated themselves for there would be no middle only a full realization of a white top and a black bottom comparison of the positions held now by negro college graduates and their white counterparts illustrates this point vividly therefore the absence of respectable africanamericans in the community is not the answer to the problem it is rather a failure of the schools as part and parcel of the system which spawns the black bourgeoisie to be relevant to the community as a total institution from beginning to end its perspective its program and its product have not addressed the needs of the africanamerican such a miscarriage of sociointellectual pregnancy has destroyed the average africanamericans respect for education the middleclass negro succeeds only at the exoense of his soul while the soul  ful blackbrother suffers a life of economic insecurity both are equally politically impotent and hence the community is stagnant moreover in respect to soul it becomes apparent that soul is thus more than a music style a way of walkingthatwalk or talkingthattalk it becomes an inner drive whose motor manifestations are present in the aforementioned traits soul becomes that which leads one knowingly in a more meaningful direction than synthetic capitalist christian materialism temptingly invites its a natural thang ie of nature and as such deserves more respect than we often give it it is as maulana ron karenga points out one thing the white man has never been able to deal with because he cant understand it therefore neither his schools nor anything else in his society has ever cannot and probably never will be able to handle it the white boy engaged in the worship of technology we must not sell our souls for money and machines we must move then to resurrect education as a constructive cultural « institution among our people aside from the need for white schools to perpetuate the white lie mentioned above other considerations seem to point to the ultimate need for allblack school systems and consequently the nec ssity for africanamerican educators to take stock of their present condition and to prepare for the essential move back to black the concern of all public schools is obviously educating the public in america that public contains a lrge predominance of nonblacks and a considerably smaller number o third world peoples the majority of whom are africanamericans because of their historical and ethnic differences these two groups are decidedly distinct culturally yet the american public education system operating in accord with the countrys meltingpot myth works on the erroneous assumption that there can at once be a basically homoceeos school  wsystem to serve all american inhabitants « this is in fact a myth because the historical existence of africanoid peoples in america has been one of separateness therefore a balanced blackwhite educational program is a contradiction of both ethnic and historical reality and  hence we must consider the alleged massive failure of africanamericans to adapt to the american school system not so much as a psychological maladjustment to be relieved by remedial and compensatory programs which in essence seek to find new ways to stuff the same rotten food down everrejecting throats but rather as a sociocultural mismatch a poorly balanced diet which is indicative of our even broader paradoxical selfcontradictory existence in america in short when there are consistently so many dysfunctional products we must question not only the raw material but the nature of the m machine itself the failure of a round peg to fit into a square hole is not because the peg isnt square but rather because it wasnt made to fit in a square hole in the first place the question can now be raised as to whether or not the present school systems can in fact be changed to meet the needs of africanamericans are such changes realistic more important are they desirable first of all it seems as though no american school has yet affected sufficient changes to satisfy the everincreasing demands of black students at all levels and perhaps this inability is illuminated by two observations on the one hand and already mentioned above since the american schools are part of the total american sociocultural complex a viable institution in that society it must be compatible to the stability of that system unless it either justifies or ignores the historic and contemporary oppression of africanamericans the society as an entity cannot exist to deal with the slanting of curriculum for this purpose would be redundant we all know whats happening there yet we have to also reiterate a need for new career opportunities white schools are structured to meet the needs of the white community our needs are quite different and often contradictory to those in fact one of the foremost designs of a black school will be the destruction of white schools as the legitimate source of education for africanamericans a second point involves the desirability of such a change in highly mechanized industrial america the schools at all levels have become the nations largest baby sitter finding nothing more expedient to do with its youth america offers a hour school week with extra curricular activities for overtime the world of academia has become a haven of escapism specializing in the mass dissemination of functional ignorance justified by tradition and legitimized as education american education tends to be a rather static type of thing so static that it does not apply its most elementary findings to fundamental issues elementary biology is inapplicable to marys divine conception courses in communism and racism are outlawed in the schools the study of them being allocated to exclusive federal scholars like the kerner commission and the house unamerican activities committee who readily admit these are the two biggest problems facing the entire country by the same token black history becomes a nice thing to study but not from which to learn lessons regarding this societys illegitimacy in relation to black people and of course there is always the matter of cooptation white folks taking over our thang for the enterprising white hustler this has always been a good gigeconomically intellectually culturally you name it tragic it is when we realize that africanamericans have been the creative backbone of this country and nevertheless have little or nothing to show for it we have to seek to reclaim our own heritage and to control the definition of our own history and culture in order to preserve a meaningful and accurate definition of our situationpast present and futurefrom our own perspective for ourselves and our prosperity it should therefore be the goal of the africanamerican educator to seek the establishment of a fluid educational structure for reality is everchanging and once established a black education should never need to be revolutionized but rather in a constant state of evolution always putting the present in its proper perspective our education must answer frantz fanons charge what we want to do is to go forward all the time night and day in the company of man in the company of all men    we must work out new concepts and try to set afoot a new man black people in america have no power to change the public schools socalled decentralization has yet to prove its viability without real control of its schools the black community that society which the educational system must serve and hence those who must have the power to define education from their own perspective and sufficient for relevance to them has only a tokenistic or advisory function and what is to prevent the dismissal of such advisory entities when political sentiments change in the governing colonial power structure as brother stokely carmichael has pointed out this is preciselv the lesson which black people must learn from reconstruction in this country and so the concern of the educator must not be to integrate by any means necessary the africanamerican student into a basically dysfunctional educational system but rather if he chooses to work within that system to work towards its destruction as a source of black oppression for those who do not wish to accept the cold reality of this there is a sort of alternate approach and that is to merely strive to offer a valid educational experience to the africanamerican student one which evolves from a black frame of reference operates with materials drawn from the black experience and prepares the individual for relevant and effective functioning within and in accord with the general welfare of that society if this can be done within the existing structures then do it but if it cannot be done there it is the clear duty of the africanamerican educator to denounce that system and to seek any means necessary to serve the black community in which his position and realitv ultimately rest no man is  any more than the context to which he owes his existence maulana karenga
oughout this t land a volcano of student alienation and esentment  compounded in the case of black studentsis erupting in the ir form of ephemeral administrative takeovers visavis black students the problem stems in part from the emptiness and subtle racism of the college system in part from the pain of black student experiences in the society which the college system serves black students it is necessary to know are descendants of a people cut off from their attachment to land culture and country robbed of a sense of pride in pastness the roots of identity so essential as a springboard for a sense of collective destiny shut off from involvement in the educational process during slavery it was unlawful to teach a black person to read or write black americans then largely inhabiting the south sought adjustment by way of supernatural rationalizations such as the superstition still extant that if you read too much youre bound to go crazy the problem today though manyfaceted is irritated by the gross invisibility of black students despite their seemingly mushrooming physical presenceon most white college campuses the neglect of the black students needs may be apparent but acutely unnoticed in the scarcity for example of courses dealing forthrightly with the black race its problems and its contributions in american society i sort of thought negroes came here to try to become white a white student leader recently admitted in the wake of a general black revolt the black college students awareness of the psychology of exclusion grows ever keener and he longs at last for educational and political visibility accordingly while the perfunctory nature and general obsolescence of higher education in america plagues white students as well the black student is impelled to seek visibility get it together and move on up and come back home through sharp demands for symbols such as the presence on campus of at least a  token number of black professors and courses exposing black history and culture down to the inclusion of hog maws and chitterlings on cafeteria menus which already include beef stroganoff meatballs and spaghetti and occasionally chop suey black students see themselves as windowdressing tokens of black participation in campus life knowing that as individuals they are in but nevertheless wanting general recognition of the fact that they are there this contrasts with the situation of black students on the negro college campus where protest does occasionally reflect racial and color considerationsstemming chiefly from negro college conformity to the mores and values of the white college systembut more typically takes the form of a basic quest for personal freedom the liberalizing of curfew regulations and other aspects of the right not to be treated as children while training to be adults by comparison the white college permits a greater degree of freedom thought not as much as they claim to believe in and not enough to please todays generation of students reared on the permissive approach members of an age group which constitutes an increasing majority while treated as a kind of minority particularly is the white college characterized by a greater spirit of inquiry than the typical negro college this intellectual activity rubs off on the student black students become concerned just as white students are except that whatever problem white students encounter black students inherit plus the dual condition of being rejected or ignored as individuals or as blacks on white campuses located in small college communities blacks live in social isolation aggravated frequently by a skewed sex distribution where their acceptance is superficial even when apparent in less exclusive colleges located in large cities the opportunities for social and romantic philandering are more prevalent in both the greater number of their kind on campus and a relative access to the offcampus black community this quest for meaningful social relations coupled with discriminatory housing and economic considerations increase the black students probability of becoming a campus commuter commuting each day between the black community and the white campus black students experience a daily sense of discrepancy between two contrasting even conflicting worlds one world whose spirit has been largely broken in the quest for the social elevation which the black student now holds dear the other world characterized by a good deal of minutiae which the black student recognizes as profoundly irrelevant to himself his fate and his experience and yet he knows so well that he must wade somehow through this white milieu in search of ratification for the white rat race which is a chore for anybody the  chore is simply compounded by the fact that psychologically and otherwise it does not relate so well to what is crucial to the black students life inclining him in too many cases to give up he eventually comes to see it as essentially a bad set this sense of defeatism and despair is reinforced and magnified by the models of failure surrounding him in the black community on top of that exposure to harsh measures of discrimination past or present provoke a feeling of suspicion out of which can develop a negative definition of certain phenomena which the white middle class employs for social acceptance including not merely cultural symbols of status it might become derogatory for example to be seen spending much time with books under the prevailing college system structured so that an individual succeeds best by conforming most to middle class values black students labor considerably less prepared than white students of suburban training and experience to cope they grow naturally and indelibly alienated it might become more in to be pretty good at cards for example which only multiplies the probability of failure in the academic arena the black studentcovertly at firstrightfully begins to question the nature of standards impassionately dangled above his head as obstacles to the acquisition of the stamp qualified recently during a talk at yale university i had the occasion to ponder the blank and in a good many cases openmouthed stares of ignorance from the predominantly white audience when i related how all white students given a test devised by a black colleague and myself had fundamentally flunked all were unable to identify such commodities as hog maws fried pies and butter roll the professorcollaborator and i had been impelled to concoct the test at the risk of falling victims to the fallacy of reductio ad absurdum after a ruckus between black students and white administrators at a predominantly white college over the choice of a professor for a course in ancient black history the administrators choice was a young white fellow armed with an ivy league phd and muchlauded publications in learned journals the black choice of the black students preferred also by many white students bore no college credentials but probably knew as much about ancient black history as anybody extant having recently spent two years haunting the schomburg collection in new york the white professor knew little or nothing about the subject under scrutiny he was quick to admit but continued to cry out with strong emotion that he was qualified the black students who sought to break up his class could not understand why the administration would choose a white man admitting his ignorance to teach a course while  rejecting the black man who knew all about it later it occurred to me that a black historian seeking publication in learned journals is placed in a rather precarious position of having to document his work when writing aggressively against the slavery era with references from the writings and records kept by a slave society in which black persons were restricted by law and custom from access to the written word while a graduate student in sociology at the university of chicago  ran afoul of academias demand for copious footnoting fleetingly scanning library shelves for instant references from unread books to win high marks and influence professors with padded documentation a harvard administrator in the audience at yale assured me that i did not invent that vulgar practice even so it was for me excusable because unlike my professors who were unable to tell me the identity of the four tops i was culturally deprived i acquired the phd without gross dishonor and that appears sometimes now to count in the minds of some people more than all the good and bad things i have eve done my contempt grew stronger in any case as l discovered the footnoting cliques in references used to buttress white theorizing on the black race not only did i detect mutualquoting affairs i noted that a professor might suggest hypotheses as many did to thesis students who then graciously used some of the professors work for references only in turn to have their thesis used by the professor to document a larger theory based on the hypotheses of the several students i learned further while poring over learned journals that the motivation behind the footnoted expressions of gratitude to wealthy foundations and colleagues was not gratitude alone the fact that a toprated foundation has backed a piece of research gives it the boost of prestige the scholarly custom of sending a manuscript around to sundry colleagues reaps similarly the inference that the reviewing colleagues have given it the stamp of approval this dirty knowledge as one of my professors called it gave me as a faltering black student from a rural district in oklahoma a new kind of confidence many experiences which can turn him either on or off confront the black college student in the typical white college classroom for example he must sit silently bemused while his eminent sociology professor reports solemnly but proudly that his surveys show there will be no riots in chicago because as one suggested early last september only seven per cent of negroes surveyed say they definitely approve of riots a black student might not realize that such a professor like his peers at large is suffering from the bias of democracys myth of majorityrule but the calculator in his brain might quickly register  blacks and wonder how many negroes his professor believes sufficient to start a riot the professor himself may later have stood perplexed when rioting broke out in chicago on the heels of martin_luther_kings assassination but he is not likely to alter his methods or standards of scholarly excellence which he requires his black students to accept early in his educational career the black student encounters the subordinating slap of white supremacy modes of communication for instance compel him to lose his ingroup dialect and imitate the snarls and twangs of the white race there becomes thear nine nighyun law lower and so on verbal facility is frankly presented to the black student as the salient ingredient for admission to college although i know young black men with more verbal facility than i will ever have who have either flunked out or dropped out of school beyond this the black student instinctively if only faintly is affronted by the fact that foreign languages required are exclusively of white european origin though oriental languages may be offered as electives this in spite of the fact that chinese is spoken by more individuals than any other language in the world and swahili an african language competes very favorably with german this is just one of the examples of white snobbishness lurking behind the criteria of excellence which by no means however is entirely a product of racism alone running through its history also is a strain fundamentally of a different sort though it too is racial by coincidence in its consequences in the beginning american education particularly on the college level was highly private restricted to the few who were wealthy enough to afford it such persons as social theorist thorsten veblen observed in his book the theory of the leisure class were characterized by a peculiar mentality in which owing to the necessity for displaying ones wealth it was prestigious to be free from productive endeavor any work done could not be remunerative and preferably should be of no significant use to anybody let alone oneself to waste time and to have the time to waste time were the symbols of prestige their educational enterprise accordingly was characterized by a liberal arts approach where students learned a little about a lot of things and a lot about nothing the leisureclass syndrome and its snobbish motivations encouraged a preoccupation with lofty gobbledygook such as footnoting students might be compelled to labor in memorizing the idiomatic expressions and the verbal conjugations of dead languages or more currently languages which invariably fade from the students memory and while remembered are useless in postcollege life as middle class aspirants began to emulate the leisure class and education was largely socialized the principle of exclusiveness was reinforced by the need to stem the flood of recruits to professional occupations hence the student might make as and bs in all required courses only to fail the comprehensive exam or the language test or pass all academic requirements only to fail the bar exam because of political beliefs or color of skin education lost much of its capacity for vitalizing the mind and since the endproducts became more important than the process eventually amounted to a routine assimilation of approved bodies of knowledge a process which fails particularly to inspire a black child of working class origin i sometimes shock students into a realization of the shallowness of the american college scene by walking into a classroom and throwing out a concept preferably with a germansounding name such as zeitschaft whether this is a word i do not know which i might claim to be a concept for a societal condition in which there is widespread feelings of racism or intergroup hostility while students are busy copying down the term i proceed to show how to measure the intensity of the zeitschaft predicament this is accomplished i further instruct by computing an index of racial response an index of racial response by now i am calling it the irr score is computed by  observing a sample of persons from two or more racial groups over a period of time say whites and blacks passing or encountering one another on a given street corner during a given day  charting the number of smiles exhibited by the individuals comprising the sample and  dividing the number of smiles observed by the number of persons in the sample then  dividing this by the square root of two while the students are furiously engaged in copying this down virtually slobbering in anticipation of returning to their dormitories where they will ambivalently complain of the difficulty of the course perhaps requesting their roommates aid in calling out the material for memory i step back and explain my desire to have the students see the board clearly inasmuch as i had made it all up i further state that i knew that they did not understand it no more than i had and that they are not being educated in spite of what they are accustomed to believe by merely memorizing a professors fodder and regurgitating it on his test white students it is true are victims of the same condition but it is doubly alien to the experience of black students who moreover are burdened by many another unconscious assumption of white su premacy take the matter of the cultural imperialism which white ethnocentrism produces a white anthropology professor may think nothing of dividing african tribes into primitive and westernized then pointing out that primitive tribes are more characterized by the matrilineal system tracing ancestry through the mother instead of the father while neglecting to point out that this could be a more accurate procedure the black student who first called mv  attention to this fact indicated that you have to take the mothers word for it and sometimes she doesnt know herself he swore that a boy in his georgia bayou community came home from school one day and told his father happily that he was going to marry a girl let us call her pearlie mae his father said son i didnt know that you would go that far you cant marry pearlie mae thats my daughter shes your sister dont tell your mamma now the boy moped around then broke down and told his mother what was wrong thats okay his mother consoled you can marry pearlie mae dont tell your daddy but he aint your father sociology classes will discuss the merits of the moynihan report on the negro family incognizant of the implications of moynihans own figures showing for example that for every  nonwhite males between the ages of  and  in new york city there are  extra females somebody of necessity must carry a greater sexual burden than rightfully is his share or a number of women will languish via induced celibacy at the same time the condition is being intensified by the disproportionate rates at which black males are dying in vietnam depleting the supply of eligible black males this cold demographic fact will lead to family disorganization and high rates of adultery no matter how moral or stable as social scientists say black sexual codes might be similarly anthropology professors will subject black students to discussions on family disorganization among africans in kenya for example impervious to the fact that much family strife is a product of the christian missionaries importation of an alien monogamy which replacing the existing polygamy evidently geared to the demography and socioeconomic needs of the people displaced surplus wives in order to save them and produced a good deal of the family disorganization which anthropologists get grants and trips abroad to study courses in european history will skip over the slave trade while courses in american history will mention black persons only with reference to slavery and the myth that lincolns restricted emancipation proclamation freed all of them courses and textbooks in literature remain lily white many white students spurred by involvement in civil_rights activities and the daily prominence of the black struggle in news coverage are growing keenly aware of these curious omissions but it is ever so much more painful when the student is black black students who wail about the absence of blackness in white college education accordingly are not trying to destroy american education so much as they are trying desperately to renovate it their compensatory response to black exclusion has taken a separatist flavor for the most part on the surface but it may seem ironic to those who misunderstand them that in the name of black nationalism calling for the presence of more black students and professors they actually are bringing about more desegregation of white colleges than there ever was before the name of the game is the elevation of a people by means of one important escalatorcollege education separatism and integrationism are possible approaches to that end they lose their effectiveness when swayed by dogmatic traces of absolutism they become full ends in themselves it will be an irony of recorded history i have written elsewhere that integration was used in the second half of this century to hold the black race down just as segregation was so instituted in the first half black students now seem to feel that integration particularly in the token way in which it has been practiced up to now and the neotokenist manner now emerging elevates individual members of the group but paradoxically in plucking many of the strongest members from the group while failing to alter the lot of the group as a whole weakens the collective thrust which the group might otherwise muster increasingly black students are turning their backs on the old tendency for negro college graduates to escape from the black community instead of returning to help build it this new mood is born of a greater awareness of the glories of their own past as a people an image they now wish to convey also to others hence the clamor for more black courses and courses taught from a black perspective or dark courses as i overheard one white colleague tell another later translated by a sociology professor into colorcompatible courses in the effort to make education relevant to the black communityand by indirection to the white communitythe communities themselves may be transformed each in its own way and so to speak made relevant to a bona fide education thus black student endeavors not only if successful might bring about a kind of black renaissance they could possibly wield an impact on the entire cemetery of american education
during a im y fiv ej ttx £ day weekend that q  r started on nov  miqrr  more than  students scholars and artists from  states and more than  colleges and universities gathered at howard university for a conference called towards a black university it was the most comprehensive group of great black thinkers ever to focus on this single issue if you ran your finger down the guest list it would fall on names like dr alvin poussaint leroi jones maxroach harold cruse rhody mccoy ossie davis maul ana ron karenga stokely carmichael dr andress taylor and hundreds of others with national and local reputations to the howard campus the conference had the effect of a rock thrown into a pool it caused ripples but two months later the surface of the pool gave little sign that the questions raised by the conference were submerged there however for some like acklyn lynch a social science instructor at howard who helped to design the conference it achieved exactly what he had supposed it would it gave people a chance to get together and start to talk about the kinds of things they were going to have to do it furthered the dialogue he added that he was still talking and exchanging ideas by telephone with people from all over the country people he had met at the conference during those bright warm five days the howard campus was full of dashikis afros undercover fbi agents and revolutionary talk former howard instructor nathan hare had declined an invitation to return for the conference because he said howard students would rather talk about a black university instead of making the university black he stayed at san francisco state college where students were doing more than talking his statement read unless every howard student comes armed with a shotgun and a molotov cocktail they are defenseless against an amos n andy administration lynch reflected later however that talk was all they had intended to do back in the s and s scientists from all over the world were meeting and talking about space exploration but the first flight didnt take place until  years later buddy hunt a howard freshman interrupted to say that the black university couldnt wait that long we were all sitting in lynchs office on the third floor of founders library lynch was quick to add that he had not meant that it should he turned from marking final examination papers but you cant have a fiveday conference and after its over go out and build a black university there are thousands of questions that you have to answer first but the prospect of revolutionary talk was enough to bring a reaction from the trustees i quoted to lynch a statement the board had issued to the effect that howard was founded  years ago primarily for the education of disadvantaged black people but nothing in its charter will support a black university they said seemingly unmindful that howard  years later has very little relation to the really disadvantaged black people who live in the slums surrounding the campus in northwest washington the trustees were making it plain that the school which has produced half the countrys black doctors a good percentage of its black lawyers senator edward brooke supreme court justice thurgood marshall and washingtons mayor walter washington was not going to tolerate anything revolutionary happening to general howards university as one student called it and laughed lynch looked up from his papermarking again the trustees didnt have to tell us that the conference was not designed to have howard become the black university invitations to the conference stated precisely what the conference was designed for the concept of a black university is revolutionary it emerges out of the frustrations of black students educators activist and community leaders who recognize that the present institutions of higher learning have no relevance to the total black community and who realize the contradictions of allowing themselves to be accultured into a society which debili tates black people    our responsibility as conference participants is to define the structure and mechanics of that university on wednesday in a twohour keynote speech stokely carmichael told the delegates they were going to have to quit talking and start acting but the conferees had come from as far away as califor nia to talk so they broke into small workshops and met in classrooms and houses in the community and read poetry and prose and listened to jazz and talked the range of subjects was too wide to summarize well in short every aspect imaginable was dealt withfinancial international political curricular artistic athletic technological environmental structural agricultural musical clerical there were  workshops digging out the answers to some of the thousands of questions that had to be answered a howard coed tall thin very attractive recalled that some of the most beautiful people in the world were in town for that weekend lynch complained however that only about five percent of the howard student body participated this figure seemed surprisingly low to some of the outsiders who were there that weekend but it was hard to tell the participants from the students who were simply making their regular rounds to classes in the same buildings lynch said he took it upon himself to close the workshop sessions to representatives of the white press he said he was trying to avoid the danger of misrepresentation and sensationalism but others say it was more a group decision which was in part motivated by the planners belief that black people at this stage talk more freely when there are no white people present which meant that some conferees attempted to eject white faculty members one observer said the selection of who was black enough got a little ridiculous a black former howard student who came on his own said he was put out because he happened to work for a white newspaper he said there was a dude a holder of a black belt in karate at the door to cramton auditorium threatening to hurt him if he was caught inside the dude had a list of folks he was going to chop up the former student said the local media reacted with anger white americans perhaps more than any other people on earth get really disturbed when they are discriminated against radio station wwdc broadcast an editorial which started off by saying officially approved discrimination is supposed to be a thing of the past and ended up with howard university chartered by congress supported in large by public money has no right to permit discrimination on its campus emphasis added the administration was in a dilemma it was caught between white money and black students a spokesman for the university said the administration did nothing organizers of the conference said the university closed certain facilities to the conference forcing it to hold most of its last workshops in the gym several outsiders said at the end that there were so few people remaining that all the workshops could fit into the gym perhaps all of the reports are partially correct or perhaps none of them are some participants complained that the conference did not get much support from the community this may have been because the conference was not well advertised in washington by barring the washington presswhich thougl overwhelmingly whiteowned i nonetheless the least segregatec and the fairest of any large citj press establishment in the countn the organizers assured that ven little news would come down fron howard hill to the rest of wash ington but the conference survived al this midway through a major re organization was necessary to keef all the participants from attending the workshops conducted by the big names and neglecting the ones where a lot of the bread and butter work was being done a small group of hard working students planned and made the major decisions at the conference all of them i interviewed said there were many things they would do differently if they had it to do over again but all agreed it was a good first step joey mitchell a howard junior who is in charge of reprinting the official results of the conference rated it a success despite the bumpy road it traveled he has in hand  resolutions and about  papers that deal not only with the black universitys role but also with the bordering areas of the black mans role historically presently and the future in white society the papers and resolutions are available through the office of the howard university student association which sponsored and paid for the conference the papers and resolutions summarize what came out of the interaction of students artists muslims professors scientists community leaders clergymen poets musicians and intellectuals mitchell said they are first steps which will have to be joined to the next steps taken in new york or atlanta or los angeles or san francisco or somewhere
the term negritude created by the brilliant west indian poet aime cesaire and nurtured to maturity by leopold sedar senghor the poet politician of senegal can help us understand where the black writer is in this country today negritude in essence as i understand it denotes that particular quality those certain nuances which are universal to the thought action and behavior of black africans the concept of negritude has been and to some extent still is of fundamental importance in the writings literature of black africans trained in the frenchspeaking areas ie by those writers who have willingly or unwillingly whatever the case may be adopted french cultural habits as part of their lifestyle negritude came into existence not purely as the result of french culture but as a needed reaction to french classical education suddenly black africans stranded together in time of crisis the weak and strong seek out their own in some french bar intellectualizing and rationalizing their existence became keenly aware of the fact that they were blackmen but most important they finally realized this in the most profound terms that were nonwhite too negritude in its final analysis can be considered the antithesis of everything french ie everything antiblack everything white the frenchafrican finally realized that he was accepted by the dominant white french society only because he was willing to subordinate his blackness and become as french as possible this meant among other things that the african had to adopt the dress mannerism culture and religion of western civilization thus the policy of assimilation was used to systematically destroy the mind and total identity of black africans stripping him completely of his africanness his blackness leaving him more french than african thats the context in which negritude grew it became that rebellious force used by the frenchafricans to try and recapture their past their culture their religion themselves and most of all their future with negritude the african writer did an aboutface and decided to exalt seek recreate and contain his africanness rather than continuing to run away from it or to cover it with the appropriate french substitutes this new literary movement to which cesaire helped give birth started in  when the parisian review published his cahier dun retour au pays natal journal of a return to my native country which has since been reissued in book form by presence africaine the journal and later poems gave impetus to what is now considered negritude but negritude itself the concept of goes back a little further to about  and was called negrismo negrismo started in cuba and was as was negritude influenced by africa and all things african cubans as well as africans had grown up under the white ruling class which tried to destroy everything antiwhite antiwestern or anything remotely connected with africa negrismo grew rapidly and influenced such writers as the cuban poets ramon guirao and nicolas guillen and the puerto rican poet luis pales matos thus the frame of reference that the african and cuban writers used to work in has been established to bring the concept of negritude a little closer to home i refer you to leopold senghors definition negritude is the sum total of the values of the civilization of the african world it is not racialism it is culture it is the embracing and domination of a situation in order to apprehend the cosmos by process of coming to terms with it    negritude as we had then begun to conceive and define it was a weapon of defense and attack and inspiration    actually negritude is the sum total of black consciousness and when used is not only applicable to literature but to all forms of art eg painting sculpture dance music etc ezekiel mphahlele who most certainly is not a proponent of negritude relates this sumtotal feeling in his the african image it is rather the assimilated african who has absorbed french culture who is now passionately wanting to recapture his past in his poetry he extols his ancestors ancestoral mask african wood carvings and bronze art and tries to recover the moorings of his oral literature he clearly feels he has come to a deadend in european culture and is still not really accepted as an organic part of french society for all the assimilation he has been through as a result frenchspeaking african nationalists have become a personification of this strong revulsion  i think that by lightly reviewing the idea of negritude it will enable us to better understand the thought and meaning of blackwriting how alike blackpeople in this country are to the assimilated frenchafricans however in our case the term assimilated can be substituted with the euphemism integrated blackwriting as we view it today is the result of centuries of slavery and forced alienation from africa and onesself weve been exiles in a strange land where our whole lifestyle repeatedly comes into contradiction after contradiction blackwriting to the afroamerican as is negritude to the frenchafrican is the antithesis to a decadent culture that has systematically over the centuries debased and dehumanized us with the fury and passion of an unfeeling computer literature produced by blackhands is not necessarily blackwriting what has to be embodied in blackwriting first and foremost is that consciousness which reflects the true black experience the true afroamerican experience written and related in a style indicative of that experience which may mean as i believe it does new forms and perhaps adaptiveness of present forms black consciousness in any case can be a conscious or an unconscious effort in blackwriting if one is black its very difficult to write otherwise although we must understand there will be a pervasive presence of every and anything that is indigenous to the afroamerican people blackart is a functional art its what the africans call a collective art our art is committed to humanism it commits the artist they commit him in a future which then becomes present for him an integral part of himself the blackwriterartisan works out a concrete situation which means that he commits not only himself but his race his geography his history as well he uses the materials that are at hand and the everyday things which make up the texture of his life rejecting the anecdotal for this does not commit because it is without significance blackart as is african art is perishable this too is why it is functional like a poem is written not to be read and put aside but to actually become a part of the giver and receiver to perform some function to move the emotions to become a part of the dance or to simply make one act whereas the work itself is perishable the style and spirit of the creation is maintained and is used to produce new works here we can clearly see that art for arts sake is something out of a shakespearian dream it does not exist all blackart is social art for peoples sake an example of good blackwriting now in existence is an anthology called black fire edited by leroi jones ameer baraha and larry neal morrow  pp  black fire includes between its jackets a convincing collection of afroamerican literature its  contributors plus its editors move to define and to present a forceful concentration of blackwriting with essays poems short stories and plays this is not to say that every author represented in black fire has contributed a work of art in accordance with my standards but it is to say that every selection of work in black fire is significant significant in that i feel that the test of a good writerpoet is not necessarily in what he says or how he says it but in what his work does to us i mean does the writer widen us does he clear our vision does he add to a deepening of our knowledge does he amplify our total being the saturday review said of black fire the ambitions of black fire make it newsworthy and instructive but the disparity between its ambitions and its achievement is painful and embarrassing painful and embarrassing to whom certainly not to those who contributed to it certainly not to the blackpeople who read it not many at  certainly not to me but yes painful and embarrassing to some white boy who teaches english at williams college in massachusetts and has in all likelihood only seen six negroes in his lifetime who feels that just because saturday review sends him the books to review its his responsibility to be painful and embarrassed about it quietasitskept it was supposed to be painful for him and vet this painful and embarrassing reviewer from williams college goes on to say that yet an irreverent reviewer could merely repeat larry neals own statement and say the text could be destroyed and no one would be hurt in the least by it he the saturday reviews black literature authority does not remotely understand what larry neal meant by that statement brother neal was working from an ideological concept so foreign so alien to the western mind that one wonders how such people as the reviewer continue to have such control over blackpeople brother neal was quite clearly talking about the perishability of blackart remember art for the peoples sake art being functional and social meaning that the people will help to shape the art not here forever but until its full meaning has been realized what we have to understand is that every piece of writing in black fire is legitimate regardless of excellence because as with the frenchafricans of negritude black writers are in a process of defining and legitimizing their own worthworks and we dont need the great white pens of the saturday review or other liberal white sheets to sanction what they feel is or is not black literature or literature period black fire helped us to move into our own direction james t stewart points out whats necessary the point of the whole thing is that we must emancipate our minds from western values and standards we must rid our minds of these values saying so will not be enough with that we can easily understand what a b spellman was relating when he wrote there is a school of young african painters who have never seen a european painting and who refuse to be shown one david llorens clears the air when in the fellah the chosen ones the guardian he writes perhaps the starting point is to look at ourselves finally to question our existence not only to question it but also to realize our existence but sister lethonia gee is hipped to a beautiful part of her existence as indicated in her poem by glistening dancing seas all art is the reflection of its creator look at new york city chicago washington d c need i say more where and what you live in reflects you if you created it art is totalbeing it cannot be separated from life thats why we say that blackart is not only social but political which leads larry neal to say the artist and the political activist are one they are both shapers of the future reality both understand and manipulate the collective myths of the race how else could a b spellman write lines like thisc run on home blackpeople the only way to be is to be and unlike the frenchafricans black writers are not trying to address themselves to white people senghor and others wrote firstly for the frenchman not for the african people black poetrywriting is written for toabout and around the livesspiritactionshumanism and total existence of blackpeople black writing in formsoundwordusageintonationrhythmrepetitiondirectiondefinition and beauty is opposed to that which is now and yesterday considered writing ie white literature black fire may not be read by many blackpeople in its present form hard cover edition because of the price anytime a book is more than thirtyfive cents to one dollar you are in trouble to buy a book that costs more would do harm to most black families daily budgets but if possible i suggest that you acquire a copy of black ire steal it borrow it or wait for it to appear in paperback hopefully we can as a people move toward a black printing company so that we will not have to continuously run to the establishment presses to be published finally this is u yrmomma yrhistory yrliterature them is u actually a beautiful reflection understood by u alone others will not our creations are ours no one can really take away yrinnerself if u have one people can napalm other people because they never felt the pain of flesh falling off ones body george washington is their hero because there is nothing better the mod squad and julia are forced upon u in prime tv time because that is their reality not ours the great white hope is just that the great white hope our heroes will be named willie bigger thomas blood pee wee and maniac and will come out of the projects and be hip to richard nixon and lyndon johnson because their fathers were hip to them and their fathers fathers fathers and on and on leroi jones said it
anyone who wears  shoes would do well to purchase a  pair ride them to your nearest bookstore and invest the difference wisely dark symphony free press  an anthology edited by james a emanuel and theodore l gross is a must for anyone who happens not to be an authority on black literature and no doubt the authorities few that they are have already added it to their libraries a total of  black authors  of whom are deceased are represented in the page book of short stories essays poetry and criticism the book is divided into four sections early literature the negro awakening major authors and contemporary literature not the least of its merits are the lucid informative introductions to three sections there is no introduction to major authors essaylike biographical sketches on the four selectees as major authors langston hughes richard wright ralph ellison and james baldwin provide perceptive commentary on their many works shorter biographical sketches are included in the case of each of the other contributors clearly the editors did not in this case request of the authors a contribution of their own choosing the editors did the selecting and they were selective and even though the reader might on occasion wish they had selected a different work by a particular writer he must appreciate their having for the most part provided insights into the reasoning that led to their choices included in early literature are works by charles w chesnutt whose first story was published in  and whose racial identity was for some years not made public paul laurence dunbar the master of dialect who died in  at the tender age of  frederick douglass and w e b dubois one might in reading douglass letter to his master or rereading it as the case might be make certain connections between then and now nuances in his fierce pride remind this reader of current literary celebrant eldridge cleaver and more in this work by douglass there is unmistakably the sense that man achieves goodness by wanting the freedom of others a quality critics have cited in praising the existentialist novels of one john uodike the section is concluded » ith a poem and a chapter from the souls of black folk by w e b dubois whose awakening was indeed early one agrees with the editors that no brief selection from his voluminous work could do justice to this man of the world but how schizoid the mind that would make such a recognition and yet omit him from inclusion in major authors or was that politicalas surely must have been the case as regards leroi jones who is represented in the section on contemporary literature by three poems the negro awakening includes the works of james weldon johnson alain locke claude mckav jean toomer rudolph fisher eric walrond sterling a brown and countee cullen it marks the period better known as the negro renaissance the s that era in which black writers came together in their separateness and dived into the literary seas only to come out to borrow a line from claude mckays baptism a stronger soul within a finer frame the scholarship of alain lockes the new negro and the singularly classic work of criticism by sterling  a brown negro character as seen by white authors are outstanding in this section the excerpts from cane recently reissued by harper and row as a perennial classic reveal the extraordinary gift of jean toomer the man who so early deserted the naturalistic fiction and who had he not ceased writing most certainly would have contributed much to that deeper exploration of the consciousness psychic and cosmic ongoing in the literature of the past  odd years flying home and king of the bingo game by ellison the man who killed a shadow by wright and baldwins sonnys blues are stories that speak for themselves the excellence of the late langston hughes is present in the form of five poems and two hilarious jesse b semple tales and for those who have stubbornly insisted that the literature of social protest was unconcerned with exploration of the ultimate questions hughes story on the road is a brilliant example of their folly in the middle of the depression which marks as well the time of the writing a black man in search of shelter from the cold and snow is felled by the cops the moment he succeeds in breaking down the door of a white church in his unconscious state he dreams dreams that the church comes falling down that christ comes off the cross  well ill be dogged said sargent this heres the first time i ever seed you off the cross yes said christ crunching his feet in the snow you had to pull the church down to get me off the cross  it is vintage hughes the ethics of living jim crow hidden name and complex fate and notes of a native son nonfictional works by wright ellison and baldwin respectively have in common their autobiographical natures and yet in a most interesting way serve as a reflection of just how diverse were the backgrounds that shaped the sensibilities of the three extraordinary artists contemporary literature features the works of albert murray john a williams paule marshall ernest j gaines william melvin kelley melvin b tolson arna bontemps robert e hayden dudley randall margaret a walker gwendolyn brooks james a emanuel mari evans leroi jones arthur p davis philip butcher nathan a scott jr and julian mayfield it is worth noting i think that the italicized authors contributions to black literature would include their having along with the writers of the early literature and the negro awakening profoundly influenced the others appearing in this final section space will not permit much comment on the works of the above but the short stories of gains and kelley are witness to exceptional talents julian mayfields essay into the mainstream and oblivion brings us into the day that is upon us a day one can hardly hope to comprehend while ignoring ones own writers and persisting in the belief that the prophets were

it was fisk universitys fit acting president i £ james lawson   v whose voice at the other end of the line asked how soon can you be here for a personal interview i fumbled the key to my office at oaklands merritt junior college between my anxious fingers realizing that relinquishing them would mark the end of my contracted services for the year  straining my ear against the friday afternoon summer noises which seeped into the public telephone booth forming static and following the demands of long distance communication in terms of abrupt decision making i startled even myself by answering monday that is if thats agreeable it was with him going home and in a matter of a few days two decades stood between my alma mater and hometown and me for me it was a period of growth mobility turbulence and commitment and i presumed it to be not too different back home i now lived in the suburbs of san francisco bay area in an integrated neighborhood with my dentist husband and five children we wore the badge of acceptance for having made it in the good old american freeenterprising mainstream tradition but already my third teenager to graduate from the local high school in as many years was saying forget it im tired of being exotic a museum piece the social integrator i choose a negro collegeone of those in nashville i pointed out to the young ones the fact that they could very well be sentimentalizing the southern situation since unlike me they had not grown uo in a segregated environment still failing to dampen their enthusiasm i reminded them that nashville was the home that i had been orphaned from and not them they checked me with you better know it for two years i had worked as a parttime instructor in two junior colleges one of these was a nearly allwhite suburban tomorrowlandtype institution the other a ghettofringed urban yesteryear model with over  black students having asked myself a few questions such as to whom did i owe my allegiance where were my teaching skills most needed which situation offered the greater reward in humanistic rather than materialistic terms even as i noted the leaded nature of them i knew the proper answer perhaps i always knew it just as most black intellectuals have known it factors such as the vast difference between the two plantsboth of whom i supported through taxesthe aura of academic freedom and exploration which seemed far more prevalent in one the huge investment in terms of personal involvement and extra curricular time which one demanded in order to meet the communitys needs succeeded in clouding the real issue but i had already returned the shiny new key to my office in the suburban school and was ghettobound when i heard that fisk was in need of english teachers black ones and then there was stanford camerons exhortation in the may  negro digest come home black intellectuals  before its too late you cant go home again seems closer to the truth according to my own personal experience john o killens writerinresidence at fisk has identified the problem of the century and the main job of the black revolution as that of the deniggerization of the world and when he points out that minds enslaved with words must be freed with words it seems he offers a direct challenge to black language arts experts who should play key roles in liberating black consciousness if indeed the midtwentieth century is a world given over to racism the negro college campus is apt to be strategically the seat of neocolonial rule the english department which requires that every student come through its portals for a stamp of approval and a ticket of eligibility in pursuit of academic degrees must be the focal point of conditioning the mind of the negro to accept his role in a racist world if this is true a university such as fiskwith nine of the  teachers in the english department white including the past chairman and interim chairmandoes not give any indication of the white mans conditioning of black minds cracking at the seams in fact the disproportion of white to negro teachers would suggest reinforcement of the traditional pattern and should assure the power structure that the seams are uptight 
going home then is a twoway road and must be paved with good intentions by all parties concerned the total black community of the usa has been duped by institutionalized brainwashing in the schools churches yes even the homes and historical conditioning toward an acceptance of a status of dehumanization and deprivation spiritual social if not actually physical the total white community is diseased with racial delusionsinstitutionalized in the same ways through myth and deed sanctioned by religious creed and lawthereby rendering it incompetent to deal with a democratic nonracist world body in a healthy way our educational institutions reflect the american dilemma in a stark mirror image there are many black intellectuals such as j herman blake negro digest march  from the university of california berkeley who see rampant racism at one of americas great universities who sees the institution as an intellectual microcosm of america who sees these campuses for what they arehideous for white draft dodgers exploiters of the scholarship racket racist snobs who use the campuses as country clubs and sports arenas there are many black intellectuals who are disenchanted with the great northern and western colleges and universities where in the spirit of the democratic tradition they have been hired out by the rent a negro agency for the instant integrated look what are his alternatives are the negro colleges and universities ready for him or are they engaged in a historical sweep marked by a headlong rush down the sellout road to integration or intellectual and scholastic extermination of the black man an example which might point out the fallacy of this thinking is that at a time when the ratio of negro dentists to the negro population is at a crisis low level around  percent of the entering freshmen  at the dental college of meharry medical college one of the twc negro medical colleges were white students are educational institutions faced with the task of educating black people committed to the task which should be within their special province while northern schools are crying out for teachers with a specialty in motivating and educating the culturally divergent child is the negro university training its student teachers to meet this demand the northern and western college having admitted to the historical distortions which have created the american image in all its unreality is now seeking teachers who are aware of the inclusivity of americas heritage are the negro universities teaching contemporary american literature which includes the contributions which have been categorically excluded from mainstream anthologies because it represented black art do they offer courses in revisionist history revolutionary black sociology afroamerican culture anc humanities black art and life political science in the black community black students at many of the california colleges and universities are demanding a black curriculum as a specialty in the black studies department which will ultimately offer a degree and a new career field this of course enables the student so trained to be a more effective worker in community action programs involving minorities does the negro campus provide an atmosphere for innovative programs and a laboratory for testing new methodology the black intellectual must be willing to choose a position which offers more in humanistic rewards than materialistic gains his role as a missionary if he must assume that role at this time must be played out with black principals as supporting members of his cast and on location in the black ghettoes across the land being whiteworld missionaries spreads us too thin and dissipates our energies without the benefits of making racial gains ambition must be tempered with compassion and concern for the black brother on the other hand the black communities wherever they exist must prepare for this second coming they must prepare the way for him this time around he should be the welcomed guest and not the intruder they must lay the groundwork which will result in an acceptance of him in the same good faith as he accepts the challenge the educational institutions must have no doubts about his belonging about the role he is destined to play in reconstructing a healthy american society above all it must be made clear that the black intellectual is not suspect rather the total society is suspect the total academic environment is suspect he has learned his lesson once he has achieved at great odds he has proven it can be done and that he can do it and having accepted the challenge he indicates a willingness to do it again success breeds success he becomes by example hope for the black student he must be kept comfortable in his blackness in order to impart selfassuredness to his students and most important the black student must want the black intellectual back home he must make him feel at ease must make him believe in himself and in his decision to come back where its at the student must enter a partnership with the intellectual to start the wheels of meaningful education grinding at a new alltime high a recordbreaking pace black students must understand that when adam clayton powell admonished the  graduating class at howard university to seek audacious power and thereby ushered in the age of black_power he called for a black renaissance resurrected black creativity in all disciplines a rededication toward building black institutions of splendid achievement with intellectual excitement dynamic creativity humanistic idealism none of these can be achieved without black scholars who have key roles in developing this idea from dream to reality this is a reality with a future it is one which can act as a serum to cure the diseases which wittingly or not halfhearted integration attempts have brought to the black communityintellectual mediocrity economic inferiority political subservience going home can and should be a beautiful thing for as adam clayton powell points out we are the last revolutionaries in americathe last transfusion of freedom into the bloodstream of democracy because we are we must mobilize our wintry discontent to transform the cold heart and white face of this nation 
this is going to be a jjf r  £ somewhat personal ac i £ count of my experiences baching in a rural black college in the south it is not written in bitterness i liked the school especially the students i enjoyed teaching them i liked my fellow teachers i even liked the administrators and it was great living in the country after escaping from the din and clatter of clashing delusions of grandeur in new york city my connection with the college was an act of desperation on both sides they were desperate because their history teacher suddenly resigned at midsemester and they couldnt find anyone else i was desperate for more complicated reasons ever since i was  years old i had belonged to the selfrighteous left to those who felt that because they subscribed to certain beliefs they were automatically wise virtuous and destined to play an earthshaking role in the world i had married into the faith and all my social ties were with fellow believers naturally we talked to ourselves and each other reinforcing our mutual delusions now the only world i knew or could easily function in as the white mother of black kids was shattered i had gone through a sudden perception change it is not easy to describe i suddenly saw people and their interactions in a new way everyone seemed to be wearing a mask and these masks were telling themselves and each other lies the masks were cold and unemotional there was at the same time intense emotional nonverbal communication going on which i was directly perceiving but the nonverbal communication between myself and others was different there was something which i can only describe as spirit which shook them leapt into their eyes flashed there for a moment like a desperate prisoner begging to be freed and then disappeared no one had slipped me any acid i knew nothing about mysticism id been an atheist since i was  so there were limited ways for me to interpret all this first i asked myself do other people perceive the way i perceive now or do they perceive the way i used to perceive i watched them for a while and concluded that they only perceive the lying masks but they do not know that they are lying the masks were the limits of their consciousness and their only way of knowing what goes on in the world is what the masks tell each other no one else whom i could observe was perceiving like me the lying masks were interacting with each other and arriving at a concensus which they accepted as reality and people were acting on the basis of this consensus my impression was that very little of what existed in the real world got past the masks i concluded that either i was crazy and they were all sane or i was sane and they were all crazy i had no wav of knowing for sure so i decided to test it out while being very careful not to say or do anything that would get me locked up i would operate on the basis of the reality which i perceived and observe others operating upon the basis of the reality which they perceived and see whose reality was more reliable i found myself back in new york in  among familiar  places and people really perceiving them all for the first time i couldnt play their games anymore i longed desperately to escape from the circles i had always moved in and to try out my new perceptions on the world out there i went to the college for the interview the president explained to me that they had only been hiring white teachers for a year the board was afraid that any white teacher who would come there would be a communist they hired chinese and east indians but alas they couldnt get enough teachers of any race and finally the board permitted him to hire a few whites he asked me is there anything you have to tell me i might as well know it now yes there is my kids are black are they adopted no theyre my natural children i have some relatives who look as white as you do i have often been taken for a creole im from new orleans i speak french whatever i say around here reaches all ears i could say have you met our new creole history teacher from new orleans  thats fine with me when you get your drivers license be sure they get the race right all the teachers except one believed it some of them even began to comment that i was a typical creole type one of the teachers from new orleans asked me where i had lived and i told him the seventh ward which is a very mixedup place i invited a creole friend to visit me and introduced her as my cousin the teachers were convinced but not the students they werent fooled they knew i was a foreigner a gi bride there were debates about me in the dormitories shes irishno shes german no shes italian i showed them my passport to prove that i was born in new orleans they still didnt believe me why do you think im a foreigner i dont have an accent no but you dont act like an american teaching was hard work i had a heavy load i had never taught before and was teaching subjects i hadnt studied in years on one days notice my first  minutes in a classroom were memorable i looked down at the faces puzzled to the point of panic their pencils poised above their notebooks not knowing what to write finally i read the same expression on every face what in the hell is this woman talking about i stopped you dont understand what im saying do you they all shook their heads no ok lets start over we spent a lot of time on words words were concepts and once they had a word they understood a lot of things once i used the word paternalism and no one knew what that meant i explained paternalism is when somebody makes you do what they want you to do by acting niceand you better do it or else the students had been taught to obey to learn by rote they couldnt understand why i objected to their quoting the textbook word for word on their exams i didnt copy it i memorized it they were used to the teacher giving them all the questions and all the pat answers to the questions once we discussed a question in class and i closed the discussion without giving them an answer they were disturbed but whats the answer whats the answer there isnt any answer i replied they laughed they had never heard of such a thing most of the students were from the immediate area they were from very poor families with lots of kids they were patient and longsuffering the campus was like a prison it was several miles out of town and there was no public transportation girls were expelled for riding in boys cars the girls had to be in their rooms by  pm they couldnt even sit on the porch even in the summer the girls dorm had iron bars on the windows the presidents dogs were released from their kennel to roam the campus at night the teachers favorite topic of conversation was the students how stupid and ignorant they were the students dont count at all said a not very scholarly teacher a university is a community of scholars it exists for the sake of the teachers the school was desperate for phds and the degree seemed to be all important the chairman of my department was an east indian who had just gotten his doctorate from nyu he had never taught knew nothing about this country planned to return to india and enter politics shortly and was very status conscious he pretended not to know his black colleagues when they met off campus then there were several elderly chinese refugees the students couldnt understand their english they cared nothing about the students they let them cheat openly on exams because they didnt want to bother stopping them students were eager to get into their classes because they gave good grades and expected nothing from the students although it was a state college they had something called religious emphasis week this consisted of sermons in which the social order was thoroughly identified with god the students were exhorted to feel eternally grateful for the opportunity to get a college education although i dont think that is a good description of what they were getting right after religious emphasis week we had a class discussion on a statement by napoleon to the effect that the only way to make the poor and downtrodden submit to their lot here on earth is to promise them rewards in the hereafter one of the students thought napoleon had something there the other students indignantly stared her down many of the teachers complained about the students lack of spontaneity they never smile they never show a spark of life after a while we had to close the windows and doors in my class because the discussions were getting so animated when one of my students said i dont know why we should be grateful to lincoln for freeing us he only did it because he had to i thought i had it made there were a handful of students from the outside world most of them on athletic scholarships one student a basketball player from indiana was determinedly hostile to me and influenced the class the day malcolm was killed we both found ourselves explaining to the class who malcolm was one of the  students said didnt malcolm preach hate we both answered together malcolm didnt preach hate before the term was over the basketball player was carrying my books to class arent you afraid the students will make fun of you i dont care anything about that he said most of the students were from tobacco farms but the college was in a lumbering area the family that owned the lumber mill owned the town and everyone in it they wouldnt allow an antipoverty program in the area because they didnt want any interference with their cheap help but the college did have funds for student jobs which teachers were given the right to distribute among their favorites the college community was a weird world of makebelieve there were teachers at that school who had worked there for  years and had never been to town they didnt even know where main street was these were the teachers most likely to talk about what a lovely advanced progressive town it was how important the college was to the town and how much the black teachers were esteemed by the community i soon discovered that the only way to maintain these fantasies of prestige power and status in relation to the town was indeed not to go there black phds would find themselves addressed by their first names by white store clerks my kids and i were nearly assaulted for trying to buy a takeout pizza from a white restaurant when i told my fellow teachers about it i was advised not to file a complaint if i wanted to keep my job late spring and early summer was harvest time on the nearby truck farms migrant workers arrived from florida on open trucks some of my students told me they had hidden migrant workers who were trying to escape from the camps as time passed recruiting of workers to get in the crops became aggressive students were stopped on the streets recruiters approached small children one morning at  oclock i found my nineyearold son dressed and ready to pick corn for  a day i had a hard time stopping him the children told me about conditions in the fields they had to look out for the tractors the tractors didnt look out for them it was swampy country and there were poisonous snakes the children were transported on the backs of open trucks three small boys had been killed on the highway the year before the children seemed to be frightened they would come and tell me when they were beaten up i would ask if they told their parents they always said they wont do anything about it i didnt know what to tell them i couldnt do anything about it either one little boy with terror in his eyes was mute my son tried to teach him to speak the ku klux klan was very active in the area and they would hold silent demonstrations lines of cars with confederate plates would parade slowly down main street blowing their horns i got worried about my kids we lived on the campus my son went to school right across the street i told him to keep away from white people especially people with confederate plates on their car he paid me no mind hed bring white boys on the campus to play with him once he told me mom you were wrong about those people with confederate plates on their car i made friends with some of them i went to their house they were very nice kids can make you feel humble sometimes the campus was like an island after i had been there for a week it was hard to remember any other world everything was provided by the school credit was opened up for me in town i rented my house from the school i got my meals from the school but there was no paycheck the first two months i worked there if i needed a few bucks i had to go ask the president to please give me an advance on my salary i was afraid i would be like the sharecropper with his bales of cotton when payday came i thought they would say you owe us  i finally worked up to getting paid every month its an isolated ingrown community the teachers each live in their own little world and are afraid to talk to each other they treat each other with the greatest formal respect perhaps to compensate for the lack of respect they receive outside no one is on a firstname basis with his colleagues it is always mr mrs or best of all dr the teachers have absolute power over the students the administration has absolute power over the teachers the local policeman has absolute power over the administration and as the true cliche goes power corrupts some of the students were conditioned to corruption around final exam time some of the girls offered to clean my house and couldnt understand why i refused students complained to me about teachers flunking students who rejected their advancesas if i could do anything about it at the end of the semester i heard that a teacher with tenure was fired for no apparent reason before the summer was over i was fired although i had a contract to teach the next year because a young man who was my friend had registered for summer school no one at the college objected but the local policeman told the president to fire me which he did with much guilty selfrighteous indignation i knew it hurt to be reminded that when it comes down to it the local policeman runs the school i had no hard feelings about being fired what i did object to was the effort to stop me from securing employment elsewhere stating that i was fired for violation of ethical codes and customs which are expected for membership in the college community here which really sounds awful and concluding by i hope for you and yours the best of everything that reminds me of bob dylan theyll stone you then theyll wish you good luck the american association of university professors asked for four months salary for me for breach of contract i never got it i suppose the local policeman would not allow it i was blacklisted all the way to detroit i was hired as a substitute teacher in the detroit public schools and then told that some of the committee members on further discussion had changed their vote a secret memorandum a copy of which some kind anonymous soul at the school board mailed to me stated it would be our strong recommendation that mrs hall not be hired in any capacity by the detroit board of education this opinion is based on her lack of judgment and general background for working in our schools memorandum from gladys v hamilton to miss malorney dated dec   file no  approved by julie strwn adm asst robt le anderson this officiallyapproved blacklist did not stop albert schiff from writing me on jan   suggesting that i complete more courses and reapply for employment with the detroit public schools i was informed by the american association of university professors that there were other complaints about blacklisting emanating from the same school their approach is resign thereby voluntarily renouncing your contract rights or they will do their best to see that you never get a job again i was fortunate because i am also a legal secretary and we got by on that for a while and since i couldnt get a job i went back to school and learned fellowships ill have my doctorate in history from the university of michigan in a few months most teachers in black colleges arent so lucky they cant type i am making this modest contribution to the discussion of the black university in the hope that some effort will be made to raise the degraded position of teachers in rural black colleges to something approaching national standards they are treated like serfs they feel like they are serfs and in fact they are serfs still they are in a better position to change the situation than are the students if the teachers were well organized and got support from professional organizations from the outside i dont know yet whose reality works but it sure is interesting finding out
in special issue of the negro digest devoted to a considerauon of the black uni versity concept you editorialized that something is gravely wrong with the conventional approach to the education of black children no longer is arguable much of the problem of course is general there is something gravely wrong with american education period however as always in a society whichbeing racist by nature assigns opportunities and rewards according to race and color those people suffer most who are regarded least and those people in the american society are black people the general validity of this observation should not be a bar to repetitive assertions until all those who are responsible for and involved in education at whatever level in our country not only recognize the deficiencies in our total educational system but are engaged upon meaningful programs to correct what needs to be corrected the important question is how can the system best be changed for black children and young adults in the united states this question takes on some particular connotations since  the traditionally or predominantly black colleges and universities have borne the brunt of the responsibility for educating the black leadership of this country many of these schools have compared favorably and still do with other schools of similar size with more resources and stronger faculties in many instances these largely segregated schools did superior jobs with their studentproducts despite the problems inherent in black higher education not the least of these problems being the necessity for combatting and remedying the deficiencies of our general educational system so far as black students were concerned the increasingly complex nature of our society and government beginning with the great depression of the s the technological advances which began with the necessity for a more efficient war machine during the s the acceleration of these developments following the launching of sputnik i in  and the ensuing age of cybernation have effected basic changes in our society these changesinvolving environmental conditions manpower requirements and individual and societal attitudeshave created new challenges and opportunities for all segments of our society these challenges and opportunities demand a fundamental and continuing reappraisal of courses of study in institutions of higher education it occurs to me that the necessity for a changed role for the predominantly or traditionally black colleges and universities must be viewed at least partially within this context this suggests an awesomely dual responsibility for the predominantly or traditionally black schools of higher educationie  a relevance and validity with regard to black students and black communities and  a relevance and validity with regard to the society in which black students and black communities will exist inherent in both responsibilities is the necessity for preparing students to meet the challenges of change in todays and tomorrows world and with respect to both responsibilities the overriding consideration should and must be to give these students that education and training sought after in todays and tomorrows labor market essentially then the education of black americans must encompass at least three objectivesie  an increased awareness and knowledge of their heritage and of the contributions they have made throughout history  a motivation and ability to render muchneeded assistance and services of various kinds to the total black community and  the development of knowledge and skills necessary for gainful employment and satisfactory living in the larger everchanging society in terms of what is necessary for sustained upward economic and social mobility of black americans i think it meaningless if not dangerous to attempt to assign priorities as between these three objectives they are all necessary moreover they constitute the basis for the continuing validity and relevance of predominantly or traditionally black institutions of higher learning these considerations dictate some rather basic modifications in the curricula of our colleges and universities modifications which involve new directions new and different courses and innovatively different techniques and methodologies of instruction moreover  there is the necessity for relating our curricula and campus activities more definitively and directly to the needs of the communities of which we are a part none of this will be easy but all is possible with varying degrees of ease or difficulty dependent upon conditions pertaining to particular colleges or universities at fisk we are attempting to meet the challenges represented by the need and desire for black identity dignity and status on the one hand and by the new career opportunities for black college graduates on the other regarding the former we have instituted courses in africancaribbean studies the fine arts literature history race relations sociology and anthropology which focus on contributions problems and developments of black people regarding the latter for example we are in the process of establishing an ambitious program in business administration which will prepare students who choose this area of study for promising employment immediately upon graduation as well as for graduate study in the field we are cognizant of the need to do even more to meet the twin challenges above and are continually alert to the opportunities for doing more we are convinced however that meeting the first challenge should represent a supplement to and enrichment of our basic program and our efforts to meet the second challenge
the idea of a black university is not clear to me i hear some advocates say that they want a black university large enough to enroll ten thousand students they mean a new creation this would be a very expensive enterprise if half of the students lived in dormitories cost for the construction of dormitories alone could be easily  or  million dollars the academic plant to accommodate ten thousand students would cost another  or  million dollars and this is a conservative estimate such a plant could cost between  and  million dollars if money of this magnitude is to be gotten from the negro community we can forget it the negroes record of supporting higher education leads me to predict that black people would never give that amount of money if the negroes educational efforts were all centered in this one university and they might be able to get the money from black people who could get them united to give it do the advocates of a single black university expect to get the money from white people white support of negro educational institutions over the past hundred years has been niggardly what would lead one to believe that white philanthropy would be more generous in its giving to a black university than it has been in giving to predominantly negro colleges it should be made crystal clear what is meant by a black university how much of the curriculum would be devoted to afroamerican people how much of the curriculum would be devoted to disciplines other than afroamerican studies would the faculty be all black would the student body be all black if white faculty and white students are excluded do we expect socalled white colleges and universities to exclude all black scholars and black students would the supreme court permit this kind of segregation do we mean by black universities regional centers of institutions that are already in existence as one writer in the march  negro digest advocates if we mean regional black colleges and universities the question of the complexion of the faculty and student body must still be asked and answered frankly i do not believe we need to build a new black university in order to get what i think we need nor do i believe we need to concentrate on a few colleges and universities in certain centers of the united states in order to get what we need and must have i believe that there could and should be established in every negro or black college in the united states a division of afroamerican studies which would concentrate on the black mans history and all that he has contributed to the arts and sciences literature and art sports and drama politics and business i believe existing institutions can do  this including the institutions that call themselves white this is not enough i have always believed that negro or black colleges should be deeply concerned with and deeply involved in the life of the black community instead of training negroes to get away from the poor and the ghettos they should be trained to help improve the conditions of black people so that the gap between all ciasses of negroes will be narrowed or eliminated there are six million college and university students enrolled in institutions of higher education of which  or not more than four percent are black certainly not more than  or five percent are black a single black university of  would be a mere drop in the bucket but if all institutions of higher learning tackled the problem of black identity through the teaching of afroamerican history and through training to help improve the conditions of less privileged black people we could do now what has been neglected for a hundred years negro students are ready for it now years ago when dr carter g woodson the eminent negro historian was trying to get black students to appreciate themselves and africa he didnt have much success and let me say with emphasis that to get this done we do not have to become racists and drive out all white teachers and all white students with government industry and white institutions pulling black scholars apart to get them there just arent enough black scholars to go around although i can appreciate the current emphasis on blackness and the much discussed black university i am mighty glad that i didnt have to wait  years for someone in the late s to teach me to appreciate being what i am black my mother unlettered and untutored did say many times to her children you are as good as anybody this was helpful to me although the white world did not accept my mothers philosophy my heroes were black in my native south carolina fairly often some negro would come along selling pictures or pamphlets of a few negro leaders and pictures of fred douglass booker t washington and paul laurence dunbar hung on our walls in my high school days booker t washington meant more to me than george washington frederick douglass the unyielding negro abolitionist was more of a hero to me than william lloyd garrison the fanatic white abolitionist dunbar as a poet inspired me more than longfellow i heard about crispus attucks and was thrilled the negroes in the south carolina legislature during reconstruction and in the postreconstruction years were men who were held up to us in high school history classes as being great men and not the negrohating ben r tillman and his kind i had identity the thrust now is toward black identity and i have no quarrel with those who advocate it fortunately i have always had black identity 
the emphasis that the  f i £ young blacks have j ii £ placed upon the discovery and promulgation of the truth about the afroamerican community is refreshing for so many years the vast majority of us have been in such hot pursuit of the norms of the majority culture that we haveperhaps unwittinglyforsaken our own identity and assumed a false superego that leaves us fragmented persons i say the vast majority this is by no means true of all blacks in  i had to take negro history as a requirement for the a b at virginia union university in   i had to take negro literature to graduate all the way from phyllis wheatley to margaret walker moreover when in college we wired fred waring and asked him to include our alma mater on his saturday medley of college songs he did judge earl dearing of louisville and i signed the telegram in the fall of  indeed some of us have been proud aware conscious and black for a long long time we find it appalling that black students lump all middle class blacks negroes in one ball and condemn them all as spineless accommodationists this is false and arrogant notwithstanding the charge applies to enough to make it valid and because there is a sufficient void in the knowledge and appreciation of the history of american blacks it is understandable that there is a call for a black university since there have been white universities for so long and all other kinds of de facto separate universities serving ethnic and demographic units it is time for blacks to cry out rather recently the jews established brandeis  and expanded yeshiva by adding a coed undergraduate program catholics never entrusted higher or lower education to the majority if jews and catholics regard their traditions as sufficiently precious to preserve them in their own schools a black university makes sense the lutherans too what is st olafs moreover public colleges located in pockets of cultural homogeneity have in fact been conduits of a continuity of mores and attitudeseg ole miss lsu georgia tech vmi and the citadel blacks still feel like aliens on these campuses yet a black university faces some very practical problems that may indicate another answer who would finance such an enterprise the idea of racial separation has already fallen on evil days because it has been associated with violence somehow it has not enjoyed a positive affirmative connotation it has been associated with the riots and four letter words this is an awful casualty it is an idea that should be debated on its own merits i cannot see the sponsorship for such an idea forthcoming but the idea need not die aborning a black university is more imminent than many imagine if the concepts of violence and negative chauvinism can be strained out only nine months of planning could accomplish what most have in mind for a black universitv at atlanta fisk or howard since there is no black math chemistry biology or physics what we are talking about is an orientation in history literature social science psychology fine arts and education that is black it means viewing these disciplines from the perspective of a black student standing body deep soul deep in his own culture this implies no hostility no separatism no alienation it could imply a disciplined scholarship that will unearth truths long hidden a bona fide experience of the thought and feelings of black writers painters and musicians a construction of social theories that will have an authenticity for black people the most dramatic results could be seen in teacher education hardly any school does justice to the challenge of the black pupil in its teacher education program    but even that would not be enough every university every college should recognize the neglect of black facts and begin to institute programs in black studies interdisciplinary and scholarly there are asian studies indian studies urban studies mexican studies and space studies all sorts of studies black studies can be added with no vast shift in administrative machinery and indeed many are doing just that a third alternative is perhaps more useful the location of city county and state community colleges should take into account the concentration of blacks in the cities centers the appointment of imaginative presidents hustling deans and teachers with common sense to head and run community colleges in the cities centers could turn these opportunities to great benefit for black people an honest relevant curriculum would accomplish again what most of us sense as the mission of a black university the sanguine expectation that a wellfinanced completely autonomous black university can be founded and supported is a forlorn one i fear fine if it can be really good and not makeshift this is too late for another crude botchy handtomouth college to be started otherwise let substantial ongoing private black schools those who have the vision and the freedom convert their present pursuit of western civ to an understanding of man through the eyes of black people let the major public and private institutions embrace the cause of black discovery and let public community colleges in the urban core look around them and act accordingly with integrity and enthusiasm 
the march  edition nr  of negro digest on the black university  celebrates a significant turning point in the history of american race relations taken together the articles in that edition constitute the most compact statement extant of the quest on the part of young black intellectuals for selfdefinition in the realm of educational theory and technique confronted with the intractable facts of history and culture an apparently growing number of black thinkers reopened with fresh intensity the old debate regarding the purpose and strategy of education for black americans disillusioned with both the conceptual depth of integration as an intellectual construct and with its slow growth as a social reality increasing attention is now being given to the internal dynamics of the black community itself whether this refocusing of vision will aid the struggle for black freedom will depend very heavily on just how faithful it is to the regimen of fact and logic in the black community for this community is not the simple phenomenon that many white and some black writers have taken it to be carter g woodson very aptly asserted in his book the miseducation of the negro that the negro community suffers for lack of delimitation because of the various ramifications of life in the united states    the negro community in a sense is composed of those around you but it functions in a different way you cannot see it by merely looking out of the window of the school room this community requires scientific investigation similarly the black college is a complex datum requiring the disciplined approaches of sound theory technique and insight if the realities of its past the dynamics of its present and the promise of its future are to be accurately gauged whether we like it or not what has always beenand what will likely continue to beof critical importance are the interconnections of the black college with the world around it the white world as well as the black world a fundamental assumption of this article is that no important institution within any communitywhite or blackcan be adequately understood through a process of violent abstraction from the setting in which it moves and lives and has its being the article by j herman blake on the black university and its community gives us valuable information about some of the socioeconomic changes now occurring within the black community particularly in terms of the northward and cityward movement of black people and in terms of changes in occupational roles and income levels of black males and females some of these are rather wellknown facts that the majority of black americans now live in the central cities of metropolitan areas that despite higher levels of education the employment situation of black people has changed little from the last hired first fired status that the black female has a better chance of obtaining a job consistent with her education and training than the black male in the professional technical and managerial categories while the black males are more likely than females to be adequately represented in clerical positions that the relative situation for the black man improved between  and  while the absolute situation declined that the absolute and relative situation of middleincome blacks is getting better and that of lowincome blacks is getting worse these are all important and interesting data but what is their significance for educational mission and strategy the question is not answered directly but answers are sometimes implied and sometimes inherent in the conceptual description of the black university provided by the other contributors to the edition all of the writers assume the absolutely critical importance of transforming the predominantly negro college into a meaningful and relevant instrument of social change the article by darwin turner is by far the wisest and most reasoned description of the total scope of problems and possibilities to be considered whether because of distinct definitions of tasks or for some other reason his is the only article which treats the black university contextually in terms of the hard facts of financing policymaking faculty recruitment and administration as well as in terms of the currently more popular dimensions of curriculum development and public service it is interesting to note that in view of the fact that so many black students today get much of their emotional and intellectual fuel from black and third world oriented thinkers not a single word of the entire edition is addressed to the issue of roles for student involvement in the black university one of the major constituencies of any college and one of the most important bearers of an ethical vocation in history today are students precisely because of their selfconceptions as significant agents of social changea selfimage in the most serious need of careful scrutinyno concept of the prophetic social role of the black university mcworter is complete without dealing in a large way with students if a summary of the arguments can be attempted the authors seem to be saying that somewhere near the heart of the problems confronting the black community is what carter g woodson called the miseducation of the negro this miseducation consists principally in the education of black scholars to feel contempt for themselves and for the black community by failing to confront them with adequate knowledge about themselves both to counter white stereotypes and to bolster their selfconfidence the negro colleges have also failed to develop meaningful helping relationships between black scholars and the balck community accustomed to facile imitations of white middle class life styles negro colleges have failed to plumb the depths of the black experience thus stephen henderson underlines the contention that in the search for identity the black experience is not only relevant    it is fundamental and crucial a strengthened sense of identity will produce not only a black university which serves the black american community it will create the indispensable precondition for new linkages with the entire third world a unique internationalism will be created in which according to vincent harding the uniqueness of our approach to the world would be found in our vision through an unashamedly black oriented prism in the academic program and in a hundred other less structured ways the black university would seek to explore celebrate and record the experience of the nonwestern world similarly gerald mcworter views as a key component of the very meaning of blackness the affirmation of an identity independent of the historical human evils of modern nation states the significant problem encountered here is not adequately stated in terms of the simply dichotemy of integration versus separatism the real question is whether this statement of mission and strategy does justice to the facts and the logic of the very black experience it claims to celebrate this writer has no quarrel with the objectives of a black university which seeks to serve the needs of the black community nor with the concern for more adequate study and dramatization of events in the black experience nor with the desire to create unquestionably intelligent and competent centers of learning for black people nonetheless as is well known agreement on specific objectives and even on particular tactical points does not necessarily mean agreement on underlying issues embedded in the strategy itself this writer wishes to focus on but one of such issues with the hope of clarifying some of the strategic questions raised the issue can be introduced by raising a question regarding in exactly what ways does the black ex  perience address the problem of racism encountered by the black community in the areas of housing and employment for example what curricular expression of the black experience would relate the black university more effectively to the black community is the creation of a black consciousness in the minds and hearts of black people more important than assisting them with their daily struggle for survival are the two problems the same thing anyone familiar with the long and often bitter struggle in our colleges and universities not only to get black studies but a particular ideological brand of black studies will know that these are not trivial questions in a footnote to a widely talked about but seldom read volume frantz fanon makes an important observation about the decision of the president of senegal to include the study of the idea of negroism in the curriculum if this decision was due to an anxiety to study historical causes no one can criticize it but if on the other hand it was taken in order to create black selfconsciousness it is simply a turning of his back upon history the point fanon is making is that the people are helped not by excessive investments in the study of the peoples culture but by addressing current problems felt by the people of the four authors who discuss the curriculum of the black university three of them mcworter henderson and harding seem to give clear priority to the humanistic sciences henderson is quite explicit that such a university would almost by definition involve chiefly those disciplines which are humancentered ie the social sciences the behavioral sciences literature art and the like moreover the faculty of the university would be staffed with black humanists and specialists in blackness  and although he says that the nonhumanistic sciences should have    an honored place in the curriculum it is obvious where the resources of such a university would be invested i want to state the strongest possible disagreement with this bifurcation of the black experience it is the logical outcome of a narrow conception of black identity which if actually pursued would isolate the black university even further than some of these same authors say it is today from the black community if as stokely carmichael and charles hamilton persuasively argue the process of political modernization must take place  in both the black and white communities in order to treat adequately the problems of racism then a black university which invests a preponderance of its resources in black humanistic studies is seriously disadvantaged in its intentions to help and that prepares them to deal effectively with that world is a basic fact to people in every black community in this land parochial programs of black studies based on uncritical concepts of black identity will not help either our students or these desperately hungry communities such narrowly conceived programs may help some professors and politicians and not a few students talk about helping oppressed people    get in  by any means necessary to do it right now but such violent discourse only helps the ego of the speaker for that is not political language that is the language of insurrection and it is both misleading and dishonest unless such spokesmen have both the readiness and the capacity to carry forward the action implied if the black university is truly to become the serviceoriented center of research and action that vincent harding desires if it is to use his words to set up skills banks for developing nations and   urge those students who do not return to the black american communities to offer their skills to africa latin america and wherever else they are needed then it will clearly have to give the nonhumanistic sciences of mathematics statistics accounting engineering physics et al a very great deal of support such a university would not be able to afford to invest all or even the majority of its resources in humanistic programs there is no reason why such disciplines cannot be construed as within the programs of black studies it is the purpose and strategy of a uinversity which defines its being black studies can be taught for the purpose of condescending to or patronizing black people as darwin turner observed in his article by the same token nonblack courses can be taught for the purpose of helping black people both at home and abroad a functional black university will strive to engage in the kind of teaching and research and public service which provides people with the disciplines of thought and action by which they can mature as persons and help shape the world into a more human place of habitation the irremediable blackness of afroamericans would be accepted both as a fact of life and as a positive value but it would not restrict the experience of black identity to the immediacies of skinassociated cultural values the black experience is one crucible in which we work our way to a vision of and a connection with the human potential in all men a final word by way of illustration  ralph ellison has complained that his awardwinning novel invisible man is often misread to imply that it was the blackness of skin of the hero which made him invisible to white americans instead says ellison the heros invisibility is not a matter of being seen but a refusal to run the risk of his own humanity which involves guilt this is not an attack upon white society it is what the hero refuses to do in each section which leads to further action he must assert and achieve his own humanity he cannot run with the pack and do this a functional black university will see the need for instruction in the disciplines of personal moral responsibility as well as in the techniques of social action asserting and achieving ones humanity means that black people are not exempted from the universal human need to develop a personal idiom as well as a group style black people too need the art of transforming and transcending even the materials and patterns of black culture we cannot run with the pack and do this whether the pack is white or black in the words of the spiritual you got to walk this lonesome valley by yourself 
confronted with a book like how we live contemporary life in contemporary fiction the inclination is to shrug throw it aside and proceed to something more relevant and instructive for black people the time has long since passed when black people should waste their energies challenging the racist assumptions at the base of such books there is much work to be done the task of turning the attention of black people away from the integrationist lures which are allpervasive and toward the possibilities inherent in submergence in their own history and culture is monumental it is obviously wasteful to debate the racists andworse recognizing them merely feeds their arrogance and depravity even so it is important to keep in mind the many millions of black peopleespecially studentswho are influenced by the kind of racist tripe which passes for criticism of black literary works generations of black students have gone out into the world as professionals believing that the white view of black literature is the valid view and there are far far too many black teachers who slavishly repeat the antiblack nonsense they have learned in the nations colleges and universities black students must not be abandoned to the insidious propaganda which holds in essence that black writers rarely produce works of art because of course there is an element of protest in their work only white writers have the objectivity toward race which is necessary to produce art when the subject matter is race pure crap and yet it is propagated everywhere    it cannot therefore be ignored as it so richly deserves to be in how we live a big  pages expensive  anthology compiled by l rust hills and his wife penny chapin and published by macmillan the racist line is presented with startling candor the section dealing with black life and literature is small  pages and toward the rear of the book six authors are presented and three of that six are white now here in the editors own words are the reasons why only three black writers ralph ellison james baldwin john a williams are included among some  authors many of them thirdrate and unimportant by any truly objective yardstick and read and weepwhy it was necessary for the editors to select fiction by three white writers to provide an authentically literary reflection of how we blacks live    unlike the jews who have equal opportunities and can change their distinguishing names and noses and adopt the elite religious and life styles and thus not only melt in but rise to the top in a few generations the negroes have a much longer and more difficult road to follow in order to lose their racial stigma and become plain ordinary americans the editors explain gloriously ignorant of the monstrousness of their presumption and condescension for these reasons and some others the editors proceed blithely there has been no negro renaissance in contemporary american fiction to compare with the jewish renaissance    there are at least a halfdozen jewish writers in the absolutelv firstrank of american writ a  ing today and there are dozens of others whose potentiality or achievement places them not far behind only two really first rate negro writers can be namedralph ellison and james baldwinand the ranks behind them are almost empty to mention the names of ronald fair ernest j gaines chester himes claude brown william melvin kellev paule marshall and john a williams is to stretch and virtually exhaust the list of negroes from whom we can expect literary fiction of significant interest it is not that negroes are not writing or being published but aside from ellison and baldwin they have not yet produced the kind of writing that satisfies the complex contemporary read white  literary tastes and sensibilities    this situation will of course change soon the editors write throwing black writers a patronizing bone but up to this time it seems that the dialects and situations of negro life have provided the negro writer with the kind of material that is translatable only into a direct recounting of or protest against the sordid or subtle facts of his oppression and finally this this all the above quotes is all perhaps by way of explaining that two of the stories in this section are by jewish writers and one is by a southern white woman there it is and you had better believe it two jews and a southern white woman are better equipped to write about race because apparently they are not hampered by the kind of material that is translatable only into a direct recounting of or protest against the sordid or subtle facts of black oppression in other words the black angle of vision is literarily invalid true literature on race comes only through the white sensibility to begin with none of the whiteauthored stories is really about black people and there is some question in the mind of this black reader whether those black people portrayed in the white stories came through as living breathing human beings but my sensibility is a black one and in the view of the editors of how we live is therefore automatically not to be taken seriously if after some  years i do not know black people and how they live and am incapable of passing judgment on the authentic portrayal of black people and black life then i can learn all that i do not know by reading jewish and southern writers the premise is familiar of course in every facet of american life white people know better than black people what is best and what is the right procedure for black people in his story the nickel misery of george washington carver brown jewish ivan gold writes about a black soldier who simply is not to be believed except in the fond fantasies of white people he speaks in an ersatz amos and andy dialect saying such nonblack things as yons all confused and yall know who copperhaid is that skinny nigrah boy indicating that mr gold might have been more at home with a white anglosaxon boy from the ozarks worse mr gold makes his caricature a blackfaced jewish schlmiel a doubledumb loser with an outsized capacity for debasement which might be common among semites but which is black only in the veiled hopes of white people mr gold in short suffers from the william styronnat turner syndrome the bernard malamud story black is my favorite color is better than mr golds but mr malamud is a better writer than mr gold and an infinitely superior observer of human beings and their behavior black or white however a black lady friend who read mr malamuds story at my request was not impressed with the authors creation of the black female character in the story ornita i guess there are black women like that she said but i dont know them the white southern woman author is the late flannery oconnor of georgia a fine and sensitive writer her black character in the story everything that rises must converge is observed mrs oconnor does not enter into the womans psyche she plays it safe the storys chief character is a white woman with whom mrs oconnor isand should befamiliar a runofthemill georgia racist but here a word should be said mrs oconnor chose one kind of georgia expression of racial bigotry she might well have chosen another two women are likely to confront each other across the racial wall in much less violent terms than two men and yet confrontation between men is more usual a black writer might well have chosen the more usual confrontation and to mr and mrs hills his story would have been unacceptable as literature one thing more the hills state authoritatively that ralph ellison and james baldwin are the only two really first rate negro writers who can be named relegating to mediocrity such superb craftsmen as john a williams paule marshall william melvin kelley and ernest j gaines and totally ignoring saunders redding robert boles carlene hatcher polite and kristin hunter the hills can be excused for not knowing about alice walker lindsay patterson audrey lee louise meriwether and the whole new bundle of black writers just being published and no one expects them to recognize the genius of militants leroi jones larry neal or ed bullins but they have slapped in the face even those black writers who slavishly submit to the white literary dogma which demeans them how we live then is important for black readers and writers for the reason that it provides them with an example of what they must continue to guard against black students in and out of integrated schools must be protected from the virulent racism inherent in criticism by literary
