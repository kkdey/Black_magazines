the history of the black man in america has been one of end i less struggle against the forces of racism oppression and exploitation yet today  years after the enslavement of our fathers we remain still on the fringes of society as a despised deprived decitizenized minority no longer held in physical bondage yet bound nonetheless by a history of social economic and cultural oppression which has been just as damaging in its effects as physical enslavement malcolm_x once said that nobody can give you freedom nobody can give you equality or justice or anything if youre a man you take it if you cant take it you dont de  serve it the history of mankind amply demonstrates the essential truth of this statement the early american settlers did not wait for the british to give them their freedom they rose up and took it the natives of  algeria and kenya and nigeria got their freedom not by asking but by acting and so it has been with oppressed people throughout the world the tragedy of black people in america is that we have never as a people risen up to demand our freedom and today we remain as enslaved as ever our lives and destiny controlled still by the descendents of those who a century ago decided to free us this freedom upon close examination however turns out to be highly illusory for it is generally known that that which the master gives he also can take away perhaps more so than in any other period of history black people today under stand and accept the essentia truth of this statement throughout black america there is the growing realization that black liberation can only be effected through black initiative on this there is no disagreement but how is this to come about what is required by what means are we to gain our freedom black_power vote power dollar power gun power black capitalism black nationalism reform the system overthrow the system under whose leadership core naacp urban league black_panthers us black community development the republic of new africa black economic development committee to begin to answer this question we might first stop to consider what do we mean by freedom the term is at once both complex and simple it is used both in an absolute and a relative sense on the one hand it refers to an ideal state in which men are free to pursue their interests and live their lives maximally unencumbered by external forces and power and on the other to certain specific rights and privileges to which all men are said to be entitled by either measure the freedom of the black man in america has been severely circumscribed for well over  years before  black people possessed few if any rights and while the emancipation proclamation freed the blackman from physical bondage it left him politically socially economically and culturally enslaved consequently the struggle for freedom since that time has moved on many different fronts following a variety of strategies and tactics all ostensibly concerned with bringing about the ultimate liberation of black america under the leadership of such men as w e b du bois a philip randolph james farmer martin_luther_king jr and many others important political social and economic gains have been made unfortunately the great majority of black people have failed to benefit from these gains thus disillusionment in the civil_rights movement began to appear in the mids with an increasing call for newer more militant strategies for the liberation of the masses ol black people and responses have begun to take shape in the hearts and minds of the ghetto and campuses across the nation as more and more of our youth begin to hear and to understand the teaching of men such as malcolm i say that you and  will never get our freedom nonviolently or patiently or lovingly we will never get it until we let the world know that as other human beimis have laid down their lives for freedomand also taken life for freedomthat you and  are ready and willing and equipped and qualified to do the same there are many who believe that the black_power movement represents the final stage in the black mans centuriesold struggle to free himself of white domination and oppressiona struggle that began with the first african warrior who chose death over slavery and has continued up through the urban uprisings of the s as noted the struggle has been marked by a variety of different strategies and programs the bootstrapism of booker t washington legal persuasionism of the naacp emigrationism of marcus garvey moral persuasionism of martin_luther_king jr and the early followers of core and sncc and most recently the black nationalism of malcolm_x and his numerous followers and disciples what then is the black_power movement and how are its goals and strategies distinguishable from those of other movements since the summer of  when the term was first given public currency by stokely carmichael of sncc black_power has come to mean a host of different things to different people and organizations as first projected it constituted a denunciation and rejection of white liberal leadership in the civil_rights movement and a break with the philosophy of nonviolence it also signaled the rejection of integration as a primary goal and the assertion of a new black pride and identity  challenged to go beyond sweeping generalities and to identify its program black_power advocates in sncc and core began to talk in terms of black people controlling the politics and economics of their communities sncc set out to organize an allblack political party in lowndes county alabama core a series of farming and business coops in mississippi and other states in the south early confusion over the meaning of black_power developed because of the failure to distinguish between black_power as a philosophy and strategy on the one hand and as a particular set of social political economic and cultural programs on the other there was never any real doubt among early advocates as to the meaning of black powei as a broadly defined strategy for change the central concern was and still is black people acquiring and exercising power in behalf of theii own interests or to put it simply black selfdetermination as a strategy black_power is applicable at least theoretically to a full range of social economic and political objectives it is not inherently socialistic capitalistic nor welfaristic its true ideological base is neither socialism capitalism or liberal welfarism black_power as a strategy of blacl selfdetermination is philosophically rooted in the unique psychosocial condition of the black man or in short in the collective black com sciousness as such black_power is a call to black people to rediscovej the richness of their own possibilities to open themselves spiritually morally and psychologically to the true meaning of their lives as expressed in the black mans own unique historically evolving culture implicit within the philosophy of bjack power is the ultimate creation of a more humane and just society whether such a society can be best realized under the capitalist socialist or liberal welfarist system is the point around which the debate has been joined black social scientists intellectuals and students of society in general have an important role to play in this debate granted the primitive state of knowledge in the social sciences and the overriding importance of ideology in the movement the black social analyst still has a responsibility to help sharpen the issues and weigh alternatives and in so doing assist in the making of decisions that are consonant with the goals of the movement the remainder of this paper constitutes an effort in this direction in the three years since the proclamation of greenwood black_power strategy and philosophy has been aligned with three more or less distinct ideological frames of reference assimilationism pluralism and nationalism the first is delineated in black_power and urban unrest by nathan wright chairman of the national black_power conference formed in  and may be characterized as the assimilationist view the second is set forth in stokely carmichael and charles v hamiltons book black_power tne politics of liberation and may be characterized as the pluralist view the third is described in the works of a number of writers including leroi jones ron karenga eldrldge cleaver and most importantly malcolm_x and is generally characterized as the nationalist view
the assimilationlst view of blaok power dr wright describes black_power as a short tenn strategy for ultimate integiation into the mainstream ol american life the reason this has not occurred according to this theory rests in the black mans failure to develop the kind ol group solidarity thzat made it possible for the early italian jewish and irish immigrants to enter the melting pot racism is recognized as a fact of american life but this can be overcome dr wright argues by a more equitable distribution of power among whites and blacks a situation which whites will be willing to help bring about once they understand that it is wot only morally right but in their best interest to do so blacks should band togefner in their own organizations under their own leadershi p and initiative and developand implement programs that not only meet their immediate material needs but also contribute to their selfdevelopment and growth into maturity whites should help to encourage this by sharing more equitably their power and resources this accomplished blacks will then be able to take their rightful place in the mainstream of american life the pluralist view of black_power according to the pluralist view american society is composed of a variety of different ethnic and interest groups all competing for various goods and services these groups operate not in accordance with what is good for the society as a whole but according to what tends to maximize their own interests the black man has been at a severe disad  vantage in this process historically because he has lacked a sense of ethnicity or group solidarity it is necessary then for black americans if they are to compete on an equal basis with others to come together and build a common power base from which they can more adequately represent their social political and economic interests black people are said to possess a culture that is distinct and separate from that of other ethnic groups wbite racism has resulted in the denial and destruction of that culture which black men must now undertake to revive and restore to its natural and proper place in their lives until black people do this tlbey will remain in effect an underdeveloped semicolonized people assimilation into white middle class america should not be the black qnans objective rather his goal should be an effective share in the totai power of the societyimprovement in the political and economic st atus of black men is dependent upon the complete revision of the economic and political institutions in this society the nationalist view of black_power  the nationalist view holds that the position of the black man ini america is that of a colonized people in a fundamentally racist society that is unwilling fund unable to change the only salvation for t o black man therefore is to band together throw off white oppressioiji by whatever means are necessary and proceed with the building of hiu own society separate and apart from that of white america the new black society will be built on social economic and political values which are different from and superior to those of america and western civilization before proceeding with a closer look at the above interpretations of black_power it should be noted that there is little disagreement among the three on the core meaning of the concept that is  that black people should develop a greater sense of group solidarity and racial pride  that the achievements of the civil_rights movement have fallen short of benefiting the masses of black people  that organizations and institutions in the black community should be controlled and directed by blacks  that white racism constitutes the core of the black mans problem  that the black freedom movement must be led by blacks  that black people have the right and the responsibility to defend themselves against violent attack and  that black_power is sought not as an end in itself but as a means to the liberation of black america differences revolve around the way in which the ultimate goal is defined and the tactics by which liberation will be achieved it is not altogether correct to refer to the above views just outlined as theories of black_power to do so would imply that a lot more serious effort has been devoted to the study and analysis of the movement than is actually the case in the three years since greenwood the most penetrating study and analysis has been attempted by carmichael and hamilton in their book black_power politics of liberation and even though this book falls short of articulating a truly comprehensive revolutionary concept of liberation it goes well beyond the nontheoretical somewhat preachy effort by nathan wright jr in black_power and urban unrest dr wright incidentally has turned out an even more disappointing statement in his latest book let us work together robert allen in a pamphlet published by the guardian press in  dialectics of black_power identifies and discusses briefly what he detects as five approaches to black_power allen however  makes the mistake as i have suggested above of confusing the philosophy of black_power with particular political and economic programs  several white writers notably arnold berman christopher lasch g and arnold schuchter have attempted to deal with the subject but have only succeeded quite unexpectedly in demonstrating the thoroughness of the white mans ignorance of the true inner meaning of black liberation schuchter provides a brilliant analysis of the problems of contemporary america but arrives at the pitiful conclusion that black freedom depends on white power at any rate it should be clear that the black liberation movement if anything is concerned with social change of a very fundamental sort as such it becomes important for the move iment to define with some degree of precision what it intends to change to what and how or in other words to develop a theory or set of guidelines by which the black mans ultimate liberation in america will be accomplished the importance of this point has been urged by such writers as harold cruse james boggs and most recently by lerone bennett jr in a brilliant analysis of the movement in the august  edition of ebony magazine a theory of social change should set forth at least three things  the structure and dynamics of the situation in which change is sought or is occurring  the nature and character of the change that is sought or is occurring and  the process by which change is to be sought or is occurring the question now becomes to what extent do the three positions noted above begin to deal with such matters first of the three the assimilationist view espoused by nathan wright and others would appear to be least concerned with bringing about significant social change to the degree that social change implies basic institutional change  the assimilationist is not concerned with changing the basic values of american society but with gaining greater participation in the existing social economic and political institutions on which these values are said to be based in this respect black_power assimilationists in actuality operate within the tradition and philosophy of the now moribund civil_rights movement the goals are essentially the same only the strategies have changed for this reason it is questionable whether the assimilationist view can be appropriately included in the confines of a philosophy that clearly seeks to transcend the integrationist reformist civil_rights movement of the s and s at first glance black_power politics of liberation might seem to argue a strictly pluralist point of view close reading of this book however does not support such a position christopher lasch in one of the earliest attempts at an analysis of the black_power movement takes carmichael and hamilton to task for failing to note and deal with the contradiction between the pluralist perspective and the colonized people analysis which lasch says the authors attempt to treat simultaneously in their book actually laschs criticism is based on a serious misreading of carmichael and hamilton true the authors discuss similarities between the black mans efforts to build a power base within the black community and those of earlier european immigrants along the same lines they also call attention to the pluralistic basis on which american political life is organized but nowhere do they suggest that the ultimate aim of the black_power movement is to gain black group integration into the existing pluralistic structure of american societ rather they seem to state very clearly that the organizing of a stroi black political and economic base is a necessary preparatory move towa the ultimate liberation of afroamericans from the control and domin tion of the mother country although not explicitly stated the unde lying tone and intent of carmichael and hamiltons analysis is clear nationalist for this reason it is perhaps more logical to include tl views advanced in their book within the larger framework of natio alism rather than in a separate and distinct category which as we find  close analysis does not seem to be completely warranted we are le then with two rather than three organizing frames of reference assimil tionism and nationalism black nationalism far from constituting a single undifferentiate phenomenon encompasses a variety of meanings some of which m be stated as follows  emigration back to africa  establishment of a separate black nation within the geographic confines of the usa the position of the black muslims ac the republic of new africa  the organization direction and control of all institutions in tl black community in accordance with the prescriptions and pe spectives of a separate and distinct black culture this is sa to be the main thrust of black_power politics of liberation constitutes the pluralistic position very often unstated of nume ous individuals and organizations  the eventual creation of a federation of citystates politicalt controlled by blacks throughout the usa apparently the pos tion of national core s e anderson identifies what appeal to be two orientations in this group those who envision tl american politicoeconomic structure as legitimate and thus see to enter it by initially withdrawing and building the blackenir cities into politically and economically quasiautonomous cit states destined to vie for influence and control of white america capital and resources and the other group being those wfc believe black cities can be simultaneously independent of tl american politicoeconomic structure and also exist within it i as noncapitalist communal enclave  the building of a sense of ethnicity and cultural unity amor black americans with little or no real concern for the remakir  of the basic institutions and values of the society an essentially apolitical position attributed by some to the cultural nationalists as a group the overthrow of capitalism and the building of a socialist society those who hold this view seemingly fall into two groups the first see afroamericans as the revolutionary vanguard that will ignite the long predicted proletarian overthrow of capitalism with blacks assuming an equal part with white allies in building the new society this approximates the position of the black_panthers the second group envisions a new socialist society organized and controlled completely by blacks this view is set forth in the black economic development committees black manifesto announced earlier this year how then do black nationalists view the black mans situation today the following statements based on the thoughts and ideas of numerous proponents of black nationalism attempts to answer this question a black nationalists see america as an essentially racist society bent on pursuing a policy of systematic exploitation and oppression of its black population beginning with the introduction of slavery in the s and continuing virtually unchanged through the next  years although occasionally modified under pressure at home and abroad eg emancipation fepc the supreme court desegregation decision etc racism still constitutes the chief defining characteristic of race relations in this country today its practice is not limited to any one area of social activity it is rooted systematically in the policies practices values norms and standards of american society its role in the shaping of americas economic political and cultural institutions has been of central importance in short racism far from being a marginal or isolated phenomenon is in fact endemic to the american way of life its removal therefore necessarily implies changes that go to the very heart of the countrys existence eg capitalism representative democracy etc the country however despite its growing public condemnation and disavowal of racism is adamant in its opposition to any attempt to effect fundamental changes in its basic economic and political institutions consequently black people as a group are left locked in a position of virtual peonage b up until recently black men have mistakenly relied on the gooc will and moral consciousness of white america in their fight for a bettei life in so doing they have found that the small amount of progress they have been permitted to make has been at the expense of their identity and sense of worth in order to move ahead and gain acceptance in the larger society black americans have been forced to deny and reject their own racial and cultural heritage and to accept the implied superiority of the white mans culture and ways of doing things the resultj ing pattern of selfhatred aided and abetted by white racism has served to destroy social cohesion in the black community and thereby to restrict its capacity for effective group action contrary to the generally held belief this is not a society of individuals but of separate ethnic and interest groups consequently the philosophy of individualism as promoted both by the liberals and conservatives in this country has had the effect of retarding the growth and development of the black population c the oppression of the black man in america is part of a longstanding pattern of oppression directed by whites against the nonwhite people throughout the world the same forces that operate to keep the black man in this country in a subjugated semicolonized state are also responsible for the subjugation of the oppressed people of africa asia and latin america the decolonization struggle in these countries and the black liberation struggle in america are part of a common effort to defeat a common enemy d the american class system supports and perpetuates racism which in turn constitutes a vital factor in the growth and development of that class system each supports and feeds on the other for example middle class suburbia is substantially the product of racist policies adopted and pursued by the american government and society the socalled american dilemma described by gunnar myrdal does not in fact exist it is not in the interest of america to extend complete freedom justice and equality to the blackman to do so would undermine or radically alter the fundamental basis on which the society is organized e the american philosophy of the pursuit of economic activity for selfish gain is destructive of the well being of society as a whole and the well being of black people in particular it operates  to keep the masses of black people in a permanent state of impoverishment and  to keep black people divided one from the other while the key to our liberation rests in unity f the accepted channels for inducing change are heavily biased toward the maintenance of the society as it exists these channels almost always operate in the interest of white america and seldom in the true interest of black america such changes have been brought about through established procedures and have produced little or no improvement in the position of the masses of black americans small gains registered during the last  years have only come about because of internal and external pressure brought to bear against the american government contrary to what the country wants to believe of itself and what it would have others believe of it america is not and has never been motivated in the main in its dealings at home and abroad by moral or humane considerations public and private responses to the plight of the black american far from being humanitarian or beneficial have resulted in deepening the slavelike dependency blackmen have suffered since gaining their freedom in  this in brief summarizes the black nationalist view of the social order in which the afroamerican finds himself today the social analyst presented with this description naturally wants to know what evidence exists to support its validity the most readily available evidence of course is written in the daytoday lives of this countrys  million black citizens beyond this documented support exists in the work of numerous reputable students of american society the compilation and analysis of this material is a task that warrants the attention of black liberation theoreticians and i for one hope to deal with it in the near future to complete this paper however i would like to turn now to a description and discussion of the stated goals of black nationalism what are the goals of black nationalism what aspects of the present social order does it seek to change the answer to this and related questions of course may be found to some extent in the black nationalist analysis of american society from what has been said earlier about the variety of meanings attached to the philosophy of black nationalism it follows that no uniform agreement exists on the specific endgoals of the movement to reiterate some advocates see the establishment of a separate autonomous black nation within the confines of the u s as the ultimate goals of the nationalist movement others are thinking in terms of developing a federation of municipal governments that are expected to come under black political control during the next  to  years still others talk in terms of maximizing black control of the social political economic and cultural institutions in areas where blacks constitute a majority a fourth goal is said to be concerned with promoting cultural and ethnic unity among black people without primary regard at this time for the achievement of black political or economic autonomy with the possible exception of the last mentioned group all black nationalists reject americas economic and political instiutions as inimical to the interests and liberation of black americans some speak in terms of socialism as the alternative others of a still to be defined cor munalism no one has been able thus far to describe in detail ti operation of proposed alternative economic systems or how they mig coexist within americas present capitalist system the one exception this might be the black_panther political party which openly embrac the socialist philosophy preached and practiced by mao tse tung i china for the panthers the question is not one of coexisting wil capitalism but of replacing it altogether with socialism    the saw can also be said about the goals of the black economic developme committee which as set forth in the black manifesto envision a blad takeover of the entire country and establishment of a socialist societl for the most part black nationalist economic alternatives have bed largely piecemeal shortrun reformist proposals designed to broada black participation in the existing economic system for example cor has developed a community development corporation proposal the in tent of which presumably is to establish black control over all fund coming into the black community it is far from clear however thj such a program is likely to do much in the way of establishing economl selfsufficiency in the ghetto or in a yet to be established separate blad nation perhaps in this idea we can begin to see the first move towarl the development of a new economic system that might be described a communal capitalism numerous other questions come to mind fq instance what kind of educational system will the new nation set ud how will it deal with the problems of juvenile delinquency drug addij tion illegitimacy alcoholism and broken homes in raising such quej tions the purpose is not to challenge the viability of the goal or to caj doubt on the possibility of building a viable new nation the purposl is rather to face boldly some of the difficult issues and problems thl movement must inevitably confront and deal with in the years ahead obviously detailed final answers can not be worked out a priori to sud gest as much would be unrealistic but now is the time to begin thinkin about such matters even as we prepare for the day of our ultimat liberation to repeat what are the goals of the black nationalist movement first let me suggest that it would be helpful to approach the subjec from the point of view of immediate intermediate and ultimate or end goals earlier i noted what may be described as six types of black na tionalist endgoals none of these common reason tells us are likely t be achieved overnight the question then becomes what are the im mediate and intermediate goals or objectives that must be achieved ii order to take the movement from where it is today to where it hope to be ultimately or to put it another way what are the necessary immediate and intermediate goals on which the achievement of the movements endgoals logically rest it is to this critical question that i would now like to turn first black nationalism in america no matter the specific form it takes is revolutionary in that it opposes and seeks to alter the basic values and institutions of the existing social order whether stated directly or not revolutionary intent is an integral part of the goals and philosophy of the black_panthers the republic of new africa the black  student union movement and cultural nationalist groups such as those led by leroi jones and ron karenga without fail black nationalists are concerned with black political economic social and cultural selfdetermination a goal which is not likely to be peacefully granted by white america such is the case regardless of whether the aim is to establish a separate black nation or to take over control of the schools or businesses in the black community this is not to argue that the realization of black nationalism in this country necessarily implies the exercise of armed force or violent strategies in some cases armed conflict will be inevitable in others highly probable in either case black nationalism as a revolutionary movement demands if anything maximum unity and social cohesion rooted in a consciousness of common purpose and social need as defined by black nationalist philosophy this i submit is the central defining condition around which immediate and intermediate goals of the black nationalist movement must be developed the tragedy of the black man in america is that over the years he has come to identify with and to accept those aspects of american society that constitutes the prime source of his degradation and oppression selfcentered materialism colonial welfarism gradualistic reformism and cultural assimilationism to mention but a few the acceptance of these values has undermined and all but destroyed the blackmans capacity to see understand and act in behalf of his own best interests while at the same time it has kept him permanently immobilized outside the gates of affluence in a perpetual state of false hopefulness it is this condition that black nationalism must alter on its way toward creating the requisite degree of revolutionary black consciousness among the masses this means developing programs and activities that expose the falseness and exploitativeness of the countrys class system that encourages black people to go beyond the crippling strictures of liberal reformism and to challenge in radically new ways and forms the conditions in which they find themselves that promote a greater sense of ethnic cooperation and racial communalism these are offered not as concrete programs which clearly they are not but as standards by which to measure the value or utility of the shortrange program proposals and action plans if it hopes to gain and maintain a sense of relevancy the movement must speak to the concrete needs of the people as they are experienced today but the challenge is to do so in a way that is likely i to heighten and not retard the growth of revolutionary black consciousness among the masses of black people examined in this way programs such as those promoted under the label of black capitalism or those which directly or indirectly contribute to the growth of elitism in the black community clearly constitute a hinderance to the black nationalist liberation process whether programs such as model cities antipoverty community health or even cores community development corporation ultimately serve to hinder or to help the process depends largely on the revolutionary consciousness of the black leaders who are a part of such programs the potential is there what is required is the revolutionary will to capitalize on it thus citing colonial welfarism a category under which most of the above noted programs fall as destructive to the liberation process is not to suggest that all welfare programs are to be rejected automatically what must be rejected however is the underlying philosophy that encourages docile slavelike  dependency among the people who are intended to benefit it would be tragic however if the movement had to depend on government funded welfare programs as its only or prime means of reaching the people fortunately there are others outstanding among which is that of political action organized and unorganized cultural activities represent another moving on to a third major question that any theory of social change must inevitably address itself to how or by what process will the black nationalist movement achieve its objectives here we must consider each of the forms of black nationalism separately as alluded to earlier organizations such as the black_panthers and the republic of new africa see armed revolution as a necessary and inevitable part of the liberation process the panthers envision a proletarian overthrow of the capitalist system the republic of new africa foresees widespread guerilla warfare initiated in the south and spreading to the populous cities of the north some who envision the creation of a federation of cities under black control stress political organization and political action others emphasize cultural regeneration and cultural revolution outstanding among the former group is core and among the latter such groups as those led by leroi jones and ron karenga revolution armed political and culturalis the principal means by which alternative forms of black nationalism hope to effectuate the goals of black liberation the success of each as already noted will depend substantially on the achievement of a condition of revolutionary readiness among the masses of black people or at least a significant minority thereof it is possible that this will come about through the organized efforts of activists in the nationalist movement or as a reaction to stepped up repression of the liberation movement in general or in response to unforeseen development on the international scene or all three the situation at the moment hangs in balance there are forces that seem to be pushing events more and more in the direction of revolution there are counter forces that tend to check and negate the drift toward revolution among the former i include the following continued ghettoization of blacks in the urban areas and selfsegregation of whites in surrounding suburbs the deepening economic plight of the masses of blacks i relative to the condition of the average white american increasing militarization of urban police forces accelerating thrust of the philosophy of black_power and the black cultural revolution the accelerating thrust of a white student movement sympathetic to the goals and objectives of black liberation among the countering forces i include continued growth and prosperity of the black middle class continued spread of i colonial welfarismimproved public assistance grants antipovertyl programs model cities programs black capitalism etc continued generalized commitment among black people to the capitalist ethic of the pursuit of economic activity for private gain selfcentered material ism nationwide encirclement and repression of liberation movement leadership and membership which of the above set of forces will prevail no one can truly say the apocalyptic predictions of marxist determinists have failed to maj terialize as a result the deterministic approach to history and social change has been largely discredited c w mills position on historical change is probably closer to the truth than that of the economic determinists when he says to be grounded in history is to expect of the future that which does not follow mechanically but flows from large decisions not yet made and to be sure it is the large decisions noj yet made that revolutionary black nationalism must seek to influence if it hopes to swing future events in the direction of its ultimate aims and purposes in summary black nationalists argue that significant change in the black mans position in this country can only be brought about througl revolutionary overthrow of the existing social economic and politic structure some hold that the chief instruments of change are necessari violent others political and still others cultural the most pressing issi at this point may not be which of the three is correct in a final or ultimai sense but rather given the situation that exists in america today an among black people in particular which of the three instruments  change would appear to be most strategically viable at this point i history numerous observers in recent years have drawn a parallel betwee the oppressed black people of america and the colonized people of th third world they are quick to point out that the liberation struggle in the countries of the third world have been characteristically violen affairs and that the struggle for black liberation in this country must alsj proceed along the lines of armed revolution it should be clear howeven that the parallel between the blacks of america and the oppressed of thl third world is far from exact aside from certain obvious difference on the question of prior ownership of and the relative numerical strengtl of the colonized vs the colonizers other important differences exist witl respect to the predominant modes of control and oppression employed by the mother country although historically terroristic activity and arbitrary proscription of civil liberties have been systematically employed against blacks in this country these arc no longer the chief instrument of oppression that they have been in the past the black man in americi and in the newly emerging nations of the third world suffer not sc much from terroristic domination and control as from domination tha stems from enforced economic political and cultural dependency on the mother country the mechanisms of repression center less in the police and the military and more in the farreaching patterns of racial discrimination in housing employment and education colonial welfarism and cultural suppression the domination of afroamericans has been made complete by the destruction and removal of all possibility for the development of a black cultural base forcing blacks to rely on the cultural prescriptions and guidelines of the culture of the oppressor the road to the liberation of the blackman in america would seem to lead at this time not through armed revolution but through the assertion of black cultural autonomy or in other words a black cultural revolution  to repeat the problem we presently face is not primarily one of widespread terrorism physical coercion or arbitrary denial of civil liberties these are no longer the chief means of oppression in this country the problem we now confront is one of domination by social economic and political institutions that have been organized and which operate in such a way as to keep black people in a permanent state of subjugation it is important to point out however that the source of oppression rests not only in the form or the structure of these institutions but also and perhaps most importantly in their very substance or content in the past liberation efforts have tended to focus on the former we have since come to understand that change must be brought about in both the form and the content for instance modifying or opening the capitalistic structure in the interest of promoting greater black participation does nothing to change the substance of capitalism yet it is the substance its essentially racist and exploitative core that serves to keep the masses of blacks subjugated and dominated at home and abroad the structural approach to change is based on the assumption that the black mans problem is essentially one of exclusion consequently the answer to the problem becomes one of structuring the black man into the prevailing system the problem however goes much further than that the problem exists because the core values goals and objectives of americas basic institutions are inimical to the interests of black people the first step toward changing such institutions must be the building of a black cultural base or frame of reference out of which new answers to the plight of the blackman can be fashioned the only frame of reference that the afroamerican now has is that of his oppressor new social political and economic forms and contents cannot be projected or realized in the absence of alternative cultural perspectives the aim of the black cultural revolution must be to furnish such alternatives there is ample evidence that the process is already well underway on the college campuses in the public schools and hundreds of cultural organizations throughout the country to reiterate the basic institutions and practices of a people are determined by its culture the projection and realization of alternative liberating social forms and institutions for afroamericans rests upon the development of a cultural matrix out of which the substance of these new forms will be shaped the liberation of the black man in america cannot go forward in the absence of a generalized cultural revolution in the black community finally the theory of black liberation through armed revolution at this point in the history of the afroamerican must be seriously questioned for several other reasons than those outlined above a black america presently lacks the material and military base for successfully carrying out a revolution on its own against the most powerful military and industrial country in the history of the world b there does not seem to be in the country today among the white population revolutionary allies with sufficient political economic or military resources at this time to make a difference in armed struggle and c for the immediate future armed revolution is only likely to produce catastrophic repression of black people and a severe setback to the ultimate triumph of the afroamerican liberation struggle let me be clear the above is not intended as an argument in favor of the single strategy approach to black liberation neither armed conflict nor political action can be summarily dismissed as unimportant the issue has to do with where our primary efforts should be concentrated at this time black people would be foolish not to take seriously j the threat of genocide and to prepare themselves accordingly just as it is unthinkable that we should not prepare ourselves to capitalize fully on the opportunity for political control of the many urban areas that will come our way during the next  to  years however unless we develop political social and economic forms that transcend those that have been the source of our oppression for centuries then in truth we will have gained a hollow victory should political or military victory come our way it is only through consciously disengaging ourselves from the cultural matrix out of which existing institutions are fashioned that we can begin to get into position to develop newer more humane social forms and institutions in this sense i agree wholeheartedly with harold cruse who holds that in america the key to the liberation of the blackman hinges on the development of a revolutionary movement that is social political economic and cultural and that there can be no revolution in the u s without cultural revolution this undoubtedly is a topic that deserves much more discussion in the near future i hope to go into it in greater depth in conclusion may i say that the above analysis of black_power and black nationalism in my opinion not only offers a more systematic approach to program development than has been evident in the movement to date it also serves to call attention to something that organizational differences within the movement have tended to obscure and that is the substantial amount of agreement that exists among black nationalists with respect to  the analysis of the black mans position in america and  the broadly defined strategies necessary for ultimate liberation where they differ and i have no desire to conceal or to cover up such differences is on the matter of the definition of endgoals there is no way in the final analysis of determining at this juncture which of the views are correct there seems to be little evidence quite frankly of any significant support for the newly revived backtoafrica movement but l between the black_panthers the republic of new africa black federationists and the cultural nationalists who is to say which if any history will prove to be correct the ultimate outcome as argued above will be determined by a variety of historical forces of which black nationalist organizations constitute but a part although a critically important part but whether black nationalism succeeds in winning over a majority of afroamericans to its philosophyor at least a significant minority will be determined to a very considerable degree by further developments at home and abroad here i have in mind such things on the domestic front as whether the country decides to undertake allout repression of the escalating liberation movement or whether it chooses to initiate quite unexpectedly a truly comprehensive national effort to elevate the economic social and political position of its  million black citizens or to continue along its present gradualist course on the international scene the materialization of war in south africa or in other parts of the third world could have a profound influence on the afroamerican liberation movement these are matters of course which deserve much closer study than can be undertaken in this particular paper in the meantime and even while recognizing severe limitations on the predictability of the social sciences the search for a theoretical base for the liberation movement should certainly go forward to be sure ideology in the long run will play a more decisive role than the offings of science yet afroamerican students of human relations and society in general have a responsibility to apply whatever skills and knowledge they possess toward the ultimate triumph of the goals of black liberation this paper is offered as one step in that direction
a sure thing about clarence majors first novel allnight visitors olympia  is that a lot of us particularly the soul sisters do or will not like it and will not think too highly of clarence major for writing it this will be because eli bolton the central character in allnight visitors is an aimless cockhound whose scores are mostly with white chicks and he describes all of his sexbased relationships with vivid detail in the first  pages understand ably the novel might not be finish by some who pick it up still i b lieve there are reasons why majc editor of the new black poetry h offered us what appears to be a sti novel i believe his reasons are  erary and social eli an orphan is a veteran of tl nam he is a numbed soul broth but not because of the nam exp rience he observes the world car fully and is hip to whats happenii around him he can dig the muslithing and flavors his sexvocab with swahili his story a firstpersonpresent narrative is a wandering outwardwhirling vortex of flashbacks dreams smells and commentary on his own precocious sensibility the present tense brilliantly projects the authors poetic imagination as do the numerous metaphors whieh are skillfully handled eli hustles through his limo with intentions to hold an honest job he works one gig at the other side hotel of onenighters later he is a sodajerk at goldburgs drugcounter three white chicks and two soul sisters fall in and out of elis range of need and circumstance there is tammy the unsophisticated impulsive liar from the midwest the restless cathy a prolonged loveobject eunice elis willowy sophisticated new england angel anita a boss soul momma and loveobject and clara a daughter of elis foster parents the novel is constructed so that the two black women and what they mean to eli are described nearest the center at the end elis three white objectangels also spin away from his grasp as we weave through elis tangled story we find that the main plot involves jimmy sheraton a white excomic turned drunkard nuisance and his death the derelict who claims that a black momma raised him is booted out of goldburgs by brogan the stores bad black assistantmanager eventually he decided to follow eli home bugging him on the subway preferring to avoid letting his irritation get the best of him eli walks swiftly to his pad stopping the youth near his destination sheraton is attacked by three young soul brothers who assume the responsibility of protecting members of the black community sheratons death is a beefkill at heart eli is a hedonist motivated only by an unquenchable de sire to tcb he is ensnared by apathy and harassed by the proximity of circumstance he will not neglect or forsake his rod in fact in the presence of women it is truly a fetish eli possesses a clinical curiosity sheratons death the brutal killing of the wardens pup at the orphanage and the rapekilling of a vietnamese child find eli in a frontrow seat massaged by the medium by the end of his narrative he will have acted in such a manner that even he doesnt fully realize the degree to which his actions permit him to break out of his malaise first he offers a confession of being witness to the beefkill in order to save the three soul brothers from the chair gazing at the nape of one youths neck as he is led from the interrogation room eli muses the view of an early defeat or the beginning of a kind of human victory his second redemptive deed comes with the offering of his living accommodations to a nonenglish speaking pregnant puertorican mother of seven whose husband has ousted them from their own upstairs apartment this is effective dramatic irony we will realize immediately the significance of these actions before eli does allnight visitors as a novel of a young black mans psychic travels contain some very believable people besides the narrator himself whether the characters are objects of elis passion andor are structural props they hold our interest because elis keen eye brings out their personalities with candor even when in the novels structure they appear to come and go as phantoms they are adequately developed as a stylist major has been influenced by henry miller and anais nin his delivery is poetic and the finished product has his own earthy touch in the fashion of ishmael reed major exploits the possibilities of surreal comedy and the ludicrous for momentary effect in descriptive content the sex scenes are reminiscent of the writings of john cleland and desade  though no writer today needs these people as models the orgiastic scene with the foxy anita is described with brilliant sibilance despite the fact that lengthy sex scenes seem a standard or a necessity for the acceptable contemporary american novel the success or failure of allnight visitors will ultimately lie with what it represents as a novel by a black american writer most of us agree that white americas current psychosexual fixation represents part of its demise the fact to consider is majors intent in starting out on this rubbish heap with his first novel if we give allnight visitors an absolute condemnation it would contradict a casually accepted image both in and outside of art of the walking black phallus an image eli doesnt mind fulfilling this image has been assumed at times because it is what white america thinks of the black man in the first place but in majors novel we do watch an apathetic black man take his first steps toward maturitysocial community responsibility eli bolton is a numbed individual sex is his only meaningful outlet eli too is not by himself allnight visitors depicts a libidinous urge but its character is headed in a worthwhile direction he begins to live up to his honorable name when he acts in a manner that will attest to his selfless responsibilit to reach out for others clarence major has the novelist talent but since he is contributing t contemporary afroamerican litera ture his craft should be highlighte by a central character who is able t carry the aesthetic motion of thl story on a more active social level major already shows signs of bein able to handle the psychologica drama the afro novel today mus project meaningful social concept and spiritual values into the blood stream of black america and thi can be done and done well with al the possibilities of style and messag taken into account in order to tel his story in order to get the message across major gives us both what we want and dont wanthis decisior to do so is the artists prerogative anc his energyvision is involved in the tell in a of truths what would have been the significance of john coltrane for example if he had giver the people the music they would have preferred to hear it is my guess that clarence major sees beyond this novel to the real needs of the black community as those needs can be expressed and illustrated through fiction soul brother eli bolton represents the living problem of apathy and as both a wanderer of the psyche and a sexual waystation his initial steps toward selftransformation were inevitable and justify his honesty ron welburn
if leroi jones and other black artists hadnt already impressed me with the necessity of ignoring fire hydrants i could possibly be disturbed by mr john hicks novel the long whip david mckay  fortunately jones admonition that black people should avoidthe ludicrous posture of attempting to communicate with fire hydrants ie people  whites generally  whose consciousness is equivalent to that of a fire hydrant conditioned my reaction to a book that blatantly utilizes the most hackneyed and offensive stereotypes of black people once you are convinced of the essential insanity of trying to converse with fire hydrants then it is impossible to be disturbed over a book written by one in fact the only possible reason i can see for reviewing this book at all is to document the fact that writers like hicks still exist that they are still being published and read and that white writers in america are still trying to market what they do not believe in and what they usually cannot understandthe complex humanity of the black man perhaps simply knowing the truth about american white literary traditions is in itself a form of liberation the story covers the short life of a black slave ridiculously named ben franklin from the time he is sold to a white master in new orleans until he dies fighting for his rights as a freedman during reconstruction one would have to look back to the novels of white southern unrealists like thomas dixon and thomas nelson page to find a more repugnant picture of black slaves than hicks has created in the long whip william styrons portrayal of nat turner another dehumanized myth from the decay of white fantasy seems by comparison positively innocent and wellintentioned because of its basic insincerity the book never rises to the level of art so there is no need to be sidetracked by such aesthetic considerations as technique or style or to be overly concerned with the artistic merits of this book it is first of all poorly  constructed events follow one another with as little motivation and as little relationship as you are likely to find in items on a grocery list secondly the only theme the author remembers to develop with any consistency is the idea that bens freedom is somehow tied up with his subconscious desire for a white woman that he must conquer this inner repressed urge before he will be totally free since this theme crops up two or three times in the novel which is at least once more than any other idea i assume it must have some sort of importance what passes for characterization in the long whip is intentionally crude and vulgar every conceivable and banal black stereotype squatting in the degenerate imagination of mr hicks is displayed here there is odette the young beautiful mulatto slave girl whom ben falls in love with her sole purpose in life is to solicit a wealthy white patron to set her up in style in the french quarter from time to time from whichever white mans bedroom she is currently occupying she is permitted to mutter a few lines of coarse dialogue  you like odette she purred  that good huh   you lie still odette show you more   big man you good  so good  pp    other than some lecherous remarks to ben about the size of his genitals and a series of barbaric nativestyle guttural laughs that is practically all that odette the major black female character is allowed to say or think or feel justine the faithful old slave woman who loves her master and his family too much to leave them is another favorite white myth that appears after she is given her freedom she makes the typical tearful and loyal pronouncement law mars legrand ifn ya jus let me stay right here ahll be the happies nigger live  p  now in all probability there were such sentiments voiced by some old slaves but judging from white writers attachment to and need for the faithful darky there were probably considerably fewer than we have been encouraged to believe besides whites have never been able to tell when a niggers pissed oftuntil after the riot etienne legrand or mars legrand as he is affectionately called by his niggers is a conspicuous mouthpiece for hicks himself a liberalsupposedly out of time and place in the slave southhe makes several noble and contrived speeches for example trying to explain the subtleties of freedom to ben he says  i have never really approved of the institution of slavery ben i have slaves because it is an economic necessity but in any conflict i will be forced to take sides against the north because this is my home because i believe in another freedomthe right of each sovereign state to determine its own course    do you understand me ben  p  aside from the most obvious obje tion that no one talks this way oul side of political treaties and seconj rate novels hicks use of legrarl as a straw man for his own prop gandu is a cheap trick that an un talented writer cannot carry off i as the mythical white souther hero legrand is as magnificent i death as in life to ben it seen impossible that there was no longj an etienne legrand and he castl gates himself for not being there tl save his master his final commenl he had been a good man    i a good white man p  i as one of the critics of styrons bool has pointed out the idea of a blacl slave an intelligent and tragic figurj differentiating among his oppressor as though he believes tyranny can bl rated on a scale from high to lovl is psychologically inconsistent likl dividing blacks into good niggers and bad niggers you have to juggll the whole apparatus to make the rig answer come out i but even hicks attempts at jugl gling are clumsy and obvious thl black manwhite woman theme il suddenly resurrected near the end o the novel and as expected ben il forced to deal with what hicks coni siders the big question in his lifei not land or power or equalitybu where the hells mah white womai tserew p  the opportunity presents itself but ben is terrified of the woman blindingly white body  a phenom enon completely beyond my compre hension and experience and is un able to score victory number one instead he bursts out of the room with the sound of her laughter following him falls against a lamppost outside and vomits which is what the reader is tempted to do at this point as if this scene were not the ultimate distortion of ben franklin hicks leaves him meditating in profound concern over his blackness  she made him feel so damned    what was the word black that was it black the new thought hit him with a physical force black hed never actually thought of himself as being black  p  hickss mama couldnt sound less like a black slave all of his life ben franklin has been a piece of property bought and sold at the highest price he is a soldier in the branch of the army called officially the nigger regiment and hicks has him discovering his blackness as though he were edward brooke trying to integrate hyannis port the idea is as patently absurd as the rest of the book the long whip is in a sense a testimony that such a book is possible in twentiethcentury america bearing as it does an identical resemblance to the racist fiction of the th and th centuries is a genuine testimony to the unchanging nature of this country this will come as no shock to anyone who has been listening carefully to black critics for the last  years langston hughes j saunders redding william stanley braithwaiteto name only a fewhave been condemning the traditions in america literature which exploit and degrade the image of black people a writer like john hicks who presents the black man as an oversexed simpleminded bewildered victim of society hung up over the sexual threat of the white woman pronounces judgment upon himself and his own artistic integrity moronically he consigns himself to a level of inferiority and mediocrity where he can really do very little harm
much of the history taught in our schools is false history a history of lies omissions and distortions in reading it you get the impression that there were almost no black men in america that they did not play an important part in its development that slavery was a benign institution that slaves were contented with their condition and that black people generally were satisfied with their status deceived by this false history people are astonished and bewildered when our cities are burned and attribute  the burning to the agitation of communistinspired agents if watts newark detroit and chicago havent dispelled those delusions then perhaps this book will do so pioneers in protest johnson  by lerone bennett jr senior editor of ebony magazine who is at the institute of the black world tells of fighters for black liberation both black and white from crispus attucks who led boston mobs against british soldiers to w e b du bois brilliant scholar who died in ghana in  as a member of the communist party and a ghanaian citizen it is written for the layman with an index but with no footnotes and no bibliography beside wellknown leaders like du bois harriet tubman sojourner truth and frederick douglass lerone bennett writes of those not so well known and of those whom history has passed by or stamped with obloquy like marcus garvey father of african nationalism nat turner leader of a slave revolt and james monroe trotter an early black nationalist mr bennett points out that the american revolution was never finished and he tells of the efforts of black men to carry it to completion he tells how benjamin banneker wrote to thomas jefferson cooling from the revolutionary fire of his youth for help against growing discrimination against blacks this lack of completion led to nat turners revolt and mr benneit points out that what a nation sows it reaps he says that slavery was an original act of violence then its violence was internalized in the slaves who were violent toward each other then violent toward their masters who in turn reacted with violence to the slaves closing the circuit of violence mr bennett writes of white lead   ers whom historians have maligned because of their sympathy for blacks john brown who some have called a fanatic saw clearly that slavery was an act of war and reacted to it with violence thaddeus stevens and charles sumner leaders of congress during reconstruction tried hard to construct a just and equal society in the south stevens said how can republican institutions free schools free churches free social intercourse exist in a mingled community of nabobs and serfs    their efforts were defeated and we are reaping today what was sown when their plans were thwarted among the less wellknown blacks mr bennett includes are henry highland garnet who appealed to the slaves to start a general strike and to revolt and david walker whose appeal to the coloured citizens of the world anticipated frantz fanon mr bennetts portrait of nat turner is very different from that drawn by william styron he ascribes to turner strong and close family ties an identification with the blacks and a grim resolve to end slavery because of its inclusion of less wellknown persons this book will be a useful addition to schools and libraries 
lee effectively constructs extended runon phrases into a myriad of thought the total idea is expressed by letters that become words and contractions correspond tonally to the diction of black speakers these mark lees style in the graphic sense the technique is not an innovation of course the umbra poets leroi jones and norman pritchard have utilized it successfully since early in the decade lee is not doing his thing as imitation or emulation but to express his distinct voice as a poet of the black revolution the thrust of contemporary black poetry is both calvin herntons fist beating against the ear and lerois machine gun and while it is destroying images which are no longer useful it is creating new ones relative to the lives of oppressed peoples don lees poetry subscribes to this standard that life in america is already absurd is no secret to lee but the absurdity is of the grotesque inhumanity of the unpeople not the configuration of their existential limitations lee is thematically unpretentious straightforward and sarcastic he is not burdened by the kind of ironic vision that plagues white existentialist poets these poets carry an apathy across their backs like the weight of dead stone they think they see too much of the universe and that universe is incomprehensible to their sensibilities their confessional poetry reeks of death wishes simply because they had attempted to conquer something larger than themselves the poor devils cannot embrace it as to labor a point cited by miss brooks who indicated that don l lee would never subscribe to what jascha kessler mentioned as a longing for death which typifies american white poets it should be further made clear that lee has a rendezvous with life as dont cry scream is his third projection of the sounds of black lifelife sounds only the spiritually alienated cry and see death as the most meaningful escapehatch race toward it like it is their lover and crying leads to that feeling we have experienced known as the blues to this the young chicago poet would respond we aint blue we is black yet kessler who would be totally outside the poetic conceptions of the black aesthetic would insist which is a reflection on the spiritual emptiness which the black american found himself being sucked into hence black death is subjective but hardly private and quite unique the white academicians understanding of white deaths is shallow they are lonely all of them poems like lees nigerian unityor little niggers killing little niggers can only appeal to the loneliness of nonblacks meanwhile assassination speaks of the response to the shooting of rev king they came running  as if the king was going to fire back this kind of dying for black men has been standard and unique all this is to say that lees poetry screams for us to
the general editor of any publishing company should rightfully be expected to print a volume of his own writings such has dudley randall done on broadside press and quite unselfishly limiting himself to a book of twelve poems of an impressive quality cities burning  is a first book by the detroit editorpoetlibrarian who has coauthored poem counterpoem with margaret danner and coedited the popular collection for malcolm with margaret burroughs randall possesses a firm sense of the lyric and cities burning is more appropriately a book of songs or psalms than a rugged razoredged batch of poetry that might correspond to the title of the collection itself the lyrical tone dominates throughout it is so strong that the poem ballad of birmingham is one example of the kind of randall piece that has been set to music randall is a contemporary of gwendolyn brooks and so not in the new school of black poets but all schools aside his is a keen functional awareness of what black poetry has been and remains and there is no hint of an alienation from the ethos being developed by the new stylists in theme and passion black poetry has always had its own thing going in sound sense imagery metaphor and content and there are many different styles or ways of doing the thingtry as he might any poet endowed with a sense of music cannot easily escape it for it is a natural asset no poets in america serve in such a priestly capacity as do black poets priests musicians deacons chanters hail dionysus analysands and augury for an infant are similar evocations each poem in this collection depicts some aspect of the terror the decay the pleasures and the hopes that affect life in cities the persona of dionysus watches with praise the work of the god of frenzy and release the melting pot and a different image offset each other with the selfacceptance after racial rejection to the more definite and enduring recognition of an artifact which defines and exemplifies heritage the final augury affirms a belief in the infants potential and in context to the rest of the book reaffirms a new conception of the moral fiber of cities randall has brought to this first volume a good heart ear and eye for sensitive observation all which enhance his lyricism young black poets who read him should be influenced by him to some degree for his voice alone is infectious moreso he is contributing something to black literature that has a lasting value cities burning unfortunately does not include most of the work he has done for a long period of years still it will endure as a piece of sculpture endures with a proud sereneand classic bronze of benin black readers will respect these statements by dudley randall as near monuments along the way toward the liberation of black poetics
