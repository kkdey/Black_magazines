on the occasion commemorating the twenu tyseventh anniversary  of the abolition of slavery frederick douglass unleashed his unparalleled eloquence over the issue of race pride among black people he uncompromisingly denounced any and every attempt directed towards promoting race pride contending that a people cannot be proud of its race or color since it has neither the choice nor the power to be what it is he strongly preached doing away with this supercilious nonsense for him only achievement should give reason for pride if black people were to be proud let it be because we have had some agency in producing that of which we can properly be proud indeed he was proud of his own achievement not because i am a colored man but because i am a man and because color is a misfortune and is treated as a crime by the american people frederick douglass of course remains one of the great heroes in black history and rightly so yet it seems to me that in criticizing the advocates of race pride among black people in incidentally almost exactly the same terms as the critics of todays wave of race pride douglass overlooked certain fundamentals needed for a people to achieve certain goals in life in so doing he authored an oversight which in fact made him selfcontradictory ie he denounced race pride while upholding achievement pride is pride of a people not directly related to the level of achievement of that people what douglass and his fellow critics then and now seem to have forgotten is the essence of the black mans fight namely to repudiate not only the lies that the whites have said about him but also to recreate old truths these lies include  that black man was is not civilized  that the black man was is a savage  that the black man was is lazy  etc etcd all these lies of course directed their authors to the killing conclusion that the black man is inferior more than advancing these lies the whites believed them and unbelievable and sad as it is the black man believed these lies about himself having been thus convinced the black mans ambition for achievement became squelched for how can inferiors be positive activists and achievers of great wonderssocial political economic technological and otherwise inferiors generally spend a large share of their time being ashamed of their life and their origin one of the most debasing facts about slavery is the fact that it sought with all the vigor at its command to strip the black man of his pride and confidence as a person and as a people this was of course a conscious design of slavery as an institution the fact is  unless a man is decisively stripped of these fundamental human qualities that is selfconfidence and pride attempts to make him a slave become fruitless he will continue to assert himself as a man and will not voluntarily submit to any degradation slave masters were well schooled in these facts and took all necessary measures to make the slave look negatively on his past and thus lose all selfpride and confidence the ultimate result was that the slave ended up loving his oppressor rather than hating him alexis de tocqueville in his perceptive study democracy in america observed that the negro in america preoccupies himself with making    a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate himself among men who repulse him he conforms to the taste of his oppressors adopts their opinions and hopes by imitating them to form a part of their community having been told from infancy that his race is naturally inferior to that of the whites he assents to the proposition and is ashamed of his own nature in each of his features he discovers a trace of slavery and if it were in his power he would rid himself of everything that makes him what he is such is the result of what i call the negrofication process as created by institutional slavery it ought to be clear to even the most elementary sociopsychologist that a man whose whole life is manifested through imitational behavior devotes a large share of his time not in the exercise of creative initiative but in observing the behavior of those he emulates this is a fundamental difference that must be recognized between whites and negroes the first order of business was is therefore to set the record straight top items on the black mans agenda must not only include the need to repudiate the white mans lies about himlies whose roots have grown so deep with years that they now sound like truthsbut also the need to inculcate in the black man a viable sense of selfrespect unless and until this selfrespect selfpride is in his whole soul no man can expect to realize achievement of any great magnitude authentic behavior must replace imitational behavior as a prerequisite to any real political achievement among and by the blacks race pride must underlie black political thought for the most part all it takes is taking what has been said of him and turning it around rather than speaking disparagingly of his land of origin he must seek to create a positive picture of africa acknowledge its greatness past and present and welcome any connection with it he must learn to support his african brethren in his hour of need such as in rhodesia south africa angola and mozambique if this avenue of mutual support were earnestly pursued blacks could create one of the most viable international political machineries ever known it would take only a matter of days for rhodesia to tumble and from its ashes a zimbabwe to be reborn south africa would begin to accept not only a black mans heart in order to save the life of a  white racist but also would begin to transplant the whole black mans life in that country into its politicaleconomic mainstream but such functional political activity cannot come to pass until the black man starts taking a positive view of his whole life and creates a sense of pride for what he is the black man must look beyond the economic advantages that have been afforded him by chance or design mostly by chance for as edward w blyden a great black political activist of the th century observed such economic advantages have accrued at the expense of his manhood he continued we have been dragged into depths of degradation we have been taught a cringing servility we have been drilled into contentment with the most undignified circumstances our finer sensibilities have been blunted there has been almost utter extinction of all that delicacy of feeling and sentiment which adorns character a number of questions must be asked of those of us who are committed to the creation of race pride what is the nature of commitment how is it to be realized is the current wave of nationalism sweeping across ghettoville usa or across the world for that matter just one more peak in the black mans history or is it here to stay this last question is being asked in view of the fact that black his tory is replete with occasions and figures closely resembling those of todays movement stokely carmichael during the meredith trial in  started chanting we want black_power that chant left nobody black or white indeed no institution untouched edward blyden at the close of the th century demanded some african power of course both carmichael and blyden meant the same thing namely the type of black or african power where our physical pecuniary and intellectual strength may be collected like brother imari biyden was demanding some spot whence such an influence may go forth in behalf of the race as shall be felt by the nations we are now so scattered and divided that we can do nothing in order to bring the scattered and divided black people together both blyden and carmichael recognized the need to create race pride among them for no people ashamed of themselves like to voluntarily get together they realized as did others that no viable political social and economic institutions could be established until the people come together and people would not come together unless there was some race pride the widespread apathy that benights the black belt of america should be attributed not so much to the lack of political education as to the negative selfimage that is prevalent in these communities one of the reasons why the black man has experienced political frustration is that he has operated not from a positive but rather from a negative selfimage base for the most part his whole participation in the political life has been executed via paternalistic guidance bv whites to be sure the black man has made some substantive demands on the political system but the type of compromise or concession that followed such demands were carefully designed into control gimmicks this only engineered more frustration this is a liability to the nation itself what is needed therefore is a call to attitudinal revolutionand that is what it isrevolution without this revolution this race pride the black manwherever he may bewill continue to be prey to the sociopolitical and economic systems of the day while institutional slavery may have disappeared its mark lingers on it is our duty in the words of alexander crummell to cast off its graveclothes and resist its deadly influences this will not only reverse the rule of the black mans political life that is taxation without representation but will create an undying love for our people and as dr w e b du bois noted will substantially reduce the degree of lawlessness and crime among our people by our people if as a nation we must seek ye first the political kingdom as per kwame nkrumahs dictum we must as a people seek a revolution in our attitudes towards each other
i would like first to  make some assertions g about what negritude s is not this prelimi nary dogmatism is required by the recklessness and abandon with which the word now falls from lipsboth thick and thin negritude is not simply anything black and it is certainly not everything black negritude is not wearing turbans and fezzes though these may be quite alluring it is not tearing up ads for palmers skin whitener it is not abandoning madame walker in africa where negritude is surely present white paint has been used for ritual and cosmetic purposes since the time when the sahara was a land of lush vegetation in africa today from dakar to kinshasa barefoot ladies do not scorn the adornment of wigs imported from paris negritude is not posturing or agitation but reflection not a code but a principle not therapy for the bemused but a modality for the thinking man the word itself which does not come trippingly from the anglosaxonized tongue is a gallic creation it was first employed by aime cesaire the martinican poet in  in the poem cahier dun retour au pays natal which we shall translate as notebook of a return visit to my native land here is the passage in french and then in my translation he is describing the geographical position of his native land with guadeloupe above it as well as    haiti ou la negritude se mit debout pour la premiere fois et dit quelle croyait a son humanite       haiti where negritude rises to its feet for the first time and says that it has believed in its own humanity    to deal with this striking neologism of  we have to go back in time and extend our gaze from harlem to the left bank of the seine in paris paris is a city of manifestos literary historians recall the romantic and symbolist documents political historians think of those of the revolution and the commune in  almost unnoticed there appeared a review entitled legitime defense legitimate defense edited by martinican students it too was a manifesto and in the unfolding of time the movement which it articulated was to become the concern both of literary and political history specifically legitime defense demanded a new west indian poetry which would no longer reflect the french tradition  years antecedent but which would respond to the present need of west indian man this significant paragraph occurs in that manifestoi translate the wind which rises from black america will we hope quickly clean our west indies of the abortive fruit of a decayed culture langston hughes and claude mckay the two revolutionary black poets have brought us steeped in red wine the african love of life the african joy in love the african dream of death and already young haitian poets deliver to us lines swollen with a future dynamism we quickly perceive that legitime defense drew nutriment from the harlem renaissance and from the indigenist movement in haiti and i must next speak of these if any single name other than that of langston hughes should evoke for us the mind and spirit of the harlem renaissance it is that of alain leroy locke he was in the words of langston hughes the granddaddy of the movement in  dr locke edited the classic anthology the new negro which should be required readings for todays neoafricanophiles here in  rich profusion was revealed an intensity of thought and feeling which came as a revelation to america and indeed to the western world in the twenties dr locke looked with considerable insight to the african origins of americas black population and defined a cultural strategy which i have called ancestralism locke had long been a friend of w e b du bois and shared completely with the older man a concern with panafricanism they were repeatedly cultural collaborators i had the privilege of knowing dr locke during the last  years of his life and can attest to the fervor with which he tended the flame of afroamerican cultural expression this is an appropriate moment in history to ask ourselves what the significance of the harlem renaissance was to study and appraise it brings forcibly to our mind the fact that much now being hailed as new in the analysis of the afroamerican experience has been known and expressed already this is not to deny credit and commendation to recent spokesmen who have expanded their energies on the killing ground but i feel strongly that young black americans would profit mightily from pondering the maxim those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it the message of the harlem renaissance was wafted across the caribbean to haiti the story has been told with scholarly elegance by professor naomi garrett and i will but sketch the background in  the united states occupied the republicthe uniquely black republicof haiti this was part of a pattern of american imperialism which in the name of fiscal responsibility and civic order included the occupation of nicaragua and the dominican republic as well as frequent flexing of muscles in other middle american states it is appropriate to mention in explanation rather than in defense that north american ideas of fiscal responsibility and civic order were honored in the breach rather than in the observance by the motley crew of multicolored middle american governments for the haitian bourgeosie the american occupation was a traumatic experience until these latter years a fundamental praxis of american imperialism was that when darker peoples were to be dealt with it was prudent to send southerners to do the dealing in the light of their long experience in such matters there was an enlightened public opinion in the us which deplored and condemned the fact and the fashion of the american occupation in haiti almost from the beginning yet as late as   years after the occupation began american authorities could still be so crass and stupid as to decree that the students in the lycees of haiti abandon their classical studies and study agriculture down with bossuet up with burbank luther to be sure i have often speculated on this strange timing did it take that long for the occupying administration to learn what the haitians were doing in those lycees or was it only possible for them to turn to the problems of secondary education then because it had required more than a decade to restore fiscal responsibility and civic order the generation of haitian intellectuals and writers who came to maturity in this period of their nations history entertained certain misgivings about the civilization western civilizationwhich gave birth to the louts who possessing no apparent culturein the older sense of that wordcould nevertheless entertain no serious doubt of their own superiority to the haitians the reaction was to produce in the latter half of the s and the early s a number of poets and writers who sought a special significance in their african heritage not directly connected with this school of poets but honored by them working apart and continuing a quest he had begun in the s was that remarkable haitian man of letters jean pricemars at last report he was still working a fact that those of us who saw him as ambassador to paris in his eighties can find readily believable he is the creator of haitianism the haitian school of ethnology and with du bois and locke one of the three tutelary geniuses of negritude legitime defense which has led us to harlem and to haiti had a single issue that was sufficient to sustain a climate of opinion two years later in  a journal fated to have a longer life appeared letudiant noir the black student here in one endeavor were grouped students from africa as well as the west indies three personalities of the first rank still active still controversial emerge from the team of letudiant noir the veritable fathers of negritude leopold sedar senghor then a student from the french colony of senegal now president of independent senegal and a major french poet aime cesaire then a student from martinique now mayor of fortdefrance deputy to the french assembly poet and playwright in the grand tradition leon damas then a student from french guyana which he later represented in the assembly now a unesco expert and cultural historian here at the origin of negritude we are faced with the essential paradox of the concept and the source of its difficulty particularly for the anglosaxon mind for we have three french intellectuals descendents of descartes and vol taire and children of the concept of liberty fraternity and equality the revolutionary heritagewho through their own experience and even more through the contemplation of the plight of their fellow and lessfavored colonial brethren could find profound disparities in what they knew and in what they felt in their gallicism if i may risk a coarse metaphor i would say that negritude springs at least circumstantially from a view of the backside of french civilization i might raise the tone if i adapt the fashionable jargon of the day and say that the elaboration of the idea of negritude was motivated by black consciousnessspecifically that of senghor dumas and cesaire in france some uptodate people might call it a syndrome rather than an idea but let us abandon the jargon which facilitates and obscures and return to our young men in their dingy paris lodgings they were intellectuals they were colonials they were black they were however from different sides of the ocean please take note of my ethnocentrism when i say oceani mean the atlantic the cultural contrasts of their origins were striking senghor had been born in a senegalese village and spoke only serer until he went to school cesaire had been born in the slums of fortdefrance a tropical provincial french town in many ways and his first tongue was almost certainly a city dialect of creole a language the linguists are still trying to classify damas was a bourgeois from an overseas provincial town but were the cultural contrasts of their infancy and early childhood as profound as they seemed to the casual observeror even to the trained sociologist they came to doubt this and out of this doubt intellectual doubt i hasten to addcame the formulation of negritude for our young men were aware of a kind of fellow feeling a kinship that lay beneath and beyond their immediate origins and certainly a great distance from that which they shared as french university students a kinship which could only be accounted for by some other agency or force there were three possible explanations it arose from temperament from race or from culture but if so from a kind of level of culture not hitherto recognized a literary critic with a psychoanalytic bent would probably not find too great a consonance of temperament in these three men and it was certainly not that race then surely it is the classic european position that race counts and tells in the nineteenth century matthew arnold the highest type of wellbred english intelligence could expatiate loudly and long on the celtic race and show the ineradicable difference between it and the germanic english race while arnold never said the celts were inferior that is what his english readers understood and i think that is probably what his celtic readers understood alsoand did not agree with however in the early thirties despite the great triumph that political racism was enjoying in germany the scientific community was entering a casenotproven plea our young men were then left with the culturehypothesis and negritude i emphasize is a doctrine of cultural and not of racial unity of course there is another possibility which would occur to cynics and skepticsnamely that the fellowfeeling the kinship which they felt impelled to explain did not in reality exist but might have been a product of their imaginings quickened by too little good french food and too much bad vin ordinaire in the fashion of all lordly expositors of difficult subjects i shall dismiss this thesis as trivial the notion of there being a sufficiently broad base of african culture to speak of it as a unifying or at any rate identifyingfactor found in black populations in africa in the west indies and in the american continents we sometimes forget there are two is staggering to most people but it staggers them in different directions absurd say some perfectly obvious say others i would like to suggest however that the whole pattern of recent research concerning what is assimilated during the first years of life will shortly lead us to distinguish between deep culture and broad culture and see that negritudeas defined by its founders is a phenomenon of deep culture frances war ordeal saw the end of letudiant noir negritude like so many other aspects of french life went into the resistance it was nurtured during this period by the climate of existentialist thought jeanpaul sartre was to bring to the theoreticians of negritude a formidable support in his analysis and rebuttal of french bourgeois intellectualism following the war grouped around alioune diop of senegal there appeared the group who brought out in december of  the journal presence africaine it appeared simultaneously in paris and dakar it carried the best wishes and congratulations of leading french intellectuals such as andre gide sartre michel leiris and georges balandier the names of senghor cesaire and richard wright also appear in the first issue presence africaine rapidly assumed a unique place in the intellectual and cultural spectrum of france and the world it developed a publishing house whose total inventory is now numbered in the hundreds its first volume was bantu philosophy by the belgian priest r p tempels later defrocked for his views the journal established the society of african culture which in turn organized under the presidency of pricemars two congresses of black writers and artists one in  in paris and a second in rome in  it was this same society of african culture which in  organized the first world festival of negro arts held at dakar under the patronage of senghor i had the pleasure of attending that event and will say a few words about it the festival brought to dakar during the month of april  sages and scholars artists and dilletantes journalists and jobhunters and some folks who just plain came some came for the party and some for the pilgrimage some were looking for laughs and some for the vision splendid but there they were splendid and resplendent in the hues of the sun and of the rainbow and it was a joy to see some were disappointed some dismayed many were exhilarated and not a few strangely gratified by the satisfaction of a certain undefinable ineffable sense of participation in a historic moment for despite all the downgrading all the clamor all the claims and counterclaims something did take place in dakar in dakar there was for the first time anywhere an encounter in the realm of art in the realm of the spirit such as has not taken place before whether one calls it negritude brotherhood or ballyhoo the fact is that black and quasiblack people from all over the worldand naturally enough white folks toogathered together to observe and reflect on the spiritual and artistic achievements of black peoples from all over the world freed of the cumbersome sociopoliticoeconomic contexts in which these are habitually viewed and the result was the affirmation of a cultural heritage long despised long deprecated long deplored what are the implications of the concept of negritudeof a uniquely black african cultural heritage for scholarship i will give you an anecdote in response to this query when i mentioned to one of the leading american authorities on african art that i was coediting with a colleague an anthology of essays and studies on negritude she expressed to me the reservations that she and her close collaborator the leading british specialist on african art had as to the usefulness of this concept quite recently when she was visiting me after having read the anthology through from cover to cover she expressed the view that it was a very useful thing to have done in a discussion concerning african art which ensued she was talking about the great variety of idiom to be found in african art  then she said if however one takes any number of african pieces and mixes them with other apparently similar examples of tribal art from other parts of the world you can immediately separate the african pieces theirs is a world apart they are distinguished by their theirshe searched for a word caught my eye capitulated by their negritude this expert has been a student of african art for over  years and had never needed the word until that moment or to be exact had needed it but had not used it until then when its significance came to to her suddenly like a spiritual illumination much of the nonsense that generations of western scholars have written about black people might have been avoided had the concept of negritude been articulated and understood earlier on the other hand much nonsense is still being engendered and subsidized in ignorance of the concept and not only by whites dangers lie in the other directionchiefly as a result of the industry and energy of the ignorant it has been truly said that nothing is more terrifying than ignorance in action no useful purpose is served by perverting a useful concept of culture into a mystique a counterracism this course has in fact been consciously and conscientiously urged by some but its usefulness i question its morality i execrate the dialectical view which holds that negritude is a necessary antithesis to white supremacy superiority and dominationto blanchitude if you willis worthy of support for the phenomenon viewed thus from a hegelian point of view leads toward the higher synthesis of universalism an urgent goal if we are all to avoid being atomicized but dialects and mysticism apart on the simple and scientifically definable terrain of culture we can state that negritude the notion of a consistent and historically valid nexus of black african values is of irreplaceable value in the continuing task of understanding societies in which persons of african descent are to be found
the moslem middle v f i a f east is strategically   £ laid out to form a natgl ural link between africa asja and europe the area forms a bridge between two oceanic areasthe atlantic and its tributaries and the indian ocean and its persian gulf and red sea offshoots the area is generally but not universally understood to include lebanon syria jordan iraq iran saudi arabia the yemen kuwait turkey and more recently the greater part of north africa in comparison to the history of western europe the history of the middle east goes back over  years one of the most conspicuous facts about the area is that each of the countries consists of an astounding mosaic of people the mosaic consists of multitudinous details an old bearded man in a white turban will pierce the cold hours before sunrise with the cry prayer is better than sleep a jet streaks overhead as veiled women wash clothes in a nearby stream located near a wide boulevard crowded with the latest model european cars in the bazaar there is the hum of voices transacting the business of the day in government offices bright young men conduct national and international affairs over steaming cups of tea in baghdad one will find black arabs in responsible positions at every turn there are also in this vast geographical area assyrians kurds turks persians bedouins and an assortment of other people whose blood has been mixed with the black african to describe the people and civilization of the middle east is as formidable a task as it is to describe all of the various people and their cultures on the continent of africa however the people including the black persians as well as the blond turks share one common element in life they are all members of the moslem brotherhood the black followers of islam in the middle east are certainly in the minority but they share a dignity and knowledge of self difficult for most westerners to understand indeed many westerners think it is only the reedy quartertone of the music of the area that serves as the unifying thread between the tall black egyptian and the short smallboned syrian the mystique is much deeper than this black people came to the middle east by three routes i from the sudan and surrounding areas to north africa over the sahara desert  down the nile and  across the indian ocean andor red sea by ship the early followers of muhammad who were traders caravanmen and sailors penetrated the vast area below the sahara the traders were seeking new and expanded trade opportunities the great armies of islam were in search of new converts and extended their conversion to africa but also they carried islam to southwestern europe and as far east as borneo those unwilling  to accept islam were enslaved and treated as infidels as one would guess the slaves captured by the armies of islam included all hues black men from africa mongoloids from central asia and white men from southern europe  it is unfortunate to have to use the term slave because servitude in islam carried no social inferiority there was no distinction made between sons of women who happened to have been slaves as we will see later and a father who was free and of the aristocracy whereas the majority of black people found in the middle east were brought or came under the influence of islam there is some evidence that there were blacks in persia before the iranians came at least two authorities have indicated that in the persian province of khuzistan which is located on the persian gulf the aborigines were blacks according to two frenchmen dieulafoy and de morgan the people of the susian plain were negroes of distinction herodotus even observed that these men were in no way different in appearance from the other ethiopians    then there is the other historical evidence that appears on most ancient basreliefs figures of negroes are seen frequently one traveler brigadier general percy sykes reported in his writings that the whole population of bashakird and sarhad were a puzzle and that possibly the whole area extending from the northern shores of the persian gulf to india was made up of black people at one time ttie greeks in their mythology no doubt recognized the fact that blacks occupied this part of persia they describe darkskinned memnon who came to the aid of troy as the offspring of aurora a white mountain woman and of tithonus the ethiopian god memnon the ethiopian prince as the legend goes leads in battle an army of susians of the persian lowlands and ethiopians today in this same area of persia the visitor will find black people in just about every town and hamlet in  the mother of the year in khuzistan province was a negro it is generally known that many of irans outstanding families from the persian gulf region can trace their negro ancestry in tehran today some of the descendants of negroes hold minor positions in government offices and some have their own small businesses in kuwait the negro has historically been a part of the development of that oil wealthy country there are cases where sudanese have become kuwaiti nationals and have moved into high government posts the minister of fisheries be ing a good example of acceptance of a black but a moslem who happened to be black the harathins can still be found in the oases of the sahara in the fetid tihama which is the coastal plain of yemen and in the sweltering valley of hadramut in the hadramut one finds a mixture of african arab and mongoloid many of the handramuti traders have brought javanese and malayan wives back from the east indies to add further to the mixture of races in this part of the middle east the arrival of the moslem missionaries in africa did not receive a ready audience for many years there were unsuccessful attempts to convert africans below the sahara eventually africans realized that accepting islam provided a social and political communion as well as protection and assistance from the atlantic to the china wall it is significant to note that the reason these missionaries probably were so readily accepted was because missionaries of islam accepted their black converts as equals and as part of the moslem brotherhood from the very first utterance of acceptance of allah as their god no doubt this rapid conversion when it began was advanced by the absence of any feeling of repulsion towards black men as often is the case in white christianity although the koran forbade the enslavement of a moslem it did not guarantee him freedom if he embraced islam after enslavement however the liberation of slaves was considered a meritorious act in the sight of god there are many cases where slaves rose to very high positions of trust after embracing islam this explains why slaves were often taken because they were capable of education and responsibility if it were felt that a person was not capable of being a moslem he was killed or condemned to a life of servitude blacks who were formerly prisoners of war captured in raids on villages or were bought on the open slave market later went on to make significant contributions in war science art and literature indeed the contributions of black men in the middle east is a brilliant chapter in an exciting history there were blacks who came to the middle east as hired guards for the caravans that plied the trade routes from china to persia to timbuctu the blacks were fierce fighters and protected the caravans carrying goods from maurauding nomadic tribal raiders wealthy sultans in all of islam were eager to have black men in their private armies many of these soldiers were from the sudan and abyssinia in the conquering armies of the turks many of the leading officers were blacks some of whom were generals the turks rewarded these leaders by making them governors of provinces of the territories captured the bukharis or black cavalry units served as the core of an army these troops were usually quartered outside the palace and were popular among the local women by mixing with white women the bukharis gradually became lighter in skin color nevertheless they always took great pride in their african ancestry and liked to boast about the amount of african blood in their veins the use of these gallant soldiers decreased when european drill masters and officers were hired in the armies during the middle of the nineteenth century militarily another group of highly prized black men were the iron workers that is the blacksmiths gunsmiths and sword makers who traveled with the military forces to the military the smith was a vital member of the company it was known that without wellshod horses and the very best of fighting equipment battles could be lost quite often a family of these highly skilled smiths was attached to royal families and remained with them for generations in harems from marrakesh to istanbul blacks played important roles true many of them were eunuchs as was the custom they nevertheless were influential and highly respected besides being used to guard the chastity of the sultans wives and concubines the black eunuch often served as chief of protocol in the guest house the visitor did well to keep in the good graces with this very important member of the sultans personal staff the extent of the blacks knowledge of political intrigue within the sultans court was highly respected and often the strength of a ruler rested in the competence of his black adviser the sultans son usually received his advice from a black companion who was referred to as brother on matters of love feuds and intrigues the highest positions were reserved for the black member of the sultans court as an example traditionally for many years the holy city medina was governed by one of the leading blacks from a sultans court there are many examples in turkey persia and iraq where influential blacks married into families of lesser nobility than that of sultan and were absorbed after several generations there were cases where a loyal servant was rewarded with the most attractive woman from a harem if he could afford an additional wife he married her to turn the other side of the coin black women were much sought after in the harems and by the ordinary arab it was usually the woman from abyssinia who was more esteemed than any others her child was often the favorite among the other children of the father because of the childs ethiopian blood ali one of the sons of sultan hason of shiraz in persia was the son of an ethiopian mother when his father died he had disputes with his brothers finally left home and ended up in zanzibar where he established a colony sir thomas gibb points out that many of the abbasid caliphs of baghdad were born of black women ibrahim brother of harun alrahid was the son of a black woman ibrahim captured baghdad and named himself caliph he retained this position until forced out of it by almamun  the royal princes of the wadai in the sudan who began their reign around  claim to be descendants of the abbasids beginning with the fifteenth century and onwards some of the ottoman sultans were offsprings of black women who were part of harems in fact many of the dynasties of monarchs who had black mothers or grandmothers were in power for several hundred years however there was never any stigma attached to this fact of parentage many of the intellectuals or men of the pen were blacks they were active as professors at mosque colleges administered and expounded islamic law from the very earliest times moslem jurists were forced to pay attention to the variety of problems found among different racial groups there was within the legal system a class of lawyers known as the muftis and many of these scholars were from black africa coming from as far east as the sudan and as far west as kano and mauritania they served in government offices under the mamluk sultans of egypt and were officially appointed to sit in the judicial college called dar eladl each of the chief cities of the empire had its own muftis who had been trained at special colleges too many westerners are mistaken to think that the college mosque of elazhar at cairo is the only institution of the kind undoubtedly it was the most important seat of higher education in the middle east but there were some  smaller mosque colleges in different parts of egypt similar but smaller college mosques were to be found throughout the middle east and moslem africa there was communication between these institutions as well as exchange of professors at elazhar there were  or  professors excluding junior teachers and officials among the professors at this outstanding university were black mathematicians and poets the students came from egypt and africa particularly sudan somalia and the region of the niger these black men of the pen are responsible too for projecting an image of strength and pride in achievement the record of the black man in the middle east is still buried and needs to be unearthed his history in the middle east is perhaps the least known and least studied by black scholars and students the libraries and archives from alexandria and khartoum to tehran are waiting for black scholars to begin writing about this glorious history we must remember that the black world does not end in africa but extends into the middle east we must remember that when a moslem in kuwait says all qawmiyya t he is really saying i know about soul too 
the man best known j r i £ as malcolm_x lived  ii g three distinct and in  terrelated lives under  the respective names malcolm little malcolm_x and elhajj malik elshabazz any honest attempt to understand the total man must begin with some understanding of the significant components that went into his making the racist society that produced and killed malcolm_x is responsible for what he was and for destroying what he could have been he had the greatest leadership potential of any person to emerge directly from the black proletariat in this century in another time under different circumstances he might have been a kingand a good one he might have made a nation and he might have destroyed one he was a creation of the interplay of powerful and conflicting forces in midcentury america no other country or combination of forces could have shaped him the way he was and ultimately destroyed him with such unique ruthlessness malcolm_x knew before he could explain it to himself and others that he was living in a society that was engaged in systematic destruction of his peoples selfrespect his first memories are of conflict in this respect his early life was no different than most black americans where conflict comes early and stays late in his own words when my mother was pregnant with me she told me later a party of hooded ku klux klan riders galloped up to our home in omaha nebraska one night surrounding the house brandishing their shotguns and rifles they shouted for my father to come out my mother went to the front door and opened it standing where they could see her pregnant condition she told them that she was alone with her three small children and that my father was away preaching in milwaukee the klansmen shouted threats and warnings at her that we had better get out of town because the good christian white people were not going to stand for my fathers spreading trouble among the good negroes of omaha with the back to africa preachings of marcus garvey this was how he remembered  his father an ambitious dreamer attempting to maintain himself and his family while bigoted white policemen ku klux klansmen and black legionnaires were determined to teach him to stay in his place the father of malcolm_x was killed while fighting against the restricted place that was assigned to his people in this country much later and in many different ways malcolm_x continued the same fight and was subsequently killed for the same reason every major event in malcolms life brought him into conflict with the society that still thrives on the oppression of his people his mother was born as a result of her mother being raped by a white man in the west indies when he was four the house where he and his family lived was burned down by members of the ku klux klan when he was six his father met a violent death that his family always believed was a lynching after the death of his father who was a follower of the black nationalist marcus garvey his family was broken up and for a number of years he lived in state institutions and boarding homes when he finally went to school he made good marks but lost interest and was a dropout at the age of  he went to live with his sister in boston and went to work at the kinds of jobs available to negro youthmainly the jobs not wanted by white people like shoeshine boy soda jerk hotel busboy member of a dining car crew on trains traveling to new york and a waiter in a harlem night dub from these jobs he found his way into the underworld and thought at the time that his position in life was advancing in the jungle of the underworld where the fiercest survive by fleecing the weak and the defenseless he became a master manipulator skilled in gambling the selling of drugs burglary and hustling a friend who had helped him get his first job gave him the rationale for his actions the main thing you have to remember he was told is that everything in the world is a hustle malcolm returned to boston where he was later arrested for burglary and sentenced to  years in prison the year was  and he was not quite  years old prison was another school for malcolm he now had time to think and plan out of this thinking he underwent a conversion that literally transformed his whole life by letters and visits from his family he was introduced to the black muslim movement which calls itself officially the lostfound nation of islam he tested himself in the discipline of his newly chosen religion by refusing to eat pork the event startled his fellow inmates who had nicknamed him satan he describes the occasion in this manner it was the funniest thingthe reaction and the way that it spread in prison where so little breaks the monotonous routine the smallest thing causes a commotion of talk it was being mentioned all over the cell block by night that satan didnt eat pork it made me very proud in some odd way one of the universal images of the negroin prison and outwas that he couldnt do without pork it made me feel good to see that my not eating it had especially startled the white convicts later i would learn when i had read and studied islam a good deal that unconsciously my first preislamic submission had been manifested i had experienced for the first time the muslim teaching if you take one step toward allahallah with take two steps toward you    my brothers and sisters in detroit and chicago had all become converted to what they were being taught was the natural religion for the black man his description of his process of selfeducation in prison is an indictment of the american educational system and a tribute to his own perseverance in obtaining an education after being poorly prepared in the public schools while in prison he devised his own method of selfeducation and learned how to speak and debate effectively so that he could participate and defend the movement after his release from prison he started by copying words from the dictionary that might be helpful to him beginning with a he went through to z and then he writes for the first time i could pick up a book and actually understand what the book was saying this aspect of his story calls attention to the tremendous reservoirs of talent and even genius locked up in the black ghettos among the masses it also indicates what can be accomplished when the talent of this oppressed group is respected and given hope and a purpose within a few years he was to become a debater with a national reputation he took on politicians college professors journalists and anyone black or white who had the nerve to meet him he was respected by some and feared by others malcolm was released from prison in  when he was  years old for a few weeks he took a job with his oldest brother wilfred as a furniture salesman in detroit he went to chicago before the end of that year to hear and meet the leader of the nation of islam elijah muhammad he was accepted into the movement and given the name malcolm_x he went back to detroit and was made assistant minister of the detroit mosque from this point on his rise in the movement and in the eyes of the public was rapid at the end of  he went to chicago to live with the leader of the nation of islam and to be trained by him personally after organizing a mosque in philadelphia he was sent to head the movement in harlem in  before he was  years old in a few years he was able to transform the black muslim move ment into a national organization and himself into one of the countrys best known personalities as the public spokesman and defender of the movement he literally put it on the map this was the beginning of his trouble with his leader elijah muhammad when the public thought of the black muslim movement they thought first of malcolm_x malcolm_x had appeal far beyond the movement he was one of the most frequent speakers on the nations campuses and the object of admiration by thousands of militant youth in his pamphlet malcolm_x the man and his ideas george breitman gives the following description of malcolms appeal as a speaker his speaking style was unique plain direct like an arrow devoid of flowery trimming he used metaphors and figures of speech that were lean and simple rooted in the ordinary daily experience of his audiences he knew what the masses thought and how they felt their strengths and their weaknesses he reached right into their minds and hearts without wasting a word and he never tried to flatter them despite an extraordinary ability to move and arouse his listeners his main appeal was to reason not emotion  i want only to convey the idea that rarely has there been a man in america better able to communicate ideas to the most oppressed people and that was not just a matter of technique 	 which can be learned and applied in any situation by almost anybody but that it was a rare case of a man in closest communion with the oppressed able to speak to them because he identified himself with them an authentic expression of their yearning for freedom a true product of their growth in the same way that lenin was a product of the russian people from  when he was made responsible for the black muslim movement in harlem the history of that movement is essentially the history of the rise of malcolm_x in public speeches where he nearly always prefaced his remarks with the statement the honorable elijah muhammad teaches us malcolm_x was teaching lessons about the black americans fight for basic dignity that was more meaningfully logical than anything that elijah muhammad had ever conceived he was the public figure most identified with the movement and most sought after as its spokesman louis e lomax referred to him as the st paul of the black muslim movement and adds not onlv was he knocked to the ground by the bright light of truth while on an evil iourney but he also rose from the dust stunned with a new name and a burning zeal to travel in the opposite direction and carry americas  million negroes with him in these years malcolm_x was preaching separation and frightening more white people than the social protest organizations that were demanding integration the bold act of refusing integration was a challenge to a society that never intended to integrate the black americans in the first place with this act malcolm_x put american society on the defensive by questioning its intentions toward his people and proving that those intentions were false also he made black america question itself and face reality he identified the enemy of their promise indicted that enemy and still did not relieve the victim his own people of the responsibility for being the instrument of their own liberation to place malcolm_x and his roughhewed grandeur in proper perspective one must first understand the nature of the society that produced him and ultimately destroyed him to a large extent the shadow of slavery still hangs over this land and affects the daily life of every american slavery was the black gold that produced americas first wealth and power slavery was the breeding ground for the most contagious and contaminating monster of all timesracism it was this racism and oppression by white america that convinced malcolm_x of the necessity of black nationalism as the vehicle for black liberation as opposed to integration while he was in the black muslim movement although his black nationalism while he was in the muslim organization was narrow and sectarian this did not prevent him from playing a tremendously important role in the evolution of the black freedom struggle prior to the arrival of malcolm_x on the scene most of white america looked upon the established civil_rights organizations as extremists although most of them were creatures and creations of the white controllers of power but malcolm comes along and says not only do i refuse to integrate with you white man but i demand that i be completely separated from you in some states of our own or back home in africa not only is your christianity a fraud but your democracy a brittle lie neither the white man nor his black apologists could answer the latter argument because they could not answer malcolm in this area they attacked him where he was most vulnerable the concept of separatism and that all white folks were blueeyed devilslabeling him a hate monger racist dangerous fanatic black supremacist etc in reality he was none of these things certainly he didnt preach black supremacy malcolm_x preached black pride black redemption black reaffirmation and he gave the black woman the image of a black man that she could respect the fact that malcolm_x while in the black muslim movement could reject a white person on any term caused most of white amer ica psychological suicide and instilled admiration and pride in most black americans for the egos of most americans are so bloated that they cannot conceive of a black man rejecting them it can be stated categorically that malcolm_x while in the black muslim movement and out of it created the present stage of the civil_rights struggleto the extent that he was a catalytic agentoff stage sarcastically criticising the civil_rights leaders popping a whip which activated them into more radical action and programs he was the alternative with which the power holders of america had to deal if they didnt deal with the established civil_rights leaders on december   about two weeks after president john f kennedys assassination malcolm_x addressed a public rally at manhattan center in new york city he was speaking as a replacement for elijah muhammad as he had done many times before after the speech in a question and answer period malcolm_x made the remark that led to his suspension as a muslim minister in answer to a question what do you think about president kennedys assassination malcolm_x answered that he saw the case as the chickens coming home to roost soon after the remark malcolm_x was suspended by elijah muhammad and directed to stop speaking for  days some weeks later when malcolm_x realized that there were a number of highly placed persons in the black muslim movement conspiring against him seemingly with elijah muhammads consent he left the movement malcolm devotes a chapter in his book to the growth of his disenchantment and his eventual suspension from the black muslim movement he says i had helped mr muhammad and his ministers to revolutionize the american black mans thinking opening his eyes until he would never again look in the same fearful way at the white man  if i harbored any personal disappointment whatsoever it was that privately i was convinced that our nation of islam could be an even greater force in the american black mans overall struggleif we engaged in more action by that i mean i thought privately that we should have amended or relaxed our general nonengagement policy i felt that wherever black people committed themselves in the little rocks and the birminghams and other places militantly disciplined muslims should also be therefor all the world to see and respect and discuss on march   he publicly announced that he was starting a new organization in fact two new organizations were started the muslim mosque inc and the organization of afroamerican unity malcolm_x was still somewhat beholden to elijah muhammad in the weeks immediately following his break with the movement at his press conference on march th he said in part i am and always will be a muslim my religion is islam i still believe that mr muhammads i analysis of the problem is the most realistic and that his solution is the best one this means that i too believe the best solution is complete separation with our people going back home to our own african homeland but separation back to africa is still a longrange program and while it is yet to materialize  million of our people who are still here in america need better food clothing housing education and jobs right now mr muhammads program does point us back homeward but it also contains within it what we could and should be doing to help solve many of our problems while we are still here internal differences within the nation of islam forced me out of it i did not leave of my own free will but now that it has happened i intend to make the most of it now that i have more independence of action i intend to use a  more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem i do not pretend to be a divine man but  do believe in divine guidance divine power and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy i am not educated nor am  an expert in any particular field    but i am sincere and my sincerity is my credentials the problem facing our people here in america is bigger than all other personal or organizational differences therefore as leaders we must stop worrying about the threat that we seem to think we pose to each others personal prestige and concentrate our united efforts toward solving the unending hurt that is being done daily to our people here in america i am going to organize and head a new mosque in new york city known as the muslim mosque inc this gives us a religious base and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community our political philosophy will be black nationalism our economic and social philosophy will be black nationalism our cultural emphasis will be black nationalism many of our people arent religiously inclined so the muslim mosque inc will be organized in such a manner as to provide for the active participation of all negroes in our political economic and social programs despite their religious or nonreligious beliefs the political philosophy of black nationalism means we must control the politics and the politicians of our community they must no longer take orders from outside forces we will organize and sweep out of office all negro politicians who are puppets for me outside forces malcolm_x had now thrust himself into a new area of conflict that would take him briefly to a high point of international attention and partial acceptance during the last phase of his life malcolm_x established the muslim mosque inc and a nonreligious organizationthe organization of afroamerican unity patterned after the organization of african unity he attempted to internationalize the civil_rights struggle by taking it to the united nations in several trips to africa and one to mecca he sought the counsel and support of african and asian heads of state his trip to mecca and africa had a revolutionary effect upon his thinking his perennial call had always been for black unity and selfdefense in opposition to the integrationists program of nonviolence passive resistance and negrowhiteunity when he returned home from his trip he was no longer opposed to progressive whites uniting with revolutionary blacks as his enemies would suggest but to malcolm and correctly so the role of the white progressive was not in black organizations but in white organizations in white communities convincing and converting the unconverted to the black cause further and perhaps more important malcolm had observed the perfidy of the white liberal and the american left whenever afroamericans sought to be instruments of their own liberation he was convinced that there could be no blackwhite unity until there was black unity that there could be no workers solidarity until there is racial solidarity the overwhelming majority of white americans demonstrate daily that they cannot and will not accept the black man as an equal in all its ramificationsafter having  years of racism preached to them from the pulpit taught in the primer and textbook practiced by the government apotheosized on editorial pages lauded on the airways and television screens it would be tantamount to selfcastration a gutting of the ego it would be asking white america to completely purge itself of everything it has been taught fed and believed for  years it was this recognition of what racism had done to the white man and the black mind that the following paragraph was and is a keystone of the organization of afroamerican unitys program we must revamp our entire thinking and redirect our learning trends so that we can put forth a confident identity and wipe out the false image built up by an oppressive society we can build a foundation for liberating our minds by studying the different philosophies and psychologies of others provisions are being made for the study of languages of eastern origin such as swahili hausa and arabic such studies will give us as afroamericans a direct access to ideas and history of our ancestors as well as histories of mankind at large more so than any other afroamerican leader malcolm_x realized that there must be a concomitant cultural and educational revolution if the physical revolution is to be successful no revolution has ever sustained itself on emotion when malcolm_x returned from his trip to mecca and africa he completely repudiated the black muslims program of separation their acquisitive thirst for money and property and machine idolatry he felt that they were merely imitating the racist enemy he still believed in separation from his racist enemy but his was an ideological separation to malcolm_x the belief was that the afroamerican must transcend his enemy not imitate him for he foresaw that both the black muslims and the integrationists were aping the oppressor that neither recognized that the struggle for black freedom was neither social nor moral it was and is a power struggle a struggle between the whitehaves and the blackhavenots a struggle of the oppressor and the oppressed and if the oppressed is to breach the power of the oppressor he must either acquire power or align himself with power therefore it is not accidental that malcolms political arm the organization of afroamerican unity was patterned to the letter and spirit after the organization of african unity nor should it be surprising that he officially linked up the problems of afroamericans with the problems of his black brothers and sisters on the mother continent malcolm_xs vision was broad enough to see that the afroamericans were not a minority as the enemy and his lackeys would have us believe afroamericans are not an isolated  million there are over  million black people in the western hemisphere cuba brazil latin america the west indies america etc and malcolm knew that when we unite these millions with the  million on the african continent the black man becomes a mighty force the second largest people on earth and so malcolms perennial theme was unity unity unity the formation of the organization of afroamerican unity and the establishment of an official connection with africa was one of the most important acts of the twentieth century for this act gave the afroamericans an official link with the new emerging power emanating from both africa and asia thus malcolm_x succeeded where marcus garvey and others had failed thus doing this malcolm projected the cause of afro american freedom into the international arena of power when he internationalized the problem by raising it from the level of civil_rights to that of human rights and by linking up with africa malcolm_x threw himself into the crossfire of that invisible international cartel of power and finance which deposes presidents and prime ministers dissolves parliaments if they refuse to do their bidding it was this force i believe which killed malcolm_x which killed lumumba which killed hammarskjold there is another and more potent reason why the american oppressors feared malcolm_x and desired him dead and that is the publicized fact that he was going to bring the oppression of afroamericans before the united nations charging the united states government with genocide many of the oppressors had conniptions when confronted with the prospect of a world body discussing the problems of afroamericans in the introduction to malcolm_xs autobiography m s handler has said no man in our time aroused fear and hatred in the white man as did malcolm because in him the white man sensed an implacable foe who could not be had for any pricea man unreservedly committed to the cause of liberating the black man in american society rather than integrating the black man into that society he was more precisely a man in search of a definition of himself and his relationship to his people his country and the world that a man who had inhabited the lower depth of life could rise in triumph as a reproach to its ills and become an uncompromising champion of his people is in itself a remarkable feat malcolm_x went beyond this feat though he came from the american ghetto and directed his message to the people in the american ghetto first of all he also became in his brief lifetime a figure of world importance he was assassinated on february   while on the threshold of his potential about the men of his breed the writer john oliver killens has  said he was a dedicated patriot dignity was his country manhood was his government and freedom was his landnew york city november 
it is  years since i racial disturbances first e occurred in the notting hill section of london today again racial violence is a real possibility in britain even a cursory examination of the events of the last decade reveals a marked deterioration in relations between the races moreover the process has been sharply accelerated during the past year to americans now harvesting the fruits of centuries of bigotry the signs are ominously familiar britains colored residents numbering one million and consisting in the main of west indians pakistanis indians and some west africans are but  percent of the entire population however when one realizes that in  nonwhites totalled only about  it is obvious that the influx has been rapid exceedingly so for many in a highly homogenized nation traditionally suspicious of strangers undeniably britons who have long claimed immunity to the bacillus of racial prejudice have now been infected indeed judging by the extent of discrimination in housing and employment the disease has reached epidemic proportions though to be sure many have proven immune according to a governmentsponsored survey released in  job discrimination based on race is commonplace employment agencies admitted that colored applicants were referred to a very small percentage of employers labor unions were no more tolerant furthermore coloreds were not acceptable as tenants in fully twothirds of all privately owned property discrimination in auto insurance was also substantiated as in the united states nonwhites who cannot find jobs commensurate with their talents or living accommodations adequate for their families needs have grown increasingly bitter one manifestation of this bitterness has been the emergence of a black_power movement for a short period of time the black_power movement was personified by michael x a trinidadian whose autobiography was recently published while its author languished in prison in november  he was convicted of violating that provision of the race relations act of  which prohibits incitement to racial hostility his conviction resulted from a speech delivered in reading in which michael observed in  i saw white savages kicking black women in the streets and black brothers running away his admonition to the audience was allegedly if you ever see a white man laying a hand on your black woman kill him immediately michael xs life in the west indies and britain studded as it has been with humiliating and degrading experiences sharply underscores the globalization of the color problem in the second half of the twentieth century few of his experiences would sound particularly novel to black americans his militant response to those experiences namely his advocacy of black pow er would be still less novel michael whose father was a portuguese merchant was often reminded as a child by his mother a black barbadian herself that white is pretty black is ugly she actually forbade him to play with negro children she discouraged him from dating negro girls and years later she was shocked and keenly disappointed when he married a black woman in england not surprisingly michael x or michael abdul malik as he now calls himself underwent an identity crisis which he subsequently saw being repeated in his young daughter the girl is fond of drawing michael comments in his book i watch her for a while and every so often i say put a little more black in here blacks a very pretty col » or particularly galling to michael was the prejudice which prevented him from working as a british merchant seaman and which required him to sail aboard norwegian vessels in common with black people in the united states he found all too often that the police in the ghetto are the type who think black people are all savages like his friend malcolm_x michael living in a society which rejected him earned his livelihood as a pimp outside the societys laws like malcolm he had affairs with white women which in retrospect he regretted like malcolm he eventually came to grips with the twin problem of a much tarnished racial selfimage and black_powerlessness dropped his slave name de freitas and converted to islam unlike malcolm whose rebirth was made possible by the muslims michael fashioned his own instrument the racial adjustment action society or raas as it is usually called the choice of name had a curious rationale raas according to michael is a west indian word referring to a menstrual blood cloth therefore it symbolizes the way the black man has been drained of his life blood for so long also the word ras derived from arabic is used in parts of africa in ethiopia for example to mean leader or head among raas aims were not only the uniting of nonwhites in the british isles but safeguarding their rights as human beings promoting black ownership of business to reduce dependency upon white capital creating cooperative housing projects and providing legal advice loosely structured the organization attracted pakistanis indians and turbaned sikhs as well as west indians and guianese associate membership was open to sympathetic europeans but it was michaels conviction that white people ought not be accorded a major role in the black freedom movement as in the united states whites have been influential in respectable civil_rights organizations in britain such as card the campaign against racial discrimination the gulf between the moderates and the militants widened  throughout  and  when to the delight of his colored audience michael described englishmen as white monkeys and condemned them for dehumanizing and raping the mind and spirit of the black man he preached black consciousness and reiterated the now familiar phrase black is beautiful in his autobiography michael claims that raas had a membership on paper of  after being in existence for one year because an entirely active membership was preferred the size of the organization was cut to some  apparently since michaels imprisonment it has been reduced further some defections including that of roy sawh can be attributed to the religious that is islamic character which had been given to raas born in guiana sawh is a flamboyant hyde park orator who had served as its fulltime national organizer by the beginning of  raas had been eclipsed by the universal coloured peoples association the ucpa first emerged on britains racial scene in november  shortly after its formation when members appeared at a weekend card meeting sporting badges on which the phrase black_power and a picture of a black_panther were displayed president of the ucpa is obi b egbuna who was bom in onitsha in what is now biafra in  included in his writings are a play a novel a pamphlet the murder of nigeria and articles on racial injustice egbunas awareness of the plight of afroamericans and his debt to malcolm_x and stokely carmichael are apparent in his writings graphically illustrating this transatlantic racial link was the first issue june  of a periodical black_power speaks published by the ucpa it contained an editorial entitled hands off rap brown an ode to malcolm_x a poem by w e b du bois a picture of stokely speaking at the ucpa platform at hyde park speakers corner and a plea to readers to join the ucpa soul brothers now and make black_power a way of life black_power has been defined in a special statement of the ucpa as the totality of the economic cultural political and if necessary military power which the black peoples of the world must acquire in order to get the white oppressor off their backs echoing michael malcolm and stokely the statement talks of cultural genocide and the need for black cultural nationalism in addition it bemoans the denial of equal opportunity to black people in short it bluntly asserts we do not enjoy being black in a whitecontrolled britain the objectives of the ucpa are comprehensive and include the establishment of nurseries for colored children the organization of study groups for blacks to stress racial interests and the formation of cooperatives especially significant is the fact that the problem of black people in britain is seen in a worldwide context the resident of harlem the black angolan and the west indian in londons ladbroke grove have a common oppressor international white power their only solution it is maintained is international black_power ian smith in rhodesia and harold wilson in britain it is argued differ not in principle but in tactics some recent racial developments make such an argument plausible to a growing number of coloreds in england on march  after soulsearing and often bitter debate both in and out of parliament an emergency bill to check the influx of asians from kenya was enacted into law this act which affected not aliens but british subjects was later roundly condemned by the international commission of jurists and in april enoch powell a leading rightwing conservative made his inflammatory speech in birmingham on the race question powell conjured up visions of whole areas of the country subjected to black domination and prophesied racial violence unless further colored immigration was stopped and blacks already living in britain were encouraged to depart although powell was relieved of his post as shadow minister of defense popular support for his position was considerable not only did rightwingers and longtime racists rally to his standard but they were joined by dockers as well as workers from the smithfield market on july  some  smithfield demonstrators marched to whitehall carrying placards reading no sellout to black_power keep britain white and guess whos coming to dinner even passage of a new race relation bill designed to minimize discrimination in housing and employment probably cannot mitigate a sense of rejection deepened by such demonstrations there are indications that powell by polarizing racial opinion has strengthened the black_power movement still quite small it is growing perceptibly for example the hustler the first ghetto newspaper appeared shortly after the powell incident published in notting hill its orientation is black_power of course black_power is not to be equated with violence yet inevitably there is talk of bloodshed in britain the ucpa while it does not favor the use of force believes that the only way to neutralize violence is to employ violence it takes a single match stick to burn london down it takes one angry black man to light that match egbuna has dismissed gandhis passive resistance as ineffective for a small minority and michael x using the idiom of the ghetto has written in anger and sorrow that the black man walking through notting hill says we should burn this place down

nkrumah back to ghana he had been in london in the honourable company of dedicated blackmen of courage such as george padmore peter abrahams c l r james and jomo kenyatta nkrumah sought the support of the ghana young men and women to push the movement for independence such men as kojo botsio and k a gbedemah joined forces with nkrumah to form an active forwardmoving organization in  he broke away from this organization with many others to form the convention peoples party a more dynamic organization capable of achieving the independence which finally crystallized in  he also was elected the general secretary of the cpp the organizations which comprised the cpp were the workers brigade the state construction workers the national council of ghana women the ghana young pioneers the trade union congress the united ghana farmers council and the cooperatives the members of these various organizations were members of the cpp and they worked to realize the ideology of the party a member ofthe cpp once said whatever they do the character of the cpp must be clearly manifested for all to see they all have a single guiding light the light of our party ideology this light must constantly be kept bright and full c f lustre and must on no account be allowed to dim for as soon as this happens we are bound to find ourselves in difficulties this first sixpoint manifesto of the cpp illustrated their pragmatic approach  to fight relentlessly by all constitutional means for the achievement of full self government now for the chiefs and the people o the gold coast no gradualism   o serve as the vigorous conscious political vanguard for removing   forms of oppression and for the establishment of a democratic lovernment c   o secure and maintain the complete unity of the chiefs and people of the colony ashanti northern territories and the trans olta  to work in the interest of the trade union movement in the country for better conditions of employment  to work for a proper reconstruction of a better gold coast in which the people shall have the right to live and govern themselves as a free people  to assist and facilitate in any way possible the realization of a united and selfgoverning west africa african continent let all fellowmembers remember whether we be trade unionists whether we be farmers whether we be members of the womens council or of the young pioneers that the dominant character which should take precedence in all that we do is the character of the membership of the cpp this character is the guiding force of our ghanaian life and existence and constitutes the bulwark against national treachery intrigue subversion and other unghanaian activities the work of the cpp prior to independence was essentially that for the attainment of independence for ghana since independence the m cpp moved its activities in the following directions a political an upper house of the legislature known as the senate shall be created for the chiefs the eventual adoption of a republican government for the total political independence from britain universal suffrage at the age of  direct eitcuons v itn no property or residential qualifications for can didates a strong panafrican movement and action b economic a five year economic plan  immediate africanization of the civil service  immediate materialization of the volta hydroelectric scheme  railway lines

education up to  years of age  the university college to be brought up to university status and more new ones established  a planned campaign to abolish illiteracy d family assistance  a free national health service  a high standard of housing program  a pipedwater supply in all parts of the country  a national insurance scheme in order to achieve these the cpp demanded hard work and sacrifice from its members as well as ghanaian citizenry president nkrumah stated thus to travel this road every member of the cpp every ghanaian man and woman every boy and girl all of us together must work and give service to the nation to the best of our ability even the disabled the blind and the crippled must be equipped in this great crusade to contribute their quota to the total national effort he spoke against the advocates of racialism before ghana attained independence he was against race discrimination whatever form it may take people have not been expelled from the country or prevented from entering ghana because of their color those who were expelled from the country were responsible for such action and it was due to their subversive political activities he has declared my hatred against imperialists can never dwindle but i want everyone in this country to remember is that we are fighting against a system and not against any individual race or color i do not believe in racialism and localism the concept africa for the africans does not mean that other races are excluded from it no it only means that africans shall and must govern themselves in their own countries without imperialist and foreign impositions but the people of other races can remain in african soil carry on their legitimate avocations and live on terms of peace friendship and equality with africans on their own soil social and economic rehabilitation of ghana under the leadership of nkrumah after independence was achieved early in  in that years christmas eve message to the nation nkrumah declared my first objective is to abolish from ghana poverty ignorance and disease we shall measure our progress by the improvement in the health of our people by the number of children in school and by the quality of their education by the availability of water and electricity in our towns and villages and by the happiness which our people take in being able to manage their own affairs and no more by alien powers the welfare of our people is our chief pride and it is by this that my government will ask to be judged i think that what follows will show that the judgment on this test will prove to be favorable the problem of social and economic transformation recognized the limiting circumstances from the beginning of nkrumahs rule economic and social change demands some choices either an outright and fullscale dictatorial regimentation and an imposition of a period of privation is adopted or a combination of foreign capital and technicians to participate in certain essential projects with some sacrifice from the citizenry to finance general social and industrial development will have to be made the ghana government made the latter choice following or using a socialist plan which has four parts  the stateowned sector  joint state and private enterprise  the cooperative movement  private enterprise the stateowned sector included electricity and water supplies hydroelectric projects arms and ammunition and alcoholic beverages these services and industries were administered by an industrial development corporation on behalf of the nation this corporation ran an efficient  factory for making furniture with ghanaian timber instead of exporting timber and later to import furniture at an exorbitant price brickmaking works and a modern printing establishment to produce daily newspapers government documents and statesponsored books the enterprises jointly owned by the state and private companies was largely an intention rather than practice the idea was to insist upon state participation in monopolies whose interests might beor are incompatible with public interests and in infant industries which need state protection as well as those sick industries which might use subsidies what happens in the western european countries canada and the usa why nationalize steel industries in britain why government contracts and trade tariffs in the usa why guidelines to labour and industries in the usa certain industries had suffered during the colonial period to rehabilitate them cooperatives became a very crucial method for improvement and survival take for example the cocoa problems the middlemen exploited the cocoa farmers while the cocoa swollen root disease devastated the cocoa trees to counteract the activities of the middlemen a voluntary cooperative movement among the farmers developed to great proportions their produce had to be pooled together and selling was done in bulk thereby overcoming the exploitation by the middlemen the cocoa marketing board developed side by side with the cooperatives the government of ghana aimed at integrating the cooperative movement with its national economic planning rivalry between the cooperatives and the cmb was unhealthy and as a result the nkrumah government found a solution by establishing ghana farmers marketing cooperatives and finally gave the country an efficient coordination of this aspect of the national economy since the revenue from cocoa was by far the largest source of national wealth it became necessary that a portion of this revenue should be set aside to contribute to the plans for national construction and social development in november  at the opening ceremony of the cocoa house the headquarters of the marketing board nkrumah on behalf of the government stated the accumulated reserves of the cmb are public money held in trust by the government for the benefit of the farmers and the people of this country most of the cocoa farmers patriotically accepted this appreciating the security which it afforded them a large percentage of the reserve funds had been devoted to the development of the cocoa industry itself the following are examples of the disbursement of the fund a cocoa rehabilitation and control of the swollen root disease  £ million  million b endowment for the faculty of agriculture of the university of ghana  £ million  million c donation to the west african cocoa research institute study of cocoa disease and the development of highyielding varieties £ million  million d new hospitals schools social servicesroads water supply clinics and dispensaries and certain projects in the economic development plan  £ million  million the cocoa swollen root disease has no known cure and the only practical measure was to persuade the farmers to cut down the infected trees with compensation a national campaign was launched and finally the cocoa swollen root disease was eradicated by cutting them down diamond industry the ghana government endeavored to bring about the africanization of the diamond industry on cooperative lines similar to the cocoagrowers organization this cooperative would train africans to serve as valuers polishers and graders of the diamonds in addition an agency under ghanaian control would be set up in london to place the diamonds on the world market the complete africanization of the diamond industry would inevitably place the wealth in the hands of ghanaians for their own enjoyment the scheme met with violent opposition from the vested interests in the diamond industry domestically and of course internationally england france and the usa delay occurred but by  plans had been endorsed by the government to place  percent of the ghanaian diamond industry on a cooperative basis and in  a marketing board was set up to sell the ghanaian supply to dealers the development of the diamond industry in ghana has been impressive in  the output was a little over  carats by  output rose to  million carats valued at £ million  million approximately the world demand for ghanaian diamonds is great since they are mostly suited for industrial purposes the expansion of the diamond industry is part of the diversification of the economy to save it from dependence on one crop king cocoa economists know the danger of oneindustry state it is always in a precarious position if prices fall the whole economy is affected the governments agriculture department followed the national plan to diversify the agricultural sector of the economy the aims were to provide enough food for the growing population and to provide funds for financing the various development projects it also gave balance to the nations economy bananas coffee coconuts copra kola nuts rubber tobacco cattleranching vegetables and fishing were developed according to the national plan prior to the execution of this diversification food had to be imported in seven years from  to  in conjunction with the agricultural diversification the aiding factors such as the use of fertilizers seed dressing new varieties improved husbandry techniques mechanized cultivation in grassland areas the distribution of seedlings at cheap prices credits for tools and equipment a service of tractors were all established irrigation and water conservation were developed including the construction of  dams in the northern and upper regions all these were accomplished within the period of nkrumahs administration the ghanaian pattern of agricultural socialism was well developed stateplanned and serviced cooperatively run comprehensive and nationwide fishing prior to independence was primitive and the supply very inadequate for postindependence fishing was revolutionized the traditional canoe fleet with paddle were motorized fish catch increased cold storage plants in inland areas and cold stores plant and canning in tema were established these have been done to achieve economic efficiency and to transform the diet of the people providing them with adequate supplies of high quality protein which they needed so much the builders of the new ghana realized that for the nation s wealth to be increased so that the standards of life of its people their material conditions health education and cultural fulfillment increased to desired levels their agricultural advance must be accompanied by an equal industrial advance this provides the achievement of a balanced economic and social growth the first need for industry is power electric power for machinery for processing raw materials for facilitating refrigeration for the operating of chemical plants and for smelting minerals to this end the volta river project was geared the volta river varies in flow in the ratio of as much as tol between flood and low water the flood before the dam project was running waste the project is intended to store the water in the manmade lake covering  square miles providing a reserve for the low water season enabling a constant flow through tne great dam which will generate the power the lake will provide a new highway to the distant north helping to break down isolation and backwardness a new fishing industry will be created and the  square miles of land around the shores of the lake will be flooded each season at high water amenable to intensive cultivation of crops such as rice there is an incidental aspect of the volta river project which is exceptionally pleasing besides the material purposes new modern towns will spring up and some have sprung up the site of the dam and power station will be kept free from ugliness to make it a true attraction for ghanaians and tourists from abroad thereby helping to develop tourism as a source of revenue this project was initiated by the government as a part of ghanas patterned construction its origin was essentially socialist but the project itself is partly public enterprise and partly private enterprise the power development was undertaken from public resources while the development of the smelter remained private enterprise the dam the power station the manmade lake the water highway the distribution of electricity throughout ghanas industrial sector have all been on the side of public enterprise another aspect of the move towards industrialization was the attempt to overcome the key drawback in the development of ghana the lack of a good harbor goods and passengers abroad seagoing vessels had to be transferred to boats some distance from land and rowed through the surf to the dock at accra a modern deepwater port providing berths capable of handling up to  tons a year was constructed at tema  miles from accra at a cost of £ million  million two new towns were developed as a result of this construction tema new town for the dock workers and tema new village for the fishermen and their families what was the situation regarding educational facilities since independence any noticeable improvement the following statistics points out the facts see statistics during the colonial period tuition cost of books and all the other incidental expenses were paid by parents who had children in school after independence tuition was abolished in primary and secondary schools generous government scholarships were given to ghanaians who study in the universities in ghana as well as those in foreign universities 
mass education meant more in ghana villagers deep in the forests were under instructors cutting a way through the trees and undergrowth and building fewer roads to the main routes to the towns so that they could exchange their produce for previously unknown goods in the shops and link themselves with the social and cultural development which was sweeping the country they built halls and schools dug trenches for irrigation organized the collection of refuse thereby improving sanitation this was an extraordinary voluntary cooperation in personal progress and community betterment the youth was organized and known as the national workers brigade to perform community service the boys were apprenticed in masonry carpentry plumbing automobile fitting electrical engineering vehicle mechanics and tractor operations the girls learned the marketing of produce food preservation household duties secretarial and office duties they were sent to different camps for their training here was a nation recruiting its youth not principally in military forces but into a disciplined army devoted entirely to constructive community activity as an index of the national economic growth the gnp rose from £ million in  to £ million in  percentage increase was from  percent annual growth to  percent growth rate in  something should be said about the man dr nkrumah the leader of the ghana movement his conception of socialism demands personal services in contrast with personal gain british and american newspaper reports have many times presented a different image the public in these two countries as well as in their satellite nations have been given the picture of a man who sought grandeur and ostentation when corruption invaded his ministers secretaries of departments he demanded that each of his ministers should reveal his income and possessions and how they were obtained the clue to the corrupt behaviors of his ministers was their construction of palatial mansions which they could not afford in their circumstances and salaries he on behalf of the government insisted that they should show examples to the nation that they should surrender all financial and business interests and live at reasonable standard ministers who did not conform were dismissed two among those dismissed were later reappointed partly in recognition of their past service to ghanaian freedom and partly because of their later adherence to principle their abilities and influence dr nkrumah believed in the complete freedom of all africans people of african descent and other peoples of the world equality and dignity of the human being was his first order in life one may question why the leaders of the opposition were arrested and detained for long periods without trial why the disturbances in ghana why the attempts to assassinate him the answers lie in understanding what african socialism means and what was the stage of alien political development in ghana inherited from the colonial administration dr nkrumahs government espoused socialism as an economic system in the context of african communalism which in no way is a prototype of european socialism de graft johnson made this clear when he wrote what our social structure which may be termed communalism cannot cope with is the modern world with its capitalist industries and our task here is to adapt the principles of socialism to our own particular mode of life alternately we can develop our basic traditional institutions in keeping with the basic principles of communalism to fit modern conditions i think we shall attempt both in african political systems there were never opposition parties per se people were active and participated fully in town and village discussions as a body gave their assent and registered their opposition to issues as they arose there was unity in diversity it was the paramount chief who acted as the voice of the people the socialism of africa differs from the european type european socialism was born of conflict the conflict that was sanctified into a philosophy the class war was looked upon not as something evil but as something necessary and good as prayer is to christianity or to islam so civil war class war is to european versions of socialisma means inseparable from the end each becomes the basis of a whole way of life the european socialist cannot think of his socialism without its fathercapitalism such a contradiction africans find intolerable it virtually says that without capitalism and the conflict which it creates within any society there can be no socialism african socialism did not arise from the agrarian revolution it did not start from the existence of conflicting classes in society it started as a family society its objective is the extended family africans have no more need to be converted to socialism than they have to be taught democracy europeans and other imperialists remain ignorant of the fact that socialism and democracy are rooted in the african past which produced contemporary africans these africans acknowledge that socialism must look to wider horizons for the extended family nyerete stated modern african socialism    can no longer confine the idea of the social family within the limits of the tribe nor indeed of the nation for no true african socialist can look at a line drawn on a map and say the people on this side of that line are my brothers but these who happen to live on the other side of it have no claim on me every individual on this african continent is his brother    the above also portrays nkrumahs socialism every african national leader had been engaged in the supreme need to build a sense of nationhood from diverse racial tribal and religious loyalties this has not been an easy task ghana had this problem particularly in the resistance of the ashanti and some northern peoples to incorporation in a united state it had to overcome the opposition of powerful chiefs regarded as the spiritual heads of communities as well as their political masters such chiefs are no more competent or capable of running the modern state nkrumah also inherited the bitter antagonism of the reactionary professional and business elite who he ousted as directors of the national movement the social disturbances were undoubtedly accented by conspiracies on the part of some of the opposition leaders who by all means were the paid agents of the british and the nato allies and the frustrated members of the cpp to overthrow the regime by assassinating president nkrumah some of those ghanaians who were definitely in the assassination plot which they attempted were apprehended and detained without trial their trial would have meant the death penalty and the pressure of public opinion would have made commutation of the sentence difficult the attacks on president nkrumahs life were misinterpreted by the western press as signs of unpopularity the facts prior to the coup point to a different direction the resistance of the ghanaian anglophiles the subversive activities of the local agents of the capitalist world the psychological poverty of arch tribalists and the unending quest to keep the black man down by the same ugly greedy and wicked imperialists account for the fall of nkrumahs government but not the man the coup on nkrumahs government february   dealt a catastrophic blow to the african continent take a statistic of the black world and see the identical damage done to our brave leaderspatrice lumumba of the congo balewa of nigeria malcolm_x of the usa those living but ousted from office president nkrumah and president ben bella of algeria why this pattern the answer is very clear to all thinking peoples the fall of nkrumahs government is the fall of africa and africans his leadership was a pacesetter a guiding star and an inspirational one since the tragedy the continent has fallen into oblivion the portuguese in angola and mozambique the ian smiths and harold wilsons the nazi republic of south africa and their international cohorts are happy ghana and ghanaians are no more independent if we understand what freedom and independence means how can it be free when a major sector of the economy has been taken over by the foreign capitalists ghana is now starting on the path of having apartheid schools the london sunday telegraph of march   writes the ghanaian staff of ashanti goldfields are incensed over the setting up of an allwhite primary school by the management and refusal to allow senior africans to form their staff association applications from ghanaian senior staff to enter their children in such schools have been rejected such a school never existed under nkrumah more than  private schools with a fee of £ have been established this is a move to deny the children of any average worker the opportunity for education on the political front  paramount chiefs as of february   have been destooled by the military regime terrorism is now the order of the day the ghanaian times of february  and   published thus reports coming from ashanti give cause for serious concern    in ashanti and the central regions and indeed in some other places in scattered areas of the country towns and villages in these areas of the country are being subjected to a wave of terrorism and dacoity unparalleled in the history of this country fear stalks the land    in many homes there is not a wink of sleep for man or woman armed robbery is showing upward surge because of the lowebbing relations between the public and the police what an insult to human intelligence the militarycumpolice regime has abolished political party organization it has proclaimed that governing a country without any party or parties is the surest way to ensure democracy what an illusion what a contradiction on the economic front the ghana trade union congress which had pledged its support to the nlc is now begging for recognition which it had under nkrumahs government the u s capitalists have grabbed the ghana economy the firestone rubber company has taken over the stateoperated rubber plantations the u s international hotels  corporation now controls all former state hotels advertisement for a managerial post for the nowcontrolled hotels stipulated quite clearly that ghanaian or african applicants will not be considered the economy is stagnating despite the assurance given by britain and the u s a that neocolonialism and capitalism will triumph in ghana as a payment for the criminal coup the british promised a loan of £ and the usa  million finally the most outrageous act of the military regime is the sending away in ghanaian airways all the nationalist refugees from angola mozambique southern rhodesia south west africa and the republic of south africa back to their respective places of origin their military and police escorts handed them over to the imperialist authorities for their final destruction such is the situation the democracy and newlywon freedom for the ghanaians and africa the direct causes of the imperialists attack on nkrumah before the independence of ghana the currency authority was the west african currency board established in  by executive decree of the colonial office with headquarters in london the wacb was nothing other than a local agent the control of the commercial banks was under the wacb the monetary policy adopted was at the whims and caprices of the wacb and principally at the dictation of london on march   three days before ghana became independent the central bank of ghana was established it thus became the sole bank of issue the banker to the government and other commercial banks the fiscal agent of the government in dealing with important international financial institutions eg the international monetary fund and the world bank it also operated for the government in exchange control as the sole bank of issue it had the power to influence the credit situation with a view to maintaining monetary stability in ghana and the external value of the ghana pound the cbg originated a local money market by issuing on behalf of the government day treasury bills this enabled the ghanaians to invest their money domestically it also curtailed the volume of funds transferred out of ghana to britain such transfers were of a high magnitude prior to the establishment of the central bank the central bank created an atmosphere which encouraged the establishment of indigenous owned and operated commercial banks and also the expansion of branches of the older ones between march  and november  branch banks increased from  to  this was the breaking of the monopoly position of the british barclays bank dominion colonial and overseas ltd and bank of west africa ltd since the monopoly position was threatened the foreign owners mounted a series of attacks on the nkrumah government we can see how sincere the british position is free competition in britain and monopoly in africa in line with the goal for relative economic independence a reduction in the high shipping costs of ghanian exports the ghana national shipping line was established after  formerly all exports from and imports to ghana had been carried by the british shipping firms the profits from such services accrued to britain the prohibitive shipping charges reduced the profit margin that could have gone to ghana passenger service provided by the shipping firms was controlled by the british with the establishment of the ghana black star line national shipping line the charges on exports and passenger services were reduced to reasonable levels the profits became a source of revenue to be used in financing other economic development projects as well as in expanding the shipping lines a third case of monopoly is the air lines colonial ghana had no national airways the air transport was owned operated and controlled by the british overseas airways corporationair france and panamerican air lines with independence and the establishment of the ghana airways corporation the monopoly position of the british was demolished more revenue was thereby secured for ghana the purchase of some aircraft from the soviet union instead of the more costly ones manufactured by the nato countries contributed to the animosity directed at nkrumahs government the african continent had been described as the sleeping giant dr nkrumah called the african allafrican peoples conference in  this conference brought political leaders trade unionists nationalists and others from different works of life together for a common endeavourthe complete liberation of the continent from foreign domination nkrumah had declared in his independence message of march   that he would not consider ghana free and independent as long as any portion of the african soil remained under foreign control ghana provided free transportation for revolutionary refugees from the racialist nightmare of angola mozambique southern rhodesia south west africa and the republic of south africa it also aided guinea when it elected to be her own boss and to chart her own destiny rather than remain in the french community and be a province of france imagine such an anarchronism part of the african continent a portion of france making black africans frenchmen this destroys the work of nature the colonial nato countries jubilantly anticipated the collapse of guinea when france pulled out taking with it everything including paperclips and toilet tissue before  the african continent had been balkanized brothers and sisters husbands and wives and even tribes were arbitrarily and forcibly separated by the unnatural political boundaries drawn by the greedy europeans today some problems that confront african countries are the offshoots of the unnatural boundaries to overcome such unending division nkrumah by political action and marriage involved the whole of north africa in the united and collective effort of breaking down the artificial disgraceful wall that had separated the african land mass and its peoples finally nkrumah with the cooperation of the late w e b du bois and george padmore initiated the dialogue on the possibility of publishing encyclopedia africana for the purpose of placing african historical cultural and social achievements of antiquity in proper perspective for all these reasons the nato powers mounted their attack on this great african one thing is clear to the patriotic african in fledgling states imperialists interest flourish where there is an atmosphere of dissension they are endangered in an atmosphere of national unity and stability some people have accused the government of having too much power over the national economy i have to remind those people that under colonial administration the little postal telegraphic and rail communications broadcasting electricity and water services that existed were all publicly owned and administered nobody domestically or internationally raised a cry of woe but as soon as the ghanaians under nkrumahs direction added an airline a shipping line a central bank loud echoes of dictatorship started to roar in the firmament since then ghana has met with active resistance from vested interest groups within and without in the effort to build a national economy jules ferry premier of france in  when he spoke in the chamber of deputies in defence of the colonial policy of the french government stated thus it is not clear that the great states of modern europe the moment their industrial power is founded are confronted with an immense and difficult problem which is the basis of industrial life the very condition of existencethe question of markets have you not seen the great industrial nations one by one arrive at a colonial policy and we can say that this colonial policy is a luxury for modern nations not at all gentlemen this policy is for all of us a necessity like the market itself today as you know the law of supply and demand freedom of exchange the influence of speculations all these move in a circle which extends to the ends of the world colonies are for rich countries one of the most lucrative methods of investigating capital  i say that france which is glutted with capital and which has exported considerable quantities has an interest in looking at this side of the colonial question it is the same question as that of outlets for our manufacture the same situation applies to the motives of neocolonialists and imperialists albert sarraut french colonial secretary of state in  spoke in stronger terms in paris what is the use of painting the truth at the start colonization was not an act of civilization nor was it a desire to civilize it was an act of force motivated by interests an episode in the vital competition which from man to man from group to group has gone on ever increasing the people who set out to seize colonies in distant lands were thinking primarily of themselves and were working for their own profits and conquering for their own power the origin of colonization is nothing else than enterprise of individual interests a onesided and egotistical imposition of the strong upon the weak you can see who really thinks of nkrumah as a dictator is it the true african no no it is the neocolonialists and their lackeys in ghana and the rest of africa the coup was effected by the imperialists lackeys in ghana in concert with thier international neocolonialist powers whatever might have happened nkrumahs philosophy remains indestructible and will be fostered in africa and in ghana as long as this planet earth exists
any persons have wondered what were the characteristics that made marcus garvey a personality to be reckoned how is it that this little black man born in a small island could conceive the idea of redeeming the continent of africa and uniting a scattered race heredity in the first instance played an important part in his life he had a sympathetic heart and an expansive mind he was gentle and softspoken just like his mother but when provoked or on a platform the maroon blood of his father would boil within him and he would roar like a lion in projecting to the world the oppression fears hopes and ambitions of his peopleinto this dynamic personality came ideas and those ideas repeatedly projected themselves in his mind until they developed into idealssomething that must be achieved must be accomplished then the driving urge from within forced action the appalling conditions of his people everywhere cried aloud for a change as he said in a speech everywhere i go i see the poverty misery and suffering of my people i ask where is the black mans government where are his statesmen where is his flag his battleships and planes to protect him from oppression and wrong the answer isthere are none and i vowed to help him free himself and determine his own destiny for nationhood is the highest ideal of all peoples thus he found his purpose in life and pursued it to the bitter end without sparing himself and those who were loyal to him serving his race became an obsession with him and everything else had to fit into his workwife children and relatives must be expendable in this great cause embodied in his slogan africa for the africans those at home and those abroad his motto one god one aim one destiny as a solution to the negro problem in america garvey was vigorously opposed to miscegenationrace suicideas a way out of the political social and economic thralldom of the black minority he protested against the plea of interracial organizations for integration as a final goal for argued he the negro is not now equal to the whites who are in the majority and in powerin all material phases of life so that integration if achieved on a national scale would be unequal integration and therefore humiliating to black americans during the process and they would be absorbed into the white society and thereby lose their identity and any distinct contribution they make to the greatness of the nation the following are some excerpts from his philosophy and opinions which disclose the workings of the mind of this man the mission of the universal negro improvement association is to arouse the sleeping consciousness of negroes everywhere to the point where he will as one concerted body act for our own preservation by laying the foundation for such we will be able to work toward the glorious realization of an emancipated race and a constructed nation nationhood is the only means by which civilization can completely protect itself  it is the highest ideal of any peopleto govern themselves while others are raising the cry for a white america a white canada a white australia we without reservation raise the cryand loudly toofor africas freedom to fight for african redemption does not mean that we must give up our domestic fights for political justice and industrial rights it does not mean that we must become disloyal to any government or to any country wherein we were born each and every race outside of its domestic national loyalty has a loyalty to itself therefore it is foolish for the negro to talk about not being interested in his own racial political social and industrial destiny we can be loyal american citizens or british subjects as the irishman or the jew and yet fight for the redemption of africa and complete emancipation of the race out of the unsettled state and condition of the world will come such revolutions that will give each and every race that is oppressed the opportunity to march forward the last world war world war i brought the opportunity to many heretofore subject races to regain their freedom the next world war will give africa the opportunity for which we are preparing we are going to have wars and rumors of wars in another  or  years we will have a changed world politically and africa will not be one of the most backward nations but africa shall be i feel sure one of the greatest commonwealths that will once more hold up the torchlight of civilization and bestow the blessings of freedom liberty and democracy upon all mankind power is the only argument that satisfies man except the individual the race or the nation has power that is exclusive it means that that individual race or nation will be bound by the will of the others who possess this great qualification it is the physical and pugilistic power of harry wills that makes white men afraid to fight him it was the industrial and scientific power of the teutonic race that kept it for years as dictator of the economic and scientific policies of europe it is the naval and political power of great britain that keeps her mistress of the seas it is the commercial and financial power of the united states of america that makes her the greatest banker in the world hence it is advisable for the negro to get power of every kind power in education science industry politics and higher government that kind of power that will stand out signally so that other races and nations can see and if they will not see then feel man is not satisfied or moved by prayers or petitions but every man is moved by that power of authority which forces him to do even against his will thus spoke garvey in the s it is remarkable that he did not harbour hate and bitterness in his heart against those who doublecrossed him turned government informers and others who used the press to make vicious lying statements against him especially in the garvey must go campaign in america launched by his rivals and which ended in his trial imprisonment and deportation said he if i kept piling up hate in my heart against those who daily seek my destruction my spirit would be poisoned by it how then could i love and serve my people they can destroy my body but they will never be able to break my will or suppress my fighting spirit i have breathed it into the minds of millions of my people the world over no human agency can stop us it is the will of god that this race of mine shall determine its own destiny and take its rightful place as equals among gods children the million dollar question asked by white reporters from news agencies and influential newspapers was mr garvey how are you going to redeem africa he answered in the year  africa will be redeemedregardless of the armaments of the imperial powersby emancipating the minds of subjected peoples to realize and know that freedom of thought and action are the inherent right of all peoples after that free thought will devise ways and means to battle its way to freedom the small european imperial nations will fight the big powers for more expansion in africa and asia when this happens the peoples of these continents will get the big opportunity to free themselves as   y   l things will be too hot for europe to hold what she has as far back as  garvey predicted the independence of the west indies in an article in the african times and orient review london he stated as one who knows the people well i make no apology for prophesy ing that there will soon be a turning point in the history of the west indies and that the people who inhabit that portion of the western hemisphere will be the instruments of uniting a scattered race who before the close of many centuries will found an empire on which the sun shall shine as ceaselessly as it shines on the empires of the north today time rolls on and in the year human rights yearwe found nearly all of the territories of africa and the west indies independent and represented in the united nations the negro problem in america has become the white mans problemhow to stem the tide of black_powerwhich is generated by black unity the basic power a small minority of oppressed people can achieve in a majority white nation is to take action in their best interests the new negro is thinking for himself and by himself and not in terms of being an appendage to a white society but with the backing of independent nations of his race and kindred spirit nuclear power is misused to decimate people and to destroy countries but black_power is generated to protect people from injustices and wrongs white supremacists cannot tap its source although they can destroy some of its exponents they cannot destroy the ideal it is in every black man woman and childs heart to get his human rights and to keep them to maintain them against all odds it is the spirit of garveyism it is an ideal a goal a working philosophy it motivates peoples to great achievements it is eternal in the breasts of peoples of african descent everywhere

dr kwame nkrumah more than any present day  ¦£vr« african leader has stood out as the most articulate and consistent champion of the african peoples struggle against imperialism colonialism and their associated refinements of neocolonialism and racial oppression his numerous books speeches and political activities spanning a period of over twenty years testify to his prodigious labor and dedication in the service of the oppressed people of africa and their equally oppressed cousins in the western world particularly in the united states it is not without significance that among people who were to fire nkrumahs own political consciousness were those remarkable and selfless afroamerican leaders marcus garvey and dr w e b du bois in africa itself nkrumah has been the most consistent advocate of the twin goals of total african liberation and unity he has seen that without total liberation africa could never control her own destiny or realize her full potentiality he has also seen that without political unity african independence would remain nothing but a shell protecting foreign interests bent upon the plunder of the wealth of the continent and the economic subjugation of its people while it is true that the african people have in general sacrificed considerably to attain their political independence that independence could only have value for them to the extent that it was linked up with genuine economic independence many of the miniscule states of africa which presently boast themselves politically independent are unlikely ever to attain a genuine allround independence they will remain prey to those who wield the levers of economic power they will remain in other words neocolonial client states whose economic lifelines and political orientation will remain essentially at the beck and call of foreign interests it is on this general and valid ground that nkrumah has called for a union of african states such that the independence for which the people of africa have craved for centuries may become meaningful unity would result in the pooling of energies and resources it would  constitute a bulwark against foreign attempts to exploit the young states of africa without it each small state must remain prey to foreign intrigues and manoeuvres much as in latin america nkrumahs prognosis on the likely fate of small disunited states in africa has already been amply shown to be valid numerous coups already have taken place all over africa and in most cases directed against progressive regimes seeking to bring about the genuine independence of their countries while no exhaustive study has been made to show whose hand was behind these upheavalsalways a difficult exercise given the nature of the casethere is little doubt that foreign interests were involved to a more or less decisive extent certainly nkrumahs analysis of the ghanaian coup which overthrew his government in february  leaves the reader persuaded to the view that this was not a purely ghanaian militarypolice putsch the hand that fired the gun against its own government was indeed ghanaian the brain that hatched the plot or fomented its execution was not but how did the coup take place who spearheaded the revolt why what explains its apparently easy success and what future for independent africa the above represents some of the questions nkrumah has sought to answer in this book for analytical purposes the book may be taken as consisting of three interconnected themes  the onset and mechanism of the coup itself  the internal ghanaian political situation and  the lessons for other african states that the ghanaian experience provides we shall try to deal with these themes in turn hereunder i dr nkrumah had left ghana on february   on an official trip to hanoi to try to discover possibilities of ending the vietnam was as early as possible he was going to hanoi at the invitation of president ho chi minh on arrival in peking on the th however he was to learn from the chinese government that a coup had that day taken place in ghana immediately a decision was made to discontinue the trip to hanoi and a statement was issued to the press urging the people of ghana to stand firm and resist the illegal usurpation of power by the army and police in addition various assignments were given to the officials accompanying the president prior to the return to africa of the entire party surprisingly however these highranking officials seemed completely stunned to paralysis by the coup and seemed more concerned about their own personal fortunes under the new order than about resisting the illegal seizure of power thus for example foreign minister a quaison sackey a former ghanaian united nations representative and president of the general assembly of the un was instructed to go to addis ababa to represent the legal government of ghana at a meeting of oau foreign ministers but he chose instead to fly to accra the miiltarypolice junta quickly put him in jail on arrival though he was soon to be released it is significant that the only politically reliable people in the presidents party at this time of tremendous shock and stress were the security officers and members of dr nkrumahs personal staff it is these loyal individuals who accompanied him to guinea where he has remained to date as for the actual coup itself it appears that the major figure here was police commissioner john harlley it was he who maintained contact with two junior army officers emmanuel kotoka and akwasi afrifa whose two garrisons were used in the storming of key strong points in accra on the early morning of february  with their commissioner at the very center of the plot the police of course offered every facility to the advancing troops indeed the only serious resistance the soldiers encountered was at the residence of the army chief of staff general barwah and at flagstaff house the official residence of the president general barwah refused to join the conspiracy and was shot on the spot by kotoka at flagstaff house tremendous resistance was offered by the presidential guard regiment for many hours until the guard was overpowered by superior numbers and weaponry some of the reasons for the coup will receive mention subsequently it is interesting however to note that these were far different from those which kotoka and afrifa gave the troops under their command the soldiersmany of whom are apparently illiteratewere told that the coup had to take place because a nkrumah intended to send them to fight the ian smith regime in rhodesia b nkrumah also intended to send them to fight in vietnam and c with the departure of the president for north vietnam there was in any case no government the army it was pointed out had to take power or else someone else would the russians it was revealed were already installed in a tunnel under flagstaff house and more of them were on their way to ghana to take over the government pp  this jumble of fictitious and inconsistent argumentations apparently sounded plausible enough to induce the troops to action the important thing here however is to note how a coup which was hailed elsewhere as popular and justified had to be backed up with a series of falsehoods by its instigators in order to sell it to presumably reluctant soldiers for if a country is lying under the boot of an oppressoras ghana has been alleged in the western press to have beenwhy should it even be necessary to explain in detail that the country deserves to be liberated above all why invent reasons to explain why the action is necessary the probability seems strong that the plotters were not fired by any high national ideals their action sprang essentially from personal and power motives and therefore had to be backed up by a stream of hysterical demagoguery which could at least give a semblance of plausibility if not respectability to their actions but why is it that the coup was not greeted with any widespread popular resistance this is after all one element which antinkrumah propaganda has seized on to substantiate the allegation that the coup was popularly welcomed nkrumah suggests several factors that explain the apparent welcome that the coup met from the ordinary people first the army made it clear that any resister would be summarily and brutally dealt with the case of general barwah has already been referred to several other lesswell known people were similarly savaged moreover all top party and government officials were rounded up early in the exercise so that the masses remained leaderless at a crucial stage in the process of arresting the soldiers did not scruple to torture and severely beat up their victims for example professor kojo abraham at that time vice chancellor of the university of ghana and a noted scholar was severely beaten before being thrown into prison the manuscript of a book he was writing was publicly burnt nazistyle while he was taken into prison pp  second nkrumah points out that resistance was slow in coming and when it did start it remained largely underground the april  attempt at a countercoup seems to bear this out third there were certain elements especially in accra who genuinely welcomed the coup because the previous government had been unmindful of their special interests the relatively privileged professional and business strata including the famous accra market women no doubt chafed under the various austerity measures which the economic development of the country had made necessary they resented having to make sacrifices when independence should have meant the arrival of the golden age in any event these elements plus those released from prisons in order to give way to the thousands of new inmates together with others who were sheerly intimidated by the show of militarypolice power paraded in the popular demonstrations to which so much importance has been given in certain circles another reason for the lack of much overt resistance may well be a more general one in an underdeveloped country where communication lines are limited and centralized the advantage in any contest for power tends to go to whoever can seize these lines of communication at the outset seizure of communications means the ability to transmit messages favourable to one side immediately and widely the opposition is in this case put at a decided disadvantage for not only is it incapable of putting its case across it has also virtually to fight on terrain chosen by the dominant group since it is the latter which through its control of official communication channels selects the issues for debate no wonder then that most coup leaders place the radio station the post office etc as priority targets on the way to the seizure of powerthe ghanaian coup was as already indicated engineered by the leadership of the police force in collaboration with certain segments of the army but excluding its top personnel the new regime came to rest on three institutional pillarsthe army the police and the civil service bureaucracy the new government christened the national liberation council or nlc comprises four army officers and four police officers the chairman joseph ankrah is an army officer whom nkrumah had earlier retired but whom the young putschists pressed back into service to give an aura of respectability to the junta it appears that the civil service generally fell into line with the new order without a murmur without the collaboration of this service the junta would no doubt have found it well nigh impossible to run the country neither the police nor the army could have taken effective control of the state machinery on its own or in combination the civil service it appears was quite happy to facilitate the militarypolice grab of power we will return to this point later the one thing that stands out about members of the ghanaian junta and a factor which nkrumah deals with at some length is their utter lack of any political experience none of them had ever been involved in politics before the coup none of them ever took part in the liberation of their country from colonialism on the contrary several of them had respectable posts in the colonial army and police force both of which were used by the british imperialists to suppress the freedom movement which dr nkrumah and others successfully led indeed one of the junta members police officer deku played some part in the arrest and imprisonment of nkrumah himself in the preindependence days when the british colonialists were engaged in the harassment and suppression of nkrumahs proindependence convention peoples party in view of all this the reader may well ask for whom then did these latterday patriots choose to liberate ghana when their country was a happy hunting ground of british colonial exploiters they not only did nothing to liberate it they zealously collaborated with the foreign exploiter to suppress those who struggled for a genuine liberation now that the fruits of that struggle were beginning to flourish our loyal police and military officers come on the scene topple their own countrys popularly elected government while mumbling hypocritical phrases about national liberation the evidence for the inference that the juntas loyalties are to foreign imperialists and not to ghana or africa does not have to be derived solely from nkrumahs book a member of the junta col a afrifa has himself written a book on the coup the ghana coup london frank cass  in this book afrifa argues among other things that the coup became necessary because nkrumahs panafricanist goals were misguided he makes clear that the quest for african liberation and unity was wrong that what was necessary was the strengthening of ghanas relations with britain and the british empire now known as the commonwealth in his own words organization of african unity or no organization of african unity i will claim my citizenship of ghana and of the commonwealth in any part of the world i have been trained in the united kingdom as a soldier and i am prepared to fight alongside my friends in the united kingdom in the same way as canadians and australians will do how could we be friends belonging to the commonwealth and stay out in time of commonwealth adversity here then is a mind trained to be loyal to its imperialist master and a mind which becomes outraged by any suggestion that an independent african state has any right to stay out in time of the empires adversity whatever that might be this slavish hankering for a return to the womb of the mother country is not confined to the members of the junta the prominent civilian supporters of the regime are generally men who have in the past shown  their hatred of complete independence for their country as nkrumah points out p  some of these men eg dr busia even petitioned the british government in the s against granting independence to the then gold coast arguing that the country was not yet ready for such independence the coup has presumably given them an opportunity to put their peculiar principles into practice it will be interesting to see what sort of politicalconstitutional contraption they will put together for the newly liberated ghana
as already indicated one feature of the men spearheading the coup u in ghana is their common record of loyal service to the british colonial regime that preceded the nkrumah government the question naturally arises as to why nkrumah continued to maintain an army a police force and a civil service all of whose top officers were largely a carryover from the colonial past if you are going to set up a revolutionary government dedicated to radically new policy orientations and programs surely the last person you want to work with is the erstwhile defender of the imperialist presence why then did nkrumah assume that he could pursue his radical policies at home and abroad with the assistance of the inherited forces of conservatism and reaction nkrumah argues that his pursuit of both ghanaian socioeconomic development and panafricanism necessitated the africanization of the state structures wherever possible he points out for example that ghana would have presented an uninspiring picture in panafricanist circles if its national army were british officered p  it was therefore necessary to put africans in charge and the individuals available for this were those who had served in the colonial army or police force this reviewer remains somewhat unimpressed with this argument the africanization argument is fraught with all kinds of illusions after all what is the difference between a whiteofficered army and a blackofficered one if both sets of officers owe allegiance to foreign interests in ghana it seems quite evident that army officers like afrifa steeped in british traditions and modes of thought as revealed partly in the above citation from his book were as much a liability for nkrumahs government as any actual whitefaced british officers would have been to suppose there was any advantage in substituting black officers for white regardless of the ideological orientation of those same black officers was quite illusory when we look at the civil service bureaucracy we are again struck by the prevalence here too of the colonial hangover as in the army and police as already suggested the civil service seems to have welcomed the armypolice coup warmly and to have proceeded to serve the new regime quite loyally how is it that these bureaucrats could switch political masters just as easily as women change fashions nkrumahs answer here is that the civil service had a tradition of serving whatever government was in power and that therefore they went along with the new regime p  here again one feels this is only a very partial explanation after all the ghanaian civil service cannot have had any tradition of serving whatever government was in power it can only have had experience of two types of governmentthe colonial and the postindependence governments if the suggestion in the book is that the civil service even in the colonial era developed the tradition of serving any government the inference is quite wrong the colonial regime was one and the same throughout the colonial period no matter how frequent the turnover of british governors and top officials might be these were changes of personnel not of system it is therefore quite erroneous to say the civil service had a tradition of serving any government a more accurate judgement is the one nkrumah hints at when he observes many of the senior officials all originally served with the old colonial regime which had opposed trade unionism and socialism in any form and was against any real representation of the people in government   behind the scenes the civil servants always looked back to the colonial times when their senior membersin practice ran the country p  what emerges from the foregoing discussion is the existence in a country like ghana of several significant centers of powerarmy police and bureaucracyall of which were manned at the most vital sensitive levels by personnel whose political loyalties were at best equivocal nkrumah gives several illustrations of the unreliability of some of these top officials thus for example at one time he asked the attorney general to investigate a case of diamond smuggling it transpired that the linchpin in this operation was a certain white man who had some years previously been deported from ghana he had however been readmitted into the country after his deportation order had been revoked by police commissioner harlley see above harlley of course had no such authority by then he simply used nkrumahs name to revoke the deportation order without bothering to obtain the presidents permission the information relating to the deportee and his contacts with top officers of the ghanaian police force was passed by the attorney general on to the chief of the civil service so he could pass it on to the president the said chief however did not see it that way and the information never reached the president until much later though even then it did not reach him through the usual channels see pp  it is clear that the army police and bureaucratic apparatus in ghana were fertile ground for intrigues and any foreigninspired attempts to subvert the government of the day with officers of such unreliability and doubtful loyalty any foreign interests intent on removing nkrumah from power would have a relatively easy time of doing it this possibility seems to have in fact been exploited by at least one foreign power let us quote the author himself in ghana the embassies of the united states britain and west germany were all implicated in the plot to overthrow my government it is alleged that u s ambassador franklin williams offered the traitors  million dollars to carry out a coup detat afrifa harlley and kotoka were to get a large share of this if they would assassinate me at accra airport as i prepared to leave for hanoi i understand afrifa said i think i will fail and declined the offer so apparently did the others and who is this franklin williams who allegedly attempted to buy ghanaian army and police officers to kill their own president let us again allow the author to speak it is particularly disgraceful that it should have been an afroamerican ambassador who sold himself out to the imperialists and allowed himself to be used in this way it was this same man who deliberately lied when he publicly described the coup as bloodless however his treachery provides a sharp reminder of the insidious ways in which the enemies of africa can operate in the usa the uncle tom figure is well known p  the lesson from all this is that those progressive african governments which would survive the strains and stresses of the present era in the world must keep constantly on the look out for the enemy from without and from within in these days of neocolonialism a foreign power bent on toppling the government of some small underdeveloped republic does not have to dispatch an army to accomplish the purpose all that is necessary is to find some reliable natives willing to act catspaw for a fee and to pay them accordingly the result can then be hailed from the rooftops as a great victory for democracy and freedom and the former leaders can then be denounced and maligned as if they never made any positive contribution to their country hence in ghana today nkrumahs contributions to ghanas achievement of independence to the economic development of his country to its educational and social advance and to the struggle for african liberation and unity etc all these tremendous contributions are deemed unworthy even of perfunctory mention by the partisans of the nlc instead all the praise is being heaped on the foreign business men who have been scouring the country in a desperate attempt to make a fat buck whilst the going is good the african revolution if it is to succeed at all will never do so on the basis of indiscriminate alliances and compromises between progressive forces and decadent proimperialist elements what is required is the establishment of a thoroughgoing revolutionary movement based on mass support and participation and resting on a politically reliable institutional base the revolution is made by the people it is for the people its survival and the realization of its objectives belong with the people its makers the objectives of the revolution cannot be attained through the agency of those whose sympathies lie

sam greenlee author of the novel the spook who sat by the door says that eight american publishers turned down his novel and that he finally had to take it to england to get it published it is easy to understand why the spook who sal by the door is perhaps the first black revolutionary novel to be published by a whiteowned commercial publishing firm either in america or england this is decidedly not to ignore the black commandos by juiian moreau a revolutionary novel which was privately published in  now with mr greenlees novel out there in the world of books where it cannot be entirely overlooked there is a good chance that an american publisher will be persuaded to consideror reconsiderit and since nothing is more imitative than a commercial publisher perhaps attention will turn in turn to mr moreaus novel this however is an occasion for discussing mr greenlees novel in brief the novel concerns the adventures of one dan freeman a bright young man out of chicagos south side who travels the familiar route from grating poverty up to middleclass comfort via government employment mr freeman even achieves one of those firsts the black bourgeoisie is known to pursue with such passion and that in this case is the heart of the story dan freeman is selected as the first negro member of the central intelligence agency cia and he gets the chancethe coveted opportunity to sit by the door so that all the world knows that the cia is integrated but author greenlee has more things up his sleeve than the rise to eminence to one enterprising bourgie and satire is one of them his treatment of the machinations of dan freeman in the world of politics and power is light slick and hip seriousness nevertheless lies at the center of freemans adventures and at the core of the novel dan freeman is no ordinary bourgie he is one of a breed that is going to be the key to any real alteration of the oppressive american system he is an undercover revolutionary the bulk of the novel deals with what dan freeman does whento the astonishment of nearly everybody he resigns his prestigious government position and returns to chicago to do social work among the troublesome gangs in the city and it would be unfair to potential readers of the novel to tell what finally happens beyond the fact that the novels climax is a kind of watts turned upsidedown it is not unfair though to say that very little that happens is by chance dan freeman who was smart enough to grow up in the ghetto with a record clean enough to clear him for the cia is a young man of very special talents most of which are also possessedundevelopedby thousands of similarly bright young men on the street corners and in the poolrooms and dan freeman sets it as his special task to help develop those latent talents and to give them a new direction the first reaction to mr greenlees novel is applause here is a book which presents a black hero who is both angry and clever a combination which seems all too rare in the racial hustings but even more important the man is committed and he has translated his commitment into practical patterns of action designed to empower the black community in one area where power counts mr greenlees hero begins where the heroes of many black novels end with the knowledge that he lives in a racist society which gives no evidence at all of lifting the real barriers against black freedom and mobility he has faced that reality and made his own decision on the surface he has decidedas his counterparts are expected toto make the best of a bad situation and grab what comforts and advantages are made available to him he has it made with a playboy pad a sleek imported sports car lots of bunny broads and a sophistication garnered from traveling over the world and on the periphery of high places as a favored government employee but mr greenlees hero is cursed with honesty and a clear vision he knows that the life he seems to be living is an illusion and so he rejects it the other life is more dangerous of course but it is the only one he can live and still respect himself dan freeman then is an authentic black hero a revolutionary man andas suchhe is more than a little welcome upon the literary scene but while mr greenlees black hero is both timely and appropriate he does not breathe adequately as flesh and blood mr greenlee strives understandably to stress the superficially the phoniness of his heros personality when superficiality and phoniness are aspects of his cover and yet there are only occasions when the depth and complexity and ambiguity of dan freemans character emerge selfevident undeclared by the author a serious flaw of the novel is the absence of an object against which dan freemans humanity might be bounced he is too much purposeful too little warmth and yet some of this is possibly intended as a writer mr greenlee is swiftpaced and competent even when he dwells a bit too attentively on details of scene and gesture his style is quick and orderly the novel is brief and it is perhaps designed as an entertainment a book to be read first and savored for a long while afterwards the books hero is portrayed as a man of action sureminded and determined and that might be the characterization the author wanted to emphasize in any case the spook who sat by the door sets a publishing precedent it is about a black hero who goes systematically about the business of putting black_power to one of its more effective uses and that is revolutionaryh w fuller
he began to feel the prickle of boredom running down his spine and not for the first time that day he thought how extraordinary it must be to be able to talk to a woman of his own kind in an intelligent fashion the black skin shone on his impassive face as he listened to the beat the ebb and flow of talk around him and what the lights glow on the so casually plunging necklines of the women in the room why he wondered was it that a woman of his own african race could walk calmly down the street with her breast swinging bare as she suckled her infant while white women like the fat blonde who sat next to him this evening with her breasts covered but only just demanded attention for her body he was well aware that he could have heror any woman in the room for that matterfor the taking he was not the only african to have belonged to this consciously leftist drearily bohemian group of white people the hit and run liberals others had told him a little about the group but knowledge killed desire and the white skin that should have fascinated repelled him the blonde was saying something to him now he listened i think these meetings of ours are wonderful dont you ncato the husky tone filled her plainest remark with a sexual meaning she was wearing a skirt made of patches of brightly colored material and a black blouse and as she leaned forward to talk to him the blouse fell open the neckline loose displaying the soft rolls of fat right down to her navel she was an improvement on the others he thought he liked her blunt use of his name without prefix or title or query yes he said his tone was flat they are interesting and all the time the false air of comradeship was about him stifling like a cloud of smoke the whites were too hearty the blacks too obsequious there was an unreality about it all she was flirting with him now rubbing her shoulder against him leaning towards him suggesting that she might give him a lift homeand to bedin the big green buick that belonged to her husband he rose to his feet suddenly and looked down at her forcing a smile thank you he said i will walk home i have a headache the cold air outside was like a bath after the stink of perfume and liquor and cigarettes and he came out into it with a deep sense of loss and loneliness education could cut a man like himself off from his own people the women of his race were still chattels to be bought and sold to work and to bear children if he wanted to marry a girl of his own color he would have to look for her in the states and according to all he had heard that didnt work out too well either the men of his race if they were educated became different enslaved with white mens ways and fashions white mens drink and women it is like the loneliness of frankenstein he thought there are no words for it but the sharp air of winter was like a creamy hand on the flesh of his face and as he climbed the hill to the native location the ghetto of the black people the moon shone through the short fir trees until they stood up like dark tufts against the horizon they are like african hair he told himself and suddenly with a great excitement he knew that he must paint them he switched on the light in the bare little room that served him as study and living quarters in oneand pulled out his box of oils and the thick pad of woven paper he always used because it was cheaper than proper canvas he worked swiftly his mind still seeing the queer dark tufts in the moonlight he used the stubs of his brushes to get the cotton wool effect of the trees it was well into the night before he was finished the exhilaration was with him still as he started to put away his things it was probably the best he had done yet he was so carried away by it that he scarcely heard the soft tap of fingers on his door it was the blonde what do you want he asked and then angered by the disturbance the intrusion on his privacy he said brutally do you want me to go to bed with you she flinched a little at that but she answered him evenly enough frank speech was always encouraged in the group no she said i was passing and saw your light still on it was a good five miles out of her direct route home then she caught sight of the picture which he had propped up against a jug on the table the better to look at it ncato that is pretty have you just finished it i didnt know that you painted he said nothing to that for part of him the greater part was artist and was predominant over the part of him that was african as an artist he liked to hear his work being praised even by this bitchblonde she could not take her eyes away from the painting it was as if she had transferred her desire for his body to his painting he saw behind the light greygreen eyes the avidity of her the animal need that was there he saw her wet pink lips i want that picture she said petulant now how much do you want for it what will you take it was late and a great weariness overtook him and the loneliness he looked at the picture memorizing it i do not want it he said in the flat expressionless voice that he normally used you may have it he placed it in her outstretched grasping hands
mass education meant more in ghana villagers deep in the forests were under instructors cutting a way through the trees and undergrowth and building fewer roads to the main routes to the towns so that they could exchange their produce for previously unknown goods in the shops and link themselves with the social and cultural development which was sweeping the country they built halls and schools dug trenches for irrigation organized the collection of refuse thereby improving sanitation this was an extraordinary voluntary cooperation in personal progress and community betterment the youth was organized and known as the national workers brigade to perform community service the boys were apprenticed in masonry carpentry plumbing automobile fitting electrical engineering vehicle mechanics and tractor operations the girls learned the marketing of produce food preservation household duties secretarial and office duties they were sent to different camps for their training here was a nation recruiting its youth not principally in military forces but into a disciplined army devoted entirely to constructive community activity as an index of the national economic growth the gnp rose from £ million in  to £ million in  percentage increase was from  percent annual growth to  percent growth rate in  something should be said about the man dr nkrumah the leader of the ghana movement his conception of socialism demands personal services in contrast with personal gain british and american newspaper reports have many times presented a different image the public in these two countries as well as in their satellite nations have been given the  picture of a man who sought grandeur and ostentation when corruption invaded his ministers secretaries of departments he demanded that each of his ministers should reveal his income and possessions and how they were obtained the clue to the corrupt behaviors of his ministers was their construction of palatial mansions which they could not afford in their circumstances and salaries he on behalf of the government insisted that they should show examples to the nation that they should surrender all financial and business interests and live at reasonable standard ministers who did not conform were dismissed two among those dismissed were later reappointed partly in recognition of their past service to ghanaian freedom and partly because of their later adherence to principle their abilities and influence dr nkrumah believed in the complete freedom of all africans people of african descent and other peoples of the world equality and dignity of the human being was his first order in life one may question why the leaders of the opposition were arrested and detained for long periods without trial why the disturbances in ghana why the attempts to assassinate him the answers lie in understanding what african socialism means and what was the stage of alien political development in ghana inherited from the colonial administration dr nkrumahs government espoused socialism as an economic system in the context of african communalism which in no way is a prototype of european socialism de graft johnson made this clear when he wrote what our social structure which may be termed communalism cannot cope with is the modern world with its capitalist industries and our task here is to adapt the principles of socialism to our own particular mode of life alternately we can develop our basic traditional institutions in keeping with the basic principles of communalism to fit modern conditions i think we shall attempt both in african political systems there were never opposition parties per se people were active and participated fully in town and village discussions as a body gave their assent and registered their opposition to issues as they arose there was unity in diversity it was the paramount chief who acted as the voice of the people the socialism of africa differs from the european type european socialism was born of conflict the conflict that was sanctified into a philosophy the class war was looked upon not as something evil but as something necessary and good as prayer is to christianity or to islam so civil war class war is to european versions of socialisma means inseparable from the end each becomes the basis of a whole way of life the european socialist cannot think of his socialism without its fathercapitalism such a contradiction africans find intolerable it virtually says that without capitalism and the conflict which it creates within any society there can be no socialism african socialism did not arise from the agrarian revolution it did not start from the existence of conflicting classes in society it started as a family society its objective is the extended family africans have no more need to be converted to socialism than they have to be taught democracy europeans and other imperialists remain ignorant of the fact that socialism and democracy are rooted in the african past which produced contemporary africans these africans acknowledge that socialism must look to wider horizons for the extended family nyerete stated modern african socialism    can no longer confine the idea of the social family within the limits of the tribe nor indeed of the nation for no true african socialist can look at a line drawn on a map and say the people on this side of that line are my brothers but these who happen to live on the other side of it have no claim on me every individual on this african continent is his brother    the above also portrays nkrumahs socialism every african national leader had been engaged in the supreme need to build a sense of nationhood from diverse racial tribal and religious loyalties this has not been an easy task ghana had this problem particularly in the resistance of the ashanti and some northern peoples to incorporation in a united state it had to overcome the opposition of powerful chiefs regarded as the spiritual heads of communities as well as their political masters such chiefs are no more competent or capable of running the modern state nkrumah also inherited the bitter antagonism of the reactionary professional and business elite who he ousted as directors of the national movement the social disturbances were undoubtedly accented by conspiracies on the part of some of the opposition leaders who by all means were the paid agents of the british and the nato allies and the frustrated members of the cpp to overthrow the regime by assassinating president nkrumah some of those ghanaians who were definitely in the assassination plot which they attempted were apprehended and detained without trial their trial would have meant the death penalty and the pressure of public opinion would have made commutation of the sentence difficult the attacks on president nkrumahs life were misinterpreted by the western press as signs of unpopularity the facts prior to the coup point to a different direction the resistance of the ghanaian anglophiles the subversive activities of the local agents of the capitalist world the psychological poverty of arch tribalists and the unending quest to keep the black man down by the same ugly greedy and wicked imperialists account for the fall of nkrumahs government but not the man the coup on nkrumahs government february   dealt a catastrophic blow to the african continent take a statistic of the black world and see the identical damage done to our brave leaderspatrice lumumba of the congo balewa of nigeria malcolm_x of the usa those living but ousted from office president nkrumah and president ben bella of algeria why this pattern the answer is very clear to all thinking peoples the fall of nkrumahs government is the fall of africa and africans his leadership was a pacesetter a guiding star and an inspirational one since the tragedy the continent has fallen into oblivion the portuguese in angola and mozambique the ian smiths and harold wilsons the nazi republic of south africa and their international cohorts are happy ghana and ghanaians are no more independent if we understand what freedom and independence means how can it be free when a major sector of the economy has been taken over by the foreign capitalists ghana is now starting on the path of having apartheid schools the london sunday telegraph of march   writes the ghanaian staff of ashanti goldfields are incensed over the setting up of an allwhite primary school by the management and refusal to allow senior africans to form their staff association applications from ghanaian senior staff to enter their children in such schools have been rejected such a school never existed under nkrumah more than  private schools with a fee of £ have been established this is a move to deny the children of any average worker the opportunity for education on the political front  paramount chiefs as of february   have been destooled by the military regime terrorism is now the order of the day the ghanaian times of february  and   published thus reports coming from ashanti give cause for serious concern    in ashanti and the central regions and indeed in some other places in scattered areas of the country towns and villages in these areas of the country are being subjected to a wave of terrorism and dacoity unparalleled in the history of this country fear stalks the land    in many homes there is not a wink of sleep for man or woman armed robbery is showing upward surge because of the lowebbing relations between the public and the police what an insult to human intelligence the militarycumpolice regime has abolished political party organization it has proclaimed that governing a country without any party or parties is the surest way to ensure democracy what an illusion what a contradiction on the economic front the ghana trade union congress which had pledged its support to the nlc is now begging for recognition which it had under nkrumahs government the u s capitalists have grabbed the ghana economy the firestone rubber company has taken over the stateoperated rubber plantations the u s international hotels corporation now controls all former state hotels advertisement for a managerial post for the nowcontrolled hotels stipulated quite clearly that ghanaian or african applicants will not be considered the economy is stagnating despite the assurance given by britain and the u s a that neocolonialism and capitalism will triumph in ghana as a payment for the criminal coup the british promised a loan of £ and the usa  million 
finally the most outrageous act of the military regime is the sending away in ghanaian airways all the nationalist refugees from angola mozambique southern rhodesia south west africa and the republic of south africa back to their respective places of origin their military and police escorts handed them over to the imperialist authorities for their final destruction such is the situation the democracy and newlywon freedom for the ghanaians and africa the direct causes of the imperialists attack on nkrumah before the independence of ghana the currency authority was the west african currency board established in  by executive decree of the colonial office with headquarters in london the wacb was nothing other than a local agent the control of the commercial banks was under the wacb the monetary policy adopted was at the whims and caprices of the wacb and principally at the dictation of london on march   three days before ghana became independent the central bank of ghana was established it thus became the sole bank of issue the banker to the government and other commercial banks the fiscal agent of the government in dealing with important international financial institutions eg the international monetary fund and the world bank it also operated for the government in exchange control as the sole bank of issue it had the power to influence the credit situation with a view to maintaining monetary stability in ghana and the external value of the ghana pound the cbg originated a local money market by issuing on behalf of the government day treasury bills this enabled the ghanaians to invest their money domestically it also curtailed the volume of funds transferred out of ghana to britain such transfers were of a high magnitude prior to the establishment of the central bank the central bank created an atmosphere which encouraged the establishment of indigenous owned and operated commercial banks and also the expansion of branches of the older ones between march  and november  branch banks increased from  to  this was the breaking of the monopoly position of the british barclays bank dominion colonial and overseas ltd and bank of west africa ltd since the monopoly position was threatened the foreign owners mounted a series of attacks on the nkrumah government we can see how sincere the british position is free competition in britain and monopoly in africa in line with the goal for relative economic independence a reduction in the high shipping costs of ghanian exports the ghana national shipping line was established after  formerly all exports from and imports to ghana had been carried by the british shipping firms the profits from such services accrued to britain the prohibitive shipping charges reduced the profit margin that could have gone to ghana passenger service provided by the shipping firms was controlled by the british with the establishment of the ghana black star line national shipping line the charges on exports and passenger services were reduced to reasonable levels the profits became a source of revenue to be used in financing other economic development projects as well as in expanding the shipping lines a third case of monopoly is the air lines colonial ghana had no national airways the air transport was owned operated and controlled by the british overseas airways corporationair france and panamerican air lines with independence and the establishment of the ghana airways corporation the monopoly position of the british was demolished more revenue was thereby secured for ghana the purchase of some aircraft from the soviet union instead of the more costly ones manufactured by the nato countries contributed to the animosity directed at nkrumahs government the african continent had been described as the sleeping giant dr nkrumah called the african allafrican peoples conference in  this conference brought political leaders trade unionists nationalists and others from different works of life together for a common endeavourthe complete liberation of the continent from foreign domination nkrumah had declared in his independence message of march   that he would not consider ghana free and independent as long as any portion of the african soil remained under foreign control ghana provided free transportation for revolutionary refugees from the racialist nightmare of angola mozambique southern rhodesia south west africa and the republic of south africa it also aided guinea when it elected to be her own boss and to chart her own destiny rather than remain in the french community and be a province of france imagine such an anarchronism part of the african continent a portion of france making black africans frenchmen this destroys the work of nature the colonial nato countries jubilantly anticipated the collapse of guinea when france pulled out taking with it everything including paperclips and toilet tissue before  the african continent had been balkanized brothers and sisters husbands and wives and even tribes were arbitrarily and forcibly separated by the unnatural political boundaries drawn by the greedy europeans today some problems that confront african countries are the offshoots of the unnatural boundaries to overcome such unending division nkrumah by political action and marriage involved the whole of north africa in the united and collective effort of breaking down the artificial disgraceful wall that had separated the african land mass and its peoples finally nkrumah with the cooperation of the late w e b du bois and george padmore initiated the dialogue on the possibility of publishing encyclopedia africana for the purpose of placing african historical cultural and social achievements of antiquity in proper perspective for all these reasons the nato powers mounted their attack on this great african one thing is clear to the patriotic african in fledgling states imperialists interest flourish where there is an atmosphere of dissension they are endangered in an atmosphere of national unity and stability some people have accused the government of having too much power over the national economy i have to remind those people that under colonial administration the little postal telegraphic and rail communications broadcasting electricity and water services that existed were all publicly owned and administered nobody domestically or internationally raised a cry of woe but as soon as the ghanaians under nkrumahs direction added an airline a shipping line a central bank loud echoes of dictatorship started to roar in the firmament since then ghana has met with active resistance from vested interest groups within and without in the effort to build a national economy jules ferry premier of france in  when he spoke in the chamber of deputies in defence of the colonial policy of the french government stated thus it is not clear that the great states of modern europe the moment their industrial power is founded are confronted with an immense and difficult problem which is the basis of industrial life the very condition of existencethe question of markets have you not seen the great industrial nations one by one arrive at a colonial policy and we can say that this colonial policy is a luxury for modern nations not at all gentlemen this policy is for all of us a necessity like the market itself today as you know the law of supply and demand freedom of exchange the influence of speculations all these move in a circle which extends to the ends of the world colonies are for rich countries one of the most lucrative methods of investigating capital  i say that france which is glutted with capital and which has exported considerable quantities has an interest in looking at this side of the colonial question it is the same question as that of outlets for our manufacture the same situation applies to the motives of neocolonialists and imperialists albert sarraut french colonial secretary of state in  spoke in stronger terms in paris what is the use of painting the truth at the start colonization was not an act of civilization nor was it a desire to civilize it was an act of force motivated by interests an episode in the vital competition which from man to man from group to group has gone on ever increasing the people who set out to seize colonies in distant lands were thinking primarily of themselves and were working for their own profits and conquering for their own power the origin of colonization is nothing else than enterprise of individual interests a onesided and egotistical imposition of the strong upon the weak you can see who really thinks of nkrumah as a dictator is it the true african no no it is the neocolonialists and their lackeys in ghana and the rest of africa the coup was effected by the imperialists lackeys in ghana in concert with thier international neocolonialist powers whatever might have happened nkrumahs philosophy remains indestructible and will be fostered in africa and in ghana as long as this planet earth exists
