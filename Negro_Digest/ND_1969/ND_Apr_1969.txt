nineteen hundred and  sixty nine over  p million americans of crrs rm african descent still ix fincj themselves occupying space in a foreign land a land that is alien to them and even though they know it is alien to them they are still crawling for crumbs refusing to accept the inescapable fact that we are not wanted here because we are not needed here unfortunately black actors belong to and are a part of that same oppressed minority there is nothing they can do about this fact the choice has been imposed upon them by racist white america so it would seem that they would all immediately join some black organization and begin to work side by side with their other brothers and sisters toward building a black nation the signs are all around us america is erupting its splitting at the seams but rather than face m  this reality black actors continue to keep on pushing trying to reach the top obsessed with the ideal of making it yet when a select few do reach the top they find it is somehow still the bottom because white people are still running the show so they wrap their troubles in a sack of dreams and keep on keepin on each day swallowing another lie dying another death trying to adapt to this mans culture a way of life that is directly opposed to their very existence they refuse to believe that they have bought a lie the myth of the american dream that perversion which says one nation under god with liberty and justice foi all to some degree this would have been true if the wording had been slightly changed to one white nation under one white god with liberty and justice for white folks only but somehow the forefathers neglected to include this most important fact you see everything white people do or have ever done culturally socially economically and politically has been solely to perpetuate their power andor to maintain the status quo history proves this to be so so it behooves us all to stop struggling  and to decide now who we are and ¦ what we are the hand is on the « gate we are at war in this coun try and we cant continue to aimlessly wonder around in negro confusion searching for a perverted dream these are the cold faced facts make up your mind do you continue to help the man help himself or do you go back and begin to help your own to help themselves and we can only help our own by first ripping ourselves away from that american dream somehow black actors shy away from this decision because they see in this choice the necessity of giving up something precious rather than gaining something vital they see in this choice a denial of some material comfort which they now afford or hopefully someday will be able to afford they are stuck with a slave mentality and would somehow rather let white people continue to take care of them giving them jobs and telling them how when and what to act they seemingly have so little confidence in themselves as black men and women that they refuse to break these ties they are afraid to stand up and accept the responsibility of controlling their own lives and providing work for themselves so instead they go around spouting universal phrases of humanity which will allow them to maintain their solo position in the unchanging system if they would just sit quietly and ask themselves how do i see myself in relationship to my physical surroundings brother leroi jones answers the question very simply slave or free black or white eitheror there is no in between but many brothers and sisters because of their basic feeling of inferiority refuse to accept this so that they continue to operate out of a negro bag its as if they see themselves in a grey world an assimilatedintegrated world but the assimilation of something is the complete destruction of one thing for another thing when you take on the other thing you also take on a different name and consequently you are not the same thing anymore you have forgotten the first thing in order to become the second thing so when it all boils down  you are still left with two choices black or white because for black people to view the world through greyintegrated eyes is really the same as viewing it through white eyes theyre simply straddling the fence occupying space theyre neither one thing nor the other theyre immobile indefinite and indecisive and more important their silence is an endorsement of white power and to be black and to endorse white power is a very dangerous position to take because they are then working directly against their people if they would appraise this situation properly they would see that this condition occurs because of an insatiable hunger for personal power and recognition a thirst for authority and dictatorship which stems from the need to constantly prove themselves prove that they exist so it seems that everyone wants to be the master and no one wants to be the slave but its not about me and i anymore its about striving toward nationhood and peoplehood its about bridging the gap between niggernegro and black its about unity which is the only solution to our struggle  for liberation unity means working together all our forces and resources co « operatively to build and develop black institutions institutions which will hopefully begin to blacken all the whiteness we find ourselves surrounded with everyday  so the next question becomes how can we do this and still survive again the answer is unity once we begin to think collectively we can begin to bring about a change change suggests revolution and revolution is a very frightening word most socalled black actors dont fully understand the depth or the meaning of this word nor do they understand the seriousness of their plight so they refer to themselves in meaningless nonpolitical and romantic terms constantly appearing and posturing on television rapping and chitterchatting about some phase of blackness or making pseudomilitant statements in magazines and newspapers concerning the emergence of this new phenomenon called black theater consistently associating the word with community theater which in turn means nonprofessional or amateur theater well i hate to shatter their illusions but the very words black artistblack theater inherently have political connotations and black artists can no longer divorce themselves from this issue no more than they can continue to divorce themselves from their people if black theaters are to be at all valid they must meet the psychological needs of all black people they must bring the people closer to an awareness of who they really are they must be used as a tool to strengthen and to build enlighten and to elevate and they must be totally run by black peopie who view the world blackly and in order to view the world blackly you must first decrude yoursif that is purge yourself of all those years of white indoctrination and white ideology living black then becomes a full time job because to live black is to think black to think black is to feel black to feel black is to act black to act black is to know black to know black is to build black and to build black is to be black just as there are churches on every corner there must be theaters on every corner theaters which will put into practice the principles of blackness theaters run by black artists who with all their beings will create black forces forces which will help tear down the walls of western rigidness and sterility forces which will lead black people out of bondage theaters which will pour out new images new symbols new patterns of thought theaters which will clear away all the old dehumanizing forms of cliches that for centuries have blocked the way we must place our energies in a new direction a direction whicn goes out instead of up leading us back to our original sourceand at the very core of that source is a spiritual tradition black theaters must portray these people so that they can see themselves in all their glory and once again walk proud praising themselves and their blackness biack people are a feeling peopie a sincere sympathetic and giving people a soulful people full of love and vitality a people with a conscience and this conscience must permeate black theaters everywhere well it seems that black artists have a tremendous task they must consciously and willfully commit themselves to change and this commitment must stem from a deep compassion and love a love that is so moving so charged with emotion that it will destroy any and all evil evil that blocks the way and keeps us from building a more beautiful and healthy world a world where black people can love laugh and sing again black artists must sing new revolutionary songs songs which will force black people to turn into themselvesinto the really real of themselvesnot the full fearing fear of themselvesnot the confused cagingcage of themselves not the aimlessaim of themselves but the fieryfire of themselves the sparklingsparkle of themselves the manwoman of themselves their voices must help black people stretch outpull in transcend step out of that narrow western concept of themselves that way of life that is killing the real self of themselves their voices must change the myself of themselves into the ourself of themselves let these images drip down for the us of ourselves giving strength and determination to all those who are a part of the us of ourselves let these images roll out into the real world giving guidance and direction but first black artists must show the real of themselves to themselves before they can teach the world to sing again do it quickly time is running out
plays with themes about black people p sprang up all over new  york during the past year however this activity is not to be confused with black theater which is still going through hard times struggling to gain a foothold in black communities if black theater is that theater written directed produced and financed by blacks located in black areas and geared to black audiences then few plays of the last year qualify they were mostly located downtown and designed to attract that theatergoing we shall overcome blackandwhitetogether crowd the most ballyhooed play to open this past season with a black theme was howard sacklers the great white hope the stillrunning broadway hit is based on the life of former heavyweight champion jack johnson and gives veteran actor james earl jones a vehicle for a bravura performance a black person attending the play had best keep in mind that this is a white mans version of jack johnson just as william styrons book is a white mans version of nat turner take a hard look at it forgetting all the rave reviews and see that many of the old stereotypes creep through for instance johnsons white woman is sanctified and idealized to the heavens while his black woman is depicted as a constantly nagging shrew be aware that the real jack johnson married three white women with at least one rumored to be a whore another play wellreviewed by new yorks white liberal audience is big time buck white supposedly a satire on the shenanigans of black militants what it turns out to be is a white author creating amos n andy images of black men to the immense pleasure of his predominantly white audience honey man weasel hunter rubber band and jive get those names spend the first threequarters of the play shouting signifying shuffling and cussing about how to divide up the antipoverty money they belong to an organization called beautiful allelujah days bad everyone is waiting for buck white and when he came out during the last quarter of the play i hoped that he would bring order to the chaos instead he evasively answered questions from the audience some of whom were plants i never knew whether he was serious or just putting everyone down the answers were usually uninformative and irrelevant to the rest of the play big time buck white has no meaning for black people a satire on some of the absurdities of the more rhetorical militants we may need but a satire on black militants by a white writer we can do without the next major opening was ed bullins in the wine time at the new lafayette theatre in harlem in this play which depicts a day in the life of tenementdweller qiff dawson his wife his nephew and assorted neighbors bullins proves that he is our top playwright his characterizations of the black urban poor are without par today cliff is a harddrinking shell of a man whom the oppressive system has beaten down despite his tough talk he has decided to escape into his wine bottle his defeat is not yet total though and he halfheartedly tries to encourage his nephew ray to break out of the oppressive cycle the two chief flaws of wine time are a somewhat abrupt seemingly forced ending and the lack of one character to suggest concrete ways for the entrapped black poor to break the vicious cycle a community theater assumes this responsibility it is hoped that bullins future plays will do this wine time is a good play and gave the new lafayette  theater a good vehicle to launch good black theater in harlem much further downtown the douglas turner wardrobert hooks negro ensemble company nec started off its new season with ray mclvers god is a guess what harshly criticized last year for not doing a play written by a black american playwright nec this season scheduled four such plays unfortunately their first offering proved a disappointment god is a guess what is a cute piece of trivia about an attempted lynching of a virtuous negro jim by two southern rednecks jim has faith that his god will rescue him from the evil whites and sure enough he does just before the dastardly deed is completed god bursts on stage not black not white but a suavely neutral gray proceeding to deliver long and profound monologues on brotherhood there had been a little snap to the play before god appeared but after his entrance it was all down hill the play was oldfashioned and resembled something that a local high school drama class would love to do in fact mclver wrote it as an exercise in a college drama class years ago its production was a waste of necs talent and i hope that their subsequent productions will be more challenging these are ceremonies in dark old men by lonne elder iii which deals with a harlem family an evening of one acts a program of plays drawn from the black experience and man better man by earl hill which is set in the west indies another interesting play is the believers directed by barbara ann teer currently shown off broadway which gives highlights of black history through the use of music in january robert riches message from the grass roots ran at the james weldon johnson theater arts center in east harlem based on the life of malcolm_x it covered a year period of his life what we get is a white playwrights interpretation of what he wanted malcolm to be not the forceful black nationalist which brother malcolm was riche almost made him into a minor martin_luther_king jr the play did contain a strong performance by  dennis tate as minister william malcolm he has a striking facial resemblance on stage and the voice imitation was almost perfect leroi jones spirit house players are still active in newark using the theater to increase the black consciousness level of newarks black majority it is hoped that this in turn will help to achieve the political aim of electing a black mayor in  another active local group is the afroamerican studio for acting and speech which is headed by ernie mcclintock performing only on weekends they did highly competent productions of amen corner moon on a rainbow shawl and black nativity this group has survived over a year in harlem with no foundation or city financial support they are deserving of support from those who endorse black theater the east wind cafe is another harlembased enterprise which provides an outlet for black arts devotees mostly poetry readings are held there but anyone who has seen what black poets are into know that this is true black theater besides the plays mentioned above black performers are in several nonracial shows on and off broadway these include hello dolly hair boys in the band and riot a yearold black musician harold wheeler is the or w  chestra conductor for the hit musical promises promises it would be a mistake to assume that all this activity signals an upsurge of black theater as critic clive barnes of the new york times so loudly proclaims except for the new lafayette the spirit house and the afroamerican studio none are located in black communities and except for these three none operate out of a philosophy of cultural nationalism true black theater is still in dire need of support financial and otherwise from those who yearn for the development of a strong and viable ethnic theater

as the key thrust of the fnr foregoing reports on black theater across the land is that black theater still is searching still gathering its forces still languishing in a state of hope and pregnancy despite the emergence of an exciting new talent like ed bullins the undoubtedly great potential of black theater in america remains as yet unrealized which is not entirely negative there must be time for the new voices to gain their strength the process of weaning is not yet complete the influence of the american commercial theater in particular and of western theater tradition in general hover heavily over the new talent perverting it when not strangling it too often the older voices are too fundamentally entwined with the dogma of the past to speak with relevance to ears attuned to the present and the newer fresher voices have not yet found the form with which to force the final breakthrough the young playwrights whose work was brought before the public in the special issue of the drama review edited by ed bullins was proof enough of the new spirit and of the great potential and the new paperback anthology which bullins has prepared under the bantam label will extend this young people like edd johnson of new orleans a writer with the nat turner theater and carolyn rodgers of chicago a writer with the obac workshop are stretching their imaginations and coming up with exciting ideas for the black theater and of course the leroi jonesfounded theater of reality at spirit house in newark continues to experiment occasionally touring the campuses at the invitation of black student groups black theater continues aborn ing then but in the meantime black people are involved increasingly in some theater activity in the principal population centers of the country during the past year in new york for example a number of productions featured black performers among them poetry and folk music of american negroes in central park with roscoe lee browne ellen holly cicely tyson amanda ambrose josephine premice gloria foster and leon bibb riot with margo jefferson and tony harrington jr a play brought to the broadway united church of christ by the om theater workshop of boston christophe at the brooklyn academy of music with j a preston and marilyn berry the cuban thing on broadway with jane white big time buck white transported from watts with dick williams arnold williams and ron rich americana pastoral at the greenwich mews with marcella lowery ron oneal and louise stubbs cities in bezique at the public theater with paul benjamin joan harris and cynthia belgrave god bless at the yale repertory theater with carl lee message from the grassroots at the james weldon johnson theater arts center with dennis tate as malcolm and walk down mah street at the players theater with kenneth frett and lorraine feather the new lafayette theater and the new heritage repertory theater in harlem were joined by the national black theater workshop inc under the direction of the dynamic barbara ann teer also its founder in february miss teer reported the following we are in the first phase of our program training the company we have spent the last five months experimenting with new techniques of working and are developing totally new and different methods of communication our goal is to establish a black art standard the first word deleted from our theatrical vocabulary was the word actor we have declared ourselves liberators keeping in mind that before we can psychologically liberate black people we must ourselves first be liberated in order to do this we have had to expose and analyze all our niggernegroness because liberators must first be strong wholesome positive africanamericans completely committed to revolution and revolutionary black art we have therefore through a process of decruding ourselvesthat is cleansing our minds so that we can change images reappropriate values and constantly strive to reaffirm our spiritual essencebecome revolutionary black artists the national black theater workshop inc is aiming at a major production for this spring officers of the theater with miss teer are larry neal charlie russell bill strickland velma banks and shirley mckie the negro ensemble company downtown opened in february with ceremonies in dark old men a play by lonne elder iii of the nec staff the play was received with guarded enthusiasm by the new york times drama critic clive barnes it was the second play of the necs second season by a black american writer the first play was ray mclvers comedy god is a guess what which was mentioned in the new york report by peter bailey out in chicago black theater fared less well even by second city standards and expectations sam greenlee mentioned ted wards theater and plans in the chicago report but did not emphasize that oscar brown jr and jean pace were being sought as the leads for his own play the spook who sat by the door an adaptation of his novel of the same name published in march in england miss teer has agreed to direct mr greenlees play if her prior commitments permit ann mcneil doggedly continued with the obac drama workshop aided by a loyal core of actors and supporters which include young bill eaves clarence taylor len jones and harold lee harold johnsons group was working at press time toward an opening theater in los angeles presented a happier picture even if a less black one harry e dolan director of the douglass house founda tion reported that the group was remodeling its theater which will be the first significant development to come out of the revolt in watts and more significant it is the first real thing of black development mr dolan said that the theater would use material from outside the community as we did with big time buck white which has a white author three other plays were scheduled for production house divided by jeanne taylor the pet shop by cal wilson and pornoff by elvie whitney we also will be doing a play by myself entitled nat turner a far different one from that william styron farce the confessions of nat turner mr dolan said the acting company includes bill jackson sonara mckeller quincy troupe

it must have been two or three years after high school or at least two or three years before collegethere was a five years gap for methat i found langston hughes i didnt find him in high school or college in the high school that i attended especially the american literature classes black writers were foreign black poets were nonexistent in my college they were ignored during the fifties when i came of age discovering searching groping for identification teachers often turned me on to robert lowell vachel lindsay eugene oneill william faulkner robert penn warren mark twain henry james hart grane and of course ernest hemingway they were described as true american writers because they were white born here or wrote here there was no labelling of langston hughes as american because in his poetry and prose there is a deep and abiding love for this country as well as for the black man in this country i found langston hughes during my intense study of the black theatre i discovered theatre in the five year gap too dr alain locke discussed black writers in the collection thirteen plays for the negro theater it is one of the earliest published anthologies of plays about black lifestyles i  wish i could find that book he mentioned how langstons plays had received praise at the karamu house theater in cleveland langston led me to other black writers black institutions he led me to richard wright crisis magazine james baldwin ralph ellison w c handy mercury magazine    even to carl van vechten    from articles and books i found that he was a poet short story writer translator and adaptor i exhausted myself in the library reading langston hughes soul gone home at least  times a good job done  times early autumn one of the most beautiful short stories in american letters two or three dozen times poems weary blues a house in taos to ive known rivers montage of a dream deferred   so i was aware of him long before i met him similar i am aware of god of pushkin if only i could have met them it was  the newspaper the negro newspaper announced that langston hughes would be coming to detroit given the key to the city and would be escorted from the airport by police motorcade downtown to the citycounty building our new city chief mayor jerome p cavanagh would then present the poet with the key to detroit on the afternoon of the following day after he had received the key ronald milner a writer friend called me he had met  langston and he had impressed langston my friend wanted me to go with him that very afternoon and meet langston hughes are you available man he asked langston was staying at the parkshelton in the art center section of detroit equidistance from everything downtown westside eastside    it seemed that all my artsycraftsy friends knew him yet before the negro press announced his arrival i assumed no one knew him because no one ever mentioned him or his work however he was a celebrity among the blacks ie the factory workers the car washers the day workers domestics bartenders    they knew one of his poems or one of his short stories or one of his plays or some of simple they had read in the chicago defender margaret danner the poet and a dear friend to detroit artists and writers had introduced ronald to langston so naturally respect and aspiration for langston grew because i knew then that the man had to be real one can determine the effect of a man by the ones who love him so it was with langston hughes before i met him at about that time we were involved in something in detroit called for nothing better black discovery we had built our own theater called concepteast margaret danner had opened boone house for poets henri king had opened the contemporary art gallery and both tony brown and richard henry brother imari started publishing little magazines we had a lot of things to talk to langston about would he listen had the new mayor and the middleclass negro doctors and lawyers cornered him on this detroit visit the first thing he did on my arrival at the hotel was to offer me a drink i refused i dont drink what a writer and director dont drink then he smiled the cigarette with the ashes not falling sort of blocking some of the smile how can i describe that smile have you ever studied the mona lisa draw in a cigarette with ashes langstons smile would create the same effect he told us how swinging the suite was man  wish l had one of these permanently this is something isnt it wow hey they gave me the key to the city he started looking for the key but evidently had misplaced it brought me in by motorcade  wish i had the money they spent on me and we all broke up laughing he was real later that evening he spoke for arthur coar local director for the association for the study of negro life and history the organization founded in the twenties by carter woodson also one of the first men to hire langston he and i talked again that night i told him how much i liked his short story early autumn he told me to look him up if i came   to new york i talked of the conditions of the black man in the theater i do remember he gave ronald milner a copy of his plays dont you want to be free and soul gone home and we tried to get a cast together to do a reading of his poetry and the two plays but he left two days later before we could get the actors parting he said something like its kinda hard to get colored people together but once you got them    well   and he smiled that smile preoccupied with his packing in early  i moved to new york i found the opportunity via rev malcolm boyd and his play study in color i called langston after about a week of the cruelties of new york city hi woodie he said come on over how is ron did he finish that big book he lived in harlem on th street in one of those beautiful brownstones i had trouble finding the house i searched around and finally i asked a policeman yeah the poet he lives in the next block his office was on the third floor it was filled with books by black writersfiction and nonfiction from blacks the world over most of the books had some personal identification for him because langston had helped in getting them published or had written the introduction or had helped the writer when the writer was beginning the first thing he said i read that story beautiful light and black our dreams in negro digest its good i didnt know how to respond i do remember there was a long pause he did not fill the pause he made me fill it i started explaining the story gaining confidence as i talked suddenly i realized that we were talking man to man not student to teacher or student to great artist we talked about the works of other writers particularly ron milner that big big bookis it really going to be  pages malraux ellison sandburg whitman wright and dostoevsky i found he never talked about his work instead he gave me copies of his book including the autobiography the big sea autographing it in large bold green ink strokes especially for woody kingwith a hearty welcome to new york sincerely langston hughes harlem u s a april  on my leaving he invited me down to the greenwich mews theaters sanctuary to see his play jerichojim crow in that brief visit langston hughes as he must have done with many other black artists opened himself and thus accepted me and listened to me i dont think i had talked to any artist as i talked to him yet the  meeting was brief less than two hours but this is a long time for a busy writer within the next year we met often he invited me to other plays recommended me for parts i even read for his play prodigal son in october of  i invited him to the opening of ron milners whos got his own at american place theater i was directing it as a workinprogress he was eager to see milners play he liked its construction but he felt that boy tim jr is awfully mad they better not put a white character on stage talking about negroes that way theyll get picketed our next meeting was in cleveland ohio at karamu playhouses golden anniversary i had been invited out by the theater department i didnt know langston would be there but i did know they would be doing his play simply heavenly as fate would have it we all stayed in the same hotel and since it was some distance from the playhouse we shared a cab langston malcolm boyd frederick oneal sidney lanier its something of an event to have langston back rowena jelliffe remarked on the opening panel langston hughes was karamus first playwright away back when it supported the gilpin players his play little mam received wide acclaim at the karamu playhouse on the panel discussion that included the above mentioned participants he did not put anyone down he praised leroi jones as one of the finest young writers in the theater he felt leroi jones was equal to the best of the th century poets at this point leroi was catching hell from the white press because of his black arts repertory theater while we were in cleveland talking about theater new york was in the midst of the now famous black out most of the new yorkers decided to remain an extra day in cleveland until it was over thus i had an opportunity to continue my dialogue with langston about poetry and the blues he knew of my interest in the blues we had certainly talked about it enough so much that i thought he was bored with it i told him what i wanted to do take his first book of poetry the weary blues adapt it to the stage using the prose and poetry from that first book to his last set it in harlem and add w c handys blues as an integral part since he and handy were saying the same things he liked the idea the possibilities he even gave me a few more copies of his work the idea would be to follow a young black american from a storefront church through the harlem streets and finally to the foreign soil of some distant land an american soldier protecting this country from  his death the cleveland visit brought langston and i even closer if only for a fleeting moment now i would be able to adapt his work with his consent and his help for two months i worked off and on with him we agreed that no corrections would be made until i finished a first draft in march of  i gave him a third and final draft of my adaptation of the weary blues he made large bold corrections and additions in the perennial green ink and returned it to me in april i went to his home again to pick it up you did it he said yes it took a lot of research i said man you got work in schomburg nobody ever heard of since  i wanted to use something from the old mercury and opportunity magazines i didnt want you to use any piece that was dated thats the only thing i was afraid of he said people find the skeletons in your closet they dont understand they get uptight i knew exactly what he meant i had been tempted to adapt a  huge fulllength play between the countee cullens library and the schomburg collection i compiled enough material for a dozen full length plays when i started cutting material from the scottsboro boys as it appeared in theater news a piece that was good and fitted weary but outdated i knew i had found a spine for the play agitprop theater of the thirties did not fit the theme we had set for the weary blues he gave me his corrected copy of the weary blues with it was seven new poems that he felt should be included plus a new play mother and child i directed it at the american place theater about a month later while he was in dakar he had marked the script appropriately large green arrows indicated where the new additions should be placed then it was off to dakar for the first world festival of negro art for langston he sent me a post card then in august he called to let me know he was back in new york for a minute whats happening with weary blues good news we have a production at the lincoln center museum and library series sponsored by equity library theatre the weary blues opened at the lincoln center in october of  for a limited engagement it was packed every night langston was there almost every night he would give a little chuckle every night because i had mississippi john hurts got the blues and cant be satisfied at full volume to put the audience in the right mood before the play he brought a lot of black guests he also helped cast the play by securing the services of miss theresa merritt i remember after the performance the actor robert hooks invited us to his apartment for drinks it was a lively evening and as i remember it langston only stayed a minute but he did want to come by to tell all the young performers how much he enjoyed the play and the direction  in which we had taken his prose and poetry he was especially pleased with eleo pomares beautiful junkie dance and norman bushs preacher and cliff fraziers hustler it was a strange evening after langston left we spent the remainder of the evening quoting and reciting his poetry you see langstons leaving never meant that he was gone he always left something behind for the black people he was always busy he had a lot of things going works not yet completed publishers after overdue manuscripts i always dreaded the thought of dropping in on him i would often wait until ronald milner came into new york so that we could both spring ideas which always meant a long and rewarding evening for me in december of  his secretary novelist lindsey patterson called and told me that langston hughes was busy but that he wanted to compile a book of short stories for little brown and company did i have anything of course i sent him the story that he liked from negro digest beautiful light and black our dreams he liked it and published it in the anthology best short stories by negro writers i ran into him a month later january of  in a small village restaurant after a performance of day of absence and happy end ing it was one of those cold evenings threatening rain i dont remember exactly what we talked about i do know i had given a friend who was starting a magazine langstons private telephone number and i was afraid he would not approve of it he was annoyed about it i told him i had tried to reach him by phone to tell him he would get this call but that his researcher raoul abdul told me he was out he was with friends in the restaurant so we didnt talk much i thought he would never talk to me again i told him i would call him but he said he would be away until the middle of february and would call me when he returned he did call he wanted me to adapt his collection on jesse b semple to the stage are you interested drop by this evening old boy we have a producer for the fall season i remember standing in his library saying for lack of anything better man    man he knew i knew the work because of the earlier research on the weary blues he wanted to give me original material from the first chicago defender article to the final new york post article in addition he wanted to know if i could do it by june because the producers stella holt and francis durcker would have to read it he also told me they had alvin ailey set to direct it i remember telling him it would be ready by the middle of may after reading the material again i told him what i wanted the character to cover the time of action and of course the place harlem usa we both got excited talking about what should be done with simple it would be set in the night since the black ghetto usually comes alive after dark simple would be allowed to move freely in the chaos of existence he would desperately search for some order in this chaos always explaining searching hoping in langston hughess dialogue langston hughess poetry showing how white folk is the cause of a lot of inconvenience in my life how they steal piece of him how his moral and religious faith in others save him from total destruction i finished the play simples blues on april   langston called me april   from the hotel wellington at the time he was working on a project for harry belafonte he moved into the wellington because there he could get away from the phone it also gave him a chance to read the play immediately he liked the play but he felt it had too many characters it would cost over  the producer had only  for the two plays ask your mama and simples blues we had some cheese dip he and raoul abdul had wine with theirs and ordered me coke i suggested that he should eat better we laughed we felt we had a hit if stella holt found the extra money or if i found a way to cut some of those people out i understood what he was indirectly telling me and went to work on rewrites i finished them on may   i called langston immediately he was in the hospital he died may

come away the better for it i was introduced to the amen corner in  by owen dodson head of the drama department at howard university of washington d c ten years would pass before i would be privileged to amplify those luminous words upon the stage words capable of enlightening and encouraging us to bridge the gap of our crisis in black and white a crisis of understanding it would wait upon mrs maria cole to sponsor its broadway appearance in  the distance between my first reading of the amen corner and its presentation prepared me to confront the challenge of its form and content after thirty years of work and study in the theatre i found it necessary to examine the causes of our social pathology symptoms of which seemed to be the subject matter without end in every medium of mass communication the time had come when the questions that itched my conscience could no longer be scratched away by reasoning   why in a great society of many different cultures was there imaged no acknowledgement for the culture of the negro where were the demonstrations of the reality of integration in society why were there no black faces in commercials on tvdid not the black customer pay the same advertising tax why even in the great war epics were there no images of the black soldiers who gave their last full measure on those distant battlegrounds a couple of latins died there too where amid the many forms and techniques of stage screen tv communications was the negros point of view expressed concerning and promoting his own understanding and acceptance of himself questions concerning how to communicate respect of self and wellbeing prerequisites for respecting others  it seemed to me that answers could and should be discovered and developed in the theatre vhich is the most personal the most intimate and the most direct means of communication i determined to produce the amen corner baldwin wiser than his knowledge had written the amen corner in a flush of inspiration which drove him past conventional forms of dramaturgy those forms and techniques have evolved from and are sustained by a conglomerate of european cultures which have historically done injustice to the negro baldwins play images the negro as he sees himselfnot consuming his genius protesting against invisibility or the myosis of others who are unable to see his total humanity this is the communication from an uncommon point of viewof a people who have known the range of wretchedness denial and abuse and who have hidden from these words and other labels of pain and hurt which have been their lot in the amen corner they are seen emerging digging themselves outachieving their realization of self inured to the disease hate but not victimized by it it is truly representative of a negro folk art serious and genuine as harold clurman has stated the presenting of the negro in his total humanity should concern the producers of theatre cinema and television communications and our critics as well the fundamental spiritual characteristic of a people cries out against suppressed into conformity with the standard a standard which has no criteria concerning the image of those characteristics manifested in their universal being the communication of the ethnic life of the negro is of profound significance at this time negroes are people very human beings who must integrate themselves through the acknowledgement of their own culture before they may be equally represented or integrated into a society of many different cultures the interchange of respect and selfrespect is the valuable aim and purpose of culture it is reciprocal and selfsustaining the interest increases with its being spent the amen comer is something of human value which becomes of greater human value as its distribution increases it is the meaning of compassion made manifest that seeing and feeling from anothers point of view their trials and triumphs as human beings searching to find the meaning of their existence in our human predicament there is no screaming or cursing or spitting back of hate the play is an affirmation of life an affirmation of value and an affirmation of the universality

robrt hooks who costars with frank converse and jack warden in abcs serial new york police department and recently appeared with leslie uggams in the broadway production hallelujah baby is a young man in his early thirties as with most actors he has found the road to success through a maze of personal sacrifices and multiple disappointments the daily struggle to achieve accompanied him as a young child in washingtons black ghetto in high school in acting school in philadelphia and finally into the theatrical world of new york critical acclaim and national recognition were gained by hooks for his performance in the offbroadway production of leroi jones dutchman in  many theatre people befriended hooks during his successful rise as an actor and producer for example joseph papp founder and director of the new york shakespeare festival cast the talented actor at a crucial point in his development he was offered the role of king henry in the mobile theaters production of henry v which toured throughout new yorks five boroughs during the summer of  this theater unit was created to supplement productions at the delacorte theater in central park the permanent home of the shakespeare festival since  the traveling theater introduced livedrama to many people for the first time actors and audiences came together in a fresh stimulating manner rewarding to both only within recent years has the company employed a number of nonwhite actors reflecting the various ethnic groups in new york city as the popular theater the festival has a critical responsibility to the multiracial community that supports it through city taxes and small individual gifts integration on the basis of talent has consciously been pursued by producer papp and greatly influenced his decision to secure hooks for the title role of henry v he remarked in an interview i dont think he is a great actor but he is growing as an actor in many ways he fulfilled the obligations of the part with distinction and a great deal of dignity i think he brought something to the play the white actor would not bring  his own understanding of power in his special way this did not distort the play but on the contrary illuminated certain aspects of it at the time for a young leading man with a fair command of the language and a certain amount of emotional reality he did very well even though he brought some colloquialisms which  think are  domestic they added something here and there this statement attempts to clarify papps choice of hooks for the role and to illuminate the positive values he felt were forthcoming because of this choice several program notes under the caption about the play offer some indication of interpretation    the story of henry v is a universal story of a ragged sick and hungry army plunged into battle against fresh and overwhelmingly superior forces both in numbers and in arms    the emotional impact of the play is to be found in the audiences identification with the underdog in this case the english soldiers and their king it ends with the summation    although the play is a paean to the glory of england it transcends flagwaving and is transformed into a statement of triumph for all ragged men fighting everywhere against impossible odds as a practical man shakespeare is not above propagandizing the prowess of england as an emerging world power through the heroic achievements of a popular monarch but as a playwright he transcends the plot for a higher purpose which though romantic in essence bears universal significance  a sense of mysterious power guiding and directing causes of righteousness many things happen in the pace of a production which an audience never notices things that are immediately apparent in a close reading or analysis of the text for instance many of the lines in shakespeares better plays have an articulated energy uncommon to contemporary drama the richness of imagery and the accelerated delivery of dialogue makes it almost impossible to assimilate the total experience at a single performance an additional problem confronting american audiences is the highly figurative language used in shakespearean drama a catalogue of meaning common to playwright spectator and actor is necessary for total comprehension and enjoyment of period drama being twentieth century audiences we must make adjustments to the emotional association and sensory impressions common to the theatrical language of the elizabethan age for greater comprehension and enjoyment we expect the playwright to provide us with experiences that are more dynamic more objective and more coherent than the contradictions of actual experience it is therefore the responsibility of a director to discover the authors intent and to recreate this ordered experience without augmentation or distortion this particular production placed emphasis upon elements of spectacle such as a handsomelymounted stage sumptuous costumes physically attractive actors exciting and realistic sound effects and movement patterns of choreographic dimensions comic scenes were broadly exaggerated yet imaginatively staged however they were out of balance in proportion to their significance within the context of the play such corollaries as language used and poetic imagery projected were often distorted henry as a man and henry as a metaphor lacked syntheses in this production critical comments of hooks performance are vague and contradictory a statement such as    king henry was especially good combining fiery grace with an almost tragic sensitivity contradicts with mr hooks strains a little and wears a perpetuallyworriedangry look as if the cares of knighthood and the demands of the role were a little beyond him add to this statement it took courage on mr papps part to put a negro in the role of henry v    and one has a collective opinion of the new york press it undoubtedly takes more than almost tragic sensitivity and courage to achieve a high degree of competent acting be it shakespeare or shaw of particular interest to me was the performance of ellen holly as well as that of robert hooks she had been cast in the role of the princess of france and displayed the type of wit and style demanded by her high comic role hooks as henry was not totally convincing as the mature and farsighted statesman a seasoned warrior a dedicated religious man speeches of lyric quality were within hooks technical and emotional range when the heroic language became intense and saturated with emotion he sounded like a sophomore playing hamlet and badly the appearance of this black performer in a major shakespearean role seems to offend john simon drama critic of the hudson review papps casting policy is attributed to laudable integrational zeal and hooks is criticized not for artistic competence but because a black monarch supposedly negates the lifelikeness of the play papp comments whenever you do a classic you recreate life in the terms that now exist both politically and socially if you try to reproduce a play the way it was done originally  it becomes a museum piece you have to draw from what exists what exists in new york and all throughout the world are different colored people and you cant deny their existence these two men agree on an essential point that an additional comment is made when a black actor confronts an audience in a role regarded traditionally as white papp feels that such an innovation allows an audience to watch the production in a more interesting manner if the actor is talented harold dewindt who stage managed the production observed negative reactions on the part of some white spectators to the initial appearance of hooks as henry these reactions obviously stemmed from psychological associations of having previously seen or certainly imagining only a white actor in the role when an initial reaction becomes a psychological hangup it is impossible for some spectators and evidently some critics to witness a play without imposing subjective feelings attitudes and perceptions upon it indiscriminately an individual can iimit and in some cases destroy an art experience by applying predetermined political and social references upon a play and upon performers who exist momentarily within the play historically henry v was an english monarch of the blood he was neither black nor yellow shakespeare as playwright has created a character who functions as man and metaphor fact and fiction and the play attempts to define mans basic instincts for domination conquest and survival integrated casting may perhaps work better in plays that are less historical or symbolic it may be that more sophistication is essential for spectators to be able to recognize the universality of human problems while disregarding color certainly the theme of sixteenth century english selfdetermination and nationalism alluded to by shakespeare is the same as that expressed by many contemporary black dramatists who are attempting to define the world in their own terms robert hooks as actor producer and black man is committed to the black arts movement which seeks a solution to the schism that exists between art and action in our society the unequivocal decision that ultimately faces every black artist is whether it is more rewarding to move delight and instruct black people in an allblack theater or whether it is better to accept the limited types of roles offered in the commercial theater and neglect black cultural expression hooks reached a decision four years ago with the creation of a group theater workshop that he cofounded with barbara ann teer he still considers this project to be his greatest achievement the group began with seven talented young blacks seriously interested in acting hooks modest manhattan apartment served as a studio during this early period but rapidly became too small as the group enlarged today the group theater has expanded to become the negro ensemble company with its own playwrights directors and choreographers a grant of  from the ford foundation was largely responsible for this rapid growth and a recent gift of   from the same foundation gives some indication of the success this theater has enjoyed in its short history hooks chose the framework of black theater in which to express his creative energies because it attempts to resolve the antithesis between the aspirations of art and the actions of men it is at the funcitonal level between art and action that drama is vita and relative whether white american producers directors and audiences can interact with the complexities of human experience that unfold through the dramatic process is highly questionable if they are unwilling or unable to extend themselves beyond considerations of color and there is strong negative indication that they cannot then black artists must separate themselves completely from an institution that in theory and practice denies restricts and destroys black creative energy and selfdetermination
through l t ward the his four characters in the baptism leroi jones dramatizes a dichotomy in attitudes tochurch among black people conservative acceptance is reflected in the minister and the old woman militant rejection is embodied in the homosexual and the boy the sacrosanct yet worldly minister filthy with success epitomizes the status quo of low income black churches he plays his role of spiritual leader and soul saver seriously so seriously in fact that his potential as a community leader is obviated myopically he focuses on the minute activities of his congregation becoming little more than an expert voyeur and singer of banalities he confides to the homosexual i smell your lovers and pray that you be redeemed i bathe them in my holy water and they are as baptized children and when the old woman swoons in a semierotic state he pronounces solemnly she has swooned in the service of the lord the hypocrisy of the minister is revealed in his dress and his high appraisal of himself the homosexual comments enviously and contemptuously you are filthy with success you religious motherfucker who may i ask is your tailor in the midst of a slow dance the minister dedares with candid egoism i fuck no one who does not claim to love me you the homosexual are less selective in the minister also is a reflection of the matriarchal inclination of black lowincome churches despite his egotism which is somewhat juvenile he accepts the directions of the old woman without reservation both when she decides that the boy is christ and later when she decides that the boy should be killed for lying the dominance of the old woman augmented by a chorus of young  sleek village  types of women dramatizes the strong appeal the black church has for black women in it are found many emotional outlets and a sense of control which is psychologically gratifying significantly the energy of the old woman is concentrated in a fierce righteousness an emotioncharged vindictive will to serve god in a fervent expression of this will she cries out i cast the stone because of your sons virtue to root the sinners out make a list lord make a list of them and ill root them out and cast them in the pit it is she who denounces the boy and causes him to seek baptism and later it is she who demands his death when the boy asks forgiveness she screams blasphemer you spilled your seed in prayer you sacrificed these vestals to your lust you should die die and the women in a choral response call upon god may our true husbandtobe castrate you with his lightning liar devil these words of the chorus raise another aspect of the black churchbehind the hysterical domineering woman hovers the shadow of the black mans failures and the trauma of the separated black family lacking a secular husband the black woman waits and trusts in her husbandtobe and invests in his sexual potency  he thus becomes the big stroker of the universe who popped us in those various hallways of love but the feverish eroticorighteousness of the church is not sufficient to hide the materialistic influences which have pervaded it these influences are cuttingly commented on by the homosexual who represents a free thinking intellectual point of view christianity as a doctrine of love is defunct in white america overruled by the protestant ethic consequently the militant thinker rejects the church and turns to the political arena the homosexual therefore demands let it be politics or shut up and when he learns that the boy is christ he asks lemme see you turn this place into the white house or something cool like that aware that the village girls supposedly escapees from a materialistic hell pray for a new doll and a monopoly set and an fm radio and a picture of monk    the homosexual tells them devout citizens stop it go home to your radios he also makes several references to sports suggesting that in white america and parts of negro america the world series is taken more seriously than the sermon on the mount with tongue in cheek he gives himself pseudohonors by proclaiming i be willie mays of the queers by his references to sports the homosexual expresses his consciousness of the pastashumiliation for the black man he chides the old woman for singing that old nigger song and delcares that he will not be limited to tiny nigger songs paradoxically the homosexual is the freest most loving of jones characters he only tries to save the boy and he alone possesses a true joie de vivre as he says the pride of life is life and flesh must make its move i am the sinister lover of love the mysterious villain of thought  i love all things as they are issued from you know who god if anyone in the play has soul it is the homosexual it seems that jones is indicating christianity as a debaser and distorter of the black mans psyche an impediment to black unity and black understanding and this indictment reaches a climax in the character of the boy after an initial denial the boy finally reveals that he is christ by then the woman and her followers and the minister are bent on sacrificing the youth his pleas for understanding are totally disregarded as the group whips itself into a righteous frenzy chanting we must cleanse ourselves    you must be sacirficed    at this point christ negates his mission by taking arms a long silver sword he will not be a savior of those who possess no charity no humanity no love wielding his sword in selfdefense and anger he shouts there will be no second crucifixion the attitude of jones christ is symbolic of the new direction in black thought and feeling the name is black_power the message is there will be no second enslavement
whereas in the baptism one sees the turning point of a people assuming that christs rejection of his mission represents the black mans rejection of nonviolence in the toilet a personal dilemma is presented ray foots an intelligent sensitive young black man finds himself caught between the demands of his black friends who subscribe to a code of violence and those of his white friends who relate to one another in more socially accepted ways the setting of the play has a sinister symbolism the high school latrine is described by playwright jones as  a large bare toilet built of gray rough cement there are urinals along one wall and a partition separating them from the toilet must resemble the impersonal ugliness of a school toilet or a latrine of some institution a few rolls of toilet paper are spread out on the floor wet through the actors should give the impression frequently that the place smells this place of course is really the nether world of the american society it is one of the sewer system and the city dump necessary but impolite to mention it is the underside of our crisp cheerful bureaucratic fagade and the assumption is that here if anywhere one can relate to another without the mask the plot is simple rays black friends have discovered a love letter written to him by one of his white acquaintances ray has scheduled a meeting in the latrine in which with the blacks as spectators he will beat the white boy james karolis and save his honor when the play opens a few of the spectators are waiting in the latrine for foots to bring karolis in evidently class is in session and they are waiting for it to end jones dramatizes the code of violence of these young men by showing how they speak to one another that is constant signifying on each others mothers and girl friends and how they express themselves kinesthetically shoving boxing wrestling pretending to play basketball together fearlessness and agility are prized ora the loudest crudest and least sensitive of them often brags about how fast he can run and how well he can crush another  cat they all feel disdain for karolis because he is slightly built and eventually ora jumps another white boy donald farrell one feels simply because he appears so vulnerable when foots enters karolis has already been brought in by two boys his condition is rather pathetic karolis head is hanging and he is crying softly and blood is on his shirt and face although he hides it foots reaction is one of horror and disgust he conceals his feelings by continuing to play a gruff role and by using the language his black friends expect of him his first question is what the hell you hit him with ora a goddamn train foots reveals his difficult position to the audience when he explains why he is late for the confrontation that goddamn van ness had me in his office he said im a credit to my race  he said im smartasawhip    and should help him to keep all you unsavory    elements in line the audience must assume that foots is an aboveaverage student who gets on in the white world of the high school as well as he does in the black cunningly however he laughs as he mentions the principals words and even imitates him so that it will appear that he takes none of the white mans premises to heart karolis condition causes foots to hesitate he had not anticipated the extent of the violence his friends were ready to indulge in foots tries to squeeze out of the situation by saying he cant beat anyone who is already sprawled on the floor but at this point farrell white makes the mistake of commending foots for his decision by saying i sure am glad somebodys got some sense here at this foots gets angry and demands that farrell leave farrell then wants to know what is so important that foots has to revenge himself on an already defeated person then one of the blacks laughingly tells farrell about the letter the response is an interesting one a letter    oh ray come on why dont you come off it this suggests that foots has revealed something about himself to the whites which the blacks were unaware of it is a subtle hint which is missed by the boys in their efforts to get rid of farrell after farrells departure karolis staggers to his feet insisting on going on with the fight to everyones amazement he gets the best of foots and when it seems that karolis is going too far ora and the rest of the crowd jump in to aid their man karolis is beaten and left alone on the floor during the fight with foots karolis reveals everything he admits sending the note you have to fight me i sent you a note remember that note saying i loved you    the note saying you were beautiful    not only did he send the note foots himself responded to karolis advances ill fight you right here in this same place where you said your name was ray  ray you said your name was you said ray  you put your hand on me and said ray and finally as he is being punched in the face karolis manages to say no no his name is ray not foots  i love somebody you dont even know this last statement by karolis is the theme of the play when he says i love somebody you dont even know he is referring to a sexual aspect of rays personality but i think it can be taken in a racial context also foots dilemma is the dilemma of the integrationist to what extent do you profess and abide by the mores of your socalled subculture and to what extent do you accept the dictates of the suprasociety which is also a white society at one time one would have said that foots was trying to rise above a subnormal perverted culture today we know that violence is a legitimate way of life for those who have been violated psychologically economically socially and physically in the conclusion foots has not resolved his dilemma he has remained hostile to karolis before his friends but after they leave he returns and    stares at karolis body for a second looks quickly over his shoulder then runs and kneels before the body weeping and cradling the head in his arms
n his first book the crisis of the negro intellectual harold cruse critically examined the intellectual history of the afroamerican in the twentieth century it is not at all surprising then that the collected essays published three years later than originally intended under the title rebellion or revolution morrow  now provide us with the recorded intellectual history of one black american harold w cruse all but two of these essays have been published previously over a sixteenyear period beginning with the daily worker in  through studies on the left liberator presence africaine the new leader and from les temps moderne an essay printed in english for the first time in  he reviewed the movie king solomons mines pointing out its exploitative and imperialistic significance the early cruse essays typical of a young writer contained a naivete in style and tone it seems that since that time cruse has given considerable thought to marxism as practiced by blacks and whites alike in their treatment of the black mans struggle for selfdetermination in the united states the path from my very first articles to the crisis turned out to be a road  years long but i didnt know that then in fact i had no idea where i was headed but as each year went by i saw the road leading deeper into a peculiar kind of american cultural sickness  hence in response to julian mayfields criticism cruse is indeed engaged in an ideological crusade but not for the sake of egotistical satisfaction these articles and essays were all derived from my great need to interpret what i perceived as a unique interplay of political economic and cultural factors at work behind the various freedomseeking fronts of the black movement factors which needed what camus once called a theoretical frame  in devoting all these years to the task of what i judge to be a rational inquiry into certain disputed facts of our reality i persevere in the hope that i have helped to make the future of    the arts more relevant and secure i believe that the only antidote to the present irrational thrust toward social oblivion is more rationality whether one agrees or disagrees with cruse is not the concern of this review rebellion or revolution is testimony to the evaluations set forth in the crisis a book so controversial and challenging that it has been the subject of conferences and symposia and has solidified friendships among us even while opening the closet doors but cruse would prefer that we evaluate his ideas judgments and dialectical method instead of himself the cruse approach is essentially marxist by  an afroamericans cultural views indicated in its tone that the writer was certain of his commitment to a cultural rehabilitation in the outlook of black america by  the marxian dialecticism and cruses frustration is much more noticeable as his prose assumed a clarity often tempered by a sharp wit as of early  the dialectical process literally had jelled and was second nature to his perceptions and their analyses cruses technique involves a review in historical perspective of black intellectuals and their respective ideas and tendencies juxtaposing them against each other observing their opposites and similarities and perceiving them as historical antecedents to the contemporary scene the cruse approach has been influenced not only by marx but also more or less by lenin stalin eduard bernstein camus and c wright mills although cruse would claim none of these as a particular intellectual godfather in his approach he has evaluated what he calls the contemporary programmatic crisis through a systematic treatment of socialistic theories and tendencies which he clearly explains despite entertaining seemingly contradictory principles besides the introduction the essay behind the black_power slogan is the other previously unpublished commentary it was originally prepared for and subsequently rejected by the socialist scholars conference of  and its point of departure is the uncertainties of the biack power conference in newark during the summer of the same year cruse by the way has had an ideological war with white marxists and communists particularly with the noted authority on black history herbert aptheker and the younger selfacclaimed jazz authority frank kofsky white marxists cannot see blacks as a nation and their europeanbased theories are totally irrelevant to the american situation yet it is the black marxists whom cruse feels are the most irrelevant political animals of our times who paradoxically are the only blacks who have any

james forman in bringing to light the story of sammy younge sammyyounge jr grove press  undertook a task which for some time now has gone begging seemingly because of a marked indifference on the part of those who are involved in what has been loosely labeled the movement forman through the medium of print has sought to do what many in the socalled vanguard of the black liberation struggle have only talked about and that is to pay homage to the movements dead by keeping alive their memory as a consequence what emerges in this work is a very profound and moving political biography which is in fact one of the first of its kind to appear in the literary genre of the as yet embryonic black liberation movement in america the prime significance of formans book lies not in the notoriety of its subject character the usual motive behind the writing of most definitive biographies but rather in the contemporary import of the political message in its content the story of sammy younge is at once both a chronicle of the developing roots of todays radical awareness exhibited by the black college student and an insightful look at the inner political trends which have shaped the newfound outlook of snccan outlook which in little more than two years has caused sncc to view itself as a human rather than civil_rights organization dedicated as such to third world liberation and black_power the book for the most part is constructed around a series of interviews and conversations gathered by forman and an ad hoc committee set up to publish sammy younge sammy younges parents along with close friends and associates which include such notables as stokely carmichael and willie ricks have combined here to convey their impressions and feelings of sammy and the movement as it developed around tuskegee sammys home perhaps the singular most distinguishing feature of the book is the refreshing attempt forman has made to reveal sammys personality too often in similar works there is a serious drawback in the manner in which a characters personal life style is illuminated many figures emerge simply as a set of cold descriptions to be considered for the moment by the reader and later forgotten sammy  younge on the contrary here can be seen for what he was a sensitive black man who experienced and felt all the hurts and joys as well as inner conflicts over girls school and society incidental to an average life it is later related how sammy unable to resolve the many contradictions that daily face every black person living in racist america sought outlet for his tensions and frustrations in drink and fast cars nonetheless sammy although only  years old and living with one kidney already had deeply involved himself in political organizing and defense of the black community this at a time when most black people were busy cursing malcolm_x for advocating independent political struggle and black selfdefense as stokely remarked sammy just before he was murdered was seriously considering the formation of a black_panther party in his home county sammy continued to move along this line despite the many doubts and misgivings that had begun to grow in his mind over his ability to continue to function in the movement however as is made clear it was too late for sammy to turn back for he had already become a marked man bad nigger in the eyes of tuskegees white and black which too had a vested interest in the maintenance of order and stability establishment from this point it was only a matter of time before the inevitable happened according to forman the murder of sammy younge by a white gas station owner and the subsequent acquittal by an allwhite jury momentarily had a sobering effect on tuskegees black bourgeoisie it served to bring them to the realization that what happened to sammy could just as easily have happened to them for it is a welltested truism by now that no matter how much money or power a black man in america has hes still a nigger forman with this view has fittingly chosen to title the chapter that deals with sammys actual murderthe death of a myth sammys death also had an effect on the student community at tuskegee university it forced many black students there for the first time to reevaluate some of the goals and ideals of the university itself in fact a large number of the black students there who had been hitherto uninterested in anything other than getting the piece of paper and moving on to the american promise of money and status themselves became committed to the liberation struggle a struggle which in the neardecade since four black students from north carolina a and t college sat down at a segregated lunch counter in greensboro in  has steadily progressed in scope today of course the demand is no longer the narrowly defined objective of integration as san francisco state college and columbia university have shown black students are demanding that the university and thereby american society since the university is in reality only a microcosmic extension of this society be transformed into a genuinely free institution for all rather than simply an academic brainwashing factory sammy younge who was described by forman as the first black student to die in the black liberation movement then represents in a very real sense every black student in america in the end therefore on the strength of sammys commitment and vitality to the freedom of black people rests the strength of formans bookearl ofari
in the past two years several welldocumented soberly approached books have been published which tell how minorities in general and how black people in particular are routinely brutalized by the nations police of course for black people mexicanamericans and puerto ricans there is nothing new or revealing in these books the books are designed for the enlightenment of the white reading publicor for that segment of it which does not automatically approve whatever the police do against black people or hippies or those with the wrong color or ethnic background the big blue line coward mccann  by ed gray was one of the first of these books published long before the chicago confrontation of august  when the bullyboys of mayor richard daley demonstrated for the whole world the kind of viciousness of which they are capable mr grays report dealt not only with police violence against people in the streets but also with the collusion between the policemen and the courts and the police practice of beating up whomever offends them and then charging the victim with resisting arrest both police power pantheon  by paul chevigny and the people and the police mcgrawhill  by algernon d black cover much the same ground as the big blue line but with added dimensions of the three books police power is probably the most direct and the most infuriating mr chevigny a staff attorney for the new york civil liberties union writes out of firsthand experience

ironically less than a year after william styron defiled black history with confessions of nat turner frank yerby has published a novel which will test the objectivity and the sincerity of those critics who defending styron proclaimed an authors license to interpret the personality and the culture of historical figures of a different race judas my brother dial  yerbys twentysecond novel tells the story of a jewish youth sensitized and alienated by his belief that he is illegitimate blessed with a hypnotically forceful personality wealthy friends and credulous audiences he accomplishes miracles in addition to those which biographers invent for him after persuading himself that god has appointed him to exemplify righteousness as a sacrificial lamb he suicidally provokes hebrew and roman authorities into executing him when they finally do he dies in despair believing that god has slaughtered him this of course is the story of the carpenters son yeshua ha notzri known to contemporary americans as jesus of nazareth i suspect that this novel will disappoint the yerby enthusiasts who have not already been dissuaded by the  cost of his recent works some may be shocked by the obviously controversial theme especially since yerby in his first years of glory an nounced that a novelist had neither responsibility nor right to meddle with the prejudices of his readers other enthusiasts may be disappointed by the diminution of sex and by the limited appeal to sadismonly one gang rape in  pages the reduced quantity however does not lower the intensity in fact yerby exceeds his earlier horrors when he describes the suicide of a prostitute who rips herself open from the navel to the womb and when he recounts in tortuous detail the process of death by crucifixion judged according to literary criteria judas my brother is not exceptional even for yerby the main plot is too familiar it is the story of the loves and other adventures of nathan bar yehudah who marries yeshuas younger sister yerby writes sentences as crudely as usual and his penchant for interpolating foreign terms continues to be annoying the minor plot is more unified than usual only because the gospels furnished yerby with a tightly knit wellconstructed outline nevertheless although he may disappoint enthusiasts and literary purists yerby has developed his most significant themean interpretation of the greatest story ever told troubled by the discrepancies and contradictions which are obvious to anyone who compares the four gospels yerby searched through other historical materialsespecially the antiquities of josephus visited the original locations studied aramic and hebrew and familiarized himself with hebrew ritual in order to present an accurate account he has not always succeeded for example in an unnecessary effort to explain each miracle he occasionally has resorted to melodramatic contrivances more absurd than any propagandists romancer could have devised furthermore he sometimes annoys by thrusting his fictional characters into some of the more familiar incidents of the new testament one is hardly prepared for the reappearance of a fictitious prostitute as the woman whom yeshua or jesus saves from execution by stoning occasionally yerby arbitrarily discounts familiar stories for example he ridicules the legendary flight into egypt by advising credulous readers to ask miriam mary whether she knows anything about that country nevertheless serious consideration must be given to much of the material which yerby has documented with  pages of footnotes for example he has argued persuasively that jesus was not born in bethlehem because at the supposed time of his birth there was no census which would have compelled joseph to go there yerbys attitude towards the different gospels diverges from scholarly tradition he has paid little attention to the estimate that mark was probably the earliest ignoring the possibility that matthew was written by a churchman concerned with establishing ritual and justifying the legend he dismisses matthew as a fool to be valued only for his exact transcriptions of the words of jesus he has drawn heavily on luke who admitted that he was merely retelling what was popular tradition among later christians and even though he has borrowed material from john yerby has served humanity by proving repeatedly that john was a remarkably imaginative inventive and skillful storyteller who knew little about hebrews and less about palestine probably the section deserving the most intensive study is yerbys account of the last supper the trial and the crucifixion if his explanation of the disappearance of the body from the tomb disappoints those who believe in miracles it is at least valuable in pointing up what is clear in the gospelsthe fact that for a significant period of time no one guards the tomb this sketchy summary may suggest that frank yerby has gleefully written sacrilege to the contrary yerby actually seems to love mary and jesusas human beings not as gods as he says he has nothing to report about the virgin mary for his subject is the human miriam mary who solves first the problem of persuading her husband that he fathered their eldest son and later as a widow solves the problem of rearing a family which includes an itinerant son who damages the familys reputation by wandering around the countryside preaching and continually provoking authorities yerby also admires and pities yeshua a phenomenal personality destined to become an ironically tragic figure because in his name men persecute by violence to enforce the lesson of love and mercy which he taught in the sermon on the mount yerby even sympathizes with lovestricken gullible judas who receives no money for his betrayal and who lives to old age burdened with the memory of that betrayal yerby does not condemn the human beings who suffered the sorrows that shaped the legend instead he attacks the pauline myth which rooted in pagan tradition has been used for almost  years to delude and destroy godly men this book then climaxes the theme which he formed in the saracen blade  and developed further in an odor of sanctity  although some of yerbys interpretations may be questioned his book should stimulate a reader to question the myth and to seek his own answers judas my brother should be read by everyone who professes to be a christian for a change a yerby novel is worth darwin t turner
he raw pearl harcourt brace  world  isnt necessarily the jewel it could be the story of the life of pearl bailey and if it were you may not go completely wrong if you possessed it miss bailey did us all a great service by writing the book herself she is no writer but she is a rather fabulous person who has tried to honestly evaluate her life as she has seen it over some years negro autobiographies are always frustrating because we lead frustrating lives unless we or someone else fictionalize there is always going to be a certain level of drag repetition and rationalization because even the most successful of us always carry a sign on our backs saying for a negro which is of course a circumvention of the level of our success this frustration and rationalization shows clearly in miss baileys autobiography it could not be that she was just talented she must surely have beenstill be aware of many people who are as talented as she but not nearly so successfulher own brother the one and only bill bailey is one exampleyet she made it and they didnt she ascribes her success to faith in god and while we would never quarrel with her faith we are aware that many people who are just as talented have just as much faith and still are not as successful because the society in which we live is built on limited demand we recognize that miss bailey was as aggressive as all hell and pulled no punches climbing to the top she was hesitant to put it that way she was afraid of her father competitive with her brother and abused by her first husband we could conclude that with the exception of don redmond she had negative relationships with black men her subsequent happiness with louis bellson must have had some relationship to that an autobiography is by definition limited to the view of the person writing it yet we wish she had given a little more thought as to just why her relationships were as they were she appears to love her children and only two other people louis and peetney redmond peetney is her lifelong friend and seeing the genuine affection that miss bailey holds for her is necessary to an understanding of the pearl but a climb to the top isnt necessarily geared to finding and making friends miss bailey has a delightful way of climbing over someone then saying but i think they have respect for me everybody has respect for a conquerorthey won didnt they but not affection miss bailey has peppered her book with little poems by friends thoughts she has jotted in poetic form and prayers she has loved her famous stage asides appear also although on stage they are witty while in written form they have a tendency to border on moralisms which are more sickly than cute but the raw pearl has something to offer and if one has a determination to read it one may find it quite interesting the most explanatory statement in the book isnt a comment at all but a picture next to page  with the word pappa that says a whole lot about the pearl and may possibly relate to its rawness nikki giovanni
the jewelers eye g p putnams sons  a collection of pieces by william f buckley jr is subtitled a book of irresistible political reflections to the white liberal american mentality buckley is indeed irresistible perhaps owing to among other things the way in which he fills the white style vacuum they call him charming moreover unlike the typical conservative buckley meets the qualifications of the liberal establishment having read all of their literature and is respected by them as an intelligent man thus buckleys rejection of the liberals cannot be dismissed by them as crude as in the case of the great masses of their countrymen but is instead curious and no matter that he never tires of chastizing them buckley presumably is as content as the liberals with the arrangement if for no other reason than that his metaphors would be wasted on a conservative audience reading buckley now and then occasionally viewing him in debate one might find oneself at once outraged by his audacity and yet a victim of his wit sarcasm and endless syllabizing one might in fact come to think of him as nothing more than the most articulate spokesman for the other argument rather than an evil man buckley seducing weaklings on tv may perhaps be more entertaining than the commercials or the corny white actions on other channels however in the course of reading an entire book of his opinion there is little that would distract one from his worldviewa view of the universe that excludes all but affluent white westerners from the family of man buckleys is a holy war no less fanatic than the crusades in which anyone who would shudder at the thought of a world ruled by the strategic air command it is already a fact is beyond god was it karl barth who said that anticommunism as a doctrine is as dangerous as communism understatement scolding schlesinger fulbright and other harmless liberals who are distinguished from him more as a matter of aesthetics than ethics as william stringfellow once noted concerning the difference between northern and southern white men buckley might leave the impression of a con man but deadly buckley more a madman surfaces when the people under attack are sartre susan sontag stauchton lynd and others who are not satisfied to dismiss the crimes of the west as something apart from its cultural legacy one neednt labor over the chasm between buckleys point of view and the interests of black people it is as though one has been asked by the chief of police in a mississippi hamlet what are you doing here at the conclusion of a piece on the  newark rebellion buckley advises a little hard labor on history and morality and the causes of the rise of civilizations and the fall of civilizations bill buckley suffering from moral infancy thinks himself a civilized man but the future of civilization is of course not dependent on eloquence and money alone the jewelers eye as a reflection of its author is unimaginative and depthless leaving one not allured but in the very worst sense boreddavid llorens
