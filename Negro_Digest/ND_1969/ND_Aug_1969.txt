even since the publicae  tion of the report of js the presidents commission on the causes of civil disorders racism and racist increasingly frequent and justified use while the usage of these two terms may have a cathartic effect on the oppressed the terms have seen black american they may also serve to take the place of critical thinking human beings seem to prefer to name things rather than to think about them and consequently to talk about things rather than to do something about them effective action depends on accurate knowledge about phenomena however and not on descriptive labelling since the fundamental issue facing black americans today is survival in its most literal sense namecalling activities are best left to children and to enemies the hour is too late and the situation too critical for honkybaiting necessary as such activity might have been in the past what then are the priorities related to survival first and most important black americans must learn to reorient their thinking from what can be termed dependency analysis of their situation to an interdependency analysis of it for example to describe low educational achievement among black children as the result of dependent on racism is to engage in dependency or cause and effect analysis a better explanation one more attune to modern scientific thinking is to describe such phenomena as not only the result of one or more phenomena but also as the cause of these same phenomena thus it is just as meaningful to talk about low educational achievement as the cause of racism as to describe it as an effect the meaning of this statement will be made clearer i hope in the subsequent paragraphs white largely liberal thinking has brainwashed us all into believing this for example if education is increased income will increase and if income is increased better housing will ensue etc such thinking is strongly dependencyoriented and while it lends itself neatly to prepackaged programs to help the disadvantaged it cannot deal with social reality the fact of the matter is that the problems facing black americans are infinitely more complex and are related to systemic social forces and not due to a group of elements which operate independently of each other to adequately deal with these forces necessitates a radical break with traditional modes of thinking most white people are incapable of making this break it is becoming increasingly clear that the countrys last source of originality as well as creativity lies within the black community it is necessary for black americans to examine american society as a system a social system can be defined as a group of people in interaction with each other any social system can be described in terms of its subsystems and components the city of philadelphia can for example be described as a social system subsystems of the system might include the various sections such as north philly west philly etc a component of the north philly subsystem might be a particular street or neighborhood there are several facts to recognize in the analysis of social systems a systems are dynamic ie they change through time b they operate according to certain rules and c a change in one element of the system has an effect on the totality of the system social systems operate by means of communication the communication of information is the social cement of all human societies information includes much more than just newspaper or television content however information is anything which people or systems use to make decisions these decisions may range in triviality from what tie shall i wear to what is the most feasible way to move large numbers of black people into concentration camps information is the crucial type of input into a social system in much the same way as electricity is a crucial type of input into a stereo or hifi system once a system has some source of input it transforms this input in such a way as to produce a certain output the output of a stereo system is music the output of many social systems are certain actions which people transform the information input into outputs ie who the decisionmakers are depends on the system in question in a typical school for example a principal may produce the outputs these outputs may take the form of firing of certain teachers the input might be the hiring of others thus it is possible to conceive of people eg teachers as constituting information the hiring of certain teachers makes it possible to fire others and viceversa people attempt to change systems when they perceive the outputs of the system to be detrimental to their interests to most black people in america the outputs of relevant systems are detrimental bad housing bad business prac tices bad schooling bad press treatment bad jobs etc are all outputs of specific social subsystems it is not surprising that the focal point of demonstrations and insurrections has been on these outputs nor is it surprising that such activities have failed the reason that they fail is that in all systems there is a direct relationship between inputs and outputs and it is useless to focus on one set of factors while ignoring the other in other words there is feedback see diagram between information outputs and information inputs ie the effects of certain decisions has subsequent on the type of information input into the system thus to return to statements made earlier the effect of racism low educational achievement is also the cause of racism racism is thus a system input the relationship between inputs and outputs is not a onetoone relationship ie if we know what went into a system in the way of information we still could not be exactly sure what would come out in the way of actions the inputs into a system are transformed or worked upon in the production of specific outputs these transformation activities are performed according to certain implicit and explicit rules the explicit rules are usually written in the form of charters bylaws constitutions etc an explicit rule in a school system for example might be as follows all students must pass fourth grade reading test x before promotion to the fifth grade on the national level an explicit rule is that no one should be deprived of the right to vote because of race religion or national origin in most social systems however explicit rules are less operative than are the implicit ones implicit transformation rules are those cultural beliefs values and sentiments which guide most human behavior thus while many white people will give lip service to the explicit rule stating all men to be equal they will operate under the implicit rule that black men are not equal to white men whatever set of rules a system or a systems decisionmaker operates under they play a part in determining the outputs of that system thus to transform a system it is necessary to not only change the inputs and outputs of a system but to also change the rules governing the operation of the total system this latter change is the most difficult of all for it involves convincing people black and white who believe the world is flat that they are fundamentally wrong such perceptions of reality are rarely changed short of some kind of revolution thus to the extent that black people engaged in boycotts and other activities directed at system inputs we are involved in an economic revolution to the extent that activities are focused on system outputs we are involved in a political revolution and to the extent that we are engaged in changing the implicit rules governing system operations we are involved in a cultural revolution and as harold cruse has noted all three revolutions are mandatory racism is best defined as a cultural sentiment or belief regarding the inherent inferiority of nonwhites it is less an individual characteristic than it is a system or societal one there will always be racists but there need not always be racism systems differ with respect to the degree that they depend upon racism for their functioning virtually every social ss tem in the south would disintegrate if racism were to disappear overnight in the north however there are other sources of system input and racism is more of a reserve source in any case racism as a sentiment pervades the entire culture north and south east and west the differences occur in the uses to which it is put in terms of system functioning the function of boycotts is to cut existing sources of system input while most uses of the boycott have been in relation to systems which depend on money as a source of system input it should be clear from the discussion above that economic boycotts are but one of an infinite number of ways to prevent information flow when students at columbia university brought the system to a grinding halt they were engaged in input disruption it should be noted that all actions designed to cut off system input need not be violent the differences between a liberal a radical and a revolutionary can be defined in terms of the price each is willing to pay for the cutting off of information input into an illegitimate system people who refuse to pay taxes to join the army to pledge allegiance to a flag to vote to provide census information are all performing the same function viz they are refusing to supply input to the system if enough people perform these functions over a long enough period of time the system will disintegrate the question of tactics in the black liberation movement concerns these very issues
the question of foreign intervention in the internal affairs t £ of underdeveloped countries has long been a bone of great £ contention but the question of what constitutes the underd development of a nation impresses a far greater influence on nat ure cf this intervention than is commonly understood given the natural disparities in economic existence in the modern world it is only to be expected that the large nations whose existence is to a great measure determined by their ability to ensure that development in the socalled underdeveloped nations proceeds at a pace dictated by the assurance of continued prosperity for themselves would view intervention in the internal affairs of the weaker nations as a primary objective on both political and economic grounds the reality of the present day standards of developed existence is that the white nations are the developed nations because the nonwhite nations are forced by circumstances of time and lack of technological breadth to supply the basic needs for their continuing prosperity this constant and regular outflow of basic property saps the nonwhite nations industrial and economic energy and produces an enormous disparity between the nations will to self determination and its ability to realize self determination taking the above generalities into consideration it is not hard to discern the need for and the advantages of a drive towards a greater unity of spirit that would give rise to an exchange of resources among the international groups that make up the underdeveloped world it is at this point that one should begin to examine the peculiar role that the afroamerican community has been forced into in this ideological breakdown of national interests the afroamerican community and by this i mean africans born and living in communities in all the americas exists within and supplies a large percentage of the labor force that produces export material in the american sector of the economic community of developed nations but the afroamerican has never beenand will never beallowed to participate in the policymaking base of the developed communitys existence by the very nature of his involvement with a past that holds as its basic standard the most obnoxious institution and symbol of the history of whitenonwhite relationships slavery as an industry the afroamerican is a continuing predicate of revolution within the developed community he is an alien in his land but knowledgeable about its mores he is by the very nature of his emotional loyalties the most advantageously placed member of the underdeveloped community for make no joke about it afroamerica is as ruthlessly exploited even in its ephemeral geographical existence as any of the more concretely recognizable nations of the underdeveloped world not only her labor resources but her resources of will and incentive are disestablished by the very nature of the surroundings in which they are called to function because the native history of afroamericas presence coincides politically with the colonial or subservient history of most of the underdeveloped nations her historic place in the present coincides with the dynamic meaning of the postcolonial drive towards self detemination that represents the positive side of the underdeveloped presence and role in modern political life emotionally the realistic desire for the vague but firm value freedom binds the afroamerican to the african or asian mass at the root point of their present respective existences it is now that we should begin to examine the role of method and ethnocratic identity in modern politics in an effort to justify the involve ment rather than intervention of afroamericans in the problems and successes of africa spirit as method the method of making any alliance subservient to its creative outcome must involve the activation in practical terms of subjective principles such abstract values as brotherhood must be understood in terms of beneficial interchange thus black brotherhood that seeks to bridge the barriers created by centuries of enstrangement and even more forbidding worlds of immediate existential in temperament and experience must be understood as ethnosocial expression with practical advantages again the most public and manifest expression of this phenomena must be seen in the possibility for an appeal to emotional pride that is common on extraracial grounds that predicates a promise of future selfdetermination of spirit for afroamerican and african alike when the late malik el shabazz malcolm_xand may his soul rest in peacesaid that the problem of euroamerican exploitation of afroamerican resources should be taken before the united nations he visualized the afroamerican stand not as a new divergence in that extensively fragmented juggernaut but as an integral and cohesive agent of action within the already firmly established revolutionary wing of the afroasian bloc this vision was not the result of a dream but was in fact a vision of reality for if afroamericans can ever begin to fight against the inequities of their internal position on the same terms of international intercourse that other underdeveloped and economically exploited communities do then the settlements that they extract must of necessity have similar international results and implications this would in itself be the first step in the conscious involvement in african problems and successes blanket name affairs of the afroamerican community that is predicated by personal involvement in specific african situations by afroamerican individuals a genuine honest and nonpatronizing interest in and decision to aid or at least lend service to distressed or beleaguered africa by afroamericans is in all simplicity a great blow for the cause of freedom of self determination for the afroamerican community for by this interest or decision the signal is given for the judgement of and evaluation ofthe afroamerican communitys destiny in world terms rather than in narrow neocolonial formulas of need vs want later we shall outline the virtues that might be considered basic tenets of the method implied by this intimation but from this general structure the question of ethnocratic identity as a positive force must evolve in the establishment of this argument the ethnocratic principle the ethnocratic principle is the principle that recognizes in a common ethnic identity the possibility of a collation of strength rather than a vague intimation towards superiority ethnic superiority is a false direction both politically and structurally but creative and dynamic political strength can be established on the basis of ethnic unity the resultant elite is an ethnocracy the causes and effects of such an establishment of ethnocratic principles can only be evaluated in terms of positive beneficiary action and analyzed in terms of active results thus it is that the emotional experience of the afroamerican community can be transformed without the added benefit of history into the modern bridge between the unconscious exploitation of resources that indicates the style of modern underdeveloped existence and the desire to determine the value and utility of such resources that indicates the confines of the underdeveloped communitys dynamic ability to fulfill its drive to self determination the characteristic malaise of the century is a natural attainment in the existential experience of the afroamerican an acquired taste in the existential experience of the modern african this malaise created by the awareness of abundance and the waste of human material in a plethora of wars and crises arising as often as not out of vague and nonideological stupidities that pass for political disagreements between developed communities has touched the afroamerican as a participant slave but has only touched the african as a conscripted servant here the african advantage compliments rather than overshadows the afroamericans desire to create a history outside of the history that created and continues to mould him in short a movement away from the emotional malaise of his native communitys status quo attitudes the conscriptee status must be forcibly revoked by the african the afroamerican has been a member of the conscripting force and so has intimate knowledge of its establishment and inner motivation but he has never beenand will never bea manipulator of energies within the conscripting force the desire to escape from the membership of the conscripting force is in him similar toand even more overwhelming watts vs sharpeville mandela vs el shabazz thanthe africanasian desire to escape the conscriptee status the above is only one of the huge and looming shadows of ethnocratic justification evolving from any dynamic examination of a possible afroamerican comity with african political realities today but it is the most patently symbolic and at the same time realistic reflection of the true nature of the enthnocratic and revolutionary relationship that can be established out of the quality of brotherhood between these two member communities of the underdeveloped world it is an awareness and recognition of the international crosscurrents of attitude and social stance that binds african and afroamerican experience in a comity of loss and hope that will be the final and most creative point of establishment for the basic unity of spirit that may eventually give rise to a broadbased african community that includes without second thought africans in and from the americas the root of awareness what we should now consider is the root of such awareness and the various moot areas of its beginning for any such awareness to take positive emotional and plastic ideological form in terms of national and or economic policies the patent humanistic elements of the overall theme of brotherhood unity and freedom must be examined and not underestimated programs of development in which afroamericans may be invited to participate in africa must have as their root the principle of mutual and voluntary access to knowledge thus gained rather than the principle of mutual economic hoodwinking which underlies most present day expatriate advisory programs but the quality of sacrifice demanded in terms of misconceptions on the part of the host and guest must include the sacrifice of broad areas of preferable error in the relationships between strangers in other words the afroamerican must seek to understand the african as an estranged brother rather than as an exotic host and the african must seek to comprehend the vital changes that his brother from the americas has undergone once the afroamerican working in africa for african causes understands that these causes are his own and the african working beside the afroamerican in africa understands that only the unimportant factors of time and geographical distance have served to alter the existential experience of his guest truly dynamic styles of cooperation will come into effect it is in this area of understanding that even emotional history becomes economic understanding because in the process of understanding the changes wrought in the spirit of his enslaved brother the african is understanding the true attitude of the white comity of nations towards his own dynamic existence this without the pain at the same time in understanding the dynamic existence of the african as an immediate lifereality rather than as a strange and somewhat quaint abberation the afroamerican is unconsciously reevaluating his own source of history and his own present being in the establishment of a third world force out of this awareness several subtle differences in programmatic behavior must be developed the afroamerican fighting with the angolan or rhodesian freedom fighters is fighting to free the nations resources for the nations good and this rather than the salary received must be his root drive he must not be a privileged soldier must be willing to take must insist on taking a salary commensurate with that paid his angolan and rhodesian brothers the afroamerican who possesses particular technical skills or technological knowledge and who is invited toor volunteers towork in african technical programs must not be a mere replacement of his likely white adviser predecessor who more often than not had merely engaged himself in days of sweat and nights of liquor in the club feeling particularly justified if he was a good one that he had come out at all to help the natives at a cut in salary forgetting always that his overseas allowance invariably raised his actual financial gain way above what he could have had by remaining as an obscure artisan in his own ultra technological society the afroamerican must involve his heart in the most prosaic forms of technical advisory posts in which he serves in africa and must be willing to eschew must insist on eschewing the principle of the overseas allowance this is merely another polite term for increasing the outflow of the underdeveloped communitys wealth the afroamerican whose involvement in african affairs has influence on political trends must seek to be as critical without fear or hypocrisy as he can be the african whose workmate is the afroamerican in such a situation must not be any less critical brotherhood cannot be built or sustained on the gloss of hostguest politeness the critical relationship   at this point we examine the nature of criticism as an aspect of discipline in human relationships criticism comes to full fruition not merely as an offspring of understanding but mainly as an evolution of feeling it is here that the organic youthexperience of both africans and afroamericans must come into recall minor anthropological figures of this century have had a field day pointing out the superficialities of the african connection across the atlantic and positing these superficialities as profundities this fallacious attitude has had an almost disastrous effect on africans and afroamericans alike who seek the easy way to identity but on the much more hidden level of ethnocratic growth much less has been either understood or written some contemporary political writers have pinpointed the growth of the mass awareness of africa on the part of the afroamerican community as having burgeoned with the spate of independence movements in africa that accompanied the downrush of european colonial fortunes in africa after world war ii but such writers are patently wrong the mass awareness of africa among afroamericans grew steadily and on a broad proletariat front ever since the earliest years of this century the marcus garvey syndrome although to a great extent confused with many of the minor anthropological fallacies mentioned before created at least a foundation of thought for possible politicaland therefore ethnocraticcooperation on the basis of a unity of spirit brought about by a unity of cause then in the late forties and early fifties what was added to this evergrowing proletariat conviction was the reciprocation of articulate feeling from african leaders that began to be known on foreign campuses where such leaders had either studied or were still students but active when such leaders returned to their homes and spoke of this kinship the words rang truer in the ears of the middleclass afroamerican community than they had hitherto when only the low class were associated with such sentiments in the late fifties and now in the sixties out of this new legitimacy has grown the articulate revolution of the middleclass youth whose public power is considered more dangerous to the status quo than was the power of the proletariat mass which could always be suppressed and was not the least of the agencies of danger involved in this new growth of understanding between the articulate elite of the afroamerican youth vanguard and the revolutionary community in africa is the fact that the afroamerican youth is able to marshal and consolidate emotional and even mystical ties of blood into concrete as well as abstract political formulas and thus to further legitimize the drive of the community away from the euroamerican status quo towards the revolutionary spirit in africa which in itself seeks to negate european and euroamerican exploitation of noneuropean resources thus the afroamerican has become a named danger in the very midst of the force that his will seeks to negate this precarious situation is what then forms a further basis of critical justification for the afroamericans involvement in the affairs of african nations he understands what it is to be threatened by white prosperity and is critical of any underdeveloped community which allows complacency to destroy the nervous urgency that is established in him on the other hand the afroamerican can be overwhelmed by this need for urgency and can go too far in trying to bring home the need for this urgency to the more relaxed and less pressed african community he often sees in black and white to the exclusion of strength and expedience it is on this level that his african brother is often critical of him these critical areas must not be allowed to grow into antagonistic forces but must be deployed in terms of constructive exchange
the afroamerican whose involvement in africa carries him into the very midst of controversy must cultivate discretion as a political style he must not seek office and must rarely turn it down when offered either act can tear away the curtain of discretion when called upon to sacrifice his comfort or his life he should do so in silence he must not aggravate national disagreements by siding openly with those who take traditional stands of hostility within the community but he must not be afraid to take his stand on national issues with the group that seems to understand the international implications which implications are responsible for his own justification best of all even then his stand must be firm but discreet publicity must devolve on the work done by him rather than on the fact that he is doing the work for this era the afroamerican must be the sacrificial african for upon his effacement rests the reunion in spirit cause and meaning of the construction and reconstruction of an african revolutionary drive with international terms of reference what is more the african will to self determination can infect and sustain the afroamerican will to uncompromising survival only if and when the afroamerican community establishes itself as an integral part of the african community in spirit and direction these are facts of the heart more than that they are circumstance of reality 
contrary to the popu ar belief held by li £ many black people torttsfl da black inen dd not initiate the black liberation movement in the s just as the concept of blackness is not solely a product of the current mood of afroamerica the ideal of black_power is neither new nor originally conceived the struggles that have occurred whether in watts or ocean hillbrownsville should be viewed as only an extension of the black struggle for human dignity which first took shape when proud african warriors threw themselves over the sides of european slave ships rather than submit to the degradation of slavery or rebelled aboard the slave ships as was the case with joseph cinque who freed the black warriors aboard the slave ship amistad in  however more important the th century saw the greatest prolonged surge of black radicalism america has ever experienced many of the demands black people are beginning to raise today historically are directly traceable to the freedom struggles waged by black people in the th century in respect to todays call for armed struggle voiced by many black militants the th century began in a prophetic manner in  gabriel prosser skillfully planned one of the first organized black slave rebellions in america gabriels plans were upset only because of a gigantic rain storm which washed out many of the roads in the area and treachery within his ranks uncle toms are also not a new development as a result gabriel was caught and he along with  other black freedom fighters was summarily executed although in this instance and later with the abortive rebellion planned by denmark vesey in  in south carolina black revolutionary violence was thwarted the lessons learned from these experiences were not lost in  nat turner in virginia organized a tightknit cadre of slaves into a disciplined fighting unit turner then proceeded to stage a protracted uprising against the neighboring white planters before turners rebellion was suppressed more than  white people were killed turner vesey and prosser although the best known early practitioners of revolutionary violence were by no means alone in their stress on armed struggle as a tactical weapon in the fight for black liberation numerous other slave rebellions both recorded and unrecorded took place throughout the south at the same time the sentiment among black people toward armed struggle was not exclusively confined to the slave south in  in boston david walker wrote a position paper on white america this later became popularly known in literature as walkers appeal in it walker openly embraced the principles of armed struggle for black people as walker put it  it is no more harm for you to kill a man who is trying to kill you than it is for you to take a drink of water when thirsty  the view expressed by walker was quite widespread among black people however much hidden as a matter of record little more than a decade later a national negro convention meeting in buffalo new york in  came within one vote of adopting as the conventions resolution a speechcall to rebelliondelivered by a then little known presbyterian minister henry highland garnet garnet stirred the participants of the convention with these words let your motto be resistance resistance resistance no oppressed people have ever secured their liberty without resistance note here that garnet wasnt talking about resistance to slavery alone but to oppression all oppression in his speech garnet also praised the fighting spirit of turner vesey and cinque garnet in effect became the first black leader in america to call for a national liberation struggle nonviolence and moral suasion the tactics then advocated by most abolitionists both black and white were not in garnets vocabulary it is interesting to note that frederick douglass at this convention led the opposition to garnet douglass remarked that there was too much physical force in the address and the remarks of garnet without a doubt garnet as an historic figure deserves much closer attention largely neglected by history garnets ideas clearly conform to many of the feelings held by blacks today garnet was in every sense a visionary of his times garnet unlike many of todays socalled black revolutionaries did not merely talk about armed struggle this was exemplified several years earlier in  when garnet and some friends were attacked by a white mob while attending school in new hampshire garnet then only  and suffering with a fever managed to beat off the attackers with his shotgun after a pitched gun battle in addition to this garnet at the same national negro convention became one of the first black leaders in america to call for the establishment of a national black press which would be solely under the control of the people of color this as garnet saw it would be an effective means of both promoting black unity and of attacking the institutional oppression from white america garnet also was very international in his outlook fluent in german and french he traveled to england in  on a lecture tour sponsored by a british labor society from there he attended the world peace conference held in frankfurt at one time he was also the american delegate to the world antislavery convention as is apparent from this garnet like douglass needs to be  resurrected from history and given his proper reward as a valiant black revolutionary for if frederick douglass is the acknowledged forefather of the civil_rights movement of the early s then henry highland garnet should be equally acknowledged as the forefather of the current black_power movement in the subsequent years garnets influence on the american political scene continued to grow in  john brown who was so inspired by garnet that he had his call to rebellion speech published at his own expense attacked the federal arsenal at harpers ferry this of course directly precipitated the civil war it is also known that at least five black men fought with brown at harpers ferry two of them shields green and john copeland were browns closest confidants copeland captured with brown is reported to have stated on his way to the gallows if i am dying for freedom i could not die for a better cause i had rather die than be a slave over a century later h rap brown would express a similar sentiment no slave should die a natural death alongside armed struggle black men then were beginning to think about a rediscovery of their brutally severed african cultural ties martin delany a black physician was the prime th century mover behind the movement toward black cultural nationalism delanys emphasis on black awareness was so strong that frederick douglass was once prompted to say i thank god for making me a man simply but delany always thanks him for making him a black man delany as a serious student of african history and society laid much of the groundwork for the latterday backtoafrica separatist movements quite significantly delany was the first black leader to formulate the concept of selfdetermination which is so much a part of todays black struggle in  delany wrote every people should be the originators of their own designs the projector of their own schemes and creators of the events that lead to their destinythe consummation of their desires also the interest in black history and black studies a major demand of black students today began to gain momentum among black people in the mids in  william c nell a black abolitionist wrote one of the first black history textbooks in it nell detailed the exploits of black men who fought in the war of independence and the war of  another black leader john rock along with delany gave major expression to the beauty and power of blackness in a speech in  commemorating the boston massacre rock said white men have no room to taunt us with tamely submitting if they were black men they would work wonders but as white men they can do nothing rock in his speech went on to extoll the physical features of black people   the fine tough muscular system the beautiful rich color the full broad features and the gracefully frizzled hair of the negro   similarly the present cry for black control of the black communities has deep roots within the black experience the legitimate desire of black people to own and control the institutions that directly affect their lives was first given formal expression during a national negro convention held in rochester new york in  the convention went on record calling for a national council of the colored people attempts also were made during this convention to form committees on protective unions and business relations both measures were designed to speak directly to the need for black people to control the economies of their communities in conjunction with this the convention called for the establishment of black educational and training institutions and a black library within the black community as the convention noted when we are called upon to consider the subject of education with reference to ourselves and to ask what kind of an institution would best benefit us the answer comes in the light of the announced doctrine namely one that would develop power and that kind of power most essential to our elevation as can be seen not only are the proposals that came out of this convention farsighted and in some respects exceedingly contemporary but the fact that black people were able to convene in such a manner is strongly reminiscent of todays black_power conferences in the year period from  to  there were at least four national negro conventions held since  there have been three black_power conferences all were national in scope and allblack in character it should be understood that this all too brief overview of th century black radicalism is in itself incomplete there were numerous other black men many lost to history who were engaged in constant struggle against the forces of american oppression there were black men such as charles langston who in a speech in  seem ingly anticipated malcolm_xs famous dictum by any means necessary when he said i have long since adopted as my god the freedom of the colored people of the united states and my religion to do anything that will effect that object or black men like william wells brown leroi jones th century literary predecessor who as one of americas first black playwrightwriters adopted black themes in his works with this historical backdrop one can recognize that black radicals such as web du bois william trotter marcus garvey malcolm_x and stokely carmichael who were to come later simply made modifications on the foundations which the early black radicals laid therefore in any future discussion of the historic development of the black liberation struggle in america it is hoped that the th century will be remembered as the era that gave formal birth to black_power
gegeographically harlem lies within manhattan between g y the rivers and north of the park yet it seems to be its own p reality an inner reality encased in a larger outer reality manhattan the other world left and right south and north rises the wall impassible    four poets from four diverse parts of the world all hear harlems heartbeat the spanish poet federico garcia lorca with gypsy blood running in his veins came from granada and heard the rumored frenzy of harlem ah harlem in disguise ah harlem menaced by the tribe of headless dresssuits your murmur comes to me leopold sedar senghor

footsteps of a lass in negro harlem when the night lets fall its veil i see the shapes of girls who pass    and the poet langston hugnes wno came to harlem from missouri knows harlem and is harlem i feel and see and hear harlem i hear you hear you hear mewe twoyou me talk on this page® the four poets identity with the near you hear mewe twoyou me talk on this page for they all sing and in their nocturnal symbiosis tell of the prostitution and the living in harlemcreate four shadows of harlem garcia lorca in his poem the king of harlem dramatizes the frenzied anguish and the chlorophyll hopes of harlem leopold sedar senghor in new york conjures up the phantasmagoria and tattoos out its rhythmical throb in his lyrical rhapsody claude mckay in his harlem shadows with deep pathos wearily laments the prostitution of harlem ah heart of me the weary weary feet in harlem wandering from street to street and langston hughes the poet of harlem wryly humorously if not sardonically bebops the deferred dreams of harlem four poets in impressionistic tones the flitting shadows of harlem life externalizing or internalizing its rumor but since this rumor reaches manhattan all of the poets speculate upon the infusions the coursing or simply the flow of blood between the divided siamese twins manhattan and harlem garcia lorca admonishes harlem that blight and deception will be a consequence of the hasty desire to merge with new york the blood is coming the blood will come by roof and shed everywhere to burn the chlorophyll of the blonde women take flight take flight past the

true as i learn from you i guess you learn from me so even if emphasis is on harlem the interrelationship of manhattan and harlem is constantly thematically projected by the poets how then do the poets present the outer reality for which as garcia lorca puts it mulattos pulled rubber hoping to reach the white torso    for claude mckay that outer world is stern and harsh inflicting deprivation on harlem and bringing about the degradation of its people ah stern harsh world    but to garcia lorca and leopold sedar senghor the outer world does not inflict wounds on harlem in itself it is afflicted like harlems the dreams of manhattan are deferred dreams the vision which both garcia lorca and senghor conjure up of manhattan is unlovely unwholesome a picture of stagnation and rot amidst its startling scientific thrust in stark colors garcia lorca writes of the insomnia of manhattan in the wards are people staggering and sleepless like late survivors of a bloody ship wreck and senghor cries out insomniac nights o nights of manhattan tormented by fatuous fires while the klaxons cry through the empty hours    the poets see the fatuousness the emptiness the hollowness in life in new york they speak too of the unwholesomeness of relationships sometimes the coins in furious angry swarms sting pierce devour abandoned children in a transferred image of shipwreck and abandonment senghor picks up the theme of dark waters both see pollution present in manhattan the images become grey and dark in antagonistic terms which emphasize the unnaturalness of phenomena in manhattan lorca depicts a hurricane of dark doves dabbling in rotten water in senghor all the birds of the air fall suddenly dead below the high ashes of the terraces  the girth of science too pollutes creating from the natural a metallic unnaturalness science is without direction and so obfuscation follows light is buried among the links of noise in a shameless challenge of unrooted science consequent on unrooted science is that artificiality which senghor makes patent in the first part of his poem new york in broken antagonistically stark lines mouths become lipless girls legs almost turn to nylon no tender words    hard cash buys artificial hearts  and all around them the poets find the rigidity of steel girders which by extension moves into the rigidity of feelings things and emotions lack the softness of the curve and so senghor marooned in manhtattan moans the nostalgia of childrens hands and mothers breasts seeing only the hard anguish which stifles creativity thus from the painters palette sprout not things that grow but things that are ossified and dead the painters palette flowers with crystals of coral the poetic vision of new york to garcia lorca and senghor is one of pollution and sterility fraught with hopelessness and anguish dawn comes no one receives it on his mouth for here no morning nor hope is possiblethere too in manhattan in the outer reality beyond the walls of harlem dreams are deferred and lorca reiterates the american girls bore in their bellies children and money bags and the boys hung swooning outstretched on the rack of the waking yawn another part of the deferred dream comes together to form the total the montage of a dream deferred for those people from harlem who have gone to the outer world fleeing the bitter dream of harlem though they seem to have achieved success they too hughes ironically suggests live a deferred dream and the one who has moved downtown from bebop to bebach misses harlem on sunny sunday afternoons when the kids look all new and far too clean to stay that way  the preceding quotations reveal all the tenderness and lova which hughes feels for harlem and because of this feeling of tenderness and love when hughes conjures up the nightmarish quality of harlems dreams deferred his tone becomes bitter and sardonic though always wryly humorous for more often than not there is no sunday best in hughes montage of a dream deferred there is not the sheer delight of being wrapped by harlems neon lights or of dancing in a warm embrace with harlem as in manhattan dawn is hopeless and awakening is darkened by the shadow of an unfulfilled past and overcast by a cloudy future the dance then becomes only a drugging hiatus all these are but hallucinations where temporary technicolor lights shine on the nightmare of a dream deferred sex too enlivens a dull existence lights up the night of hughes harlem montage with a witty banter that highlights this problem hughes jibes by question and answer jibe and jive from bebop to bebach upbeat to downbeat hughes recreates harlem in all its social dimension reveals its hopes and frustrations its laughter and tears he depicts too a careless bebop insouciance a nonchalance a careless disregard with which many cats in harlem coolly view legal institutions and jailings in that ooppopada is all the flinching laughter everpresent in montage of a dream deferred hughes presents harlem bebop boys and girls together in the gutter and claims that to rise out of it to not have the dream deferred to achieve anything at all requires a morethanhuman effort in montage of a dream deferred the pulse beat of the poem the tempo constantly increases as we move from dream boogie boogie  am through ladys boogie through blues at dawn through dream boogie variation to nightmare boogie there is the tingle of a tear the trilling the treble whirling of a treble and it looks as if the musicians eyes are teasing pain but sometimes we sense in the bass notes of the boogiewoogie rumble an ominous note langston hughes does not explicitly answer the questions as does garcia lorca in the king of harlem hughes and garcia lorca the one from harlem and across the park the one from granada and across the seas two poets who felt and wrote about their solitude at columbia universityboth foresee an ensuing confusion if a dream is too long deferred  garcia lorca in his long poem objectively dramatizes with elemental motifs the frenzy and confusion which he senses throbbing in harlem the poem externalizes barrenness and sterility anguish and violence ruin and chaos both people and phenomena all are disturbed frenetic the picture is unrelieved the shadows are deep and dark here there is none of the humor or sardonic laughter of langston hughes none of the fantasy of senghor or the evocative pathos of claude mckay the poem opens with a series of four graphically elemental slashes hard brush strokes which are repeated throughout the poem and present a totally stark and lovely canvas the king of harlem is raving his subjects are weeping the children pursue their little cruelties the landscape scurries away in dread  throughout the poem the kings delirium the kings obvious powerlessness evoke the uncontrolled weeping and confusion of his subjects whose anguish and stifled violence reach out to the poet and the poet cries outthe imprisoned bloodthat too as it seeks an issue any issue to the outer reality may bring with it selfdestruction and emptiness may find only the blood that speaks by a thousand roads death powder dusted ashes of nard    the blood from commingling with landscape from living in the daggers thorn in the heart of landscapes   now takes on added fury and power and is rusting the careless tradewind in a footstepmelting the butterflies on the window panes and the wind in its turn takes on the fury of the king of harlem becomes a wooden south wind which in this picture of total confusion and destruction in which eyes of crocodiles are gouged out squirrels are beaten in frenzy in which moths and butterflies are smothered and beatles are drunk in this picture of violence the poet asserts that it is necessary to kill the goldenhaired whisky seller for the king of harlem to chant with his full choir  like hughes but more explicitly garcia lorca repeats that the dream that is deferred too long may explode but the poet sees the explosion as endemic to the outer reality which has its own confusion this is the same wise silence which the dancer in claude mckays the harlem dancer keeps as she proffers her body to prostituting glances there is none of the harshness of garcia lorca in these poems of mckay neither is there the ironic laughter of hughes there are only bare shadows and painted prostitution mckays harlem dancer evokes all the nostalgia of distance and of deferred dreams in contrapuntal tones the poet reveals the two distinctive ways of seeing the dancer to the applauding youths and their prostitute compaions the dancers perfect body awakens desires and highpitched laughter they only see the externals of movement and body the poet however lyricizes the dancer whose outwardly perfect form is heightened by her silent resistance to prostitution to me she seemed a proudlyswaying palm but others who have to prostitute themselves bodily are not as resilient as mckays harlem dancer in his harlem shadows the figures of the girls are thinly clad they are not swaying palms but rather uprooted wandering and weary here the poet conjures up the mood of unending hopelessness of unending weariness on and on throughout the night the feet go trudging here there is only a certain amount of tramping in a dream deferred there are no undertones of the bass beat of the marching feet of hughes in the harlem dancer even though her dancing for her livelihood seems as unending as the trudging of the feet there is a sense of otherness and escape she is almost through a transmigration of feeling theres a certain amount of escape in a dream deferred in mckays harlem shadows the figures that flit through the dark streets are timid fragile almost on the verge of being consumptive phantoms conversely in the harlem dancer the picture of the dancer is that of a beautiful black woman upon whose swarthy neck black shiny curlsluxuriant fell in langston hughes the faces the figures who rumble through the night possess shadow facesin the shadow night    momentarily however the poet transforms his usually shadowy faces into those found in the poem the harlem dancer and hughes will dance with you till daydance with you my sweet brown harlem girl in garcia lorca there is no transformation in the shadows the darkness of the shadows is unrelieved the night has no portals in your night face up no blush there is no harlem dancer rather there is frenzy in the dance the wind ruptured the veins of the dancers in senghor harlem night is transformed into a fantasy one can almost hear hughes says take it away senghor senghor picks up and we hear the notes from mckays harlem dancer    the sound of blended flutes blown by black players upon a picnic day and senghor proclaims i have seen them preparing at flight of day the festival of the night i proclaim there is more truth in the night than in the day the wind is not an element of destruction the shadows have taken on strength night a positive force where the feet of the harlem dancer are charged with earth rhythm and the poet rhapsodizes harlem harlem i have seen harlem harlem a breeze green with corn springing from the pavements ploughed by the bare feet of dancers   ft differing from garcia lorcas the king of harlem phenomena in senghors poem are not jarring elemental and destructive the wind does not rupture the veins of dancers it becomes a lifegiving breeze green with corn phenomena do not jangle they harmonize into ballets of lilies and fabulous masks    even though in harlem senghor finds licentiousness and violence the mangoes of love roll from the low houses under the police horses hooves even though there is bacchanal where there run down the sidewalks streams of white rum and streams of black milk in the blue  haze of cigars the scene is carnivalesque it does not contain the sterility and barrenness which we noted in the outer reality where the poet senghor found no well or pasture but rather encountered blue metallic eyes and frosty smiles the poet had cried out to the outer reality insomniac night o nights of manhattan    these nights become purified in the poets vision of the inner reality harlem where the curative elements of manna and hyssop flow nightfall is    the pure hour when god sets the life before memory germinating in the streets    in those streets of harlem senghor like lorca feels the anguish of harlems blood garcia lorca had cried ah harlem harlem harlem there is no anguish like    your shuddering blood within the dark eclipse    senghor had echoed listen new york listen to    the muted anguish of your tears falling in great clots of blood   c to the anguish garcia lorca had coupled a garnet violence senghor allied to the muted anguish a brazen male voice a vibrant oboe voice this is the voice which senghor urges new york to listen to a voice which might bring a harmony which might bring about a time of signs and reckonings when the outer reality manhattan and the inner reality harlem become a chorus blending their voices and so the harsh visions of the outer reality proffered by garcia lorca and senghor the four shadowy visions of harlem evoked by our four poets may be reconciled senghor invokes new york to listen to  the far beating of your nocturnal heart rhythm and blood of the drum drum and blood and drum garcia lorca admonishes the shadowy figures in his king of harlem not to remain the ivory salamanders in the cleft of the night but urges them to
if mankind survives faraway generations will wonder what i £ america was likenot because america is now great or £ powerful but because it is the vast laboratory where one ispaicqsiis most pr°f°und experiments in the history of human life is still taking place the subject of the experiment is the negroa hypothetic average of the american black manand the object of that experiment is the identification of those characteristics and methods by which men might achieve humane survival in the face of demoniac obstacles it is a hopeful assumption that the experiment is presided over by some cosmic force kindly disposed toward our earthly race a force into which our forthcoming adventures on the moon and other planets might give us some unexpected insight america then has been a metaphor to mankind while it has been both a time and a place for the evolving spirit of the black man torn from africa stripped of ancestral culture family affections and many hopes and after two and a half centuries of slavery thrust suddenly into a complex industrial society while mankind has watched this black man from a distance coming closer largely through books motionpictures and radio and television programs conceived mostly by white men the black writer has lived the metaphor he has known america with an intensely prophetic vision inaccessible to the routine mechanics of the historian and other scholars the most subtle insights of the black man have daily preserved his sanity and optimism in a brutal environment of irrational color prejudice if it is true that the best writers of black america like the best writers of any society are among mankinds most sensitive beings it follows that their best literary creations are a universal resource of thought and feeling precious to the world what these writers have had to say before  therefore is authentic commentary upon the willingness and capacity of the united states to function for its black citizens as a civilized nation black america has more than lived up to its social contract paying its way through the thankless toil of its ancestors in bondage through the largely unremembered blood of its sons in every war and through its monumental patience from the days of the slave drivers lash to the present decade of the assassin and the spy it is the determination of white america that raises doubts verification continues that the nation is grappling with a historic sickness but nations like individual men do recover if they have the will to surviveand if the abuses of the laws of being have not been so enormous as to invite an irreversible doom a word of caution must precede even a brief glance at  years of negro literature especially since the phrase protest literature has obscured the whole tradition the black writer like the unappeaseable old captain ahab in melvilles moby dick paces the deck of his memories wearing an ivory leg to replace the one bitten off not by a whale but by an agent of a force capable of greater evil and like old ahab walking on life and death and unable to forget the malice and the challenge of the white whale the black writer inevitably walks on one leg of death and unforgettable anguish and on another leg of life and hope readers must not approach the writings of a black man then expecting to categorize them neatly as social protest for the black writer has achieved a marvelous equilibrium in balancing himself on both legs the mere fact that he must walk at all explains his literary attack against conditions that would keep him forever crawling the fact that he must walk like a man but at his own pace and with his own stride demands diversity in content and style conceding at the outset a limitation here that barely allows drawing aside the curtain on a literary scene of real magnitude i choose three important literary formsthe novel the short story and the poem to convey a glimpse of black writers views of america searching the records of novels written from the beginning of that tradition through  one can find about  published by negroes ranging from william wells browns clotel or the presidents daughter in  to frank yerbys prides castle in  before the harlem awakening of the s which is a focal point in the development of negro literature black novelists began their evolution in artistic sensibility and political sophistication of the two novels that appeared before the civil war clotel combines some of the facts of slavery with rumors of president jeffersons amours with negro women the second one is interesting for its early analysis of racial prejudice in the north there followed a year lapse in the production of novels by negroes an apparent example of the effect of the ascendancy of force in contemporary events on creative human energies the civil war and the reconstruction period were the oppressive factors in this instance in the last  years of the century only six novels by black writers appeared and of them only two merit special attentionattention unrelated to their small artistic value frances e w harper was the first negro to write a novel about the reconstruction period her novel lola leroy  shares its bit of historical value with paul laurence dunbars the uncalled  worthwhile for its autobiographical references between  and  years which include primarily the vast migrations of black people from the south as well as world war i the most important novelists were charles w chesnutt dunbar w e b du bois and james weldon johnson as novelists they anticipated the literary themes of the harlem awakening or as men they personally influenced the leaders of that movement chesnutts the house behind the cedars  began the serious treatment of the theme of negroes passing for white dunbars scenes of gay lowlife in harlem in the sport of the gods  forecast famous novels of the s du boiss scholarly novel the quest of the silver fleece  brought a new factual political sophistication into the narration of racial struggle for he explained how the cotton industry affected washington politics northern industrialism and southern prejudice james weldon johnsons novel the autobiography of an excolored man  which directly influenced five or six novels of the harlem awakening freed the negro novel from its dependence upon southern and other american scenes for his cosmopolitan novel was set in europe as well as in the north also his treatment of negro life and music in new york was transitional other black novelists of the  period whose names are less well known now have the historical distinction of being the first to write novels totally or substantially on the following themes black nationalism negro pioneers in the west negro war veterans and the great migrations to the north novels by at least eight black authors of this period developed the washingtondu bois controversy which argued the relative merits of the policy of racial submissiveness followed by booker t washington and the policy of aggressive militance exemplified by dr du bois this controversy was simultaneously carried forward in autobiography short fiction poetry and drama the novels published during the harlem awakening of the s are less important than the phenomenon of the decade itself its social glamor and artistic vigor have never been equalled the several causes of the harlem awakening therefore are significant first negroes who became soldiers abroad or migrants to the north learned that all people with white skins were not prejudiced and that freedom for black people within the american system of government was possible second the emotional dazzle and racial appeal of marcus garvey with his black dolls black newspaper black steamship line and black god stimulated authors as well as the poorer negroes garvey pulled together several strands of negro philosophy the selfreliance of booker t washington the militance of du bois and the emerging selfpride of black people third a new interest in afroamerican history was stimulated by publications that followed the creation in  of the association for the study of negro life and history and similar interest in african painting and sculpture was encouraged by the revolutionary discoveries and work of picasso of the art collector paul guillaume of the art critic guillaume apollinaire and of several french painters composers and writers fourth there was the attraction of harlem itself the home of the garvey movement and of the most powerful negro organizations magazines and newspapers most of the negro writers and artists who were to achieve fame before  came to harlem during the s harlem was also an attraction to whites a fact which was the fifth cause of the harlem awakening some whites who visited nighttime harlem merely wanted to forget the war and to engage their new freudian awareness by escaping into exotic black cabaret life other white visitors were serious writers and artists such as theodore dreiser and george gershwin white readers unable to go to harlem night clubs could feel their attraction by reading the primitivistic works of eugene oneill sherwood anderson waldo frank and especially carl van vechten whose controversial novel nigger heaven  was very popular there were a few other causes such as personal relationships between black and white writers examples were the business and literary associations with white writers experienced by claude mckay james weldon johnson and langston hughes consequently leading national publishers who seldom handled books by black authors before the s began to recognize both their merits and their commercial possibilities the final overreaching cause of the harlem awakening was the steady decline in the popularity of the late booker t washingtons shameproducing conciliatory philosophy giving way to the assertive pride of what was called the new negro langston hughess statement of  has often been quoted as the manifest of this new negro in his essay entitled the negro artist and the racial mountain hughes declared we younger negro artists who create now intend to express our individual darkskinned selves without fear or shame if the white people are pleased we are glad if they are not it doesnt matter  if colored people are pleased we are glad if they are not their displeasure doesnt matter either we build our temples for tomorrow    and we stand on top of the mountain free within ourselves out of this creative upsurge came a dozen or so black novelists among them at least three who deserve special mention du bois mckay and nella larsen each publishing a novel in the same year  du boiss dark princess treating a group of african and asian revolutionaries explored the negroes plight in its worldwide setting mckays home to harlem with its colorful violent depiction of harlems lowlife and underworld was probably the most popular novel of the decadeits sequel of the following year entitled banjo even more dramatically used the european lowlife of the marseilles waterfront as a setting for the clash of negro and white attitudes nella larsens novel quicksand dealt with questions of morality and color prejudice by converting them into passions in the breast of a neurotic woman of mixed parentage also in  there appeared a novel important for its inauguration of satire into the tradition rudolph fishers the walls of jericho in the subsequent decades of the depression at least three separate influences marked negro literature first the proletarian ideology encouraged by national introspection urged american writers to use art as a weapon in the class struggle the black writers racial pride that characterized the harlem awakening therefore was in the s some times merged with the proletarian insight that a workingclass hero fighting industrial and propertyowning tyrants deserved a place in literature second that racial pride was in the s given extra intellectual depth by essays in new journals such as the journal of negro education founded in  and the negro history bulletin founded in  black peoples civic and higher educational institutions also increased their emphasis upon racial history third the governments federal writers project which gave many black authors literary work to do during the depression sponsored serious regional and historical studies that provided both facts and inspiration the novels published during the depression encompassed at least seven types and some of these novels were the first of their kind the first type was the war novel represented by victor dalys not only war  the earliest negro novel about world war i the second type was the novel of folkways which was practiced by zora neale hurston george wylie henderson and george w lee hendersons ollie miss  was about sharecropping and lees river george  was about a legendary racial hero a mississippi college student named george who planned to free his race from oppression the third type of novel was the historical novel best represented by arna bontemps black thunder  on gabriel prossers slave rebellion of  the fourth type might be loosely called the proletarian novel forcefully represented by the short novels of richard wright collected in the  edition of uncle toms children the fifth type was the college novel originated by owendell shaws greater need below  which explored life in a southern negro college the sixth type was the family history initiated when waters edward turpin published two novels these low grounds in  and o canaan in  the former traced four generations of family life and the latter covered one generation of the chicago experiences of a family from mississippi the seventh and final type dealt with migrant workers william attaways let me breathe thunder  influenced by steinbeck was concerned with white boys trapped by the fate of migrant field hands perhaps only four or five of the odd novels of this decade would repay close analytical study such as bon temps black thunder hendersons ollie miss and the work of zora neale hurston but the tradition of the negro novel was gaining solid substance in  the publication of one great novel wrights native son had the impact of a national event unforgettable in its variety of indications literal allusive metaphorical and symbolicalof ways in which the sensitive black protagonist is doomed before birth in his struggle toward human selfidentity native son stands alone in literary history world war ii itself had a less profound influence on the negro novel although the war did force advances in civil_rights those advances culminated in supreme court decisions favoring social justice in interstate travel housing voting and education presidential executive orders ended segregation in the armed forces and made the gesture of ending employment discrimination by firms having government contracts but while negro soldiers abroad were absorbing a new cosmopolitanism that would widen the themes of novels they were deeply aware of the nazilike attitudes at home which caused riots in both harlem and detroit in  in the s then the followers of wrights literary example were urged on by at least three forces by the emotional magnetism of native son itself by racism in the national environment and by the naturalistic tradition already famous in the novels of dreiser dos passos and farrell wrights followers however did not share his genius their work is best represented by chester himes if he hollers let him go  and by willard motleys knock on any door  himes battered his raceccnscious protagonist thoroughly before letting him ecape into military service motley borrowing wrights main plot rather than his intentions gave a naturalistic picture of the defeat of his young italian hero the most ably written novels of the decade did not depend upon native son william attaway in writing blood on the forge  improved upon turpins earlier account of migrants by adding symbolism and deeper realism attaway treated the deterioration of three kentucky brothers working in northern steel mills two other superior novels were written by women ann petry and dorothy west the formers country place  employing symbols and metaphors reminiscent of the work of nathaniel hawthorne explored the declining yankee traditions of a connecticut town dorothy wests the living is easy  satirically condemned the harmful behavior of middleclass negro bostonians struggling to escape their racial heritage because of unrestricted length and relative freedom of style in the novel one can assume that its fullness of negro expression has been limited only by the imagination and skill of the novelists as a group one must of course always keep in mind the inhibiting effects of unimaginative publishers perhaps then a notion of black writers views of america before  can be gained by the addition of less detailed references to short stories and poetry the first short story published by a negro was frances e w harpers the two offers  it praised a white woman who was an antislavery crusader between that year and  the two most important short story writers were chesnutt and dunbar both men but especially chesnutt had to consider white magazine readers accustomed to degrading or simpleminded stereotypes popularized by such white writers as thomas nelson page and joel chandler harris chesnutt whose publisher did not reveal his racial identity for about a dozen years explored the following themes color prejudice folk negro psychology and southern hatreds that cause both subtle and brutal injuries dunbar more so than chesnutt created simple negro characters who spoke plantation dialect but he also deviated into such themes as negro leadership and negroes problems in industry and education between  and  george marion mcclellan and joseph s cotter took advantage of the groundwork laid by chestnutt and dunbar mcclellans volume of stories was noteworthy for its study of the disadvantages suffered by negro women cotters work began the emphasis upon sordid realism in negro experience during the harlem awakening three short story writers predominated jean toomer rudolph fisher and eric walrond toomer wrote uniquely poetic stories about idealistic young people fisher writing while practicing medicine turned out prizewinning stories published in atlantic monthly and other distinguished magazines walrond reared on the island of barbados wrote a volume containing vivid morbid pictures of human deterioration in the tropics the tropics also provided the setting for half of the twelve stories in mckays volume of the early s although these storiesas well as the remaining ones which were about harlemnarrowed their main interest to sexual intrigue and color prejudice it was langston hughes and richard wright however who led the short story writers of the s hughes explored new depths of common negro urban life with humor and satire as well as with bitterness wrights work powerfully dramatized the ways in which southern black people both young old were brutalized the best known other short story writers of the depression were the following john f matheus rudolph fisher zora neale hurston arna bontemps and ralph ellison the s brought more writers of short fiction to public attention the best being ann petry chester himes frank yerby and john henrik clarke ann petrys work appeared in the anthology best american short stories of  himes by  had published ten stories in esquire alone and clarke wrote stories while starting a career as editor book reviewer and essayist the destiny of yerby whose early stories show that he might have become a follower of wright was changed by the popularity of his novels although these writers placed their stories in firstclass traditional periodicals they found special encoragement in new negro magazines for example negro story in its spring  issue alone published two stories by ellison two by himes three by hughes and several others by minor authors black poets who deserve a booklength history of their own were first represented by three slave poets lucy terry who in  wrote verse about an indian raid by jupiter hammon whose work appeared in  and by phillis wheatley who after her original publication in  imitated alexander pope and received much acclaim in england the next poet of historical consequence was george moses horton the title of whose volume the hope of liberty  indicated his purpose in writing it the book did not bring horton enough money to purchase his freedom but it did secure his reputation as the first slave to use poetry to protest his bondage he was also an early stylist in the humor and satire that were increasing in american literature fifteen years after the hope of liberty frances e w harper the bestknown negro poet of the s preserved in her poem the slave auction a generalized picture of the grief of black families callously divided and separately sold on the auction block negro poets in the second half of the nineteenth century generally fit either a precivil war or a postwar category the prewar poets were usually conventional versifiers demonstrating that they were cultured americans deserving firstclass citizenship their names are minor in negro literature the postwar poets however thrown into the literary war started by irwin russell harris and page had to choose between striking down or humanizing the stereotypes popularized by those white founders of what has been called the plantation tradition the postwar poets as diversified then as black poets are today were divided in their choices albery a whitman chose to strike the stereotype down sounding sometimes like spenser byron or tennyson and sometimes like whittier or bryant whitman used both negro and indian themes to picture black men as heroes the rise to fame of paul laurence dunbar just before  has been called the most important event in the history of negro literature but when americas leading critic william dean howells praised dunbar without racial condescension the poets public image as a writer of negro dialect was also confirmed howells praise ironically trapped dunbar in the shadow of the plantation tradition he is not usually associated with poetry written in standard english which is the kind he most often wrote the lyrical poems that he preferred are not forgotten but he is famous for his dialect poems and for such sternly racial poems as we wear the mask dunbars contemporaries who worked with less originality in the dialect tradition are little known today between  and  black poets remained divided into two main groups that approximated the earlier categories first those who imitated past english and american masters and second those who claimed the heroism and rights of negroes or sympathetically pictured their folk ways the first group achieved a literary detachment from the racial repression and violence of their own times representative of their work were the lyrics of william stanley braithwaite the charming verses of benjamin brawley and the nature poetry of george marion mcclellan the second group which includes du bois fenton johnson and lesser known figures breathed into their poetry the anger they felt in the midst of racial abominations du boiss vehement poem a litany at atlanta an outstanding example was written on the train he was riding to investigate the atlanta riot of  the black poet and college teacher margaret walker commenting on the wealthy white patrons who financed some of the poetry writing of the harlem awakening observed that they did so as a fad to amuse themselves and their guests at some of the fabulous parties of the twenties the poetry itself however was usually serious and volumes of permanent value were written by james weldon johnson claude mckay countee cullen and langston hughes johnsons best poetry especially o black and unknown bards and his book of freeverse poetic sermons gods trombonesretained the eloquence and rhythm of important predecessors without depending upon dialect mckay an intense poet who seemed to one of his firends to have a furnacelike fire within him wrote excellent sonnets and lyrics that were angry but artistic expressions of negroes many discontents his book harlem shadows  represents his best work his most famous poem is the sonnet if we must die which is so eloquent in its insistence upon negro resistance to tyranny that winston churchill appearing before a joint session of the american congress quoted the poem without naming its author to inspire americans to enter world war ii countee cullen who said that he wanted to be a lyric poet like john keats but who responded more and more to racial injustice as he grew older had the gift of making the ordinary seem beautiful a classicist at heart cullen wrote remarkable sonnets his first volume entitled color  was his best his own favorites among his poems appeared posthumously under the title on these  stand  langston hughes whose most famous poem the negro speaks of rivers was published when he was  composed two outstanding volumes during the harlem awakening the weary blues  and fine clothes to the jew  also in the s hughes who was to remain the most important innovator and experimenter in all of negro literature initiated the practice of reading poetry accompanied by music in addition he introduced the pattern of the blues into poetry hughes was the first poet to picture black people regularly as merely people and to find permanent human and literary worth in such lowly negroes as porters bootblacks and field hands two other poets who were important in the harlem awakening but who did not then publish volumes were jean toomer and arna bontemps the black poetry of the s shows two tendencies regionalism and a sometimes classoriented social criticism thus exhibiting both the concentration and the expansion of racial thought characterisic of the decade the best volume sterling browns southern road  reflects the regional and slaverytime studies fostered by the federal writers project as well as lingering garveyism and the historical awareness promoted by new negro journals and organizations a new poet frank marshall davis published black mans verse  and  am the american negro  volumes filled with harsh criticism on the other hand black labor chant  a book by another new poet david wadsworth cannon jr who died while a doctoral student at columbia university reveals negroes expanded vision of themselves as part of the workingclass which should unite before  names now well known were being heard melvin b tolson robert hayden owen dodson and margaret walker among their socially realistic early poems were at least two that would become prize winners margaret walkers for my people and tolsons dark symphony in the s three poetic modes were dominant the lyrical the experimental and the racial the lyrical tradition always carried forward by the very nature of poetry was maintained principally through volumes by hayden tolson and braithwaite the experimental tradition on the other hand represented a delayed response on the part of black poets to the stylistic freedoms that other american poets had taken between  and  that is the free verse imagism and other techniques used by walt whitman and emily dickinson by french symbolists and by spanish modernists hayden belonged in this tradition as did dodson and a few others the racial thrust almost as natural to black poets as lyricism was continued by davis and hughes and was joined by a newcomer gwendolyn brooks her second volume the pulitzer prizewinning annie allen  showed a flair for symbolism and experimental syntax hughes halfway through his long career was especially effective with his satirical poems in shakespeare in harlem  and with his humorous but biting madam to you series in oneway ticketa his experimental inclination continued in his topographical poetry in oneway ticket as well as in his blues and jazz verses between the eighteenth century and  then black writers of fiction and poetry have suggested such a complex varied picture of america that no single impression emerges nevertheless a brief synthesis of their common evolution might simplify that picture before the civil war they mounted their attack on slavery and northern prejudice after the war through reconstruction and until  some black writers replaced the stereotypes of the plantation tradition with heroic figures or with humanized folk negroes while other writers either turned to the psychologcial and economic effects of racism or imitated english and american masters between  and  certain subjects received original or increased attention especially those reflecting new political and societal insights during the harlem awakening black writers became less

the book is a novelpoem sarah e wright wastes no words she is clear she is precise and she uses her technical capabilities to infuse and successfully a lifeflow between the characters who live inside of this childs gonna live lawrence delacorte  and her readers and successfully more than a lifeflownearly a transference of presence all of which makes reading the beautiful experience it can be mariah upshur is a black woman concerned with survival for her children and the movement of the story of mariah her husband jacob their children living dead andabouttobeborn centers on her anxious impassioned desire to take them out of the wasted land of death in which they live mariah and her family live vividly as the reader feels into their minds sister wright avoids none of the conflicts of black marriage black family life and her insights are relevant for now even though the setting is the depression years strong parental figures are worked throughout the story there is incest and the weaknesses which give rise to it themes of superstition undercurrent motivations for mariah and they do not really conflict with the strong reality of her christian religion but are interwoven and absorbed and traditionally so with her rational beliefs when i began the reading of this book i was tempted to feel that this is a womans book but it is not it is a book for black people and it is that because of the fullness with which sarah e wright has given us the panorama of a black family over several generations who have owned their own land and have been gradually losing it to a local white family as the story is created mariah discovers the reason for the loss and also discovers the blood relationship between the two families there are themes which all black people are familiar with the personal conflict between black and white the struggle for economic independence the parental will for security for one s children the guilt from infidelity with concommitant selfpunishment and conscience flagellation but these themes are not tired in this childs gonna live they are rather alive and challenging and involving as the pages are turned it is a creation well worth reading it has power and it lives and flows
on october   in the small town of £ brundidge alabama  i was christened alexander by my parents james lucus and annie marshal bell this information was related to me by my grandmother who reared me from a baby both my parents died before my third birthday other than the fact that they both died young my mother from a chronic illness and my father from an injury suffered while serving in the second world war there is little that i know about my parents for some reason my grandmother never talked much about them and for the same reason perhaps i never asked many questions before my ninth birthday we moved to troy alabama another small town twelve miles north of brundidge there i grew up and lived a very normal childhood by my seventeenth birthday i was already a rapist a high school dropout a threetimes jailbird and well on my way to the reformatory school i hated and feared the world and felt that the world hated me how i came to that state of being is a long and complex story however i have always felt that the early death of my parents had much to do with the problems that i encountered during my adolescence at the date of my birth my grandmother was over fifty years of age had reared a large family mostly as a widow and was tired the task of adequately caring for a male child without the assistance of a man would present a difficult jobeven for a young woman for my grandmother the task was impossible in the streets my running pals were neighborsguys whom i had known most of my life and felt that i could trust two of them were my cousins sonny and love who were brothers the third one we called peanutthe joke around the neighborhood being that peanut had small dried up balls which resembled a pea of the three of us love was the oldest the strongest and the wisest peanut sonny and i always looked up to him as our hero and protector and during all those years that we were together i dont think love ever disappointed any of us whenever we would get into trouble after acting toughwhich we did often  enoughlove would come to our rescue and our foe would always reconsider love as they say had a reputation peanut the youngest of the group was an amusing character of highly imaginative spirit who constantly sought adventure i find it very difficult to describe sonny except to say that he was cunning  and he was loves brother it was peanuts love for adventure which led to my first encounter with the police it was saturday morning and a doublefeature was playing at the pike theater neither of us had any money and we both wanted to see the flicks as usual peanuts imagination came to the rescue the solution to our problem was simple we would steal iron from one junkyard sell it to another junkyard and with our earnings we could attend the movie it sounded easy enough to me ill never forget the shocked and disappointed look on my grandmothers face when she saw me standing in the doorway trembling tears pouring out of my eyes and knots swelling on my forehead where i had been beaten with a billy club with the burly white cop holding me by the collar of my  shirt and blurting out indignantly auntie we caught this here rascal stealing iron if you wanna get this little thieving bastard back you better follow me down to the station in the following years i had many encounters with the police but i never hated any cop more than i hated that big dumbfaced bully that dragged me in guilt before my grandmother for many years to follow it would be difficult for me to live with her both of us would be tortured by a sense of failureour failure to understand each other the ironstealing episode was my first encounter with the cops but it wouldnt be my last during the following month i became totally disgusted with what might be referred to as the systemthe school the teachers the students the whole bitand began to hang out with love and sonnypeanuts iron stealing experience having slowed him down considerably at the house of a group of young ladies who were notorious for their charm the casey house became a place of recreation and a refuge there we drank booze gambled made love and ate and slept in a relaxed atmosphere by this time i had intellectuallyif not emotionallyrejected the moral standards of my grandmother and society in general the caseys home served as a source of inspiration to my rebellious attitude the happiness that i witnessed there confirmed my belief that many of the moral standards of society are not only useless but that in many cases they are a hindrance to the common good as for the casey girls i believe they are some of the finest people i have ever met but as with most black people in troy as with sonny love and me they were caught in a world of despair and as with most black people in troy they sought a means of escape but what made the caseys different from other blacks is that instead of seeking refuge in the church they sought relief as they saw fit one of the things i admired most about those girls was that during our many years of association i never knew or heard rumor of them having relationships with white men a phenomenon which occurred frequently in troy even among the high class negroes the caseys were black women nearing my fifteenth birthday i had completely quit school the immediate money in the streets as well as women and booze coupled with my dislike for authority were all factors which influenced my decision to become a dropout but perhaps the strongest persuasion was my knowledge of what happened to other guys who had their high school diplomas most of them seemed to be in worse condition than i the best that a black high school graduate in troy could hope for was a  a week job as a delivery boy for a drugstore  was aware of the fact that it was possible to make more money than that in one night on a billiard table or in a dice game i was convinced that the time one put into getting a diploma wasnt worth it however a series of events were to occur to change my opinion on october   five days before my sixteenth birthday love sonny and i were confronted by an angry cigarchewing tonguebiting bill casey the indictment was seriousrape the night before sonny and i had gotten drunk from homemade whiskey while at the casey house bills woman came looking for him appearing highly drunk and highly sexy sonny suggested that if she couldnt find bill we would be glad to act as substitutes bessie mae said something to the effect that only bill could satisfy her we proceeded to prove her wrong at first everything seemed to be going fine sonny held her legs while i screwed i held her legs while he screwed and bessie mae seemed to be getting a kick out of it herself boastfully joking as we wrestled with her on the bed that she was too much woman for both of us then suddenly before we knew what was happening the house was full of buckeyed males pulling out their rods and hopping on bessie mae realizing that the situation was out of hand the two of us wished her good luck and made a fast exit stage right when bill learned that a train had been pulled on his woman he  pretended to be fiercenot that he ever claimed to love her or anything like that his ego had been hurt as usual love came to our rescue and as usual he was persuasive billwho had a lot of respect for loveagreed not to press chargesprovided that we pay him a small fee and agree to stay away from the casey house we agreedtemporarily anyway approximately two weeks from the date of our meeting with bill i found myself picking beans on a small farm a few miles north of orlando florida my grandmother had somehow learned about the episode with bessie mae and i found it a little too uncomfortable at home the sense of disappointment and failure that existed between us had deepened to the point that she seemed to have developed an accusing indifference which was expressed in an ivegivenuponyou attitude the silence was too tormenting it buried me in guilt i had to escape i borrowed a few dollars from love a few from sonny and went south why i went south i dont know there has always been something downward about me my money gave out before i reached orlando so i said goodbye to the greyhound and started hitchhiking after walking for what must have been a couple of hours i came to a truckstop with a sign in front of it which read bean pickers wanted £ a basket i had never picked beans be fore but i was well familiar with the cotton fields of alabama besides i was broke and getting hungry for the first time in my life hard work was unavoidable i worked three weeks on the bean farm during which time i slept in the cab of a van i was the only black in sight my coworkers were white rednecks from the appalachian area of alabama who seemed to delight in having a strange black creature in their presence they assured me that no blacks were allowed where they came from they were very nice to me while working on the bean farm i did more thinking than i had ever done before it was obvious that i wouldnt last long picking beans it was late in august and all the beans would be harvested within a couple of weeksthree at the most after carefully pondering my fate i came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to return home and reenter school i began to understand that the poor and uneducated would always be at the bottom level of a capitalistic society just like the poor rednecks in the field with me and the poor blacks back home i hated the system but i would try to use it besides i was lonesome i missed love and sonny and the caseys all the people and things at home i missed my grandmother fate was on my side the next day i caught a ride on a van all the way to bainbridge georgia that night i was picked up by the bainbridge police and spent  hours in the bainbridge city jail i was thankful compared to the slanted seats of a van the cell bunk felt good from bainbridge i caught a chicken truck to dothan and from dothan i rode with a minister to troy i returned home and reentered school but instead of getting better things got worse i found it difficult to adjust to the authoritative atmosphere of the school the freedom and dangers of the street had made me somewhat of an independent and aggressive person i resented being told what to do how to do it and when and where to do it my instructors sensed my rebellious attitude and hated me i hated them even more i was sure that my experience in the streets had given me a certain awareness of life that many of them would never obtain as i reflect on those days i sometimes think my instructors knew this to be true maybe thats why their dislike for me was so great they found my constant questions on morals religion and race frustrating there were no answers in the instructors manual my problems at home werent getting any better either the tension between my grandmother and me reached its climax i ended up in jail on a disorderly conduct charge at this stage in my life i was  years old for some reasoni find it less painful not to ponder the matter my grandmother withdrew charges from that point on my situation seemed to change for the better while in jail i made one important decision if i was to survive in this world  would have to discipline myself i realized that it was much easier to make a decision than to execute it but i had to try things began to go my way the following year i joined a school organization known as the new farmers of america nfa an agricultural organization for black male students of the south the school director of the nfa mr julius kennedy is one of the few high school instructors i ever respected kennedy was a big man lie encouraged me to stay in school and as a result of his inspiration i participated in many nfa activities winning state and national honors my success with the nfa greatly increased my prestige on the campus the ds and es which i had been receiving in certain classes turned into as and bs even my problems at home tended to decrease i could sense a feeling of pride for me in my grandmother during my senior year in high school i felt myself slowly pulling  away from the old crowdlove sonny peanut and the caseys we still hung out together at times but my class work i had a lot of catching up to do the nfa and a parttime job kept me busy ive never learned to like the system or institutionalized ways of doing things but by my senior year i was determined to attend college  had nipped on the wine of success and i wanted a larger drink however the decision to attend college meant i had to work twice as hard as before i didnt have any money and my grades werent that good yet i had two aces in the game the first was my nfa record the second was mr julius kennedy they both came through on september   entered through the college gates of the pride of the swift growing south to have the veil of ignorance lifted from my head i had a lot to learn it suffices to say that my general impression of the pride was sickening that impression has never changed approximately four months after i entered college a fellow student jimmy strong was shot in the back by a white service station operator because he sought to use the white restroom the college family marched in the rain while the murderer went free i repeatthe atmosphere was sickening a few weeks after jimmys death i received a telegram from home love was dead he had been knifed to death in a dice  game the ironic connection between the death of jimmy and the death of love hit me like a stone jimmy was a college student love barely had an elementary education jimmy was of a middleclass family many times love had worked in the cotton fields while hungry jimmy had a working knowledge of political and racial concepts love understood the primitive law of the jungle the law of survival yet they shared one thing in common which outweighed all their differences they were both victims of a white racist society i marched for jimmy i wept for lovenot the strong proud and commanding love the love who was always seen by those who never really looked but the love who was seen by those who knew his mercifulness
carol held her report card firmly in one brown hand and clung  to the tall wire fence with the other peering through the spaces at the men working in the sun most of them were shirtless and sweat glistened on their backs and stained their pants as they carried their boards from one place to another making them into giant standing xs a drop of water trickled down one side of her face and dropped inside the collar of her apple green dress she clutched the report card her first a little tighter she hadnt waited at the flagpole today for sylvie now that she had completed kindergarten she felt that she was too old to be escorted to and from school so she had walked on alone feeling maturity on her like a coat of shiny paint that announced her new standing to everyone she passed she had intended to rush home before sylvie who lived next door could report her missing but she hadnt been able to resist stopping to watch the banging the lifting the excitement of a building growing she hoped that it would grow into a toy shop like the one downtown with the little player piano in the window or an ice cream store with hundreds of flavors to choose from two of the workmen standing a little apart from the others had stopped working and were talking carol watched thembig men with big frowning facesstraining to hear what was being said but their mouths moved silently like television when the sound was off their heads jerked as they stepped closer together and she could hear their voices now low and rumbling like a storm coming up then rising into a booming clap of thunder what you call me the man spoke the words slowly through his teeth his wet black chest shining like the seals carol had seen at the zoo you heard me i said nigger the other mans face was splotched with red and pale pink as if it had been pinched in certain selected spots and the thin mouth curled and twisted around the last word nobody    nobody calls me a nigger curling and twisting his thicker lips pushed out the same word yous a lousy nogood nigger a few curious passersby stopped at the fence and the other workmen began to move toward the argument but too slowly to stop the black man as he picked up a board and smashed it against the pinched face man again and again until he fell to the ground with blood popping out all over and even afterward it seemed to carol that the first blow had thrown a switch to change the action from slow to accelerated motion so that now the workmen ran stiffly back and forth like windup dolls bending over the man on the ground and yelling at the other man who waved the bloody board in an angular circle in front of him and shouted stay away from me over and over in a hoarse voice by now a crowd had gathered at the fencelatecomers eager to hear the details and early arrivals eager to share their various versions there was a lot of gasping and several oh my gods and one tall man gently pushed carol away and carefully blocked her view she went as far as the other end of the fence and squeezed between a woman in a pleated skirt and a teenaged boy neither of whom paid any attention to her when the sirens approached the police cars screaming the ambulance hummingthe workmen backed off from the man still swinging the board his whole face was twisted now as only his mouth had been before and the policemens guns went off as the arm was swinging upward stopping it high in the air and reminding carol of the game of statues she had played at recess with patty and janet the police ordered the crowd away and most of them left though reluctantly carol headed down fourth street toward home again taking care not to invoke bad luck by stepping on the lines in the concrete her dress stuck to her back and her stomach felt funny she whispered nigguh nigguh to see if it made her lips curl she wondered what it meant carol baby it was her mother swooping down on her like a plump angel in a frilly apron she threw her arms around carol and squeezed her i heard the sirens and i thought and then angrily why did you leave sylvie im all right mama im big now carol said she was concerned that some of her friends might have seen her mother outdoors hugging her as if she were a baby her mother took her hand and carol had to trot to keep up with her when they reached the house her mother frostily sent her upstairs to change her clothes in her room she kissed jenny the redcheeked doll lying in the middle of the bed then changed into her yellow shorts and white blouse removing the green ribbon that held her short pony tail it didnt match she wishedagainthat her hair would grow long so it would swish from side to side and hit against her face as did the girls in the television commercials and so she could tie her own ribbons in the top drawer of the dresser she found a yellow one and holding it in one hand and jenny in the other went down to the kitchen her mother was in a better mood she kissed carol after she tied the ribbon and carol kissed her back enjoying the warmth of her mothers soft arms now that she was in the house and regretted having upset her mother mama whats a nigguh carol asked her stomach still felt a little fizzy so she only nibbled at the coconut cookies her mother had placed on the table for her she saw her mother pull the inscrutable secret face over her usually expressive one and realized that an answer would not be forthcoming she decided immediately that she wouldnt ask her father when he came in from work because although she had not yet figured out the correlation she knew that the questions and incidents that caused her mother to wear the secret face always angered her father its just a word baby her mother said finally nothing for you to be worrying your little head about finish your cookies so you can watch television carol took jenny with her into the living room to watch cartoons but found it hard to concentrateshe kept seeing the mens faces and the blood and hearing the shouts and sirensthat word it was the power of the word that frightened and fascinated her whether it was a malediction hurled with a pointing finger by a pinkfaced sorcerer or whether it was an attack by a black giant upon anyone who dared to use the forbidden word made no difference either way it was the word itself that held the power to transform a man carrying planks back and forth into the thing with the twisted face carol remembered the day not too long ago when her father had become so angry that hed smashed the glasstopped coffee table with the big orange ashtray he had been pacing the floor shouting about an electrician screwing in light bulbs and her mother had tried to comfort him dont worry so much about it honey shed said we cant change things thats the way they are carols father had picked up the ashtray and turned toward her mother then back to the coffee table and hit it generating cracks that travelled across the sheet of glass in intricate patterns since that day her father had been very quiet almost as if he were not really there when he talked to carol or laughed at one of her jokes she had the feeling that he was looking over her or beyond her at something far away but her fathers anger she knew had been about his job and some other things that she didnt understand not just one word she wanted her brother robbie to get home from junior high school he almost never failed to answer her questions when he had the time a commercial had replaced cartoons on the television set and it was the one with her friends in it the one about toothpaste she loved the glow in the little girls faces the silky beauty of the swishing hair and the swinging skirts she loved them all with the hope that one day she would be surrounded by them or people like themshiny joyous people and she would live happily ever after robbie slammed the front door and the small number of times his feet touched the stairs on the way up told carol that he was in a hurry she took jenny and scampered up the steps behind him hi shorty robbie said without stopping to look at her he was pulling baseball gloves shoes socks and bat from under the bed where you going carol asked where does it look like i want to ask you something not now he said pulling on his sweat socks im late i saw a great big fight and the police and everything she said rushing the words robbie looked up from tying his shoe what happened he hit him with a board because he called him a nigguh oh robbie jerked the shoe string what does it mean robbie he straightened up slowly carol saw his nose wrinkle and his eyes were blinking the way they did whenever she had asked a truly difficult question its    its a bad name that white people call negroes what are negroes the word sounded familiar but she couldnt remember where shed heard it before people with brown skin like us you and me and mama and daddy and our friends well what are white people she asked puzzled as to who was left people with white skin they dont like negroes you always see em on television and downtown and    like jenny well yeah only jennys just a doll after robbie had left to play ball carol went to her room and pulled out her toy chest she opened it and placed jenny face down in the bottom letting the pile of blocks and plastic chairs and books slide down on top of her she wondered if blood had popped out all over jenny she went to the mirror and examined her reflection  dark brown face edged with tiny stubborn balls of hair short stubbly pony tail barely extending past the yellow ribbon she pulled off the ribbon dropping it on the dresser picked up her comb and took it downstairs to her mother mama will you plait my hair her mother took the comb smiling indulgently as she sat down on the sofa baby i thought you liked your pony tail carol sat on the stool at her mothers knee not any more she said
perhaps the complexity of most west inl dian societies is very   obvious because of the icqpttunisti heterogeneous nature of their composition aldous huxley in the introduction to alfred mendes first novel on trinidad entitled pitch lake  observed that the islands mixed population was a gift to any novelist it was its variety of races religions and economic classes that prompted him to make such a remark west indian novelists have certainly not failed to exploit this gift of variety in the caribbean in order to fulfill their purpose as writers take almost any novel of recent years and you will find that whether the scene is set in one of the islands or on the mainland territory of guyana it is the unusual variety of social forces that gives paradoxically both a peculiar and a universal significance to the human drama depicted edgar mittelholzer was almost obsessed with the fact of ethnic confusion in the life and death of sylvia and a morning at the office even in the novels of wilson harris who can hardly be regarded as a social novelist one finds that the six peoples of guyana form the groundwork of his theme as treated in his metaphoric saga from the palace of the peacock to tumatumari although guyana and trinidad are the clearest examples of multiracial populations most if not all west indian societies are composed of the same four basic elements race religion education and money these determine the nature of what grantley russell a character in the life and death of sylvia describes as the complicated social setup in georgetown positively astounding how life goes on at all there are the whites in an exclusive little corner of their own then the highc coloured coloured in various compartments according to good better and best families with money and quality of hair and shade of complexion playing no small part in the general scheme of grading take two steps aside and youre up against the east indians in another cluster with a hierarchy of their own ranging from ricemiller to barristeratlaw and doctor and then down to busdriver chauffeur provisionshopkeeper and sugarestate coolie stumble around and youre face to face with the chinese either shopkeeper or business man stagger off a pace or two and youre sniffing at the portuguese split up into rumshoppawnshop class and professional man class and bigbusiness class my god if it isnt bewildering russell the expatriate englishman married to an illiterate guyanese in his stumbling staggering be wildering vision can hardly be said to hold things in a steady focus his impression is therefore naturally one of senseless confusion but even in a sober clinical analysis of racial types presented in andrew salkeys the late emancipation of jerry stover the impression remains of strains and tensions in the wouldbeemancipated jamaican elite from the bondage of race and colour in chapter four he provides the pedigrees of the chief characters who are a cross section of negro inidan chinese english jew syrian and carib the nature and action of religion vary with the particular history of colonization and immigration in the individual territories where the population is predominantly christian differences between protestants and catholics may come to the surface in times of crisis there is a legion of protestant sects and syncretistic cults in a number of west indian societies the extreme emotionalism of some of these religious bodies derives from african sources for example that of the shouters in trinidad is a legacy from the shango worship of the yoruba of west africa the religious fervor of some of these unorthodox sects and cults is sometimes exploited by demagogues for political ends as may be seen in v s naipauls the suffrage of elvira in guyana and trinidad the majority of east indians are hindu or muslim by religious persuasion naipaul deals mainly with the hindu community in the mystic masseur and a house for mr biswas in the former he studies the astuteness of ganesh the mystic masseur and selfcreated pandit in manipulating the rivalry of hindu groups to get himself finally elected to the legislative council of the island in a house for mr biswas naipauls satirical references to indians converted to christianity for material advantage are unmistakble but he seems to disregard the advantage of christianity as a liberating force from race and a step towards the intermarrying of indians and others in naipaul the hindu religion functions mainly as regards namegiving initiation marriage and death it will be observed that ganesh uses the bhagawat devotional readings and its feasting as a means of gaining favour with the hindu electorate the symbols of indian dress are similarly used by ramsumair ganesh for rising to the position of an executive member of the legislative council when he can safely doff the trappings of hinduism and bask in his european suit as g ramsay muir mbe as naipaul points out towards the end of the novel such a career as that of the mystic masseur would not have been possible without the advantages of the grammar school education for which his father could afford to pay education is the chief aid to social mobility as both xavier and jagabir in mittelholzers a morning at the office realize xavier is black but he knows that a black man can be mayor of port of spain tiger in samuel selvons a brighter sun too knows that the light of learning will show the way to progress and selfawareness many a west indian novel is in one way or another a commentary on the kind of education that makes a west indian into a g ramsay muir mbe or a mr indarsingh bachelor of arts of oxford university london england or perhaps something better than either of these now that there is a university of the west indies the universal bilingualism of the educated west indian fluent in the idiom of the people whether called creolese or by any other name and having also at will a conscious control of standard english is more often than not a sign of the dichotomy of culture that is due to exporting british education to the caribbean complete with bat and ball h o patterson shows this to be true in the case of alexander blackman the chief character in an absence of ruins nourished on just william cricket and celtic melodies blackman comments with nostalgia memory becomes the vehicle merely for the empty shells of melodies for the recollection of a friend who never existed for the odd blindly obeyed commands of a game i used to play for a child who used to walk from street to street and dream of other places of friends he did not know of heroes he did not understand of the adult he would one day become the adult whom he is now who dreams vainly of the boy he once was who used to dream so much    the tension between the peoples idiom and the language of education is apt to cause a disintegration of individual personality and to widen the rift between the working class or peasantry and the middle class a combination of educational and economic factors seems to aggravate racial and color differences thus causing political fissures in the state the late emancipation of jerry stover shows the jamaican population falling into two main camps the voice of the people supported largely by the middle class and the just proletarian destineers to which the working classes belong these two parties represent the government and the opposition there is also the third minority nonpolitical group the rastafarian brethren the three groups are described by jerry as thieves on all three sides opponents on two and everybody rassing around and aspiring to middle class status  jerry stover has just obtained his alevels and is a recruit to the civil service but he is unwilling to conform to the respectablility of the middle class to which he belongs he chafes against the routine of the service is oppressed by the claustrophobic atmosphere of island society and as an apparently irrational gesture of defiance he dedicates himself to debauchery with his fellow middle class termites pledged to undermine the establishment at heart jerry feels the futility of his way of life and a visit to the dungll turns his attention to the needs of the rastafarians with whom he identifies himself after resigning from the civil service he takes up his residence in the squalor of the rasta with the intention of helping to educate them and support their cause for rehabilitation but not for emigration he is joined by a fellow termite the nearwhite mason who is an oxford graduate their rastafarian interlude which begins in lent is an experience of shared communion between all classes and colors the rastafarian brethren in this way become for a time a symbol of the search on the part of all the characters for selfintegration and social unity peace and love the novels of salkey and patterson reveal a genuine desire to enter into the experience of the rasta cult since the brethren are a concrete manifestation of the social malaise in the west indies and also a symptom of the universal unrest typified in the characters of jerry stover and alexander blackman the rastafarians emerged as a social phenomenon before the passive beatniks of america or the activists of black_power roger mais so far ahead of the times wrote a perceptive and significant novel about the true ideal of the peace and love cult in brother man it is an ideal however overlaid in the popular imagination by the caricature of the rastafarian dream of a return to a romantic africa and betrayed by the inconsistent behaviour of adherents of the cult it is obvious that the emancipation of jerry stover and mason is one from traditional values and conventional ways of seeing things but their emancipation fails to bring lasting satisfaction salkeys gratuitous moralising on the frustration of the termites takes this form they all knew it in themselves some of them were willing to continue as they had been deluding themselves contradicting their hopes the others were frightened and panicstricken both sides were without a palliative they knew that black seal bad rum was never intended to be effective both sides were without a plan for their spiritual reclamation jerry and mason had claimed the dungll in desperation but they had not worked out a personal programme in terms of their claim they had not willed themselves to a balanced and precise attack on their weaknesses and cruel excesses they secretly feared a concerted voice a possible remedy they had no private philosophy no binding discipline no real faith in anything all they had was their freedom an emancipation that had come too late they had not had the time and the kind of society in which to use it intelligently to benefit from it to build on it it had come all at once in a frightening lump it had a tired colonial shape there had not been the time to divide it up to live with it to transmute it to put it to work for themselves and their islands destiny both salkey and patterson explicitly state that at least part of the reason for the failure to realize a sense of personal or national identity is the fact that west indian society lacks a true cultural heritage of its own there is what patterson calls an absence of ruins associated with the crum bling empires of the historic past in spite of his initial cynicism with regard to political parties and social reform jerry stover does try to commit himself to the rastafarian cause but alexander blackman in an absence of ruins does not wish to be committed to a world not worth winning when lloyd says we are black men in a white civilization and whether you like it or not youre committed to the freedom of your race blackman replies  i dont want to spend my life being a negro or being a jamaican or being a socialist or a capitalist or what you like    if you must know i simply want to be me to be what i am and that alone takes a lifetime of knowing avoiding involvement with society he ends by being an outsider without identity among the london crowds like ellisons invisible man in new york pattersons character laments an absence of ruins wilson harris strives to reconstruct from the history of guyana a present that contains all time and space associated with the caribbean yet the metaphysics of these two writers complement each other the former seeks fulfillment in the wholeness of the individual being through the negation of everything else the latter aims at the transmutation of all experience into the identity of the individual being when the writers at a recent conference of caribbean artists were being called upon to declare themselves unequivocally in their writings on the side of nonwhite minorities harris made a

novelists he is none the less engaged in the same quest for individual and national identity but a national identity that does not violate any human values in his recent novel tumatumari occurs the significant phrase immunity from race which is achieved by the anoni im uymous dead to achieve nity from race the chief characters have to absorb in their individual life the personalities and

selfrighteousness and selfsufficiency though the drama of harris novel is played out against the guyana landscape the message is universal to expiate the past one must evoke from the depths of ones own complex psyche all the cruelty inflicted and all the suffering endured by all the races of mankind only in this way will selfawareness come and coming engender a sense of the sanctity of all life the west indians depicted in these novels strive to break through the old barriers of insularity and to cross the frontiers of hinterland fastnesses maybe there are important political implications in this fact
