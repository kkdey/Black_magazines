riding on the ebony wings of black pride and black sel fdetermination has been the burgeoning interest in all things appurtenant to the black americans traditional heritage not the least of which has been an assiduity to discover a black language apart from gullah one that would uplift unify inspire and glorify the black man to fill this need a few years ago some people gravitated to kiswahili swahili perhaps because it was the only african language they had heard about almost to the point of cliche gee dont all africans speak swahili and of course swahili was the source of that great word uhuru symbolizing the elusive concept of freedom somewhere along the line it turned out that swahili s bright image got tarnished for one thing soon afterwards a horde of denigrating whites started ridiculing the very idea of black folk wasting their time learning an uncivilized jungle language and how these whites questioned could swahili be a symbol of the new black man when it had once been employed by rapacious slave traders it didnt seem to bother these critics that a lot of white people have wasted their time in studying swahili as evidenced by the curious fact that  percent of all swahili grammar books are whiteauthored in america nor did they seem unnerved by the fact that the usedbyslave traders charge could be equally cast against english spanish french german portuguese and a lot of other languages deemed more appropriate for black folk to be concerned with for example some of these instant swahili experts suggested that swahili was spoiled because of the influence of arabic upon its vocabulary great slavers those arabs and proceeded to urge upon blacks the study of the west african language hausa they were ignorant to the truth that most flausas are muslims by religion and that their language has also been influenced by arabic so much so that the very hausa word for god  is allah a veritable linguistic war broke out in the district of columbia recently when some high schoolers had the audacity to demand use of the taxpayers money to introduce swahili as a regular foreign language in the high school curriculum exacerbating matters was the knowledge that d cs school system had for years turned out scores of functional illiterates who could not speak good english a demand for swahili was looked upon by many as a sure disaster and as a dangerous obstruction to preparing alreadydeprived children to enter the mainstream of respectable responsible american life at worst such a demand was considered an act of sabotage against the educational system and at best an irrelevant diversion over the years my interest in language and communication has led me to learn several languages in high school my eagerness made me borrow with permission a spanish grammar a full year before  was scheduled to take the schools spanish course and in college bowie state of spiro agnew fame due to my entering in the second semester i was a whole semester behind everyone else in the french class but in my zeal i wound up by achieving one of the few as given in class at another time in high school i once greatly irritated my civics teacher by writing the first paragraph of an essay on communism sovyershit vid kommunist na narodye in russian while during a few lean months some years past when i was out of work i kept out of trouble by studying the bible in hebrew bereshith barn elohim et hashamayyim wa et haaretz    i began to learn swahili when concern for my african heritage bloomed in the blood of martvr dr martin_luther_king jr the trauma produced by his brutal murder  turned me inward toward blackness away from honky america and her honky institutions values and language not being content merely with textbook study i contacted the tanzanian embassy in d cwriting in swahili naturally since it is tanzanias national languageand arranged to receive a swahili newspaper i also scouted around for some black swahilispeaking penpals i now have ten then after about six months of study i decided to move closer to africas west coast and added hausa and yoruba to my continuing study of swahili acquiring in the process two yoruba penpals and getting wrapped up in the politics of the nigerian civil war but thats another story finally i ran across the white swahili scholar and author basic structure of swahili jim brain who is currently an associate professor of anthropology at the state university college in new york and we began exchanging correspondence in swahili the purpose of all this background is to separate what i am about to conclude from the senseless inaccurate assertions of the myriad of swahili detractors who abound today who try to substitute bias for knowledge in the first place the objections to a few black people learning swahili are utterly ridiculous swahili is no more nor any less than any other foreign language it is neither magic nor poison knowing how to speak it is no panacea for the black americans ills but neither will its study retard him in arty way if it is not entirely the very quintessence of uhuru neither is it the very embodiment of colonialism kiswahili is a bantu african language native to africas east coast about  or  ad arab settlers and merchandise traders in that area intermarried with bantu natives and thus introduced some arabic terms into the lanuage and still later the islamic religion among the africans there subsequent commerce slavery and colonialism caused the inclusion into swahili of some indian and english terms but the grammatical structure of swahili has remained bantu african throughout all this activity none of these borrowed foreign words changes the fact that swahili is an african language any more than the large quantity of borrowed latin and french words changes english from a germanic to a romance language knowing how to speak swahili wont conjure up miracles for the hardpressed black american the mental disciplining derived from its study might enliven the mind and promote good study habits in other areas but merely intoning uhuru unlike the mythical shazzam wont turn anyone into a captain marvel nor will it put money in the pocket or food on the table in honky america it is a serious fact of life that learning honky english kimombo is a swahili term for english mumbojumbo to africans is of much more immediate benefit than learning how to speak swahilior french or spanish for that matter none of this is meant to suggest that studying swahili is conversely a waste of time if a black child is interested and advanced enough to undertake the study of a foreign language swahili is definitely as useful as any european language with the advantage of being distinctively african even though swahili words are easier to pronounce than those of tone languages like yoruba swahili grammar presents a mental challenge it is very involved and very precise similar to latin in these respects a student who has real trouble learning english had better forget about swahili learning correct swahili actually requires a great amount of skill and concentration but at the same time such study can be made very interesting and relevant if tied in with a study of african life and heritage after all africa not just west africa is the home of the black man and swahili and swahilispeakers are not foreign to our heritage a common blackness and a common experience with slavery and colonialism and neocolonialism makes us all kinsmen in fact ? and experience using swahili or some other african language can open up a wealth of doors to interesting and fruitful friendships sure most educated africans can speak english or french but many of them would prefer to use their own languages several tanzanians have impressed this fact upon me and it was a point effectively made by members of kenyas olympic track team the danger inherent in the putdown of swahili by most people is that it implies also that the validity relevance and usefulness of all other african languages is doubtful for the purists who pursue a banal sectionalism by asserting that afroamericans have little in common with east africans because our ancestors were primarily west africans  suggest that they agitate for more recognition and instruction of ede yoruba bakin hausa ibo ashanti or mandingo in the educational systems of this land however for those who want knowledge of a black african language that is beautiful logical wellconstructed challenging and abounding in written material swahili has few equals in short swahili has the usual assets and liabilities of any other foreign language except that the black highschooler of the aware generation might be more interested in whats going on in the congo angola kenya or tanzania than in the action in some obscure village in peru or france while language of itself cannot teach culture it certainly need not be divorced from culture and can be excellently employed as a springboard for the study of culture and heritage kwa haya kiswahili huweza kuwa samani ya manufaa katika makolokolo ya kujifahamu ya mweusi pia baada ya kufikiri dhana za kiswahili mintarafu uhuru kujitegemea ljjamaa na upinduzi kwa muda kidogo ajuaye ni nani     
my any black youth are becoming involved in  the process which they   term revolution  revolution black revolution we hear these cries echoing from the campuses to the ghettos across the face of america today but many of these youth i find alarmingly in much of their basic outlook perhaps unconsciously imitate the western newleft whites much of the same sterile marxist jargon of these whites with the usual references to lenin trotsky castro etc comes to mind even some of our most fiery young spokesmen are constantly quoting albert camus as a reference i propose that these youth are deeply misguided and in their references are still operating within the trance of the whiteeyes the west they are still under western controlthe radical wing of the western establishments captive negroes many of these youth when questioned closely after breaking through the mystique of the gunfetish guns baby guns the gun as extended penis an adolescent manhood symbol really seek an integrated marxistsocialist america revolutionary integration so to speak which has always been within western radical tradition as an ultimate solution for american social development in this essay i speak of a concept of black revolution totally different from the sterile western forms and concepts i speak of a spiritual internal revolution which will create new people new men a revolution which will follow in el hajj malik el shabazzs malcolm_xs footsteps to relink afroamerica with the afroasian east a revolution which will restore the mind and soul of the black man to his ancestral rhythms and ancient spirituality while many of these undisciplined youth shout of guns which will eventually become necessary for survival i agree and getting whitey how many of them would be able to begin the most basic internal revolution to uplift their moral and spiritual natures and uproot the decadence and spiritual and moral diseases that haunt the psyches of all who fall victim to the western way of life ill wager that many cannot even admit that we are and have been a mentally and morally sick people it is my belief that the end result of this revolution will be new forms  political cultural spiritualwhich will crystalize into a new black civilization here in the west which will ultimately change the moral spiritual and political outlook of the entire planet earth what our youth must realize is that one cannot defeat the west by using western formsbeat the devil at his own game so to speak and marxist materialism is the most dangerous form the west has used to ensnare the minds of black people we have the writings of harold cruse to attest to this fact i would add that were not against socialism or communalism as leroi jones says this is the natural way for men to live what we are against however is the western atheistic denial of godallah moulder and shaper of the universe which is totally against our spiritual nature as black people and actually reflects the white western intellectuals estrangement from his religion western christianitywhich is whiteys internal problem not ours in a great sense this fundamental nonwestern revolution has already begun and has been in progress for the last few years one has only to observe the dress images and changing lifestyles of a growing number of black youth outside of the marxist movement to discern this phenomenon it is as though an african nation were rising here in the west to quote a black spiritual leader el hajj ameer hassan my brothers and sisters are returning to themselves donning their ancestral robes once  again returning to their true religion philosophies and lifestyles    this process this easternization or reafricanization is coming to them from the vibrations of allah in the atmosphere the air they breathe the water they drink nothing is more startling than to see the robes of africa in the subways and the gray ghettos of this land which robbed us of our heritage and seemingly turned us into frankensteinnegroes a people without past or future it is this process which again is the true revolution that our people are making and this is the path which should be explored selfconsciously by our leading young minds in this credo essay i attempt to move in this direction the black magi i have at last found the kind of personal identity that i desire as a black man i know that when first  turned from the westernized revolutionary intellectual path into an eastern direction i became worried about my new role my personal identity if i wasnt a revolutionary intellectual if this was a white thinga leftist white thingthen what was i how to define to the inner self this eastern orientation i had always in my revolutionary intellectual days shunned the poet in me in those days i saw the poet through western radical eyes as a feeble little versifier only content to put rhymes on paper talking hard but really out of it in terms of  guns revolutionary politics community organization etc but now thanks to my continued striving jihad and growth i have returned to myself i no longer shun the poet in me for i now see a greater deeper definition of poet and artist in the eastern sense returning to the book muntu and correspondingly the writings of poetphilosopher aime cesaire and the philosophers of both african  eastern culture i began to discover the poet as priest as sorcerer a black magician from magi hence imagnation whose sole duty is to raise the collective consciousness of his black people the black nation and prepare them for revolution and the seizure of their collective destinies by creating an inner revolution of the soul transmuting them from negroes into an eastern people once again this role of poet as priest seer holyman and finally prophet has given me a muchneeded dignity and added a new dimension to my life i now choose as my models the great priests of ancient egypt  ethiopia the black magi of ancient persia  elam and the learned shiekhs of timbuctu my sole duty in life now is the elevation of my race and the shaping of black people here into a great new nation rising upon the ruins of a crumbling decadent america doomed to go down hard screaming and blubbering in the flames of her filthy murders and spiritual doom i now see myself and my brothers as the embodiment of the soul of my nation the living vessel of its myths rituals aspirations and future world view we the new black artists and thinkers are evolving into its conscience voice and living archetypes in the age of the third world the coming world order we the new black artists and thinkers are the harbingers of a new spiritual dawn when the wretched billions of humanity will arise from the degradation of this evil barbaristic white age and reclaim their lost heritage by returning to their original selves and uniting with the evolving cosmos of god to restore civilization to our planet we the new holymen and shiekhs of the black nation must serve as the living mind and holy soul of the coming black nation the guardians the warriorprophets the lovers of man everywhere we are we must put down roots and sacrifice our time in service to black people the nation by teaching them new ways and helping them to elevate their minds magi spreading the healing light of black consciousness and national being there must not be any great contradictions in our own lives for we must serve as living examples to our peopleas brother malcolm peace be upon him didin order for them to advance with confidence and unity they must come to feel that the new brothers and sisters are above reproach in their actions would never under any circumstances let them down or sell them out this will be a difficult task at first for we are all filled with white western contradictions in our minds but we must strive greatly jihad to remove this cancer from our spirits and establish eastern models and forms to live by for the eastern world africa included is the originator of human civilization and of all things godlike and spiritual upon our planet identity and nationhood our thrust then would be to rtstore the spiritual links with our racial ancestors we are west africans in captivity we must rekindle the energies and tap the root sources that gave rise to ghana mali songhai and the moorish empire we must link these redis covered roots to our africanamerican soul culture in order to become a whole people once again we must strive to restore what chattel slavery destroyed a the black national identity b religion and cosmology c communal family structure we must transform our imitation white lifestyle into a positive black cultural form we must  restore the ancient rhythms that raised the race once we change from imitation or carboncopy white forms into truly black eastern forms we will purify our psyches so that the wisdom of our illustrious ancestors will return to usintuitively one cannot expect spiritual light to shine through a corrupted vessel such spiritual ways as islam african cultural teachings and yoga its philosophy spiritual training and physical therapy will prove helpful in restoring our harmony with the cosmosalong with the eastern martial arts evolution will be our slogan evolution evolution change the forms change the images of selfour selves change  into the new that is old the ancient that is here again african and eastern dress wearing the long dress or west african wraps for our sisters black woman give beastina back her whorish miniskirts bellbottoms dykesuits evolve eastwards into your african princess self the dashikis and burnooses for our brothers give the ivyleague back its togs black man the buttondown world is crumbling along with the furnishing and decoration of our homes in an african and eastern manner all of these revolutionary changes in our lifestyles forms will help free our black souls from the stranglehold of the dying west dietary changes you are the food you eat oink oink oink many brothers and sisters have not only given up reactionary food the filthy hog but have gone further eastwards by becoming vegetarians and adding to their mental and physical health by using herb teas to cleanse their systems and other health foods speech how we speak what we say languagelanguage helps shape thought identity being we must releam rediscover the history and languages of our ancestors arabic yoruba swahili hausa etcin order to become a whole people once again we must become nationbuilders think nation be nation in our minds in our hearts be be be become the new emerging from the ashes of the old identity will spirit strivinginmotion jihad  there is only one identity and one direction that history will allow us black nationhood as many of our leaders and thinkers from marcus garvey and w e b du bois to harold cruse and elijah muhammad have pointed out we are already a separate peoplehave been since we were brought here in chains what we must strive to do is to organize this separateness and make it work for us by forging our  to  million souls never believe your enemys statistics into the highest modern form of human organization the nationstate for only a sovereign national state will solve our centuriesold identitycrisis and land question our slave ancestors worked the fertile lands of the deep south for centuries and it was promised us in the form of forty acres and a mule by the union government which later withdrew its promise along with its armies and left our defenseless ancestors at the mercy of the southern terror forty acres and a mule to millions of black peasants wouldve created a black nationwithinanation in the deep south only then will we have the living room or space to fully evolve and develop our national potential as dictated by the dynamism inherent in our black spirit and will to power timid souls will ask what about the white man i would answer by saying that we have this task to perform because it represents the final workingout of our collective destiny whether the white man is living or dead living and creating evil and suffering or burned to destruction by the fires of divinity i say that if the white man gets in our way or tries to interfere then he is tampering with our godgiven rights to selfdetermination as human beings and we must deal with him as any other sovereign people or nation would deal with their foreign enemies in a highly organized disciplined fashion by any means we deem necessary scientifically intellectually rationally remember the oppressors are only a highly organized hierarchy of corrupt men they are not god and only god controls our planet and the universe including the white man there fore fear a llah not the white man the complete man in returning to the subject of the roles of the new black artists and thinkers we must strive to become complete men in the eastern sense of the term a complete man is a person who is fully developed physically mentally and spiritually the eastern man could write a beautiful poem or carve an ancestral figure or mask then don his armour and lead a thundering horde into battle in defense of his nation and culture he could hold discourses with learned sages and organize and handle the administrative and diplomatic affairs of his nation or empire while taking time to lecture to students or to design beautiful parks and flowergardens for the people i speak of such men as askia the great the soldierstatesmanemperor of the songhai empire muhammad ahmed the mahdi scholar spiritualleader and revolutionary warrior of the sudan yakub al mansur soldierstatesman cultural leader and emperor of the moorish empire of northern africa and spain and in modern times the two poets philosophers and revolutionary statesmen of the east ho chi minh and mao tse tung who while admittedly using marxism have absorbed all of the ancient philosophies of their cultures and shaped and moulded that marxism to fit the psyches and psychologies of their ancient peoples  these are examples of the complete or eastern man that we must become if we wish to be truly free by developing fully in this sense we would rule out the socalled western intellectual who would live a contradiction between his life and his work a person who would write beautiful revolutionary essays plays etc but who might actually be a weakling or coward when it comes to basic manhood protecting his family picking up the gun to defend his community or nation or setting a living example of courageous virtue for his people in my humble opinion this is the path we must take if we desire a full and complete existence for our race here in the west and if we expect to survive the fall of the west only history will know if well find success     here within the grey walls of harlem among the myriad masses of my people i work out my destiny evolving in the soul upwards towards my higher self moving to reestablish the broken links with my racial ancestors while maintaining a revolutionary black awareness of the modern world moving eastwards  towards mother africa and holy meccain these young years of black awareness heeding the call of the world spirit l come  come striding forward striving in a great jihad of collective being we all come evolving towards a new spiritual a ge a iways the nation always the black

most of those who object to the teaching of black literature j  if £ d° s° °n aesthetic grounds they suggest that the black  lvj k writer does not present a realistic view of his society that his version of america and the world is shameful fantasy that his art is slanted by racism and wellmeaning sentimentalism  arguing that a valuable aesthetic experience must be primary to the teaching of literature they go on to suggest that all black literature is aesthetically inferior they imply in their artforartssake thesis that all aesthetically valuable literature with only a few exceptions is white no one should disagree with the notion that literature should afford one a valuable aesthetic experience an elementary test of the aesthetically valuable however is concerned with the relative beauty of art the art that is literature is concerned with the relative beauty of the lives of people how they stand on top of a western mountain and die how they live their short happy lives in search of success of course there is universality in all human experience but when teachers present experiences to a class of black and white children they should present experiences which compliment the humanity and dignity of a black and white class surely no sane teacher will defend presenting literary experiences to any student which implies denial of that students humanity his human beauty literature should facilitate a persons search through the mirrored past of human experience for reflections of his own life worth his own humanity if every image in the aesthetically valuable is white and if in contrast the only black image presented is one concerning a black child chased by a childeating tiger is this not a cruel denial of the childs human beauty and worth is it not building a social dynamite which must some day explode in black summer rage history gives men a panoramic view of life experience in the universe literature isolates experiences and men gives them spirit aesthetic structure the literature that is history is created so that men  may have a record of their past if that record is honest it should aid in shaping the future deciding about even the next moments the literature that is literature that is aesthetically valuable is governed by integrity it is according to professor andrew pawley an essential institution created to serve common human needs and aspirations  an honest literary experience should serve the needs and aspirations of all of the peopled hills of a nation a city or a school it is common knowledge that every american city has its various ethnic and racial groups cleveland has its hough its mount pleasant and its glenville each populated mainly by black americans murray hill is predominantly italianamerican numerous slavic families in habit the lower southeast side beechwood is a predominantly jewish community parma is second and third generation polishamerican in every urban area such ethnic and racial communities exist my purpose is not to justify these racial and ethnic lines in urban living patterns it is rather to prove that our society is pluralistic a reflection of the many parts of our societal whole and that as a result the teaching of literature ought to be pluralistic a reflection of the peopled hills in our cities in our classrooms the demand for the teaching of black literature is a demand for a more human definition of the aesthetically valuable it is more specifically a demand for a literature that serves the specific human needs and aspirations of black life black humanity the literature that is presently called american literature is complimentary to white images it is in short what may be called white literature i do not mean to suggest that what is presently called american literature is not good literature much of it however lacks the basic ingredient of literary integrity and is indeed slanted by racism and wellmeaning sentimentalism since black life experiences are normally different in america from white life experiences constantly in aesthetic and actual conflict there is no reason why a clearthinking teacher should expect one valuable aesthetic experience from honest literature what is reasonable is that there should be at least two aesthetically valuable experiences and there should be beauties in between the solution it seems to me lies in the acceptance of all of our american selveswhite yellow red black gwendolyn brooks is a pulitzer prize winning poet her in the mecca was nominated for a  national book award her beverly hills chicago is a splendid example of poetic excellence but in spite of awards and nominations gwendolyn brooks poet laureate of illinois is edited out of books of american verse the prose of richard wright is as clear and clean as that of ernest hemingway the dominant most admirable image in the fiction of hemingway is white the nigger that cooks is in the kitchen in hemingways fiction and he seems to want to stay there the nigger may be in the kitchen in the fiction of richard wright but he does not want to stay there he does not wish to remain a nigger either implied in the fiction of richard wright are the hopes and aspirations of black life in america implicit in the fiction of this black writer is what the civil_rights movement isor wasall about black students as i understand them are saying that if they must read hemingways the short happy life of francis macomber then white students ought to read richard wrights big boy leaves home that if they must read emily dickinsons as imperceptibly as grief then white students ought to read gwendolyn brookss beverly hills chicago to thine own self be true was the last admonition polonious gave his son laertes when laertes left home for school in france the proper study of mankind is man alexander pope wrote in his essay on man an elementary lesson in modern social problems reveals that thousands of people are institutionalized each year because they do not know themselves thousands of lives are lost each year as they are washed down ghetto drains in search of other selves through drugs alcohol lsd when laertes left home for school he had been taught well the ways of other men but more important than that he had been taught to know himself if we teach on the green grounds of universality a black child the life experience of a white child we are saying to that black child that there is no american difference between him and the white child we may desire that dream to be true but it is not true today a white child may go to mississippi from his home in cleveland and find that only the weather is different and perhaps the people walk and talk a little slower than they do in cleveland but a black child having been taught that there is no american difference between him and the white child may go to mississippi and die in the bloated belly of the mississippi pearl where emmett till far from chicago floated to a deathly adolescent truth black child truth is not the same as white child truth in mississippi there is a deadly difference between the two kinds of childish truths surely most educators would like to equalize the two truths recognizing and teaching them may be one way of equalizing them meanwhile however the child must know the truth of the world he lives in that truth may not set him free in mississippi but it may well save his life those who contend that the black writer cannotor does not present a realistic view of society are obviously not black they do not know the reality of black american experience often they do not even sympathize with the needs and aspirations of black humanity and a writer ought to sympathize he really ought to empathize he ought at least to sympathize with the denial of black feminine narcissism illuminated in black rage what robert herrick does for white womanhood in his to electra is denied black womanhood barred from the classrooms by traditional professors who apparently know nothing about human needs and aspirations and their relations to literature of course there are black writers who have not presented a realistic view of their society most of these writers however had their brains washed in the stagnant waters of slavery or selfhate sometimes success in the white world drove them to copy the stereotypes of their humanity phillis wheatley an outstanding example of a black woman who was denied feminine worth most probably hated herself  looking at phillis wheatleys poem through contemporary blackpower and emergingafrica eyes one must conclude that miss wheatley was ashamed of her native land ultimately of herself but phillis wheatley was a slave and so it is easy to forgive her for her mask jupiter hammon a contemporary of miss wheatley was a slave who was encouraged by his kind master to write and it is easy to forgive that dutiful slave paul laurence dunbar in his poem we wear the mask suggests that there have been many black lies told to white america jupiter hammon and phillis wheatley wore the mask so have dozens of white american authors worn white puritan masks but there are black writers who have grown up who have taken off the mask there are black writers who have never worn a literary mask they paid a painful price for their integrity it is they who can take the slogan blackisbeautiful and develop it lovingly in all of its american shades it is they who can most vividly portray the racial glory and dark beauty of black life most white writers in america have not described honestly the human beauty of the black american perhaps these writers are too near in their imagery herricks to electra perhaps unconsciously they distort the humanity of black life perhaps they do so because it isit certainly wasin vogue it was the literary thing to do at any rate if they cannot treat that humanity vividly and lovinglynot as vividly and as lovingly as the black writer can for you see if he loves himself his treatment of other black lives will be reflected through his loving eyes most white writers do not bring sympathetic or empathetic hearts with them when they endeavor to portray black life they bring creative hearts creative hearts may create new lives distort old ones they cannot however measure the extent of rejection the black man takes to his youcanmakeitifyoutry brainwashed home if they have not felt the electric cattleprod stabbing afroamerican dignity they cannot measure not truly the aesthetic value of blacklife dignity because they have not felt the electrocution of it if they have not been black like me for one day they cannot begin to know the realism of my uncle johnnys  separate but equal louisiana sawmill years while black students may seem to be saying that the proper study of black man is black life i understand them to mean that they want to be told the american truth of themselves i understand them to mean that the proper study of any man is honest life they know that jim of huckleberry finn is a compromise of man in them they know that little black sambo is a classic black lie they know that virtually every story about black life in american literature is a story that presents a questionable humanity black life is portrayed as primitive savage life or saintly romantic life neither is honest earthly american life this is not meant as an argument against the teaching of literature by white writers to black children our national goal at least at this writing is still an open society still one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all to teach any one kind of literature however in an integrated classroom is a tragic denial of value for another kind of life beauty life experience perhaps an honest solution lies in teaching world literaturenot just the white world but all the world a meltingpot world the american worldthe unmelted ethnic world
the image of the black american in american literature has been to say the least dishonest black humanity as represented by most white writers has been capsulized categorized and disintegratized the happy slave is a literary hoax the tragic mulatto was tragic because he was a social slave trapped in the iron grip of class the wretched freedman was not free and the local color negro is a romantic creation like the exotic primitive if there was ever such a man as the local color negro he is dead now if he is not dead then he has moved to the city if there was ever such a wretch as a wretched freedman he lives solely in the territory of american fiction the tragic mulatto has integrated now and the exotic primitive has lost his exoticism as well as his primeval loveliness in urban ghetto reproduction we teach by what we teach as well as by what we do not teach for too long aesthetic reality in american literature has said that the humanity of black americans is ridiculous with stepin fetchit amusing with amos and andy entertaining with white blackfaced minstrelsy and human only in exceptional cases like uncle toms cabin up from slavery the jackie robinson story and yes l can what we have said as a nation about and to black humanity is this basically your humanity is questionable however if you are fantastic like uncle tom booker t washington jackie robinson and sammie davis jr we will concede your exceptional ability now those are not kind words to utter to a human being they are not kind words to speak to any child regardless of the color of his humanity they are unkind and they erect a stone wall between the human needs and aspirations of people something there is that doesnt love a wall robert frost wrote in mending wall frost went on to say that that something nature black students want to send a frozengroundswell under the aesthetic wall which bars them from their own human needs and aspirations they want to unmend that wall to spill the upper boulders before a black sun and make gaps that even two can pass abreast that even they and white students can pass abreast much of the fault for the communication gap between people in america today is due in part to three centuries of classic lies and not to teach in the context of american literature that literature which treats honestly the humanity of black americans is to continue to be to black and white americans academically dishonest humanistically cruel and psychologically destructive not to teach black literature at all is to continue to build with scholarly arrogancy a summer bomb that must explode over the traditional september walls of academic paranoia onto the green canvas of american liberty thomas jefferson might have written that while all men are created equal literature keeps them equal literature can build a fortress of human dignity in a childs heart thomas jefferson did not write that however he wrote all men are created equal it is up to education to write the rest it is up to education to build the fortress of human dignity in black and white american hearts we communicate by what we say as well as by what we do not say and we have not yet said as teachers administrators and educators that black life is beautiful life we have not even said that black life is human life we have stood on the white brink of artforartssake and denied the humanity of most of the world is it not now time that we move our concern across the wall toward a sane oasis of universal life if we do move toward the sane center land we may witness the dark reality of alexander popes wisdom when he declared in essay on man 
david littlejohn is the author of a white paper black on white which should be appropriately entitled the effects of the vast body of black literature on the little blind bigoted white mind this proves to be a clinical analysis of the effect of the american dilemma on the mind of what should be a disciplined scholarly white intellectual and educationist rather than a critical survey of black writing as it is supposed to be this then is essentially a black paper by a black writer on the white paper by a white writer who describes black literature in terms of its effects on the white readers already burdened and confused mind perhaps if three years before the publication of the before mentioned book in  era bell thompson and herbert nipson editors of ebony magazine had not published white on blackthe views oj twentytwo white americans on the negro or had even asked mr littlejohn to give the definitive twentythird view we would have been spared this occasion for certainly the impulse begins here browsing through success book store in san francisco i found a copy from this source spring platitudinous statements which have since become cliches as an integral part of black humor eleanor roosevelt begins with the essay some of my best friends are negro honest injun and what follows are period pieces in americas attempt to bridge the racial gulf and to integrate the negro into the fabric of the democratic society although mrs roosevelt admitted that one of the odd things about my negro friends is their consistent failure to invite me to their social gatherings she claims never to have lost a negro friend she also admits that she could have done so had she known paul robeson she assesses him and his talents thusly  he should be using his talents to help rather than to destroy his country despite his intelligence  feel that he has not demonstrated any analytical qualities surely he has not examined the soviet system because it does not permit for real democratic freedom the kindest thing that i can say about him perhaps that he believes that communism will give all people equality this everyone should have but mr robeson and all of us have a greater chance of getting it here in the united states than anywhere else in the world she goes on to describe a crude drawing she encountered in georgia during a political campaign showing her dancing with a negro and entitled niggerlover eleanor and as a result how she had franklin d call in the secret service and the fbi to investigate the rumored eleanor clubs where negro members of those clubs were supposed to push white people on thursdays or something really strange the second essay the plight of southern white women by a husbandandwife team wilma dykeman and james stokely who are authors of a book on the race problems neither black nor white is one which lauds the moral courage of the  women born and bred southemers who met on november   to form the association of southern women for the prevention of lynching this came after a preliminary study of the violent practices of their men this study included the revealing statistics that of  lynchings occurring from  to  only  per cent of the victims had even been accused of crimes against white women this fact convinced them that economic exploitation had hidden too long and too comfortably behind their skirts following these two essays is a string of confessionals by an array of white people sophie tucker the last of the red hot mamas told how she launched her entertainment career in  by thinking black billy graham evangelist warned no color line in heaven lillian smith in strange fruit in harlem admitted that bounded on the south by visible signs on the north by invisible signs filled with its heaven and its hells there is no way for a white person to walk away from harlem frank sinatra in the way i look at race informs us that people who hate dont live wholesome lives and that i believe that bigotry is a national disease but that it can be cured we are curing it slowly and are on the road to the solution of our no  domestic problem segregation bishop g bromley oxnam in the sin of silence begins with once again the ku klux klan burns crosses and masquerades in white it proclaims its message of vicious racialism antisemitism and religious bigotry many church members who proudly declare they are saved belong to this unamerican and unchristian body ralph mcgill in the south looks ahead states matteroffactly that the south has sacrificed its children colored and white to inferior education and has across a hundred years discriminated in one degree or another against all its people a free south will be in fact a new south the human being or condition always has had at least three yearnings  to be treated as a human being to have an equal fair chance to win respect and advancement as an individual in the economic environment and freely to seek spiritual and cultural happiness and finally william faulkner the mississippi writer who won the nobel prize for literature in  gives advice in a sevenpage essay if i were a negro in answer to the question surrounded by antagonistic white people would you find it hard not to hate them his answer was i would repeat to myself booker t washingtons words when he said i will let no man no matter what his color ever make me hate him so if i were a negro i would say to my people let us be always unflaggingly and inflexibly flexible but always decently quietly courteous with dignity and without violence and above all with patience the white man has devoted three hundred years to teaching us to be patient that is one thing at least in which we are his superiors let us turn it into a weapon against him let us use this patience not as a passive quality but as an active weapon if you will pardon the seeming digression i cite these numerous references from the book white on black in order to pose the question can a white american from a society diseased in institutionalized racism ever talk about the black man without it being a projection of his own racist fantasies which colors his logic and i would answer that with seldom certainly the few white revisionist historians have found a way in the somewhat newer field of english literature scholars like professor richard m dorson author of american negro folktales and abraham chapman who in september  edited the  page anthology of afroamerican literature black voices show that it can be done chapman ends his page introduction thusly i close this anthology reluctantly with the feeling that so much is happening and being born that it would be good to keep the book open and bring it still more of the new but the end of this anthology is not conclusion i hope but further beginnings greater appreciation of what black writers have contributed and are contributing to the diversity of american literature and movement towards greater inclusion of works by negro writers in our american literature courses in the high schools and colleges and from the january  issue of negro digest he includes a quote from the fine black writer margaret walker author of the novel jubilee the black aesthetic has a rich if undiscovered past this goes back in time to the beginning of civilization in egypt babylonia india china persia and all the islamic world that preceded the renaissance of the europeans we have lived too long excluded by the anglosaxon aesthetic    where else should the journey lead the black writer is the black experience how can the human experience transcend humanity its the same thing yes thank god it can be done unfortunately however mr littlejohn failed in his critical analysis of black writing to be equal to this mammoth task to use his image he was not the gulliver he imagined himself to be nor are the yearold voices which resound from the wealth of afroamerican literaure those of the lilliputians which could be easily dismissed as the product of small minds that happento be negro or a literary output which if a bright white mind immerses itself for long is pained dispirited by dwelling in the dull dark prison yard that is so often the negro writers world and the responding spirit is dulled and bored by the sordid limitation of the soul in the tight closet of the black imagination this man is so square that he doesnt even know that black people have more soul than anyone ask james brown aretha franklin or even time magazine or esquire where has this man been where is he coming from mr littlejohn does not have to study the background the history the social milieu which produces black writers he already has his mind made up in the first pages of his introduction of the quality the nature and the occasion of this vexing material    the occasion and the substance of most negro writing in america is still the undeclared race war in which all americans are by definition involved this writing often becomes a weapon in the race war and from the view of white readers an enemy weapon some of it is meant to give pain to disconcert and unbalance    the pain in most negro literature of the american race war however remains solid and undigestible it juts up it rankles it rubs raw like an ulcer as it is meant to sometimes the design is quite conscious writing is one way of getting back at the enemy the negros satisfaction will be doubled of course if his foolish white reader can be made to pay for and to praise the materials of his own discomfort p  and even when the scholar in him nags at him to consider the history of a racially oppressed minority he dismisses this impulse the wounded white reader may even try to reduce out the color content and claim that there are simply the histories of any oppressed minority regardless of race and then confront that accusations as he will    such attempts to deflect the pain of negro writing are like the evasion interpretations the explainingaway of book iv of gullivers travels horses really arent houyhnms you know people really arent yahoos gulliver has obviously gone mad swift was psychologically misanthropic and so on   well who wants to top that what was that the great white father william faulkner advised his good colored people in his sevenpage essay if i were a negro first i must repeat the magic words from booker t washington  will let no man no matter what his color ever make me hate him and then according to faulkner i must use patience as an active war weapon frankly i never expected to find in faulkner a true adversary but perhaps just perhaps  can communicate what i must say from this vantage point having exhumed the ghost of the great white father of american literature even his voice comes back to haunt mr littlejohn with the truth that not only is what he has to say about the black writers so much nonsense but even what he says about white writers proves him to be a sloppy scholar and critic i quote mr littlejohn william faulkner who of all people might have had an idea could not imagine himself a negro for two minutes p  in this book on the black writing checking the reference pages in the index i found that jonathan swift has three references while sterling brown dean of black literature and black scholarship has only two sterling brown respected poet and longtime professor of english literature at howard university did the definitive scholarship on negro writing in the s leading to the valuable book the negro caravan continuing this disproportionate cataloguing we find the naacp with one page reference claude mckay with eight jean genet with five arna bontemps with five dr strangelove with one marcys garvey with one charles dickens with three and william faulkner with  mr littlejohn continues
frankly  must admit that the other side of the coin may also be true certainly as a black literary critic on the subject of a whites attempt at criticizing black writing i at least blush it becomes rather obvious then that this book should be viewed as a companion piece to the confessions of william styron via nat turner therefore i will view it with patience ijowever even now since faulkners advice i must run the risk of bringing new pains to this brave warriorcritic of the race war literature of black people as mr littlejohn cautions p  the literature of the race war polarizes american it forces them to take sides they would rarely take in life it pains me to be so argumentative but mr littlejohn even here is in error because he does not know himself in real life his stances are the same contradictory to his philosophy that of a gulliversized fairhaired bigoted pedant you see using this scholarly work as a shield mr littlejohn is waging a war in reallife drama this one is pitting him and i as generals on either side of the camp the war is over a simple idea is the history and culture and society reflected in black writing worthy of serious study to even those blacks who must know themselves to open the floodgate of all other knowledge the university of california berkeley was the wartorn battleground where this open and declared war was to be staged we were both members of the faculty of this worldrenowned institution of higher learning for the  year i was teaching a subjecta course in remedial composition where the bulk of third world people particularly entering black students are placed as a result of discriminatory criminally inaccurate whiteoriented achievement and placement tests as a black teacher i was teaching this course primarily for blacksalthough  of my original students were nonblacks it was taught from a black perspective it recognizes the black mothertongue as a possible effective poetic language which is a very natural outgrowth of the black experience and i used black literature as models of form for expository writing subjecta is not an integrated part of the english department as is the case on some campuses it stand alone it is for the student who is deemed deficient in language enough to justify barring him from participation in more meaningful courses from a white standpoint within the hallowed ivy walls of the academic department of english on the berkeley campus i had  students who elected to take my course from a black perspective one black graduate student was auditing this remedial class of my nonblacks one was an orientalamerican one a mexicanamerican at least one was jewishamerican and there were six other white nonestablishmenttypes and then of course there were my  black students trying to determine to what extent they shared in the american tradition mr littlejohn whom i have not had the pleasure of meeting facetoface because of my outhouse status on campus is a respected member of the english department he is most vociferous in denouncing the merits of afroamerican literature and he is accepted by his colleagues as an expert critic in this field which is my expertise by birthright by godgiven and academically developed talent and scholarship so far he has been successful in convincing his department the university the educational community of the san francisco bay area of the meanness of this unliterary body of work by illiterates who have small minds and who dwell in a small dark world somewhere on the periphery of his great white vision he has convinced all that  am an outlaw practicing an outlaw trade and that to lower the floodgates to let in either the monster known as a black writer or the writing which is the product of such a monstrously dwarfed world would be a disaster and so the afroamerican studies department waits the afroamerican students wait the body of afroamerican literature waits and least of all ian upcoming black poetmust wait while a hand is on the gate which has locked us out when did this real war for me begin with this intensity it was almost a year ago at that time while developing creating courses in this field for the english department and the newly envisioned afroamerican studies departmentthe first one in actuality in northern californiai became a target of intellectual abuse in the educational community this happened while i was serving my time as an outcast in the miserably segregated and unequal facility known as merritt junior college a feeder junior college of urban vintage as over against the suburban disneylands for which california is so well known in its attempt to give free education for every worthy white student regardless of mental ability and human worth it began in my overcrowded first class in one of the many portables crammed together for the most part in a onecityblock concentrationcamp type institution which proved often to be the logjam of aspiration for  urban youthas well as academic death for the  black students who had been systematically confined there regardless of mental aptitude and social position in my class were auditors from the university of california graduate english departmentmostly whiteand jim nabors a thirdworld activist who is also an afroamerican he explained that the u c students were desirous of starting such a course on the berkeley campus he was attending my class to determine the focus of such a course and the desirability of initiating a similar one on january  shortly after the beginning of the winter term for  the daily californian announced that jim nabors had proposed a potential course in an article entitled afroamerican literature class this was on monday mr nabors was beaming when he arrived at our early morning wednesday class the students were exuberant even i was pleased momentarily at the anticipated reception of the new course i had not only spent my entire life as a student of afroamerican literature and had my vows as a black writer to champion its cause but more immediately i had burned the midnight oil well into the night since the beginning of the  school year also i had spent a small fortune in acquiring books on this topic which were systematically excluded from the public schools libraries and higher educational institutions in the western tradition i spent my christmas holiday much to the dismay of my dentisthusband and my five offsprings delving into these books in my private collecton purchasing others that would be essential in the new field that was about to open surveying libraries book stores in the end being really disheartened by the mammoth void i noted the storehouse of ignorance that existed in this field in this educational center of western culture the high motivation of angry black students this was only a part of their great beauty many of them followers of black_panther leaders bobby seale huey newton eldridge cleaver gave me the impetus i needed to keep going on in the face of so much pain and persecution i beamed
by thursday the uc establishment with mr littlejohn as one of the academic warring generals declared through the press its open war on me here i feel compelled to inject that the chairman of the english department james d hart remarked in the january  article entitled conflict over proposed course that such a course was perfectly feasible however this lone white sane voice was lost in the shrill air of the louder voices which were raised as follows david littlejohn assistant professor of english and author of black on white a critical survey of writing by american negroes asserted to invent the course before a substantial literature came along would be pandering to the needs of race pride such a course would be educational therapy for blacks who need to invent a heritage by grasping at such things as jazz african sculpture or afroamerican literature littlejohn said mr littlejohn was not alone his colleague jackson burgess an associate professor of english who spent a year in africa as a smithmundt lecturer in american literature at the university of capetown according to the article stated that the bulk of negro literature is of great value in the fields of history sociology and political science mr burgess stated there isnt a great deal of negro american literature of much value written before the second world war    over the last  years negro writing has been more emphasized partly because it is becoming better known and partly because much of the better literature has only been written in the last  years by the next week an afroamerican student norman wilkerson senior in the english department wrote a letter to the ice box he asserted that black students were black and proud and that we have learned it most prudent not to address ourselves to every perverted inane ejaculation that dribbles from the universitys several malignant orifices however he felt that he must answer mr littlejohn and did so as follows mr littlejohn manages to be both thoroughly insulting and distressingly illogical by this imagery we are characterized as diseased black students seeking rehabilitation through the benevolence of educational therapy while at the same time we are striving to invent a heritage just as littlejohn explained the harlem renaissance into nonexistence so he has reduced us to nonentities if these arguments fail to convince one of littlejohns racism we recommend his low pathetic endeavor to appraise black literature we submit that littlejohn considering his manifest ignorance of black literature should argue for rather than against the creation of such a course    on friday january   a front page article stated that petition demonstrates interest in black literature course and the afroamerican student union president lenneal henderson called the study of afroamerican literature an absolute necessity i was asked to come to the campus for an interview with the daily californian staff writer debbie heintz and the result of this interview was boldly headlined in the wednesday january  paper black literature course offered at merritt college  in this article i was asked to describe the contents of my course and in a sweeping generality i mentioned that it starts with the ancient folktales of west africa goes to uncle remus and ends with a survey of todays black drama and poetry by thursday february  raymond kent assistant professor of african history had raised his voice in the letters to the ice box column his letter was entiled african black american link rejected although at the time two very pleased african students were students of mine and later took the course for two quarters stating over and over again that because of colonial conditions they had learned more about their african selves in my course than was ever possible in their own homelands mr kent suspected that african students in this country would not welcome links of this kind he further argued that curiously enough the course at merritt is not called black literature but rather afroamerican folklore poetry and drama this conveys that the instructor is teaching certain forms of literary expression which emanate from black americans whether literate or not it is limited to a single culture and language familiar both to the instructor and her students it hence is not predicated on pigment alone as in the case of black literature the term afro is intended to replace black again your readers should know that africa is far from being either uniformly or consistently black it is also meant to connect the black american with africa as a single cultural entity which corresponds to the black subculture in this country    etc etc etc ad nauseum to retain my sanity at this point i asked that my class turn inward on itself to get the most from our unique experience with a verboten subject area and instructed that if no one kept such a ridiculous circular illogical argument alive that it would in time die of natural cause and it did more or less die for the remainder of the year it was james baldwin who said people are trapped in history and history is trapped in them how true today i am still entrapped in the cold war being fought in the english department to keep from legitimatizing my expertise in the field of afroamerican literature i must implore you dear reader to have the patience with me that i must have with my adversaries i promise no more digressions i will be direct about a critical analysis of mr littlejohns black on white mr littlejohn feels that novels in the richard wright tradition depend on sadism and brutality which cause the reader to respond with the imaginative equivalent of nausea p  he theorizes why this is so behind the sadism and brutality secondly are the sadists and brutes the legions of bitches and boors of near subhuman moral monsters who throng the pages of negro writing detached from its specific nationalracial setting the literature of american negroes may be read as one giant case against man at his worst even the white reader philosophic enough not to identify himself in guilt with these disgusting white human specimens not to read them as personal indictments will see in the genuineness of their portraits 
a dispiriting swiftian reminder that man at his low point is incredibly vicious and foul it is not a pleasant reminder and negro literature hammers it in p  works of richard wright james o killens he must mean the respected novelist john o killens margaret walker introduced in the forties as a poet in the yale series of younger poets and robert hayden winner of the literature award at the  first world festival of negro art in dakar senegal were passed off as mere catalogues of white oppression littlejohn says they use the technique of the unrolling of the white mans abuse of the negro in america from the inhuman slave ships and plantations of antebellum days through the lynchings and beatings and brutalization and the stunting economic imprisonment of yesterday and today he blames this literature of the race war with polarizing americans of the warring racesblack and white and he adds this polarization with the implicit assumption of all the suffering by one side and all the guilt by the other is enforced by the frequent and usually unnoticed use of wethey rhetoric in negro writing a usage that presumes the myth and fosters the fact of racial war of we versus they he criticizes james baldwins mixing of the pronouns until even the emotional truth of his rhetoric is corrupted he then states in any case the dogmatic use by negro writers of the warringcamp pronouns helps to enforce in white readers the disturbingly irrational sensation that their hands are on every whip and every touch the habit is not confined to negroes police chief parker of los angeles declared when victory over the  watts rioters seemed to be near were on the top now and theyre on the bottom p  mr littlejohns historical frame of reference is as confused illogical and inexact as his power of critical analysisat least in the area of what he calls literature of the race war to refresh his memory on the use of war camp pronouns police chief parker is far more american in his usage of the warring camp pronouns than is our ivory tower professor wasnt it abraham lincoln that great emancipator of the black race who at the time advocated expatriation and colonization of the newly freed slaves that made the historical statement which follows you and we are different races we have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races whether it is right or wrong  need not discuss but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both as i think your race suffers very greatly many of them by living among us while ours suffer from your presence in a word we suffer on each side if this is admitted it affords a reason why we should be separated for the record this statement was made following an altercation by factions of the american society known as the civil war in the polarization of northerners and southerners over the practice of slavery each side solicited black men to engage in battle with each other over their freedom a contemporary of president abraham lincoln usa was one of the giants of black literature that great abolitionist and statesman frederick douglass in narrative of the life o f frederick douglass an american slave published in  he eloquently expressed the psychology of master and slave and the effects which such a psychicas well as physicalcondition might have on an individual and a society his writing of well over a century ago created a sensation in its day and spurred on his career as a militant uncompromising leader of his people he rose from bondage to become secretary of the santo domingo commission recorder of deeds in the district of columbia and united states minister to haiti he led a minor rebellion escaped from slavery became a selftaught man contrary to mr littlejohns fact that blacks were illiterate before world war ii all that blacks needed to become publishers of newspapers essayist poets was to have lived the harrowing black experience in america and then live to tell it checking out mr douglasss poem called a parody which is the conclusion of the book one finds that it has a whole lotsa soul much insight about reality and truth again please note that in a book about negro writing mr douglass has a onepage reference as opposed to william faulkners  understandably i have a difference of opinion with respect to mr douglasss works which mr littlejohn dismissesone fell sweepalong with the works of james weldon johnson and booker t washingtonas follows i would make no claim for any of these as literature the douglass and johnson works are fat detailed episodic memoirs of the usual unliterary sort    mr douglass would not be perturbed by this he anticipates the littlejohns who fathered him enslaved him tortured him who surrounded
him and would keep coming on down through the centuries menacingly using the diction of the bible the only book a slave could learn to read from under threat of death his words are no less true today the christianity of america is a christianity of whose votaries it may be as truly said as it was of the ancient scribes and pharisees they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers all their works they do for to be seen of menthey love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues    woe unto you scribes and phari sees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess    woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness    dark and terrible as is this picture i hold it to be strictly true of the overwhelming mass of professed christians in america they strain at a gnat and swallow a camel it will not be necessary for me to attempt to establish a name for mr douglass his life is his glory even an innocuous and generally irrelevant magazine like life had his wise black visage on the november  cover in an attempt at revisionist recording of the true american experiencethat is for those americans who are ready for this the truth i mean 
glimpse of truth is completely overshadowed by its surrounding diatribe in such a critical analysis the titles of the chapters are before native son the dark ages before native son the renaissance and after negro writers today the novelist i negro writers today the novelist ii conclusion and index the conclusions and index comprise an additional  pages i have discussed the illogical and dishonest nature of the index which outlines the geography of the totally irrelevant body of the work as it relates to understanding black literature the value in a book of this sort is the revelation of the nature of the psychopathic pseudointellectual mind which has dominated the thinking in the western world even the simplemindedness of the titles of chapters tells the truly informed much more than a small mind could envision of one of the giants in black literatureand american literature also if it were knownrichard wright who by the way authored the landmark novel native son which served as a chronological pivot for mr littlejohn mr littlejohn says in what he must assume to be a poetical idiom an infant crying in the night an infant crying for the light and with no language but a cry p  julian mayfields the hit is called a small strangely airy family tragedy it is about a little negro building superintendent his little dream is deferred p  of pulitzer prize winner and poet laureate of illinois gwendolyn brooks work maud martha referred to as one of the handsomest small novels by american negroes mr littlejohn says in  tiny fragments vignettes tiny moments in passage the reader skims into the life of maud martha    it is a powerful beautiful dagger of a book a womanly book as generous as it can possibly be it teaches more more quickly more lastingly than a thousand pages of protest pp   of langston hughes mr littlejohn says that he is as skillful and durable a storyteller as he is poet a master at the ironic little social comedies of negro life    he is lesser than ellison or baldwin only because his scope is so much smaller not because his work is cheaper or less complete pp   of willard motley and others in the school of wright he dismisses their work of the forties as material james baldwin the dramatist mr littlejohn feels wrote blues for mister charlie as an attempt to give white people an inferiority problem he calls it an essay in artless bullying not a play and since a play is about words and actions which underscore and dramatize these words mr littlejohn lowers the big boom by saying the play betrays serious imaginative disability and the dialogue for the most part is hopeless faked banter faked poetry doctrinaire racism dated slang all conflated with artificial violence and obscenity p  this in spite of the fact that it was based on a real life lynching of a black young man taking place in the present day among socalled civilized christianized democratic citizens of the usa where law and order is violently and unjustly dispensed to the victims of an oppressive racist society mr baldwin in his notes for blues explains his impetus and concerns about writing protest drama admitting that at first he was unwilling to risk my morale and my talentmy lifein endeavors which could only increase a level of frustration already dangerously high however in fully explaining the impetus for writing this essential drama he said lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun new york drama critics award  as a conventional socialrealist drama the short story of an embattled negro family in chicagos black belt and their small unsatisfied dreams p  is mr littlejohn having pronoun trouble shouldnt that be familyits and not their as opposed to our great american dream i suppose mr littlejohn in his little way approves in some small way the talent of mr davis he makes the following comments mr davis composed the worddrunken part of reverend purlie to suit his own exuberant talents godfrey cambridge one of the best new negro comedians took the part of a classic twofaced uncle tom who sings slavery songs to his master the fact that so healthfully doubleedged a takeoff on racial oppression and the civil_rights struggle could be written and produced in one of the surest signs of the maturity of negro art every sugary deep south lie every hoary delusion and institution is deftly mocked in the play its white folks are all patent fools this is clearly a negroes show for negroes to laugh at the jokes are all theirs he says but white viewers too if they are ready for it can relish its sanity p  gosh mr littlejohns pronoun confusion which is clearly racewar oriented really is about to confuse my good clear sane black mind leroi jones the dutchman obieoff broadwayaward for  was described thusly it may be the most important imaginative literary document of the american race war since native son and it works    the dialogue  is almost perfect of mr jones the toilet which takes place in the little john of a city high school he says the plays major strength lies in its sense of menace of the slave he says it is a blatant unmodulated scream of racial abuse its primary purpose one assumes was authorial selfgratification pp   of the author of black mans burden and the screen play odds against tomorrow he says james oliver killens has written two long detailed humorless artless almost documentary race novels youngblood  and and then we heard the thunder  the first is a sort of negro family epic the expected tale of two generations of longsuffering blacks and their sadistic white masters in a georgia town the second tells the interminable story of negroes and whites in wartime where the ordeal of world war ii seems less harrowing in the long run than the race war inside it p   killens who is generously placed in the school of wright described as the most celebrated of the second rank heads the list of writers of the angry novels which are described as symptoms rather than examinations of the race war mr littlejohn says of these they are weapons like rockfilled mudballs they are aimed from the negro fort into the white fort in the hope of wounding or at least splattering some of its inhabitants p  yes we are detecting a circular motion that brings us back where we started as ellison has said of invisible man in the end is my beginning and in the beginning my end perhaps we should end with mr littlejohns appraisal of ellisons talents he lauds ellison for having the most closely focused review of the negros story in america he calls it a shorthand history and sociology of the american negro among the couples tattered scrambled effects cast out on the street are artefacts and mementoes from every stage of the american negro past minstrel show bones voodoonuggets an ethiopian flag a tintype of lincoln a picture of a banjostrumming blackfaced white man a yellowing headline of garveys deportation a hollywood pinup a st louis fair plate and a set of manumission papers dated august     p  as testimonials to ellisons art mr littlejohn mentions the fine texture of his style his manipulative skill in handling language character event design and to move to items of slightly larger focus the fullest sense of drama he says his rhetorical skill is prodigious and he is not reticent about displaying its range not only does he indulge himself in perfect mimicry of the tall tale the emotioncharged address word display and makes his heros hold on history a way with words a gift of tongues an awesome and dangerous eloquence like his own p  in describing a chapter entitled out of the hospital and under the bar which was excluded from the novel but published in soon one morning mr littlejohns description sounds almost appropos for ed bullins inspiration for the electronic nigger here the hero after his disastrous explosion at liberty paints is imprisoned in an antiseptic glass case and operated on by voices and white hands which rearrange his brain and identity with electric devices a negro maid a wonderful woman helps him to escape into underground passages as psychological as they are architectural p  after much quibbling mr littlejohn assigns ellison a place in the tradition of great american novelists like hawthorne and faulkner rather than among the new negroes he says he is not up there of course but i see no reason not to assign him a placeeven for one unbalanced bookat least in the high second rank    p  woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites    frederick douglass shook his head in patience humility disbelief they strain at the gnat and swallow a camel as you might suspect i feel that any conclusions reached by mr littlejohn in the field of afroamerican or black literature are inconclusive to say the least even for the white reader they are totally irrelevant and ridiculous for the black reader i would like to call attention to his criticism misplaced again as cause rather than effect that most negroes are too unhappy about their racial identity  to be able to celebrate the life of their people he lowrates black people in general and black writers in particular for wanting to deny their people wanting to become white in face to adopt white values to assimilate he instructs black readers and writers it is one thing to want to be free it is quite another and sick to want to be a different color it makes for neurosis not for art but america all of it goes on hating blackness fosters the neurosis and holds off the day of a true negro art this of course is a halftruth but he obviously does not realize the heads or tails of the turth also how can he believe this then protest the black students militant demand to be able to study black literature by stating as he did last winter in the daily californian that such courses as black literature african sculpture and other courses which attempt to establish or rather invent a heritage for black students would be pandering to the needs of the students a great truth is evidenced in mr littlejohns critical analysis and fortunately it is addressedeven then in a wrongheaded wayto the white reader he warns that a proper reading an honest

the expected opposition to the concept of a black aesthetic was not long in coming in separate reviews of black fire an anthology edited by leroi jones and larry neal critics from the saturday review and the new york review of books presented the expected rebuttal agreeing with ralph ellison that sociology and art are incompatible mates these critics nevertheless invoked the cliches of the social ideology of the we shall overcome years in their attempt to steer blacks from the path of literary fantasy and folly their major thesis is simple there is no black aesthetic because there is no white aesthetic the kerner commission report to the contrary america is not two societies but one therefore americans of all races colors and creeds share a common cultural heredity this is to say that there is one predominant culturethe american culturewith tributary national and ethnic streams flowing into ture the duct of the larger river literamost important byprothis cultural moonolith knows no parochial boundaries to speak of a black literature a black aesthetic or a black state is to engage in racial chauvinism separatist bias and black fantasy the question of a white aesthetic however is academic one has neither to talk about it nor define it most americans white accept the existence white aesthetic as naturally as they accept april th as the deadline for paying their income tax with far less animosity towards the former than the latter the white aesthetic despite the academic critics has always been with us for long before diotima pointed out the way to heavenly beauty to socrates the poets of biblical times were discussing beauty in terms of light and darkthe essential characteristics of a white and black aestheticand establishing the dichotomy of superior vs inferior which would assume body and form in the th century therefore more serious than a definition is the problem of tracing the white aesthetic from its early origins and afterwards outlining the various changes in the basic formula from culture to culture and from nation to nation such an undertaking would be more germane to a book than an essay nevertheless one may take a certain starting point and using selective nations and cultures make the critical point while calling attention to the necessity of a more comprehensive study encompassing all of the nations and cultures of the world let us propose greece as the logical starting point bearing in mind will durants observation that all of western civilization is but a footnote to plato and take plato as the first writer to attempt a systematic aesthetic two documents by plato the symposium and the republic reveal the twin components of platos aesthetic system in the symposium plato divides the universe into spheres in   one sphere the lower one finds the  forms of beauty in the other the higher beauty as diotima tells socrates is absolute and supreme in the republic plato defines the poet as an imitator a thirdrate imitatora point which modern critics have long since forgotten who reflects the heavenly beauty in the earthly mirror in other words the poet recreates beauty as it exists in heaven thus the poet as neoplatonists from aquinas to coleridge have told us is the custodian of beauty on earth  however plato defines beauty only in ambiguous mystical terms leaving the problem of a more circumscribed secular definition to philosophers poets and critics during most of the history of the western world these aestheticians have been white therefore it is not surprising that symbolically and literally they have defined beauty in terms of whiteness an early contradiction to this tendency is the marquis desade who inverted the symbols making black beautiful but demonic and white pure but sterilethe marquis is considered by modern criticism to have been mentally deranged the distinction between whiteness as beautiful good and blackness as ugly evil appears early in the literature of the middle agesin the morality plays of england heavily influenced by both platonism and christianity these plays set forth the distinctions which exist today to be white was to be pure good universal and beautiful to be black was to be impure evil parochial and ugly the characters and the plots of these plays followed this basic format the villain is always evil in most cases the devil the protagonist or hero is always good in most cases angels or disciples the plot then is simple good light triumphs over the forces of evil dark as english literature became more sophisticated the symbols were made to cover wider areas of the human and literary experience to love was divine to hate evil the fancied mistress of petrarch was the purest of the pure grendels mother a creature from the lower regions and marshes is like her son a monster the bad characters in chaucers canterbury tales tell dark stories and the satan of paradise lost must be vanquished by gabriel the angel of purity these ancients as swift might have called them established their dichotomies as a result of the influences of neoplatonism and christianity later the symbols became internationalized robert burton in the anatomy of melancholy writes of dark despair in the seventeenth century and james boswell describes melancholia that state of mind common to intellectuals of the th and th centuries as a dark dreaded affliction which robbed men of their creative energies this conditiondark despair or melancholiawas later popularized in what is referred to in english literature as its dark periodthe period of the grave yard school of poets and the gothic novels the symbols thus far were largely applied to conditions although characters who symbolized evil influences were also dark in the early stages of english literature these characters were mythological and fictitious and not representative of people of specific racial or ethnic groups in the th century english novel however the symbolism becomes ethnic and racial there were forerunners as early as  shakespeare has lago refer to othello as that old black ewe attaching the mystical sexual characteristic to blackness which would become the motive for centuries of oppressive acts by white americans in the tempest shakespeares last play caliban though not ostensibly black is nevertheless a distant cousin of the colonial friday in daniel defoes robinson crusoe robinson crusoe was published at a historically significant time in the year  the english had all but completed their colonization of africa the slave trade in america was on its way to becoming a booming industry in africa black people were enslaved men tally as well as physically by such strange bedfellows as criminals businessmen and christians in the social and political spheres a rationale was needed and help came from the artistin this case the novelistin the form of robinson crusoe in the novel defoe brings together both christian and platonic symbolism sharpening the dichotomy between light and dark on the one hand while on the other establishing a criterion for the inferiority of black people as opposed to the superiority of white one need only compare crusoe with friday to validate both of these statements crusoe is majestic wise white and a colonialist friday is savage ignorant black and a colonial therefore crusoe the colonialist has a double task on the one hand he must transform the island africaunproductive barren dead into a little england prosperous lifegiving fertile and he must recreate friday in his own image thus bringing him close to being an englishman as possible at the end of the novel crusoe has accomplished both undertakings the island is a replica of mother england and friday has been transformed into a white man now capable of immigrating to the land of the gods from such mystical artifacts has the literature and criticism of the western world sprung and based upon such narrow prejudices as those of defoe the art of black people throughout the world has been described as parochial and in ferior friday was parochial and inferior until having denounced his own culture he assimilated another once this was done symbolically friday underwent a change to deal with him after the conversion was to deal with him in terms of a character who had been civilized and therefore had moved beyond racial parochialism however defoe was merely a hack novelist not a thinker it was left to shrewder minds than his to apply the rules of the white aesthetic to the practical areas of the black literary and social worlds and no shrewder minds were at work on this problem than those of writers and critics in america in america the rationale for both slavery and the inferiority of black art and culture was supplied boldly without the trappings of th century symbolism in  in a book entiled nojoque a question for a continent hinton helper provided the vehicle for the cultural and social symbols of inferiority under which blacks have labored in this country helper intended as he states frankly in his preface to write the negro out of america in the headings of the two major chapters of the book the whole symbolic apparatus of the white aesthetic handed down from plato to america is graphically revealed the heading of one chapter reads black a thing of ugliness disease another heading reads white a thing of life health and beauty under the first heading helper argues that the color black has always been associated with sinister things such as mourning the devil the darkness of night under the second white has always been associated with the light of day divine transfiguration the beneficent moon and stars    the fair complexion of romantic ladies the costumes of romans and angels and the white of the american flag so beautifuly combined with blue and red without ever a touch of the black that has been for the flag of pirates such is the american critical ethic based upon centuries of distortion of the platonic ideal by not adequately defining beauty and implying at least that this was the job of the poet plato laid the foundation for the white aesthetic as defined by daniel defoe and hinton helper however the uses of that aesthetic to stifle and strangle the cultures of other nations is not to be attributed to plato but instead to his hereditary brothers far from the aegean for plato knew his poets they were not he surmised a very trusting lot and therefore by adopting an ambiguous position on symbols he limited their power in the realm of aesthetics for plato there were two kinds of symbols natural and proscriptive natural symbols corresponded to absolute beauty as created by god proscriptive symbols on the other hand were symbols of beauty as proscribed by man which is to say that certain symbols are said to mean such and such by man himself the irony of the trap in which the black artist has found himself throughout history is apparent those symbols which govern his life and art are proscriptive ones set down by minds as diseased as hinton helpers in other words beauty has been in the eyes of an earthly beholder who has stipulated that beauty conforms to such and such a definition to return to friday defoe stipulated that civilized man was what friday had to become proscribed certain characteristics to the term civilized and presto friday in order not to be regarded as a savage under western eyes was forced to conform to this ideal how well have the same stipulative definitions worked in the artistic sphere masterpieces are made at will by each new critic who argues that the subject of his doctoral dissertation is immortal at one period of history john donne according to the critic samuel johnson is a second rate poet at another period according to the critic t s eliot he is one of the finest poets in the language dickens argues professor ada nisbet is one of englands most representative novelists while for f r leavis dickens work does not warrant him a place in the great tradition when black literature is the subject the verbiage reaches the height of the ridiculous the good negro novel we are told by robert bone and herbert hill is that novel in which the subject matter moves beyond the limitations of narrow parochialism form is the most important criterion of the work of art when black literature is evaluated whereas form almost nonexistent in dostoyevskys crime and punishment and totally chaotic in kafkas the trial must take second place to the supremacy of thought and message richard wright says theodore gross is not a major american novelist while ralph ellison on the strength of one novel is leroi jones is not a major poet ed bullins not a major playwright baldwin incapable of handling the novel formall because white critics have said so behind the symbol is the object or vehicle and behind the vehicle is the definition it is the definition with which we are concerned for the extent of the cultural strangulation of black literature by white critics has been the extent to which they have been allowed to define the terms in which the black artist will deal with his own experience the career of paul laurence dunbar is the most striking example having internalized the definitions handed him by the american society dunbar would rather not have written about the black ex perience at all and three of his novels and most of his poetry support this argument however when forced to do so by his white liberal mentors among them was the powerful critic william dean howells dunbar deals with blacks in terms of buffoonery idiocy and comedy like so many black writers past and present dunbar was trapped by the definitions of other men never capable of realizing until near the end of his life that those definitions were not godgiven but mangiven and so circumscribed by tradition and culture that they were irrelevant to an evaluation of either his life or his art in a literary conflict involving christianity zarathustra friedrich nietzsches iconoclast calls for a new table of the laws in similar iconoclastic fashion the proponents of a black aesthetic the idol smashers of america call for a set of rules by which black literature and art is to be judged and evaluated for the historic practice of bowing to other mens gods and definitions has produced a crisis of the highest magnitude and brought us culturally to the limits of racial armegeddon the trend must be reversed the acceptance of the phrase black is beautiful is the first step in the destruction of the old table of the laws and the construction of new ones for the phrase flies in the face of the whole ethos of the white aesthetic this step must be followed by serious scholarship and hard work and black critics must black experienceregions where dig beneath the phrase and unearth others due to historical conditionthe treasure of beauty lying deep ing and cultural deprivation canin the untoured regions of the not go
then we intellectually its  consider the idea of a  vv £ black aesthetics we v rm need not look to aris xqnnsh totean academes or white western artistic qualifiers we need not be preoccupied with classical dramatic unities or traditional plot and character development we need not submit ourselves to the arbitrary classes of absurdist impressionist surrealist naturalist or other available labels  m t   which have absorbed new dimensions in american dramaturgy we need not in search of a black aesthetics   we need only to look to ourselves we must probe the depths of the black soul and unleash the wild wings of the black spirit its flight will lead us forever onward and upward to a greater aesthetic appreciation of the free black spirit the aesthetics of black art come from within it is the internal made external for within the creative psyche of the black artist who must be deep into the reality of his own existence is born the essence of black aesthetics from its union with community it is thus the internal consciousness of the black artist from whence come the sole standard if you will of his art black artists must not look for absolute external aesthetic criteria for selfexpression for that forced objectivity negates a fundamental aspect of creativitythe self instead he must view his art from within the total spirituality of his blackness and create new forms and new standards which offer a truer reflection of himself and his art in theater the thrust of aesthetics is the drama of the black experience it derives its energy from black lifestyles and exerts a positive force toward the dramatic perpetuation of that life it redefines the theater process into an arena of selfawareness selfdirection selfcriticism in relation to the entire black community it is a marriage of the self and the community whose child is art as such black theater fosters a great festival of blackness where new doors are opened new directions forgedand new aesthetics developed from the dark continent of the progressive black being it is indeed intellectually satisfying to expound upon the ideologies of a black aesthetics but the total grasp of such knowledge is missed if the intellectual aesthetics renders itself impotent in practical application the viability then of a black aesthetics or the art of black life can only be appreciated in the truest sense by its function it must live it must live on the streets as well as reside in secluded ivycovered minds the viability or the living of a black aesthetics in theater rests in a total liberation from a white or negro mentality to an artistic awareness of the beauty of black activity it is functional active alivefor a true black aesthetics lives in every black man it walks talks eats and sleeps with every black man it is the essence of black existence it is the soul a black aesthetics can never function in theater unless there is a conscious living black we as black artists in theater must explore every speech pattern every physical movement every psychological crisis of a black existence in white america we must know the indigenous art of black life completely so as to be able to use that uninhibited style as the artistic impetus to a dramatic presentation of the black experience otherwise there can never be a black theater reflective of black life or black people we must combine all phases of theater divisions into a communal direction towards the development of an afroamerican theater tradition its product is a merger of the black actor playwright director and audience in a common quest for a total liberation to a cultural and political identity free at last from the rusty chains of western aesthetics the castrated black actor in what is conveniently referred to today as american theater must regain his artistic masculinity he must emancipate himself from the auction block of commercial theater and hollywood glamour once free physically and most important mentally he then can utilize in a new theater perspective aspects of black life eg movement speech character these new techniques that are characteristic of black people become one important foundation for the building of a black aesthetics in theater the black actor no longer acts or imitates he lives he lives blackly his mind and body are stripped of the facade of broadway professionalism and left naked to discover the mysterious essence of his stark black existence he is free from current theatrical restrictions to think black and thus give birth to a true black art which is an essential and a living part of his existence as a black man the black actor is liberated from an artistic colonial mentality to that of an independent creator once liberated he serves primarily as a liberator he is a messenger to the community he then in turn liberates the community to a significant cultural and political awareness essential to the freedom of all black people the messenger communicates the message which is the revolutionary philosophy of the playwright his literature is the prophecy that heralds the creation of a black artistic medium as the only form which fully expresses the aesthetic truth of black life the playwright is a sculptor who com bines various aspects of black life into a soft fertile clay and molds the spiritual essence of the black experience into a solid living structure impervious to the intrusion of white exploiters the playwright has created now he must communicate as a black artist he directs himself to the black community to which he is both educator and student as educator the playwright teaches his people the glory of black heroes the resolution of social problems and the art of community politics he exposes the flaws of black society to foster internal reform he praises black accomplishments to instill hope and ambition he proclaims black beauty to show forth pride in being black he teaches his people about  themselves in order that they may appreciate their blackness as a unique blessing the theater then becomes a great ritual of ethnic identity and ethnic worth as student the black playwright looks to his community as a source of material he must learn about himself in relation to his people in  order to provide a true representation of black life the playwright learns from the people he chooses to portray thus the black community dictates the technique he must use to effectively relate to that community black people as a collective body will dictate the form and content of black drama and in r the end they will judge the artistic merit of the playwright as his art speaks for the people and himself the black community at large is both the source and the critic of  the black playwright it is clear that the community as a collective society is the center of black aesthetics in our quest for a functional application of a black aesthetics in theater and the devejr opment of an afroamerican theater tradition we must look first to the black community therein lie the souls of black folk therein  »  lies the beauty of black life as reflected by black people therein lies the black aesthetics a functional viable black aes  «  thetics grows from an alliance of the artist with the community the artist and his audience become one in search of the spiritual truth of blackness in a righteous effort to create an indigenous black art  a living theater  a living aesthetics
though we may al come from god where n    we decide to take ourselves is what we eventually become  though we change at the moment of decision thereby making if one talks of america morality a matter of strengthand distortion of the natural world sin at its vilest the lie with which we whip others in line and with which we kidnap our senses that is why the blues is the most important art form ever produced in america ever possibly in the west because it has the big feeling as john lee hooker says it broke past the lie became rudely vulgar in its exposition of  w truth spit in the face of venus de milo the armless bitch incapable of the embrace stumbled through the flung lye of loneliness so often scalded walking barefoot in the glassstrewn alleys of anguish maimed by memories suffering the treason against the self which is called sentimentality but at the end with its tongue hanging out in love dunt you want to rock or got a good rocking mama and the way she rock is all right that is the final specificity of feeling and of life the woman reached or wished forand say babe dont you remember me that is the blues to me means no one is crushed if he or she can summon the strength to understand what has happened which is identity therefore b b king need not be threatened by white musicians he knows who he is and knows as we all must as long as youve got black people youll have the blues the truth that nothing is easier to carry than the lie for the moment we diminish our adversaries we diminish ourselves there is no other way to look at it and neither black artists nor black people can afford purely in the arena of personal growth to do this for that the turning of other lives to ideas that perpetuate fantasy is where the white man has been as long as we can read or remember backward r f     the heaviest growls the biggest truths always come together to make the strongest art forms and i believe that the blues or rhythm and blues as popular art forms amongst black people have kept us sane as a mass as opposed to the maudlin weeping of a white folk form like country and western musicthough both musics the folk black and the folk white deal with the same areas of challenge death natural disaster and anguish but white men crumble and end up shooting people from bell towers because their arts have not prepared them for the pressurecooker of living which burns or purifies but to get way down in it the fantasy which america suckles like a synthetic breast is created by the fact that the country is controlled by faggots and dykes from ymca toilets in washington to hollywood to broadway to fashion circles they who must reorder the world because they are not and can never be that which they would want to be hence the abstractions the trail pulled from struggle to the salivating desire for instant change as lsd not too long ago made for instant spirituality as though god could so easily be hidden in a chemical lsd and indians anything other than what one is which leads to whowhom you are we as black people need none of this for most often we seek not instant life change nor insulation but merely a vessel from which to express that which we know to be true bullshit notwithstanding all men come forward with equal internal chances but the fags and dykes would have us believe otherwise that human reality is subjective and freedom but a state of mind those ideas oh so useful because they themselves are some place else their minds are perpetually in pursuit of the alteration the reordering of what is naturally placed forward hence aggression vietnam dead jack and bobby kennedy slaughters on the wholesale of black people as the most natural must be done away with and controlled first or fashions wherein women are made to look like men which cools out the faggotsand we know the dykes dig it we should want total truth and realize ourselves as fools if we wish otherwise we must seek to understand all levels of living must be strong as nothing black people have ever created in this country or elsewhere has ever been easy the only instants ever were fear and death creation always took time and understanding even more than that which is why black artists must seek the inner workings of every possible thing their eyes ears and senses can find for the redeeming qualities are those which a personor a peoplewould have whether or not the place was america africa or alaska that is say black women are not beautiful because other women are not but simply because they are things must be seen that way or one ends up having something by default which is there can be no doubt the rankest way to look at the world all possibilities of heroism and growth are eliminated because the measure against which one compares his legs are ricketturned and eaten with sores from the start and one can thereby just walk on to the finish line very cool let us say then this man would be good whether all other men were rotten or all other men were good false gods called ourselves are not necessary are never necessary as clear vision for it is only the insecure who need to shout down all other voices to be heard since the strongest thing will stand up anyway and i will never say that the white man is responsible for my possibilities my strengths prowess or ideas me no ill never give him that much credit i would be whatever i am if i were a south american indian whod never heard of america can you dig that now to get down to further business the thing at hand there may though may is almost idealistic come the time when we will have to kill people and it must always be understood that its people were killing not ideas fantasy abstractions nor even our wishes that part of ourselves we would like to be but destroy so that we will not more fully pursue that illusion as long as we know those policemen those mayors and even presidents we may have to do away with in selfdefense long as we know they are men and yes have wives families lovers as long as we know those things murder in defense of whatever possible vision is humane for it is when men become abstractions that the land of the soul is inflamed and any evil is possible and even the most cursory thumbing through of the white mans history will show that his greatest failing has been his inability to accept the humanity of those whom he murdered to accept that responsibility which is where all those funny names come from polacks niggers jerries chinks japs redskins etc and the tools the ideas the mentalities and responsibilities or fear of them which are involved in the overthrowing of a system are the building blocks of that which will follow the smoke so we must be very much together internally to truly come up with something different we must be on the move for as leroi jones says love not bloodhounds sniffing the tracks of a misshapen world whose tenets and buildings are but caricatures of our real power the presence of self of spirit
nowadays when attention is so sharply turned on the black creative writer as prophet and analyst of the black soul and psyche the recent book black expression weybright and talley  edited by addison gayle jr provides a kind of counterbalance which helps to bring the whole matter into better perspective it is becoming harder and harder to live in isolation from our own literature black literature has of course been going on all the time but there was a time when black people werent encouraged to be particularly aware of it perhaps in the james baldwin of the fifties in the leroi jones of the sixties we can trace the current movement of affirmation in which more and more black writers seem bent on making the black reader aware that his life through art is captured in all its fullness and preserved so that he may savor it and be shocked by it even so the contemporary reader is frequently unaware that that whole other body of writingthe critical apparatus which must accompany artistic endeavorexists and exists from the pens of black men this is exactly the point black expression makes addison gayle jr has collected in this work a very large number of essays from various sources and fashioned them into a neat comprehensive volume the essays represent work published as early as  web du bois and  langston hughes five of the essays were written especially for black expression the established recognized men of black letters are to be found here web du bois alain locke sterling a brown arna bontemps j saunders redding the writers themselves are included langston hughes margaret walker richard wright james baldwin ralph ellison leroi jones black scholars who will be active in the shape of things to come are here john henrik clarke james a emanuel addison gayle jr there are others writers critics popularizers whose names are not so well known but who have or had a sincere commitment to the fortunes of black literature in america the book contains a preface and an index the preface examines at length the peculiar position of the black critic and what his role should be and puts forth the thesis that understanding black poets depends not only on knowledge of american literature as some white critics may presumptuously declare but also on a critical perspective conditioned by the manyfaceted experiences of the negro in the turbulent american society the essays themselves there are forty of them are divided into four categories folk culture poetry drama and fiction the inclusion of a section on folk culture can be perhaps justified on the basis that the oral tradition constitutes literature as well as the written however the reader will probably find that this section stands somewhat apart from the rest the section on poetry is quite complete the entire history of black poetry is there dudley randalls essay black poetry rounds out the picture by speaking at length of the revolutionary black poets of today the section on drama is perhaps the most exciting gyrating as it does between commerciallyoriented theater and black revolutionary theater the reader must conjure up in his imagination on the one hand the large whiterun whitepatronized whiteoriented movie houses and broadway musicals the minstrel shows which preceded them and on the other work in the black communities by and for black people traditionally harlem but also more recently watts and san francisco california and newark new jersey compare for instance this passage from jessie fausets article that laughter for which we are so justly famed has had in late years its overtones of pain now for some time past it has been used by colored men who have gained a precarious footing on the stage to conceal the very real dolar raging in their breasts to be by force of circumstances the most dramatic figure in a country to be possessed of the wells of feeling of the most spontaneous instinct for effective action and to be shunted no less always into the role of the ridiculous and funnythat is enough to create the quality of bitterness for which we are ever so often rebuked with the following from k william kgositsiles towards our theater a definitive act  we will finally be coming to grips with where we are really at historically we will be destroying the symbols which have facilitated our captivity we will be creating and establishing symbols to facilitate our necessary constant beginning old decadent wouldbe black woman this theater will straighten out your mind instead of your hair    the last and largest section on fiction deals with various things the novel the essay and the intangibles of attitude aesthetics and destiny the amount of research and organization necessary in putting together such a volume should not be underestimated however one would have hoped for better editorship in one or two areas the most perturbing aspect is the absence of publication dates for a significant number of the essays a chronological ordering is especially important in the field of black letters due to the accelerated character of its development in the twentieth century when one comes across these words by langston hughes but to my mind it is the duty of the younger negro artist if he accepts any duties at all from outsiders to change through the force of his art that old whispering i want to be white hidden in the aspirations of his people to why should i want to be white i am a negroand beautiful if one realizes that they were first published in  then one understands that the younger artist is hughes himself and not his younger brothers of the sixties who may indeed express the same sentiments though in more militant style and one would understand instantly if one had not up till then why dudley randall can state elsewhere in the volume that hughes in the midsixties was still holding his finger to the pulse of the times there is it is true at the beginning of the book copyright information on most of the essays and by referring constantly to these pages the reader can most of the time determine when an essay was first published however as if by some ghoulish prank it is precisely in those essays lacking copyright information that we come across such phrases as for some time now recently in late years currently wallace thurman and jessie fauset are especially frustrating in this respect there is here and there the need for clarification in the form of an editors footnote we need to know something about the amsac writers conference to which julian mayfield refers in his article this is important as the conference apparently provided the impetus for the article the preface makes much of the fact that black critics are the invisible men of black letters the whole reason for the books existence is presumably to remedy this it is not clear from the books subtitle essays by and about black americans in the creative arts that we are dealing exclusively with a collection of black writers this is something the reader will probably ascertain by prior knowledge and inference as he gets further into the book but confusion however momentary could be avoided by a very short footnote at the beginning of each essay giving the date of publication and some information about the author and would greatly enhance the books handiness and tighten its organization admittedly some of these men need no introduction but there are others here who are not necessarily familiar to the general reader these weaknesses are more than compensated for by the richness variety and scope of the essays themselves one of the beauties of the volume is that it will immerse the conscientious reader in the world of black literary criticism and will do it not within the rigid confines of the programmed syllabus but gradually and leisurely it must be admitted that some of the essays will sting and irk some readers because some of them are bound to reflect an attitude about blackness which is odious to him therefore if you like james baldwin you must prepare yourself for eldridge cleavers essay which decimates him if you feel that acceptance into the mainstream or the negros contribution to american letters is of no relevance then several essays including margaret walkers new poets may vex you if you pride yourself on your deep reverence for black american literature then leroi jones essay which probably should be more specific in its charges will exasperate you writers themselves may understandably take offense at nick aaron fords blueprint for negro authors writers presumably know how to make their own blueprints all of the essays are not of the same quality and there are some contradictions for instance arthur huff fauset and sterling a brown will instruct you differently as to the existence of the rabbit in african folklore and addison gayle jr in his preface gives a picture of frank yerby very much different from the one given by nick aaron ford all these different opinions and the reactions they may provoke in the reader do no more than point to a strong feature of the book it is not slanted toward any one school or period of black criticism there is every shape of article here the richly informative reportage of ernest kaiser the literature of harlem the reminiscing tone in arna bontemps negro poets then and now one cannot help but be aware of the scholarships behind james a emanuels interesting comments in the future of negro poetry a challenge for critics as opposed to the downright antischolarly and negative attitude of wallace thurman in negro poets and their poetry there is also the sensitive perception beautifully expressed of the artist himself as in the case of ralph ellisons richard wrights blues certain essays are enjoyable not only for what they bring to our understanding of literaturenathan a scott jrs essay on richard wright contains a wealth of allusions to the american and european traditions in generalbut also the light they throw directly or indirectly on other aspects of the black experience addison gayles own essay perhaps not so soon one morning will be of special interest to teachers for it deals with one

anita followed her  a  movements in the bu j  reau mirror as she deftly applied pink lipstick to the full cupids bow of her mouth then pausing she gazed critically back at her reflection the offshoulder black cocktail dress fitted snugly over her round curved hips while the white pearl necklace and earrings set off the creamy tan of her skin she decided that she looked very chic and smart im sorry you wont go with me claude she said turning now to the man seated at a makeshift card table desk in the comer of the bedroom i got more important things to do he grumbled sullenly bent over the mound of papers a frown wrinkled tiny delicate lines between her widespaced eyes as she stared long at him sometimeslike nowhe looked so forbidding to her with all that fierce black hair worn stiff and high and long bushy hair growing down his dark brown face into sideburns which ended in an entangled brush of beard with all that hair covering his face and arching above the thick full lips he looked like a black samson a black samson who needed hair to give him his manstrength she sighed reaching to struggle her fingers one by one into the white linen gloves you never go anyplace with me anymore not since he had gotten so wrapped up in the movement the movement almost an obsession with him now he lit a cigarette from the crumpled pack of larks on the table flicking the match into the already overflowing ash tray i got better things to do right now the movement the movement she almost shouted at him thats all you think about hell i believe in the movement too but christ i cant live the movement im also an individualist a person not just a negro person i cant eat sleep and go to the toilet with civil_rights and hating the white man with each breath i take i cant submerge the fact that i also like to have fun once in a while i like to enjoy a good book not soused with racism listen to pretty music valk in the park and admire the natural green of the grass and blue of the sky i like to look up at the strength of the trees growing high and i like to look down and gaze into the coolness of a spring brook i like to see and do those things as a person without their being marred all the time by hating and thinking about the white man she stopped feeling out of breath like the words had drained her slowly she went over to him caressing his haid broad back outlined in the colorful summer african shirt with geometric patterns of spears and masks surrounding a lion cant you relaxsometimes it was a plea he tensed beneath her touch not turning to her not looking hell no thats the trouble now we been relaxing too long your daddy and my daddyrelaxing uncle toming all those years letting things get tougher and tougher claude thats not true you know how our parents yeah i know by buying lifetime memberships in the naacp you go on to that cocktail party with all those mealymouth white liberals whore going to do thisandthat for the brother until they get out in the air and back to the suburbs i work with those people i cant refuse their invitations all the time besides in my line of work it gives me an opportunity to meet others and make significant contacts significant contacts he sneered excusesexcusesexcuses you just want to be with them and act like them and wish you were like them you cant forget your little black bourgeois upbringing about how great it is being in with white people like a status symbol she stepped back as if struck you had the same socalled black bourgeois background as i yeah baby but  got out that second year in that middleclass snooty college i got out and joined the movement i left my doctor daddy and my social sprinting mother beeehind there are times when i think youre jealous because at least i did finish his hands tightened on the chair the knuckles showing like taut knobs through his skin she knew the lance had pierced always between them now were angry hatefilled words making them no longer one but two divided into sharp brittle separate pieces blown by different winds and guided by different stars go on where you going he muttered thickly i got work to do work she repeated bitterly watching him shut himself away from her over the desk her eyes swept the papers before him the array of pencils and the oldfashioned battered typewriter what kind of work  work  keep us going and i work because my black skin still doesnt deter me from liking good scotch good steaks living in a decent neighborhood and seeing a good play and its my work thats doing it she watched him puff heavily on the cigarette knowing she had wounded this timestruck where the sore was like a cancer eating him finally he laughed shortly some work the only nigger in a government job placement center a showpiece to prove nobodys prejudice a nigger behind a desk whos pretty and looks white with a forever florida suntan big deal meim out in the streets working with the brothers out there where the nitty gritty is fighting mister charlie im going to make whitey realize im a man i want to be treated as a man and baby i am going to be treated like a man takes a lot to make a man she scoffed slamming the door hard behind her      the doors slam was like a slap a burning sting pierced the tips of his forefinger and thumb the cigarette had burned down to a pinpoint heat he dropped it in the burial ground of others a sharp recurring pain streaked across his forehead blurring his vision and the words on the paper she had caused him to lose his thought just when his pencil had moved and written a wonderful spring of free flowing words he was certain this one was the onethe essay that the atlantic monthly or new yorker would publish he was sure because he knew it was good it was just as good as any of baldwins or jones or cleavers wasnt he socking it to whitey spilling out his seething hatred and venom and frustrations making whitey feel guilt making whitey want to feel punished by the hot word lava flung at him by a black writer now was the time for the black writer to emerge because whitey was a masochist who wanted to be verbally whipped by the black man for his guilt whitey wanted the negro to tell him like it is tell him that he wasnt shit never was shit and never would be shit but the black man was some shit and even if blood had to flow the black man would prove he was some good shit he stared down at the papers and rejection slip that had come in the mornings mailthe telltale slip he had tried to hide from her the stock words swam before him thank you for your submittal which we are returning to you please dont consider this a reflection on the quality of your work    he crumpled up the letter damn them whitey wouldnt even give him a chance to tell it like it is he got up stiffly noticing the soft summer evening rapidly fading into night a mauve twilight streaked pink and lilac ridges across the blue sky what he needed was a drink he went to the kitchen where a bottle of cutty sark was on the sink he got a glass from the cabinet and half filled it with the clear brown liquid raising the glass to his lips he savored the rich expensive odor of the scotch then suddenly in revenge he flung the glass across the room it made a dull thud against the wall before crashing into pieces on the floor the ache in his head flared anew he closed his eyes thinking he had to get out away from hereif only for a while he had to walk a block down the neat wellkept residential street with rows of modern onestory box houses and green carpets of manicured lawns before he could board the bus he felt the eyes upon him as he took a seat midway by the window the people on the bus stared furtively at him because they were used to seeing cleanshaven negro men in wellpressed suits dress shirts and carefully matching ties in this neighborhood this amused him so he always played a game with the passengers first he would glare at the white women gazing boldly to frighten them through his boring eyes with all those stories about the black mans sex powers some of the women would look away nervously averting the blackeyed spotlight beaming upon them while others would squirm uneasily on their seats as if what his gaze was divulging made them want to masturbate then tiring of this he would turn his fierce threatening look to the palefaced washedout cleanly scrubbed dickless white men and watch them wither as they wondered if he were there to start a riot or rob them or rape their women it was a tough hard funny wellplayed game that he enjoyed very much but tonight he didnt feel like playing instead of staring at them he simply ignored them by looking out the window and down at the cars appearing like miniature bugs darting in and out of the traffic soon the white people began to empty the bus and after a while he was left alone to travel into the belly of the ghetto where the seats would then be taken by others like himself he felt a surge of exhilaration when the first sister got on a large black perspiring woman grunting up the steps flopping down tiredly on the seat in front of him her  hair was short and shot straight up as beads of sweat sprinkled the bare crinkled kitchen of her neck he smelled her sweat felt her tiredness wallowed in her big black brassiness and felt suddenly hilariously drunk you wont be tired long we black men are going to take up for you he thought he had said to himself but when the woman turned stared at him and back he wondered if he had said it aloud the ghetto noises began to drift in and rock with the rhythm of the bus flashing neon signs shattered kaleidoscopic shock waves of pawn shops bars furniture outlets and allnight grocery stores soul music spilled from the sleazy bars and shabby mountainous hollow eyed tenements into the streets bouncing off the hot pavements with its loud soaring beat home he wished anita would move here where his work was his heart lay and where his pain could be borne with a little more ease but no she wanted to stay where they were because it was closer to her work and she liked it there the streets were taking on the evenings life men lounged on the corners cracking jokes and making passes at the pliant flashing swell of brown yellow black feminine pulchritude floating by in gales of teasing laughter he breathed deeply soaking in the fetid air and the sounds and sights he liked it here he got off the bus and walked back to the movements office a few people who knew him waved he waved back bracing his shoulders in a swagger making the lion on his shirt stretch as he smiled broadly at them the office was locked he stood at the door for a moment then decided to go to tubbys black bar across the street the place was deserted except for two men in dingy tshirts and faded pants at the bar drinking beer an old man halfslept in a corner by the jukebox blaring james browns wailing blues shout the mans muddy face sank heavily in deep valley folds he was dressed in overalls that fell over and hid his shoes from time to time he would awaken sip from a glass of beer gone flat and nod again hi claude the shiny dark baldheaded man behind the bar greeted him hey tubby whiskey he perched on the bar stool glancing around at the shabby booths and worn wooden floor which had held and showed the weight and scuffle of many souls long gone friday and saturday there was hardly room to get in the whiskey was set before him it was cheap and raw and burned like a blaze going down his throat but it warmed him and he began to feel mellow inside he reached in his pocket and pulled out a crumpled  bill the weeks pay from the movement slow night he commented picking up the change yeah too hot to stir anyway i got no air conditioner tubbys head jerked back to a lone fan in the window whirling a bee sound to make a faint breeze suddenly a police siren screamed outside reaching high above the wailing of james brown the two men further down the bar turned quickly trying to peer out the dirt streaked plate glass window a quick visible chill of fear iced their eyes the loud whine ceased but from the proximity of its subsidence they could tell it had stopped somewhere near claude kept his eyes on the glass he had to drink slowly to make the liquor and the money and companionship last james browns bellow ended in a crying moan leaving the room silent and each mans thoughts naked to the other trouble tubby said frowning too hot a night for trouble the police cars siren squealed again and faded away the old mans eyes opened as if on signal and he reached for the beer glass that was encircled with skimmed foam well tubby smiled relief flooding his face gone probly nothing much next round on the house brothers then the polices warning song shrilled again coming closer and louder like a screaming angry hyena the scream stopped in front of the bar the door swung back and two uniform policemen entered everybody up and over against the wall the big stout one ordered standing spraddlelegged with gun drawn in the middle of the room search em ed he said to the tall thin young one who looked and acted like a rookie the two men at the bar resembling welltrained robots moved simultaneously to stand against the pock marked wall scribbled with countless names and addresses and epithets the old man half stood obediently in his corner then through no volition of his own swayed back down in his chair too drunk to stand you too pops the big officer snapped pushing the bill of his cap back to unmask small narrow eyes then moving uncannily fast across the room he jerked the old man to his feet and shoved his dead weight against the wall the man bent his will to blend into the scars of the walls legacy of past histories whats wrong officer tubby asked quickly i aint had no trouble in here but weve had trouble white man was mugged down the street were looking for the nigger who done it it was then his eyes discovered claude still sitting firmly on the bar stool their eyes met the white mans cold grey steel of a winters sky and the angry black mans storm of inbred hate goddamnit you get over there to that wall like the rest claude steeled himself against the bar planting his feet solidly on the rungs of the stool who the hell did they think they were bursting in here like this they had no right that white man who got mugged  had no rightbeing here in their world words came out revealing his thoughts what was that white man doing down here anyway looking for black pussy the policemans mouth opened in surprise his thin lips folding like a tent against the flabbiness of his face for a stilled deathlike moment he was too shocked to say anything then giving an angry bellow his meaty hands seized claude by his shirt ripping the african symbols and tearing the lion into shreds furiously he slammed him against the wall the hardness struck his head stunning him for a moment he knew he had fallen because he felt the floor and grit under the palms of his hands dazed he saw the big black shoes of the policeman shift and before he could roll out of the way felt the hard weight of the lawmans foot plunging into his side pain gripped him as his body was left as breathless as a deflated balloon black bastard i believe you the one done it get the goddam hell up get up he got up slowly the hurt bursting through him the room swirled in a circular motion reminding him of the ferris wheel he rode on when he was a boy that went around and around and when he closed his eyes he could yet feel the revolving sensation in the blackness he felt numbed and on another planet where there was nothing and even the nothing would not keep still the cheap rotgut whiskey rose to his throat he wanted to vomit but he swallowed and swallowed the bile to keep it down he couldnt do that not before him dont this one look like the one he described ed naw bull the young cop replied shaking his head eyes nervously skirting claude he said the guy was little and yellow with he looks like him to me bull growled spittle making bubbles at the corners of his mouth his tone became wheedling now dont he to you the young one looked down and away as if studying the thought but said nothing the men against the wall stood motionless like a shadow of silent ghosts claude guardedly watched the cop called bull thinking if that white sonofabitch hit him again hed kill him so help him hed kill that white motherfucker im goin to take this nigger in bull said pointing to claude comon lets go claude worked his lips they felt cracked and he could taste the salt of blood around them the movement of his mouth to speak hurt but the words came out strong not betraying the inward pain how you going to take me in he just said i didnt fit shut up nigger i can take you in for anything i goddam got a mind to we ought to take all you black coons in and kill ever last one of you pow pow like that he waved his pistol menacingly shoving it into claudes face suddenly upon seeing the beefy face and the wild grey eyes so near the old familiar ache crossed his forehead as a rushing tide of black ancient fires of loathing seared through him his black fist clenched doubled hard and drew back the white target wavered like a leering pendulum before him it seemed like a time without beginning or end but it was only a second before his right fist raised ladened with the weight of his rage suddenly there was a weakness in his arm like a pressure was holding it back subconsciously restraining it making his arm not a part of him but a separate entity the fist shot out lightly grazing the fleshy white chin goddam black bastard the policeman roared he saw the cops gun handle raise in the air and pause for a blinding moment before he closed his eyes and waited to go down in darkness he awakened in the back room of tubbys on a hard dirty cot a cold towel was over his forehead and he felt the bandage behind his ear the pallid yellow naked bulb shone above him making him aware that he had entered the now you goin to be all right man tubby said soothingly standing above him face anxious that other cop grabbed his arm just in time to keep him from really knockin your brains out they didnt take me innaw they too scared i guess the skinny one said sumpin bout the chief wanting em to lay off crackin niggers heads for a while guess they scared we might start a riot he laughed a dim sound can you make it home by yourself ill call a cab gently he  removed the towel i can make it he shifted his legs over the side of the bed and ¥ with effort stood up groggily im ok aside from a pain in his head and the blood caking his lips making them heavy and swollen only thingonly thing i sure wished i had knocked the goddam pure white shit out of that motherfucker but he hadnt he hadnt or was it that he couldnt    a chilling helplessness invaded him blown by the winds of past ancient black futility he suddenly wanted to go home at home he didnt bother to wash he simply stepped out of his tattered clothes and got between the clean white sheets in his shorts it was early but seemed late to him it was early when she came home yet seemed late to him he closed his eyes when he heard her key pretending to be asleep his ears followed her movements from the living room to the bathroom where he heard the running water  the flushing of the toilet then her foot sounds in the soft mules coming into the room the bed dipped slightly as she slid in beside him he could smell the peppermint toothpaste and the avon cream she applied to her face at night as well as the faint odor of her perfume still clinging to her he wondered why it hadnt taken her as long as usual to go through her nightly rituals without opening his eyes he knew it was because she hadnt put her curlers onshe hadnt planted the garden rows of wires to make her hair bloom round soft ringlets in the morning he heard her turn over on her side and sigh soon she would be asleep listening to her steady breathing he thought she hadnt spoken to him or even tried to awaken him and talk with him she hadnt noticed the bloody bandage behind his ear or the cakey brown crust on his mouth it was as though he wasnt therewasnt there like the white policeman had actedlike he was nothing a nameless phantom to be pushed and cursed and ignored he was nothing at all absolutely nothing suddenly he opened his eyes to shout at her as the white policeman had at him make her notice him see himrealize he was there the darkness met his eyes first upon seeing it he felt inept frustrated in the mire of his thoughts somehow he knew she hadnt even bothered to turn on the light in the room at all simply undressed in the bathroom and followed her instinct around the darkened bedroom to the bed she hadnt wanted to see him anita he shouted sitting up angrily anita she stirred moving a little what is it claude the words were even estranged from him coming sleepy and muffled in her pillow he swallowed hard what was it what did he want to tell her about the eveninghis failure a failure because of a yet alive ageold fear of the white man still ghosting his black mind and making him ineffectual was that what had caused his abortive effort to strike back the way he really wanted to hard strong like a mannot a feeble man how were the nice white people he finally asked the question meaningless to him but it was an attempt a start for wasnt she there eating and drinking and laughing with them while others of them were beating him up oh god claude not tonight again im sleepy he moved closer to where she was lying with her back to him a perverse anger made him want to continue did you sneak out in the car with any of those faggot blonde boys whore always trying to get you in bed behind my back she did not answer her back and her silence a barrier to him they almost killed a white sonofabitch downtown tonight for that thingafter black women is that so and the police thought  was the one who did it now hear that he thought gleefully the police thought someone like him could do thatwas capable of defending his black women welldid you had he detected a note of sarcasm in her words the derision dipped over him like smoldering hot honey was it her cool contempt that made him feel she knew him too well i could have hummm with your black_power i suppose damnit anita look at me the words spewed out a belch of fire before he realized she couldnt look at him because of the darkness even if she did look there would only be the dark outline of him that was a man all right claude she murmured in exasperation turning towards him so a white man was half killed and i was involved the police beat me up in a bar the words were hesitantthe story not coherent puzzle pieces which he couldnt put together for her snatches of thoughts and actions left hanging in the air so whats so new about that the white mans been beating nigger heads since slave time and will still do it whenever they can get a chance it just happened that you were there at that time in that particular situation suddenly her voice softened claude im sorry are you hurt bad  she reached for the light on the bedstand but he stopped her he didnt want the light the light and its harshness would destroy the mood and the moment and turn his feelings inside out the sudden concern of her began to anger him but wasnt that what he had wanted her sympathy kindness the protective shelter of his black woman as all black men had wanted and gotten at some time whats there to be sorry about he snapped defensively were all going to get bloody fighting the system in the movement we expect those things welcome them roll with the punches and give out some too you dig me baby unhuh she yawned shifting back to her side of the bed to him the disdain was there in the mocking aloofness the ache in his head began again slowly intensifying the pain from the cut on his head he had been a buffoon all nighta black travesty beaten by what he was trying to beat destroyed by what he was trying to destroy and now he was being buked and scorned by what he imagined her to be all in one a black tribe of amazons towering in statuesque dominance over the black male pygmies stunted by the white mans nurturing the ache increased as pain and heated resentment flowed hotly through his loins the boiling blood caused his manhood to rise stiff and long the throbbing elongated maleness of him made him passionately aware again of what he was and of what he could do he could make babies like the white man he could and should make hundreds of babies to create an army to fight the white man hundreds of black babies to make the white mans milk black he could he was a man wasnt he uttering a harsh desperate cry his arms reached out to grab her to pull her savagely against him he wanted her to feel and know the strength of him the depth the height the power and the glory his bruised sore lips smashed against hers then tearing the flimsy material of her gown he covered her with his stink and beard anger and wretchedness he entered her before she was ready and was hardly conscious of what he was doing he heard and didnt hear her cries to cease for him to stop get up get off he had caught her by surprise she stiffened beneath him trying to close the entrance to her against him but he swelled and gloried in the battle that he fought now without gun or fistonly with the spear of him stabbing again and again into her until finally he felt her weaken and grow pliant under his warriorlike strokes to make her submissive to his will and strength and manhood he fought and fought marvelling at his staying power pridefully thinking he could go on and on like this all night but when he felt the moistness of her beginning to receive him bringing him into the hot deep well of her that claimed him now and made him feel caught and obliviously lost he realized the battle was over and in the end he cried out in triumphin defeat after a quivering moment that froze him he rolled off her breathing heavily expelling the last of his strength before he closed his eyes to give up to the tiredness he heard her say in a voice that made him know she knew it takes more than that to be a man then he thought he never wanted to awaken again
in a mirror a soul a twopart volume of poems richardson sister fabio has written two books of poetryboth of which are sarah webster fabio meaning a blkpoet and both about what is relative to blkpeople meaning the blkexperience of blkpeople the distinction sister fabio draws between the mirror and the soul is both heavy and finea combination of the visual and of the aural visually the book is in two parts with one part reversed no matter which side of the book is up aurally sister fabio has done a thing with the written languagewrites it to sound like we sound in her foreword she presents her whythe existence of a black mother tongue born out of necessity from a period where not only were blkpeoples bodies shackled their minds enslaved but their tongues were tied and then proclaims that this then is a bilingual if not trilingual volume   but back to the distinctionthe fine onethe distinction blurs somewhat for two reasons first there are poems in both sections which could comprise an intermediate section languagewise  poems such as a downhome recipe from a black soul mothers workshop my own thing artifacts from home free by any means necessary and formula for liberation second and perhaps primarily though sister fabio has done a thing she hasnt completely done a thanga direction in which our blkenglishteachers should move and i say this is primary because in coming short of a thang sister fabio defeats some of her purpose in having the book in two sections what actually happens is that where she writes the language so that it sounds like we sound for the most part there are a few exceptions she has not written it to look like we sound then we deal with the fact that most blkpeople reading from a written page tend to pronounce read english words using the english pronunciation patterns they have been taught likewhen we look at whipping we more often see and read whip  ing rather than whippin which is more often what we actually say or like the difference in your behind and yo behine or the actual difference in capturing and not capturing our blkspeech patterns in sightsound but for the poetry itself some of the poems are beautifully worked through the blkartist comes off strongartist here meaning blksister relevant to what we is the strongest ones and here strongest is not enoughmore most cutpungent ones are a longlongpome puzzle chronicled and artifacts from home some pieces of the puzzle    any day  now it might  as ed bullins  says could up and shit or at the least  its likely to  rain blood       darwin was a scientist  one of those fiends who hate  all manner of men except themselves       love  is a dirty fourletter word  of the longstanding joke  rigged with a white mans curse  thats your nigger baby       while goldwater feels people  smile at him now and say there  goes that queer is he right as  always in suing fact as a  distorter of his image       all the advertisements say it will be mothers day  this sunday in usa we should stay home and weep and some artifacts toovivid visual blackness    that rounded belly  oblong teat fulllipped  vessel of ebonyblooded  femininity       that warriorwhose upturned  honed heavyhanded spear  reflects a manhood booming  from cudgel and fullblown  penisis just too much    alright there are others which really stand out and hit like soul aint soul iswhich reviews our blkmusic    soul is  a rich trip  into the heart  of it all  into the heart  or righteous  life    my own thing which is a piece of beauty the hurt of it ah the elegy for matthew johnson    all make this book rich in what we is from the second coming her mirrorimages of two southern babes which are now gone firstof one  he grew in  black soillove  and fashioned this  into the juju of our  hopes and dreams   he who became  the lovemad saint     and then of the other one    lawgiver  ladya small fourletter  lewdity lain low  a loop of birdcrap  fashioning a lariat  to lynch liberty  love and life  i and from work it out shindig usa other mirrorimages    flower borne  they reel in a  kaleidoscope of  forms and hues  ssssteeled behind  big sounds twanged  from livid guitars  they moan shout  jerk twist bounce     and not knowing  if there is a proper stance  frantically and publically they  fidget in their  dance to ease  the terror  of the  unknowing a mirror a soul is sister fabios is ours is to be read cause she rights on johari amini jewel c latimore
