the impotent talk endlessly of power beyond talk we do nothing i do not trust fervor fer vor is the preferred weapon of the impotent we know who we are where we are were slaves caught in a world constructed against us we know what and where we wish we could be it would be good to live masters of our own selves in a world weve constructed to meet needs of our own the disaster of the black man lies in the fact that he was ensla ved but behind us our past has been an endless disaster our present is sheer impotence and ahead of us even fools have begun to see destruction  the black man has no ontological resistance  in the eyes of the white man overnight the black man has been giv  en two frames of reference within which he  has had to place himself his metaphysics or  less pretentiously his  customs and the sources on which they were  based were wiped out  because they were in conflict with a civiliza  tion that he did not know and that imposed j itself on him the catastrophic drift could be stopped if we could think clearly  about where we are decide where we want to be then act to move  ourselves from here to there but thought is difficult talk is easy decisive action is impossibly hard and talk is so beautifully cool thats why the hottest sou food is never in short supply its brand name is bullshit in a week of days we do our ordered bit to keep this white world going above us above our people weekends we meet to trade bold lies about our freedom lost and found our power lost and found our femininitv our mas mf  culinity whether they were ever lost before they were found above all we talk of our identity also lost and found anv boastful kind of talk just so long as it keeps us from having to look into the nausea the uselessness the impotence of these our lives at the risk of arousing the resentment of my colored brothers i will say that the black man is not a man our enslavers assure us weve been free these many years one of us looking far into this world were bound in and deep into his own soul came up with the truth another murderous white lie the white man in the capacity of master said to the negro from now on you are free we are not free we re not even able to achieve our humanity says fanon were damned souls aborted creatures suffering in hells created by white people to sustain their crass heaven the central fact of our lives the central statement in all of fanons work is simply this were slaves the black man is a toy in the white mans hands until weve looked hard at this fact not as a metaphor not as some poetic figure of speech but as a rockhard statement of what we are we cant even begin to understand fanon and without understanding him well never get where we need to go we may move without him but only blindly wasting energy if this coherence is not present there is only a blind will toward freedom with the terribly reactionary risks which it entails our enslavers have found a new sport these days they speak of our anger black rage is a marketable passion now slickly packaged after hot processing then advertized and hustled through exclusive middlemen a while back the going commodity was black nonviolence and the cats hustling that were priest priests not prophets prophthe settler keeps alive in the native anger which he deprives of outlet the native is trapped in the tight links of the chains of colonialism the natives muscular tension finds outlet regularly in bloodthirsty explosionsin tribal warfare in feuds between septs and in quarrels between individuals ets die lean railing against their peoples suffering fighting fate priests have always managed to live well off that suffering times have changed though our slavery hasnt a new breed of priests psychiatrists have sprung up not to live off the collective pain of whole congregations but to deal in individual suffering in all commercial privacy money continues to change hands from sufferer to soothsayer but now its not a collection its a fee in place of holy scriptures to keep the faithful good and blind there are profane scribblings aimed boldly at the marketplace offering the exciting experience of black suffering to enslavers so hardened they need this splashing in someone elses blood so they can feel alive in our haste to join the scramble for the gold they drop we have forgotten rage is not the disease not even the only symptom but one among an infinity of symptoms at their root not on the marketable surface lies the real sickness we are a people destroyed a conquered people conquest is a violent destructive happening it turns the conquered into broken pliable things objects upon which the conqueror acts handling shaping manipulating them  a manichean world fanon calls it strange new word but check it out it describes the universe we live in its a persian idea meaning a never ending conflict between light and dark the idea has a simple moronic appeal  light is good darkness is evil from this everything follows automatically whatever is light in color is morally good everything dark is bad its a perfect descrip tion of the kernel idea around which all white culture is constructed it is the primary idea white men have worked so aggressively and so long to impose on the entire world it is the governing rule of our slave lives today the most important effect of the success of this idea is this all white people are born with inherited advantages on which to construct their lives all black people are born with inherited disadvantages they must spend time overcoming if theyre to have any kind of existence at all life in this our world  is arranged with this main concern how whites can keep and increase their advantages and at the same time keep us so tied up in our disadvantages we cant do anything but suffer impotently this is the  tone of life wherever the dominant power is white in america latin  and anglo all over africa in those parts of asia still under white western power in australia that the original process of our conquest was violent and destructive we all know by now the destruction of africa the killing of our people the scattering of part across the earth to build a material heaven here for white christians and jews the rest remaining slaves in our homeland working to make  a better life for europeans we know of all that violence this european opulence is literally scandalous for it has been founded on slavery it has been nourished on with the blood of slaves and it comes directly from the soil and the subsoil of the underdeveloped world the wellbeing and the progress of europe have been built up with the sweat and the dead bodies of negroes arabs indians and the yellow races but after this first knowledge we risk a dangerous ignorance our conquest was not a momentary act of violence that staggered our ancestors alone and then was ended our conquest was only the beginning of an endless violence our present existence is this violence continued sharpened and refined institutionalized and made such a permanent part of our lives we often suffer it without being able to understand or even notice it were things not human beings we have dreams of the human beings we could become but this western world is built to crack our dreams and wishes to break us down till our best desires shrink and vanish to be replaced with the small mean hustling ways we use to survive personally from one slave day to the next at the risk of arousing the resentment of my colored brothers  will that the black man is not a man it is a world constructed to keep us slaves eternally this world in which our enslavers pursue their peculiar happinesses with such deadly ruthlessness and we learn to make adjustments to constant pain apartheid is not some sickness peculiar to the white south african soul it is the whitest most brilliant expression of western judeochristian values in africa wherever the word of white westerners is law life is arranged so white people experience it as a blessing and it hits us with the force of damnation whatever could not be molded to the shape of these their values white people in their attack on the world have simply killed south africa has a racist structure now i shall go farther and say that europe has a racist structure genocide is not a twentieth century german invention it is the root of white western values everywhere the exact basis on which white civilization rose here in north america in south america in australia in africa it is the prime method for keeping western values alive in vietnam today except the boers the americans are the only modern nation that within living memory has completely driven the autocthonous popula tion off the soil tha t it had occupied in this connection it is worth noting that the carbs experienced the same fate at the hands of french and spanish explorers and slavery isnt something we suffered accidentally and which white people stopped when they saw it was bad it is simply the destiny of all people living under white mans rule if weve grown up thinking apartheid was some special abomination in a far off place that genocide was one mad germans game and that slavery ended when some lying white man said it did its because white civilization lives on many kinds of violence and were victims of that special violence meant to kill the mind in this fanon was no exception bom in  on the small french west indian island of mar tinique he grew up in a world so messed up with white western values he didnt fully realize he was black until adulthood as a youth he was clearly convinced he was a frenchman his delusion of belonging in a white french society should not be strange to black people who still consider themselves americans fanon as a young man merely went along with certain assumptions we still consider normal the west indian does not think of himself as a black man he thinks of himself as a west indian the black man lives in africa so deeply did he believe these assumptions in fact that during world war ii when the germans conquered france fanon just seventeen and quite unaware of his own slavery went off to europe to fight in defense of french freedom  have remarked that certain things surprised me whenever there has been any attempt at insurrection the military authori  ties ha ve ordered only colored soldiers into action they were  tmen  of color who nullified the liberation efforts  of other t men of color the war apart from hastening his maturity generally brought him into contact with people and situations that filled his mind with questions provided him with a few answers and a multitude of hunches to work on the most important of these questions and answers came from his encounter with the reality of africa under european rule military service gave him a chance to observe western civilization in action as it affected the arabs of north africa west indians fighting on the french side and senegalese soldiers also in the french army later he was to remember wondering why the french were so concerned to indoctrinate arab africans against black africans and vice versa and why white officers always sent in black soldiers to kill other colonial peoples fighting for their freedom some ten years ago i was astonished to learn that the north africans despised men o f color it was absolutely impossible for me to make any contact with the local population i left africa and went back to france without ha ving fa thom ed the reason for this hostility with the end of the war fanon went back to france registering as a medical student at the university in lyon he had always been an intense kind of person and as he grew this quality did not disappear it got deeper realizing he lacked that cold steadiness of nerve he would have needed to be a surgeon he chose to specialize in clinical psychiatry he had no difficulty qualifying fanon who was not one of the breed of supernegroes who do fantastically well against black competition but are content to sink with a grateful sigh into mediocrity once they bump into whites his was an active intelligence that grew more alert when faced with aggressive whites instead of getting paralyzed life at the university in lyon seems to have been pleasant enough for fanon he did not suffer for lack of personal friends he married a french girl and answered suspicions that he was making a sick choice by declaring he was going into marriage with both eyes wide open the truth of that remains a private matter but its worth noting that his wife continues to live in algeria as a citizen it was she who in june  in response to the french philosopher jean paulsartres antiarab proisrael position after the israeli attack ordered sartres preface dropped from all subsequent printings of fanons most important book the wretched of the earth  wish to be acknowledged not as black but as white    who but a white woman could do this for me by loving me she proves t h a t i a m worthy of white love i
he nigerian civil war  nrl represents one of the j ii r most significant active symbols of the african strugge or a larger measure of self determination and unification of the exploited people of the nonwhite world being pursued today baldly stated the nigerian civil war represents the confrontation between the positive need for unity in the national politics of africa and the temptation to seek to continue the subservient status of the continent through the fragmentation of its parts the tragedy is that this confrontation is not as openly ideological in terms of white versus nonwhite interests in nigeria as it was in the congo but the fact is that at an even more profound level than in the congo this is the true nature of the forces that keep the nigerian civil war going the federal government of nigeria has waged a most benevolent war against the forces of division ever since  this is a fact that must not be lightly passed over i have worked in war zones for more than a year now and have been an eyewitness to the fantastic restraint of the federal troops what is happening is quite the opposite of naked howling savagery painted by secessionist propaganda had the surface quarrel that gave rise to the crisis remained the only issue in the war reconciliation might very well have been effected within a few short months of the start of the war but if we look back quickly on the way in which the crisis was brought into being we will discern that these deeper influences were at work every step of the way postindependence nigerian politics like postindependence politics in most of africa were largely controlled not by the desires of the masses but by the manipulations of foreign power politics and international economic interests in order to ensure the preservation of their interests the large powers with economic interests invested in the nation as well as those with economic prospects in view in the nation sought to woo and to win the allegiance of the nations rulers the pressures brought to bear on the leaders of the young nation in this way led to the inevitable result of alienation between the masses who were led and the leaders who were supposed to lead corruption and disregard of the basic democratic principles of political action became the norm one industrialist an englishman whose factory employed more than  nigerians in enugu before the war admitted to me that in the postindependence political era just before the crisis broke his benevolence exercised a measure of control over local politics according to how many jobs he would promise to certain supporters of certain candidates an oil executive a dutchman has told me that similar influence was wielded by his company in port harcourt while this syndrome which was widespread in the nation was not the only factor responsible for the breakdown of the democratic experience in the nation it is symbolic of the type of influence which foreign interests wielded in the political life of the nation at the same time the nigerian army was undergoing a process of change and growth having only been handed over to the full command of nigerians in  it must of course be remembered that african armies are for the most part inheritors of the colonial military tradition of oppression rather than protection the change to an army of protection and defense from that of an army of oppression must give rise to traumatic problems especially within the officer corps the army has to identify on a benevolent level with people whom in its initial stages it was employed to coerce thus when as a result of the machinations of the politicians who sought to remain in power by cultivating the support of the nations economic enemies the gulf between the nations people and its  leaders grow so wide that a full scale civil crisis was precipitated the young officers who saw in the ills of the nation the ills of their army sought to remedy both by attempting to eliminate in one stroke retrogressive elements in the military and political institutions in the nation tactical errors brought down the first attempt in january  the coup did not give rise to a government led by those who started it instead it had the effect of eliminating a sector of the political experience of the country without being able to replace it with the planned political alternative hence it soon became obvious after the january coup that the governmental direction forced upon the new leaders was for the most part directed by the sentiments of the coup leaders who were then in prison or in hiding and had no real basis in any long term decisions taken by the new leaders of course such a situation was bound to lead to dangerous ambiguities in the process of political existence and identity in the nation and in the struggle to grasp the very ideals of the men whose incarceration had brought them to power the new leaders especially the southern hierarchy led by major gen johnson ironsi seemed to be indifferent to some of the most blatant betrayals of those same ideals in the execution of the january coup the most tragic of these was the fact that owing to previously men tioned tactical errors the ibo political hierarchy was virtually untouched by the events of january  while the north west and midwest lost nearly all their most prominent and active leaders naturally the increasing trauma of tribal and intertribal suspicion raised by this situation was ripe field for the nations enemies they did not hesitate picking the lines of weakest division the foreign jackals moved in early they sought and in some cases found willing listeners in all sections of the country among the new leaders as well as among the people they concentrated particularly on the east and the north in the east they spoke of northern domination of the troop force of the army as a potential threat to the south in the north they spoke of eastern domination of the key posts in the officer grades in the army as being a continuation of the evils that should have been destroyed by the january coup what they were in fact doing was reading the already outlined ambiguities of the situation and heightening them along unnatural lines being fully aware that the new government was insecure in its directives because it was a government by default they felt that they could stave off the eventual correction of the january mistakes which would give rise to a truly national government working for the selfsufficiency of the community and against the continued ascendancy of external interests in the economic life of the nation tragically this trick worked to an extent and a line of suspicion was drawn between even the younger officers in the army the insensitivity of the ironsi regime to this problem was remarkable if the realities had been realised early enough and the ironsi hierarchy had been able and willing to take the drastic step of honoring the ideals of the young january coup leaders then the july mutiny would have been staved off but this did not happen the july mutiny however was the best thing that could have happened at that time because it succeeded again by default in placing the issues of division squarely before the nation ironically just as the january coup could be said to have failed so can the july mutiny be seen as a failure neither action resulted in its primary aim but remarkably the failure of the july mutiny seemed to give rise at last to a government that was prepared to honor the ideals of the first coup when major general yakabu gowon stepped in to quell the mutiny he did so with a full understanding of the native grievances of the mutineers for this reason he did not seek to berate them but rather to soothe their feelings and to promise that if given a chance he would head a national government that would seek to correct the grievances that they sought to eliminate by violence in a peaceful manner obviously such a promise was not in the best interests of the nations enemies and what is more the implied government would obviously be forced to review the basic causes of the alienation of the governed from the governing in an effort to heal the breach now it became necessary for the foreign interests who were the driving force behind the continuation of this alienation to step up their efforts to maintain a position of strength in nigeria by finding and supporting any internal movement that might promote division we can now only speculate on the reasons why this search bore greater fruit in the east under lt col odumegwu ojukwu than it did in the rest of the federation under major general gowon while both are young men one ojukwu had been openly contemptuous of the mutineers in july while the other as has already been pointed out was courageous enough to admit that native grievances existed but to express the opinion that such grievances could not be remedied by the method chosen it is therefore not surprising that ojukwu should have felt that his own stand which he was not prepared to change would not be popular within the framework of a reconstructed government that  based its premise of justification on the recognition of the verities inherent in the grievances exposed by the july mutiny thus it was that right from this point in an effort to gain some semblance of legitimacy for his own stand ojukwu found it necessary to overplay the essence of ethnic divisionalism present in the upheaval and to project this essence upon the national situation in such a way as to impress foreign groups with the hysteria of purported genocidal persecution given his peculiar histrionic and oratorical talents it is not surprising that he was highly successful but his success was also to a large measure predetermined by the fact that his stand suggested division and was therefore sympathetic to the dilemma of the foreign interveners whose interests were being threatened by nigerias thrust towards selfsufficiency at this point with the above outline as our guide we must examine the present state of affairs in the light of its internal shape and effect one of the first things that major general yakubu gowon tried to do was to bring about a reconciliation of the divisive forces within the army these efforts were supported at the highest level by the senior officers of every region except the east as a result a deadlock within the army developed and the last and most publicized attempt to break it was the aburi conference which took place in ghana in  it must be pointed out that this conference came after ojukwus highpowered drive to ethnicize the social problems of the nation in keeping with his july stand had culminated in the muchpublicized killing of several thousand people of both eastern and northern origins in the north and in the east thus it was that aburi which should have been a military conference was really a political confrontation however treating the crisis on the military level only enormous concessions were made to ojukwus stand it was agreed that for an undefined interim period troops would be confined to their regions of origin this might not seem in the best interests of the principle of unity in the nation but as has been said before major general gowon had pledged to settle the critical situation by methods of peace and he seemed prepared to compromise his own position of power even to achieve this however immediately after ojukwu returned to enugu he met with his advisers and some foreign sympathizers and announced that the stage was now set for the final thrust to division it now seems most likely that this remarkably insidious conclusion was prompted by the fact that even before deciding to go to the conference ojukwu had been in touch with his foreign backers and had been promised their unqualified support in the event of his deciding to pull out of the federation after this last ditch move it even seems likely that none of the western powers who were then observing the nigerian situation closely were sure that the degree of rapport reached between the different parties at that meeting could actually be reached ojukwu was aware of this and did everything he could at that meeting to maintain the state of deadlock when he was unsuccessful in this he found that the only chance of success for the force of division lay in ignoring the very points that he had won in the meeting and going ahead fullsteam towards his goal of a separate nation this surmise is borne out by the fact that his own eastern advisers were wary of his proposed trip to aburi feeling that just such a degree of rapport might be reached his trip to aburi was undertaken in an atmosphere of the closest secrecy even at the point of his departure from his regional capital enugu aburi was the greatest surprise that ojukwu and his foreign supporters ever had but it is interesting to note that the first signs of division in the ranks of his native advisers especially in the military forces appeared immediately after the aburi conference and culminated eventually in the death of two of the guiding lights of the original january coup major nzeogwu ibo who was the most idealistic and fearless initiator of the original effort in january was taken out of the jail in which he had been placed by major general ironsi and forced to lead secessionist soldiers at the early battlefront near nsukka there he made an attempt to escape from the rebel side into the nigerian lines but was shot by a nigerian sentry whose alertness played no truck with political ramifications to this day senior officers in the nigerian army lament this misfortune the other highly idealistic ibo officer major emmanuel ifeajuna who sought to effect reconciliation after the aburi conference was executed for his pains by col ojukwu in enugu in september  just before enugu was liberated by the federal troops but all this is a bit ahead of the sequence of events the nigerian developments following the aburi conference featured major general gowons repeated pleas for another conference to iron out whatever differences might have given foreign interests a loophole for influencing col ojukwu to ignore his most concrete gains furthermore the redeployment of troops according to their regions of origin was started but had to be halted when it became apparent that another clause of the agreement eschewing violence as a solution for the crisis was not apparently sufficiently engrained in the actions of and principles of the secessionist army commanded by ojukwu since they were then discovered to be involved in large arms deals through the agencies of such nations as portugal and south africa it was at this point that the lagos government led by major general yakubu gowon decided to turn its efforts to some of the more profound political decisions necessary to secure the future stability of a united nigeria the problem of minority ethnic groups seeking a measure of autonomy through the creation of separate states within a unified federation of states forming one united country had been for a long time one of the most pressing political problems in the nation as has been said before because of the insidious influence of foreign politics on the political life of the country prior to the military era this was one of the most vocal and visible symbols of the alienation between the masses who sought this type of unity and the politicians who sought to subjugate the labor and political forces represented by these demands in order to control the flow of foreign wealth stolen from the nation into their own pockets the federal government under major general gowon addressed itself to this problem with remarkable zeal and after a series of pulsating meetings in lagos it was decided that eight new states should be created in the nation bringing the total to  this had the effect of equalizing the ratio of mass representation on the councils of central government in the federation and thus ensuring the almost immediate elimination of domination from the top which ojukwu professed to fear however when the minority forces in his own region welcomed the lagos move ojukwu prodded openly by foreign backers refused to heed their demands for a rethinking of his position in the crisis and instead declared immediate secession from the federation thus coercing more than six million of the people under his nominal rule into a state of seige these are the facts of the start of the war and they form the basis of any true understanding of the present state of the crisis that of a benevolent civil war waged from a position of unity by the federal military government of nigeria and resisted from a position of division and neocolonialist support by the secessionists led by odumegwu ojukwu all that i have said so far is a prelude to the message that i wish to impart to all black activists on the side of the forces that seek selfsufficiency and consequent self determination for black men within the nonwhite community of this world we cannot in the light of the true political implications of this war afford to make decisions or utterances harmful to the cause of unity in this nation or helpful to the forces of division in it to do so will be to condone the intervention of our emotional and economic enemies in any internal and fraternal quarrel that we might have as i said at the start of my message the nigerian civil war is one of the most significant symbols of our struggle against such intervention today the secessionists have of necessity to seek such intervention in the form of socalled aid in this light ojukwu has addressed his wonderful sense of drama to dramatising the emotional issues involved and the ethnic divisions in the country in an effort to raise the bogey of genocide and starvation as his last ditch justification for promoting the division of this nation having impressed these lies upon the moral vanguard of the neocolonial forces through agencies of religion and relief he has succeeded in sustaining his rebellion by having arms and foreign currency procured for him by these white agencies under the pretext of carrying out humanitarian duties two examples of the way in which this is done will suffice to expose the true nature of the secessionist rebellion  since the socalled biafran currency is not negotiable by virture of lack of material solvency the secessionist regime obtains foreign exchange by having some of these white agencies pay the amount of money meant for the purchase of local foods into foreign banks the foods are then bought from the farmers in the rebel areas in nonnegotiable currency and given to the relief organizations  arms bought in switzerland france and the u s are flown to a central pool in lisbon from where they are flown by quota to sao tome a portugueseoccupied island off the nigerian coast out of which relief organizations flying to the rebel areas operate from there they are put into relief planes along with an equivalent weightload of relief materials to be flown to the rebel areas where such planes are not allowed to land unless radio signals from sao tome indicate that the proportion of weapons to food being carried is correct these are only two of several such devices employed by the rebel regime in pursuing its aim of perpetuating division in nigeria we cannot afford to lose sight of the fact that the nations engaged in ensuring the workability of such devices are nations dedicated to the external subservience of africa and the black race to their own burgeoning economic ascendancy i have written this as an appeal and explanation black brothers working in their various ways towards the ideal of unity and unit strength for our people in several parts of the world have written asking me to clarify for them my own relationship to this crisis in this black nation because i am here you black brothers have cited my earlier writings on the subject of black force black unity black love these are the issues at stake here and only the unity represented and pursued with benevolence and dignity by the federal government without pandering to foreign sentiments can achieve the forward movement of these issues in this crisis i can only hope that this small attempt at clarifying the position will convince you that i am working towards those same ideals that we have spent so long so much of our racial lives crying for the war is nearly ended today i work for the federal government in enugu i am involved in helping to repair the bruised feelings of ibos whose leadership betrayed them into this disaster from my vantage point i can swear by all that is sacred to our cause that the nigerian army works even harder at this than it does at the business of fighting a fraternal war notwithstanding the impression given by secessionist propaganda directed by european publicity experts and which panders to the popular european belief that all black actions are savage actions the area now held by the rebels is infinitesimal the two states in the east which were created out of the minority areas there are completely free of the secessionist army reality and reason demand that in these lights those of us who are africans born outside of africa should now address all our efforts and selves to supporting nigerias cause the unity of blackness and the dignity of man wherever we are whenever we can
i have lived in both worlds black and £ white north and  south i lived in bedfordstuyvesant in brooklyn in watts in the detroitinner city and worked as a secretary in a variety of law offices usually temporary jobs which covered a great deal of law as it is practiced now after living in ann arbor for two years and becoming somewhat acquainted with the intellectual elite of michigan i am convinced that the perception gap is a fundamental factor in the racial crisis making it impossible for wellmeaning whites to begin to cope with problems which we all now realize are decisive for our future there are i think two fundamental causes for the perception gap first of all it is difficult for is very foreign to their own experience they tend to project the framework of their own thinking and experience to the life situation of other people and cannot perceive a world which is very different from their own second people tend not to perceive things which are very unpleasant upsetting and undermining to their security to understand to even state the extent and forms of exploitation to which blacks are subjected in this country involves perceiving a very unflattering picture of the state of the nation given this perception gap much of what is said about the racial crisis brilliant as it may be in terms of internal logic even when it is sincere rather than manipulative is alienated from reality and many of the programs funded expensive as they may be solve nothing the unconscious assumption behind these programs is a liberal illusion the liberal assumes that his own wealth and status is due to his virtues rather than to his privileges and from this false assumption flows his solution to the crisis remake blacks so that they become as much like whites as possible like god making man in his own image these efforts produce a thin stream of verbose aggressive efficient automatons who are placed at certain points in the structure where it is convenient to show a black face the cost of buying off militants goes up otherwise nothing changes the problem is whites even  scholarsexperts on the race crisiscannot admit to themselves a simple fact which every poor black knowshas to know from daily if not hourly experience blacks are pushed to the wall because the black community is ruthlessly exploited by parasitic elements in the white community through legal semilegal and illegal means and these parasitic elements are bolstered and protected by the institutions of our society generally whatever is corrupt in the united states is multiplied and magnified to the point of grotesqueness in the black community what the french historian francois chevalier calls the law of the strong operates because blacks lack wealth power and influence they are least able to defend themselves the crucial problem is to pinpoint the legal and illegal mechanisms by which the black community is exploited and to destroy them thereby bringing about an essential redistribution of wealth and power in favor of the black community at the expense of the parasitic elements in the white community much can be accomplished through direct community action many changes are beyond the control of the black community and involve changes in local state and federal laws dealing with for example credit insurance taxation appropriations health and welfare crime and punishment as well as changes in the structures of municipal government i will briefly outline several of these parasitic mechanisms and make proposals for their destruction credit a prime target of the detroit riot was the easy credit store especially the furniture store aside from looting and arson notes of indebtedness were searched out and destroyed by the rioters the credit problem is agonizing blacks have great difficulty getting credit when they get it they pay huge interest rates usury laws do not apply to consumer credit stores which offer credit to blacks stock highpriced shoddy goods for which they deny responsibility once the contract is signed aside from consumer credit finance companies pawn shops and illegal loan sharks who collect with the gun charge escalating interest rates if pawned articles are lost or stolen the pawn shop is not legally responsible in a city like detroit where there are a handful of big employers workers live in a state of urban peonage working endless hours in a vain effort to stay on top of a hopeless accumulation of debts collection practices are barbaric collection agencies harass workers at their places of employment threatening their jobs in most states including michigan a workers wage can be seized for debt this practice is called wage garnishment at most places of employment including the auto plants a worker loses his job and is blacklisted if his wages are attached twice i would suggest a fourpronged attack on the credit problem  legally restrict interest rates in consumer credit  license and inspect the practices of stores doing business in the black community revoking their license for overcharging and denying responsibility for defective goods  restrict collection practices outlaw wage garnishment make it illegal for a creditor or collection agency to harass a worker at his place of employment make it illegal to fire a worker for nonpayment of debts  make lowinterest or interestfree loans available on the basis of need through government funds credit record or the filing of personal bankruptcy would be irrelevant to obtainina such loans imprisonment for debt when i was working for a law office in detroit a black factory worker came in with summonses to appear at the same time before two different judges on nonsupport charges for two illegitimate children in detroit an illegitimate child costs the father  a month minimum and a legitimate child  obviously one of the reasons for the high illegitimacy rate this man also had a wife and two children by her his story was six months before he had been working obediently in a factory when he was arrested for failing to pay traffic tickets since he could not pay them he was imprisoned for  days he lost his job because he went to jail and had been unemployed for several months he had recently found another job but meanwhile he had fallen behind in his child support payments the lawyer asked him how much money he had he had  but he left it with his wife to buy groceries in case he went back to jail the lawyer wouldnt take his case because he had no fee to give him this story illustrates a problem we have debtors prisons in this country full of mostly black men who are unable to pay their way out perhaps it is reasonable to put a man in jail if he is able to support his children and refuses to do so but to present a poor man with the choice money or jail when he has no money is barbaric i propose  a sliding scale for traffic tickets so that the amount paid for each offense is in proportion to income fines should be minimal for people with low incomes  end all forms of imprisonment for debt  make the amount of bail bonds proportionate to incomehousing i would like to tell you about my own experience withhousing in detroit i moved into a furnished apartment which i rented by the week in a slum neighborhood on the east side the outside doors were badly hung from the frames and they would not close the wind blew snow into the apartment the wiring was so bad that if you touched the walls you got a shock waste water backed up into the kitchen sink when i complained to the health department the response was unless it is unsafe or unsanitary we cant do anything about it the landlord made a habit of coming into the apartment while i was working and abusing my son pulling the plug out of the refrigerator and doing other presumptuous things after he pushed my son down the steps one day i went to the police station to complain the police had to ascertain my social standing before they knew how to respond the first thing they asked was what kind of apartment i lived in the address whether it was furnished or unfurnished and if i paid by the week or by the month since it was furnished and i paid by the week that meant i had no rights at all they treated my complaint like a big joke and said its his building he has a right to do whatever he wants in it because i complained about conditions in the building my rent was substantially increased and i was given an eviction notice home ownership in itself is no solution once again the real estate racketeers create an expensive restricted market for blacks to buy homes then they profit again from barbaric practices when it comes to financing the purchase of a home i will cite my experience working in a real estate office in bedfordstuyvesant these brokers were buying very old dilapidated houses for about  cash they made no repairs they just smeared cheap paint and laid cheap linoleum down then they arranged a discounted first mortgage from the bank for substantially more than the original purchase price they had already made a good profit then they sold the house with the first mortgage from the bank collected a down payment of  to  and put a second mortgage which the real estate brokers held of  to  the purchasers were paying   to  for the houses payments came to around  a month which involved several members of the family slaving for years at lowpaying jobs to meet these payments and the homeowners are then at the mercy of crooked housing inspectors home improvement racketeers etc etc i remember an old lady who made her living scrubbing floors who came in apologetically to make the payment on the second mortgage she was two days late because she had been sick the real estate agent put his arm around her shoulder and patted her saying thats all right granny we knew you would pay my proposals are  outlaw real estate agencies and brokers  home improvement and construction companies should be carefully licensed legal fees scheduled work inspected for quality and home improvements financed at low interest rates through antipoverty funds criminal penalties for fraud in home improvements should be enacted  apartment houses should be transferred from private ownership to cooperative ownership with individual titles to apartments allowing the occupants to deduct interest payments from their federal income tax  low interest loans for purchasing homes with no down payment should be made available according to need rather than to credit standing the object is to eliminate private landlords real estate brokers and home improvement racketeers schools there are battles going on now especially in bedfordstuyvesant over community control of the schools let me explain to you once more from my own experience why i strongly favor dismantling the big city bureaucratic control over the school system and placing control in the hands of the community my son went to the fourth grade at a public school in detroit that was quite a school the children were not allowed to play on the playground since it was used as a parking lot for the teachers cars the patrol boys and girls were required to report their friends for playing on the playground one of the teachers was shaking down the kids for money he was furnished with indigent supplies for kids who couldnt afford them which the children had to buy from him for  a day or they got a grade of zero the principal would not allow the children to bring their own supplies to class because she thought it was not neat for children to walk down the hallways carrying school supplies thus the teacher shook down the kids the big kids shook down the little kids the little kids shoplifted to get money etc etc the teachers maintained order by hitting the kids with a wooden paddle my son does not believe that his teachers have a right to hit him and when he was threatened with a beating he stayed home i got a call from the truant officer  told him the whole story about the school and he got very agitated and said things like oh so you dont like the detroit public schools and ive worked in this neighborhood for years and no one has ever complained to me about the school and menacingly those are very serious charges even coming from children and if i were you i would complain to the school board i explained that i already had also that  was moving out of the neighborhood because of the impossible conditions in the school he insisted that i tell him where  was moving to and what school my son would be going to i declined to furnish that information the response of the principal was no child has ever been mistreated in this school they are all perfect nothing is ever wrong and if you complain you might get locked up or have your kid locked up after the july  insurrection we drove past the school hoping it had burned down the teachers cars were still parked on the playground the signs saying no ball playing allowed were still up the only change was the fence was about ten feet higher to keep the kids in during class time and to stop them from destroying the school after school hours
in his third book of poems dont cry £ scream brother don vs d lee urges us to know nothing less than the real enemy the real enemy one way to really appreciate what a lifesaver this kind of knowledge can be is simply to ask the question what could serve us as a blacker test for recognizing our real leaders our real sources of information insightselfassessment and direction we as black people cannot pay enough real tribute enough real attention to our real black leaders for the seriousness with which we check them out as well as preserve and keep them on our course is a clear measure of the seriousness with which we take ourselves and our efforts as a people to get out of this white prison were in the story of the games the real enemy runs on us to separate us from our own strength is not a very bad way to check out our real history in this place and furthermore nothing reflects the story of the need for solidarity more vividly than the story of black writers black literary history is loud and endless with scenes of brothers and sisters stripping each other of their arms while at war with the real enemy i saw this suicidal conflict in a very dramatic and instructive context just this past semester among black students in my english composition and literature classes at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee the two black warriors who got stripped were marvin x and jimmie garrett their plays take care of business and and we own the night the vitally black liberation lessons to be learned from them both were lost in the fury of a loud and false dispute which of the two plays was revolutionary that both were and continue to be was an answer that was quickly lost on most lord the warriors argued each other down and really went into an act ripping and slashing and nearly trampling all over the varying substance for black salvation which they should have been gathering and cherishing and recultivating towards their own black growth and their own black awareness what was lost is the simple fact that both writers are revolutionary because they are deadly serious about black unity both were looking at some of the major things that work against the efforts to keep black families together the chief conflicts concerning father and son and mother and son marvin x looks at the disastrous consequences of such a split while garrett examines one of the primary causes a white set of values joe simmons and his father never talked to one another about anythingnot even sports by the end of the play he is determined never to make that fatal mistake with his own children in garretts play johnny had to fight his mothers worship of whites at home as well as the real enemys police forces in the streets where he dies with the pale knowledge that his own mother was incapable of looking upon him her own sonor any other black manas a man now these black playwrights and their plays constitute a sort of revolutionary teamwork a very  crucial and singular division of labor and what confused many of my students about the revolutionary nature of both plays was their preference for one form of revolution physical combat over another and less spectacular form they mistook the least visible for the least real but while its true that johnny and lil t and the rest of the brothers pitted body against body arm against arm concrete weapon against the government weapons of the cops they were just as concerned just as determined to pit their consciousness against the white consciousness of people like johnnys mother the acquiring of a black sense of purpose is the real rebel featured in marvin xs work though the primary business which joe simmons takes care of is the achievement of a new sense of duty as a black son and potential father he and his running buddy wes also take on the cops who nearly ran them down and over after a party we witness two different kinds of resistance at work both of which are seen as necessary to our black survival brother marvin isnt offering us both only to have us choose one the bargain is simply three black lessons for the price of two he isnt saying choose but see check out the connection between the arm that resists and the consciousness that resists black liberation depends finally on black commitment which in turn depends on black consciousness on black understanding understanding depends on knowledge or information which in turn depends on communication especially communication of the information that can only be transmitted from the old to the young remember joes problem he didnt dig his old man enough to speak to him there are times when i cant speak a positive word for eldridge cleaver especially whenever i recall the game i caught him running on readers which means us in an uncommonly vicious assault on james baldwin you need only open soul on ice to see what i mean there are a number of other places in that remarkable book where the real enemy rules supreme by using brother cleaver as a tool for cutting down the informationpacked lifeline connecting us to the thirties and forties of richard wright and chester himes and langston hughes the forties and fifties and early sixties of gwendolyn brooks and baldwin and malcolm_x instead were hooked up with some fantasy place were hooked up to dim twisted confuseblackpeople words featured in such pieces as the primary mitosis and convalescence and to some extent the white race and its heroes these are for the most part tributes to dream to wishful or incoherent thinking in a book that is otherwise notable as much for the downtoearth clarity of cleavers views as for his stunning language even though on first reading cleaver struck me in the main as the most incredible stylist since baldwin and jones the fact that his ideas were also an extension and elaboration of theirs was not altogether lost on me for instance much of the burden of soul on ice is given over to the conviction that american society is run by intricate lie machines on every level of public life intricate lie machines that produce deliberate confusion among the people here we have at least the sound black forehead of a sound black leader coming into view of course the suggestion that there are talents that precede cleavers talents that elaborate positions cleaver himself is able to stand and build on would be pretty hard to find in a piece like his notes on a native son his description of himself as one of a generation of baldwin readers like myself is truly an absolutely hypnotic tribute to baldwin his picture of him as a wright reader as a person who actually knew wright personally in the late forties when he was going through his own early paces as a writer is another affair this connection between the two so alive with lessons for anyone concerned with the inevitable writergeneration gap is in cleavers hands simply unrecognizablewhen it is present he doesnt depict these two writers as significant steps in a common thrust but as two detachable halves of the moon we are to use only one half of their combined light here take the wright side just throw baldwin and his perfumed prose over the shaky bridge into the watery darkness where rufus floats right where he done got drowneded and in another country at that but we want both brother cause both belong to us every bit as much as you cleaver do and allah would never forgive us for accepting such a selfcrippling selfblinding bargaineven from a brother don l lee had told me about cleavers article on baldwin long before i ever heard of the brother probably before i even heard of ramparts i had checked out calvin herntons double job on baldwin though in his white papers for white americans so by the time soul on ice came out i was ready to go into my act the result was a piece called incest for brothers this defense of baldwin though deadly earnest was no starched sheetpulling exercise it was a whole lot of writers fun it was one of the most liberating experiences ive ever gone through as a writer it was a real breakthrough for in order to bring my rescue plot off i had to break away from things i admired most about the baldwin essay for my purposes the finely graded sense and elaboration of the baldwin sentence just wouldnt do only cleavers own surrealistic sweeps would work so i took cleavers name calling attack as my rescue model as i tried to indicate before the stunning defiant verbal acrobatics of the cleaver style were not lost on a styleconscious dude like myself baldwins best qualities are based in large part on controlled utterance on the precise and exact elaboration of an idea or sentiment while the panther brothers sweep comes in part from the flair and very earthy resources of a brother jumping bad i also anticipated the incorrectness of the current dictum among the panthers which holds that fire cant be fought with fire that you have to use water to put it out no good i understood part of my mission using just the opposite principle baldwins mode of clarity would not work would not penetrate the lively but hysterical nonsense that paraded through cleaver and hemtons makebelieve but deadly play at critical analysis the only precise way to handle those shapeless semifreudian puddings was to resort to a farce of my own what does a baldwinite know about farce i knew what mrs rothenberg my cool advanced expository writing teacher taught me only a few months before reading cleaver she introduced be to mr jonathan swift and what did she hip me to about that irish cat why the use of what white english departments call a persona jesse b simple is a black persona a bar i stool philosopher a real character invented by brother langston  hughes as a fabulous mouthpiece who were the makebelieve characters i invented to reply to cleaver and hemton why brothers eldridge and calvin along with uncle richard and father baldwin though i was offended by the namecalling tactics of the two brothers that wasnt the point of my dispute with them what truly angered me was this if youre going to write about another brother especially writers like wright and baldwin why not do so in a way that makes theour lifeline between them and us more clear not more pale more visible not deliberately hidden and more secure not shaky we are a desperate people and when you disguise the nearest exit the clearest way out youre not only being frivolous youre being a real black criminal black leaders not only need to be recognized by black people and celebrated they also need to be taken seriously once theyre spotted they need for their own collective welfare to be looked at and listened to ruthlessly close we cant afford anymore never could white divide and conquer bargains if cleaver cant help us toward the most rigorous selfexamination and selfcriticism when he opens his mouth to us as a writer then we have every right to view his mouth as a weapon turned against his own people now since baldwin is quite a veteran of disaster a man like cleaver himself and huey newton who has known very precious few survivors in this place the presumption never entered my mind that i was defending baldwin he can look after himself well enough a little panther namecalling or a lot shouldnt shake him too much harm it is we the people who have been turned upon and messed with who dont need our vision tampered with but expanded and deepened enlarged in the same way as is the case when reading cleavers lazarus come forth or on becoming or  the christ and his teachings we are a desperate people looking for a way out of this prisonplace and nobody knows this better than brother cleaver himself we need our black artists to help us see ourselves see where we are where weve been where were headed baldwin no less than cleaver can show us this we need both and then some we need to see baldwins real weaknesses in order to see our own just as we need desperately to dig his real strengths and our own its a white game to discuss a black artist with the purpose of disguising and discrediting what hes really saying and we expect white lie machines like the whole white mass miscommunications networks including white publications to misuse and mangle the clear black voices that are saying things the black minds that are organizing things for our mutual benefit but can we afford to take the works of our own less than seriously look at them without raising real questions and real issues can we afford the game of pitting our joe simmons against our johnnys who would deny that we need to dig the issues and dilemmas the marvin xs and jimmie garretts create for them and us so that we can check out how theyre dealt with or not dealt with since the plight upon a black stage is simply our own beyond racism by whitney m young jr mcgrawhill book company  is a curious book for two reasons first a heavy despairing hand wrote it it unfolds all of the brutalizing horrors of the black ghetto in cold sparse prose that seems to float somewhere between frigid clinical accounts and terse newspaper reporting mr young documents the hell of the young black child presents convincing data and details on the miseducation of black youth and simply lays before the reader the black mans political emasculation and economic exploitation these are harsh words how much more bitter are the lives that these words describe yet the black mans story is being told every day in every medium and in every kind of voice ranging from violent hysterical bellowstorn from the bowelsto the cold statement of fact and appeal to reason mr young chose the latter to make his point perhaps that is what is frightening about his book hp seems to be delivering the benediction in a way the final act is really over no it hasnt been lived but we all know it by heart and when we hear whitney young saying unless we can devise ways to admit black people to full participation in the social political and economic life of the larger society the bitterness and despair of the impoverished black masses will bring about the destruction of the cities we know down deep we fear when we close our eyes we see our cities settling into waste lands but black folks are indeed a strong people they are a people that survived  years of criminal oppression  we arise daring to hope the second curious aspect of this book is that it has a profound yet subtle and contagious hope in its lean lines ive never been so aware of both emotions in reading a book he quotes frederick douglass and raises pride and hope for in douglass we see the black mans complicity in his own hell and his salvation if there is no struggle there is no progress those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground they want rain without thunder and lightning    find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both item by item area by area whitney covers them all from education to employment from police brutality to discrimination in housing and with the innocence of the youth of today he proposes he tells america what it can do to right its wrongs many of the proposals i have discussed arc practical ones which could be implemented tomorrow if america really wanted to use its resources in a rational manner to create an open society these are embarrassingly naive words they are uttered in simple honesty and seemingly with a simple faith whitney young sweeps me along with his quaint openness i say yes it really could if it wanted to yes if america wanted to and here lies the rub the jaded soul suspects the worst the despair and hope that spring from beyond racism reveals a great deal about mr young and perhaps a little about the black spirit the justified castigation and utter condemnation of america by blacks are matched with a deep faith by them that the american society can become an open one extending to all the economic educational and social opportunities now set beyond the prospects of most blacks if a revolutionary lacks this faith then he is confronted with alternatives that should lead him to a foreign land since there is little chance for a real revolution of flesh blood and steel here without a doubt the most militant revolutionaries will adamantly deny this faith but find themselves hard pressed to explain what all of their violent words are about and minor defensive actions forecast if not a faith that by some shout words and shock america can find its way to make good at long last on a promise it made to oppressed peoples this blend of despair and hope are what make mr youngs book a curious offering perhaps the black mans faith in america may be the faith by which america saves herself in addition to faith the author has a straightforward message he wants america to develop an open society a vision of an america that glories in diversity and respects the unique contributions and traditions of all of its people the open society will unite whites and blacks in true equality banish poverty rebuild the cities in greatness and he has practical suggestions for accomplishing these goals community control is suggested as one step toward rebuilding black communities the argument is persuasive certainly the evidence seems quite clear that black people are less tolerant with extremists than whites community control is nothing new most white suburban communities control and direct their local school systems and it is considered a good thing the argument that community control will perpetuate segregation is brushed aside for the ghetto has never known integration in the first place besides it is deeply dishonest to criticize community control solely because blacks want to accept a white decision not to integrate and extract from it the power and benefits that come from controlling ones schools economics and politics but again all of this logic tells just one thing the issue has never been community control the issue is racism mr young wants the highest level of government involved in the effort to habilitate america he suggests the appointment of an executive vice president for domestic development concerned with the poor and the plight of the cities it would be the responsibility of the executive vicepresident to coordinate a national effort to rid the land of poverty and to rebuild our dead cities hopefully the working poor the aged and the unemployed poor would be provided with economic security local state employment services would be transformed into national computer
she kept on rereading the letter stop runp ning even nonthink ing animals stop «£iicv  v u running you have a capable mind stop running before you are destroyed a tear trickled down her cheek why had he decided to write a letter instead of talking she looked at the letter you doubted your parents teachings but you would not question them instead you exiled yourself to europe you doubted europes humanism you doubted western values but you were afraid to question history so you exiled yourself into negritude you stopped straightening your hair and started raving about egyptian civilizations songhai empires and zulu warriors of old but that was still running you are afraid to assume responsibility sometimes you try to sound worldly and cold do what you have to do that is what people do you are wrong people do what they want to do you cannot do what you want to do you are afraid    and it was not the first time that he had been critical of her ways since they had met a few years and many disagreements ago they had met at a mutual friends house the snow outside had dared them to leave as warmly dressed as they were and the snow had won the battle because hadnt they decided to stay until it had subsided and then they could freeze their way home in the slosh without having to cope with the sleet he had sipped drink after drink and she had not seemed to drink much of anythingnot even water they would talk for a while then he would go over to the window and look at the snow then get back to his drink and shake his head a little as if he were in deep thought it was after one of those trips from the window that he had said but the tide wont subside you cant sidestep so rage and blaze they burnt the mask and left the hue blue after the red blaze so with the mask gone we dance and laugh less and less and the world is blue but you cant stay blue though nor sing the blues any more she had wondered if he were slightly insane this young man talking like some kind of mystic as he talked more and more seemingly more to himself than to her or the other woman she had felt uneasy particularly if he looked at her but then again she had thought whatever he looked at he didnt seem to see he seemed to be looking way beyond it he had gone to the window again then came back and said it has subsided now ill see you home if you dont mind he had paused for a while then addressed his drink as usual young lady your little bottoms up before we leave the two women had tried in vain to suppress their almost embarrassed smiles it was cold and sloshy outside when he hailed a taxi she had wondered if she was doing the wisest thing by letting him see her home she wanted to be with him because she was intrigued by the way he talked but she was at the same time afraid to be with him because she thought he might be insane and if he were there was no telling what he might do for no reason she was conscious of she believed there was warmness and a kindness about him while this was going on in her mind a taxi stopped for them and when he opened the door of the car she just went in as though she were doing something she had no control over very much like ones actions or behavior in a dream he went in after her and started talking you know the best thing youve got going for you is that you have not lost your mask but it is walled in now she believed more and more that he was more than likely insane what is this mask thing you keep talking about thats what im talking about you dont know it because you have been taught not to but why do you think you do some of the things you do for instance here you are  you do not really know if you should let me see you home or not you are afraid of me and you are not afraid of me your better judgment tells you not to do it but in spite of that for whatever reason you have let me see you home how do you  i mean    unh    it is written all over your face again she wondered she was quiet for a while she wondered if he had some power some kind of extraordinary sense of perception which enabled him to see things going on in her mind without her saying them where are you from she asked him and she wondered why she had asked the question sun valley he said sun valley seemingly more as a reflection than as an answer to her question a long time ago your tribe did too thats where your mask comes from the sun still shines over the valley but most of the masks are obsolete or veiled and chaos and confusion abound in and around the people the taxi stopped at her address she realized at this point that she wished the ride had been longer if he was insane in some kind of way she thought there was some sort of method or order to it he scribbled his telephone number and gave it to her thats in case you want to call me some day  the taxi took off to take him home he has some nerve she had thought what made him think she would want to call him but she didnt throw away his number the following day it snowed some more then it stopped and the temperature plummeted to below zero a wind arose and raged and howled in the streets and the citizenry for the next few days like an army losing morale retreated more and more indoors in the daytime the sun went on its way across the city like a teasing woman indiscriminately exposing herself but not yielding to anyone and balese kept thinking about reaitse particularly when she looked at the sun that gave off no heat was he somewhere looking out some window what would he be saying about the sun in that weird way he talked she wanted to hear him talk she called him i hope he doesnt think l would be interested in dating him or any nonsense like that she thought as she dialed his number hello  unh  reaitse this is balese we met at yea i know im glad you called i was just thinking about you and    o damn she thought he does have some silly notions after all he must think hes got a good line talking all that weird abstract nonsense o unh    you know i was calling to thank you for taking me home the other night yea yea i know that but like i was saying i was just thinking about you and the imprisonment of the mask in the name of some silly god who doesnt even have respect for life you are a funny man sometimes    but the world is even funnier he went on talking he told her how in sun valley centuries ago the people had used masks to study human nature the mask was never a reproduction of the human face in the mask the face was transfigured to enable men to delve deeper into inner man in their language also the people never spoke directly about a thing they spoke around it so that it stood out more clearly then some day another tribe had come in from the sea at first the sun valleyians had thought these people might be some gods or ghosts and they had given them food and presents to make them feel at home as it was customary to treat peaceful strangers or to make peace with them should they be some angry gods or ghosts systematically the strangers from the sea had destroyed the ways of the people of the valley they had imposed their gods and their traditions on the people of sun valley they had cut up the land as they pleased deposed the kings of the valley and held the sun valleyians in bondage and now we laugh less and less he said finally and you do not even have memories of tales told by the fireside then she had known he was not insane but why the hell couldnt he talk straight about things    talking like hes telling some fairy tale to some little child like that the conversation had gone on much longer than she had imagined it would she was somewhat puzzled and happy when she found him conversant with whatever she brought up for conversation they planned to get together in a few days and they did for the next few weeks they saw each other often mutual attraction developed between them or they grew into it they loved each otherthey felt and believed crazy woman hed think about her some day we might even get married months later they moved in together planning to get married they enjoyed each others company and had no significant disagreeable arguments that is until the day he told her they were almost complete strangers because she was perhaps unwilling to demolish the walls in which she was imprisoned are you high she had giggled thinking he was not serious no im low mama and the world is a blue mess im not your mother yea your biggest problem is that you are not anythings mother you do not even mother your ideas or mode of living whats that got to do with us being strangers the walls around you and the shadows prevent you from seeing anything as it really is including you you are not even in love with me you are in love with what you think i ama necessary distortion because you see me through the eyes of some woman you dont even know nor understand through the eyes of everything that denies the validity of your very existence you must be out of your mind she tried to control the flow of anger churning in her the problem with you is that you are so afraid you always settle for the most convenient answer and if there is no convenient answer you run like i said before you must be out of your stupid mind you see thats what i mean you even use anger as a means to run away but look  acceptance    thats where it has to start no    not anger acceptance you have to realize and accept that most of the things you learned before we met the complex set of symbols you use to perceive the worldwere an attempt to bury you if you could look at it without pitying yourself and accept it then vomit the crap wed be getting into something thats what i mean when i tell you to break down those silly walls and unveil your mask because that other mask you wear every morning is a lie you smear all that junk on you to hide the real you its not the  smear thats in question its the implications of the thing and when i point that out you rage or call me insane and she raged too this time more than she had ever raged before she raged so much that she left and rented a room at the ywca sleep teased her but would not come to her bed that night not only was she still exasperated she had not slept in any bed without reaitse in quite a while for the first time in her life she could hear the eerie stillness of the night when the city was asleep finally as the sun approached the eastern horizon pushing the dawn before her balese fell asleep regret accompanied reaitse that night and anguish sneered at his mind accompanied by drops of despair threatening to engulf and occupy his heart but no tears son dont cry he mused worlds full of stale tears and pain and those havent solved a single problem yet no balese i am not at wor with you all im saying is when you mistake artificial light for sunshine you are in danger woman and woeeternal unity of opposites you do not try to shut your eyes to the existence of things balese whatever things unless you want to dig your own grave i know your heart wants to strive but the walls but how expect me to watch you sinking low even in goldplated mud and just let you go when things dont jive together when you cant dance and even the air sticks a poisoned finger at your song it is time to create new wombs for a rebirth and come bursting out on the other side of time dancing laughter out the wilderness he couldnt fall asleep at the break of day he went to the beach he had always loved to watch the unrestrained movement of the waves as they leapt to caress the rocks this time he could not bear it they made him miss balese even more he went back home as the city was beginning to bustle deaf to the noise of man and machine balese woke up too late to go work but she really didnt care she hadnt planned to go anyway she called at work to report she wasnt feeling well after a quick shower she went out for a cup of coffee she was no longer angry at reaitse she thought about how happy they were together most of the time and when they were happy he was oceans of fun she smiled to herself remembering a conversation some day they had been discussing their immediatefuture plans when hed said some day ill take off to the sun with my son he loves to play with the sun how come he believes hes a god like the sun what are you not telling me do you have a son or something every day gives birth to him i see him in your eyes too youre a funny man sometimes she went back to the ywca and called reaitse hello lostandfound he teased her the words pulsed with a monumental love and she knew it he didnt wait for her to ask any questions baby let me try to explain a few things we live in a filthy world when that comes up to the surface and you see it it shakes up your inner stability because you dont want to accept that it is really that filthy im not coming back then i think you should wait and check things out thoroughly before you take a plunge like that you might regret it you might not be very happy why would i not be happy after taking the plunge why is die plunge not happiness when the filth of the world is not immediate you are happy happiness meaning what relative amount of enjoyment of life or existence out of becoming aware of things in the world you mean more than that what kind of happiness then well lets see    explained by the absence of other things at midnight dying to get home instead of some hotel by yourself giggling and fooling around like a baby thinking of things that are not frustrating what ever do i think of that is not frustrating a number of things as simple as for instance looking forward to a vacation but is that happiness   only because you are there its not always things but    ideas    your ideas concerning certain people even me you how my presence physically or in your mind how physical sexual no just being at the same place at the same time doing what doing nothing isnt that sexual if you want to limit it to that but i thought it was much more than that ill be right home she felt so much stronger than she could remember ever having felt before she didnt know why or how but this conversation had left her feeling strong enough to do anything she desired to do and right now her number one desire was to be with reaitse she had left the ywca and gone home to reaitse never again to leave because of a disagreement they were married a few months later and they could say they were happy and they would not be telling a lie occasional disagreements were there but then whose household is without those now there she stood looking at the letter reading and rereading it as though it were all in a dream perhaps it was hadnt it been that very morning that they had been so happy just before she left for work she had asked him reaitse can you be anything you want to be no baby you can be only what you really are if your life is an attempt to be reasonably happy and at peace with other men and nature why because you live under the sun you are a funny man she said getting ready to leave you know you had a funny dream last night he said what you said you wanted to play with my sons sun

it had been exactly  years earlier that i first had set foot on algerian soil it had been a brief visit a stopover on a voyage south to the new republic of guinea in  algeria was an armed camp with the french colonial masters firmly in control soldiers and gendarmes were everywhere arms at the ready and many of the public buildings were protected from guerilla assault by layers of barbed wire i had entered the city from the liner foch with two young africans one from abidjan the other from brazzaville and we had moved about with relative freedom until we reached the famed casbah the incredible labyrithine quarter made famous over the world by hollywoods film algiers starring charles boyer and hedy lamarr the armed guard at the entrance to the casbah politely but firmly turned the three black visitors away offering no explanation beyond the simple statement that entrance was forbidden the africans having no urge to defy the guard suggested that we move on which we did ending our tour at one of the many sidewalk cafes which dot the citys main arteries however when the young africans returned to the foch i set out again to find access to the casbah and finally succeeded by simply walking past a french guard as if he had no right to challenge me inside the quarter i found it impossible to dispel the aura of mystery and the vague suggestion of danger this was after all simply a community of peoples with customs and a lifestyle different from my own and it was merely insulting of me to adopt toward it the attitude of disrespectful westerners capitalizing on the difference to give an impression of evil in paris an algerian friend had given me the name of a young freedom fighter in the casbah and  set out to locate him the search led to a little a rab kiosk deep in the middle of the casbah where a group of hardbitten men finally encircled me then hassan the young man whose name  had stepped forward i was on trial who was i where did i get his name what did i want how did i get past the guards into the cash ahthough frightened  had only admiration for the cold nononsense manner in which the arabs confronted me i explained simply and honestly how  came to have hassans name and how i managed to enter the casbah and they believed me the tension was relaxed they laughed they invited me to the home of one of the men where we drank coffee and talked of african liberation afterwards they walked with me down a twisting street to the entrance above the great plaza we said goodby as i strolled out a guard stopped me he asked for my papers and i showed him my american passport what was i doing in the casbah he asked didnt  know that it was closed to tourists and that it was dangerous but msieur  said to him mustering my best french i am a black man the algerians have no need to harm me we are fighting the same war
woodie king jr has told me that ed bullins is leaving for algiers tomorrow we sit eating sweets and drinking coffee talking of black quartet the four plays woodie is producing across the street at the little gate theater i am pessimistic he is optimistic the previews open a few days away the run begins july  he feels the plays still will be running in september    doug turner ward comes in his play reckoning opens in september at the negro ensemble company theater  i think four years ago at the new school for social research richard gilman said black playwrights were incapable of producing mature drama ward was there silent the headline in the arts and leisure section of todays new york times proclaims from the black experience a new kind of theater    and the roads now lead to algiers there is a connection between the sudden explosion of black drama on the stages of america and the staging of a panafrican cultural festival in algiers what richard gilman was saying of course is that black playwrights are unimportant because they do not speak to white america in the terms the cadences and with the substance white america demands of them  the proponents of black drama say simply that they speak on their own terms in their own cadences and with the substance of their own lives and experiences and to hell with the richard gilmans of this world and in algiers the black world mounts a resounding support to the black dramatists    with real power behind them black writers will be free only then 
a moment ago in the savarin cafe the incredible fact confirmed the americans have landed on the moon the americans have landed on the moon it is not merely that i cannot get with this adventure that i do in effect resist it it is also at bottom that i wish it were not an american feat they are planting the american flag on the moon claiming the moon disclaimers of possession to the contrary notwithstanding perhaps in simple truth there is no people anywhere any better qualified technologically or emotionally suited for preeminence in the exploration of the cosmos but i have grave fears for all the worlds if this means they will be at the mercy of the american mentality    how can the third world winby playing the power game or by setting the two monster nations against each other
the air france airliner finally lifts off the ground  minutes late for which the captain apologized over the pa system in three langauges time  it is in keeping here we go into the fog out over the atlantic gaining or losing time i am never sure which in the six hoursplus journey to paris already one of the stewardesses has come to ask me if i am not someone she remembers from a previous flight quite recent i smile and say no it is possible of course that she was on the flight from amsterdam to paris last may but i think not i dont even remember if i flew air france in  in  and  yes but she would hardly remember that far back it does not matter i am always being mistaken for someone else i dont understand it perhaps it has something to do with time and place perhaps i am someone elsesitting aboard the caravelle waiting for the plane to take off for algiers the french ground crew is still fussing with the plane  in the bus riding from the terminal to the plane i watched the faces and the attitudes of the french and algerian passengers the french are still the rulers haughty remote the algerians remain the ruled the mark of oppression is there the docility the herdinstinct the absence of confidence the deference and all the algerians are in shirt jacket tie the key figure the wispy little frenchman wearing kid gloves in midjuly looking down his nose at the algerians the quintescent colonialist an insignificant man elevated to importance by the fact of his europeanness among the barbarians and i think it is always so the colonist rules with the complicity of the colonized why should these algerians tolerate a creature like the frenchman    an academic question in dakar the black intellectuals play at being french you should come and live here your pace is too swift in america you could have a villa servants    and the squalor of the medina   the algerians are wearing french clothes there are none of them in boubous or jellabas    how do they feel about their traditional dress they are probably very much like the african evoluesexcept that even the most europeanized black africans occasionally will wear boubous dashikis and agbabas    and black americansthose who want most to be american are terribly threatened by dashikis they accepted the nehru suits and jackets and some of them even wore the mao shirts but dashikis thrust upon them images they cannot yet accept    how they welcomed the tom mboya article chiding black americans for seeking to identify with africans by affecting those symbols of african povertysandals and dashikis the white press of course gave wide coverage to what was intended as a slap in the face to the black nationalists but as usual neither the white press nor its sycophants the black integrationists have much understanding of the black consciousness movement the spiritual identification with africa and the third world has little directly to do with literal emulation of african clothing and customs it has more to do with a rejection of things western    spirit in the east but the fact that mboya seemed not to know the difference tells a great deal about mboya and his apparent suggestion that africans want to and shouldadopt european style clothing seems almost naive nothing seems sillier than africans racing around in all that heat wearing shirts ties and suits to say nothing of shoes and stockings why shouldnt they wear boubous sandals and dashikiswhich are perfectly suited for the climate why should affluence and sophistication be equated with the wearing of the impractical clothes of europe  watching the thousands of algerian young men thronging the streets they are everywhere in noisy groups sitting on curbs standing at bars and bus stops simply roaming aboutone is impressed with several facts first of the utter waste of potential manpower and political power harnessed the energy of all these youths could transform algeria into an important country and possibly a wealthy one also one is aware of the absurdityno the monstrousnessof such a handsome and vigorous people being ruled all these decades by the french and beyond that of course one considers the absurdity of the white races long hegemony over the other races of mankind and finally in the streets of algiers one understands the outrageousness of little israels successful defiance of the entire arab world one acknowledges of course israels great debt to america for her success the problem of all the worlds underdeveloped people is highlighted here properly politicized indoctrinated in an ideology which would mobilize both their sense of racial pride and their sense of destiny the young men of algeria could literally overrun israel trample it to death the afroamerican center is for all practical purposes intent merely a showcase for the black_panther and for all party eldridge cleaver handled himself very well indeed at the press conference today kathleen cleaver very pregnant looked lovely she was subdued wifely stokely carmichael was in the garden of the hotel st george talking with charlie cobb and the washington d c delegation when we junius griffin and i returned stokely has behaved with maturity refusing to allow the press and provocateurs to draw him into a nonperformedproductive feud with cleavers forces cleaver also has commendably although the two men have some fundamental disagreements they seem to understand that no real purpose can be served in airing these differences before the world and mostly antagonistic press  the world still belongs to the white man though decreasingly so they move about with assurance and control which the formerly colonized peoples have not yet mastered in their bones and which consequently they emulate rather clumsily but emulation is the key what they need is their own style their own approach what is most important about the presence here of eldridge cleaver and stokely carmichael lies in the movement toward unity of all african peoples the political implications of their reception on this continent are profound two of the revolutionary leaders of the american blacks exiled for their beliefs and activities have found refuge in africa defiance of the great economic and military power of america raymonde and jean briere and his wife on monday that makes a total of five familiar faces from dakar in the lobby this morning the pretty little black american girl from milwaukee valerie stopped to chat she is it turns out making it on her own working with the horace jenkins filming crew and accepting the patronage of an american lady she lives she says in paris and came down to algiers on a fourthclass boat there is another pretty little black girl down from paris she was imported for the cast of hair took a few days off    three of the young people manning the black_panther party exhibit indicated that they now use paris as headquarters  a healthy trend young blacks increasingly prowling the world traveling not only will broaden them it will make it all the more improbable that returning home they will adapt to the role america has designated for them the group from washington has a certain quiet endearing style balanced without illusions but not without humor charlie cobb reports that the bookshop is finally in the black jean wheeler smith who has been working on a novel indicates that she is wrestling with the project im not sure i know what a novel is jimmie garrett looks more like everybodys goodnatured kid brother than a playwright    and there is vinie burrows a startlingly beautiful woman with her nineyearold son and fouryearold daughter in tow why isnt she better known why dont black americans pay homage to their own she has been invited to eastern europe but she has not been seen in chicago i have been told by mme briere that her husband jean the haitian poet is busy writing a poem to be dedicated to president hourari bournediene and i do not wish to disturb him and yet i feel it important that he know of the presence of two members of the new generation of black american writers and that they know who he is and so i introduce him to ed bullins and don l lee    thinking of jean and of amadou mahtar mbow who also is on the terrace with his wife raymonde and their son it occurs to me that the black world is a far more complex and integrated one than we sometimes realize jean for example is in exile from haiti living in senegal where he is a key member of the cultural arm of the government and his wife is americanborn senegal haiti and america are linked in them with the mbows another country franceis brought directly into the linkage raymonde is haitian i met her in  when she and mahtar visited her sister mme raoul beauvoir who lived in my building in chicago she was educated in paris where her father still lives and where her son is in school mahtar comes from an old and respected senegalese family once based in ancient st louis at the northern tip of the country when i first went down to senegal for a stay of several months in december  mahtar and raymonde were teachers in the equivalent of a special american high school there was considerable feeling among black educators in the country that mahtar should have been president of the university of dakar but that institution wasand iscontrolled by europeans leopold senghor was aware of the popular sentiment favoring mahtar apparently for he later elevated him to minister of education i do not know what combination of forces or events prompted president senghor to switch mahtar from education to culture perhaps the continuing unrest in the university which is pressuring for africanization of the university but mahtar is in algiers as minister of culture and of course as leader of the senegalese delegation to the symposium a personable and intelligent man with no illusions at all as to what africa must have and of what will be necessary to get it  jean briere informs me that mercer cooks wife vashti who i first met in dakar when mercer was ambassador died several months ago in washington not only that but he says that mercer is with his son in chicago i come all the way from chicago to africa to discover that is language the only barrier to closer ties between the afroamericans and the algerians watching stokely carmichael moving about the terrace and the gardens of the hotel chatting with old friends and with representatives of african governments i think that perhaps at long last the era is ended wherein the boldest and most imaginative of our young black men are predoomed to an early death or to eternal crippling by imprisonment all perceptive black americans know that american prisons are filled to overflowing with some of the finest minds and the most aggressive spirits from the black community but their very ingenuity and vitality of course insured their defeat in a racist and repressive system like americas such men are indeed great threatsnot to the precious american law and order of course but to american duplicity and conspiracy against equal opportunity and justice the list of villains who are in fact black heroes is long el hajj malik el shabazz marcus garvey angelo herndon paul robeson eldridge cleaver leroi jones  in the past strong black men who defied the system had no place to go once the forces of repression cornered them and those forces tragically include those moderate negro leaders who always can be trotted out as examples to the black community of what an acceptable negro ought to be but now the black worldand increasingly portions of the third worldis the new refuge   the game stokely has elected to play is no less dangerous in africa than it was in mississippi but then stokely knows that very well he has walked openeyed into his new adventure the stakes are very large indeed and all the world knows that the cia plays for keeps those who respect stokely will be pleased to know that he wears a new maturity and wears it well he lives now in a remote villa in the mountains in the interior of guinea where the climate is mild and he works closely with deposed kwame nkrumah in the former rulers campaign to reclaim his position of leadership in the country he led to independence when will stokely return to americawhen i have accomplished something worthwhile is his answer the days of innocence when thousands of bright black youths put their faith in sncc seem eons away not a mere three or four yearsthe site of the festival symposium on african culture its reality its role in the liberation struggle in the consolidation of african unity and the economic and social development of africa is this sprawling sumptuous complex on the sea  kilometers from algiers the conferfence center is an integrated unit with one of the pleasantest auditoriums i have ever seen fully equipped for simultaneous translation of speeches into three langauges french english and arabic it sits on a hill above the splendid white beach and a score of huge villas stretch out beyond the complex was built for a major united nations conference two years ago    there are shops several restaurants a security center a press center several luxurious lounges a postoffice    the speeches are boring perhaps the collected papers will make a book of some interest but there is no fire no inspiration they are all diplomats the spokesmens countries are all dependent upon the colonialist powers for crucial aid and so they are wary careful very intellectual and general in their attacks and condemnations the real talk the meaningful dialogue is being held where it is being held at allin the hotel rooms over dinner at the hotel allite and the st george in the two or three posh restaurants around the city    the exception to the general blandness of the speeches was understandably the address by the representative of the democratic republic of vietnam vice minister of culture haxuantruong he dealt    even the speech of alex la guma the exiled writer from south africa seemed pale and full of cliches and yet it was a real speech dealing with the oppression of the nonwhite peoples of his homeland    what will all the talk availfor that matter what will all the dancing on the stages and in the streets availwhat africans need are guns and the will to use them  is it true as president boumediene said in his opening address that culture is a weapon in our struggle for liberationwell of course i think it is true the people will not demand guns and they will see no need to use them until they understand who they are what their possibilities are and the forces which stand in the way of their realizing their potentialities i do not regret not having seen all the theatrical presentations and the dance troupes most of them i saw three years ago during the first world festival of negro arts at dakar they are delightful but they become monotonous after awhile    when reginald wilson of detroit and i went up to the museum of fine arts to see the special exhibition of african art we ran headlong into african bureaucracy and pageantry we could not see the show until after the dignitaries had arrived and been escorted through although we arrived at the appointed time however the exhibition at dakar would be extremely difficult to match    the arts and crafts exhibits in the university center in town were generally absorbing the stuff shown would sell well in shops in america    i went again alone into the casbah which no longer seems even mysterious the people no longer feel shut off from their own city it belongs to them i bought five dinars worth of candy and tried to distribute it to the children but so many of them descended upon me with such fervor that i realized that it was a mistake  a friendly arab rescued me and to show his thanks for my kindness to the children insisted that i be his guest for drinks at a cafe at the base of the casbah    ted joans was a discovery i have known of the mans work for a number of years but meeting him was a joy marvin x has written of don l lee that don is a poem ted is a poem a warm unaffectedbut tremendously affectingman as free as a man is likely to be  it was fun tramping over algiers with ted and don and michele russell watching ted in his enthusiasm and guilelessness being as alive and open as a child    i missed the meetings with a fatah the single group present more popular with the hordes of algerian youths than the black_panthers but i went down to see their headquarters they are indeed heroic figures    they apparently are particularly interested in making contact with the american blacks and vice versa    a fatah is stronger than any arab government strong enough to cross all the frontiers to command the sympathy of arabs everywhere it is both comforting and unsettling in the struggle to come will there be a force in the black community able to excite that kind of support dissidence a meeting of writers is called by joseph o o okpaku editor of the americanpublished journal of the new african literature and a handful of writers and interested persons show up i have not much time for i want to talk with mahtar mbow before i leave the city okpaku is concernedand rightly so i feelabout the irrelevance of the presentations at the symposium he talks of the writers descending upon the club des pins in a group seizing the mircrophones and proceeding to deal with real revolutionary ideas and means    none of the american writers are present perhaps they have not heard of the meeting there is an american girl from new orleans who is working with some international agency in monrovia i ask her if the liberians are still behaving like bad caricatures of white american stereotypes of africans and i suppose that i pressure her into some admission that in some cases it is true they still dress up in full formal regalia in all that stifling heat she says but she likes the country    john d a okai the ghanaian writer is there i do not tell him that i have seen his poem in the new issue of african artstarts dafrique because i do not remember what it is about and cannot truthfully say whether i like it he does not seem stuffily british it is good to observe but i find myself wondering why he is living in london the question is dangerous i know from experience and i have no right to ask it and yet being concerned as i am with the acquisition of power in all of black africa i am always disapproving unfairly or not of the bright and talented africans spending their energies in europe and america    janheinz jahn his friend ulla and his elder son are present i do not tell jan that the new york times has asked me to review his new book new african literature a history of black writing for i am not certain i have time to read the book and write the review by the august  deadline    there is a south african present a colored who identifies himself as a writer but i do not ask him to repeat his name unlike okai he seems veddy veddy british and i find with regret that i am depressed about the whole assembly and have no wish to get involved  i find myself supporting the idea of dissent from the formal papers being presented at the symposium and yet i wonder what resonance can be achieved by the objections these people will make   are the black africans and the algerians reaching out to touch each other today chatting with ben enwonwu the nigerian sculptor the impotence of africa was brought home to me anew enwonwu is growing old he speaks now of all the old onesof langston hughes and paul robeson and peter abrahams one dead one quite seriously ill and one in quiet exile in the hills of jamaica enwonwu is serving his country diligently at the festival not missing a single session although he is obviously tired and wishes to relax more important still he is so busy at home with matters of official government concern that he has no time to create and what is an artist who cannot work he wants desperately to be free and yet a sense of patriotism drives him on with his mundane chores but he is disheartened at the same time by many things at home he seems not to be sure that his countrys leaders are certain of the path they have taken or that they are fully conscious of the terrors which have been unleashed in the taking of that path and he is heartbroken about the treatment of wole soyinka the great playwright who is going blind in prison like most of the rest of the world enwonwu cannot understand how his own country can be party to the cruel punishmentperhaps the destructionof one of its leading artists    but the detainment and treatment of soyinka illustrate the precariousness of political power in africa and if political power is so uncertain is to be so jealously guarded how can the government turn its full attention to the acquisition of economic power which alone will bring about the true liberation of africa
i am thinking now of the evening in detroit after my return from guinea in  entertaining my friend fred hart williams block club with my photos and artifacts from africa the forced expressions of enthusiasm from the polite middleclass ladies the uneasiness provoked by the lecture    and finally the little canadianborn man whose parents had fled slavery in kentucky to the free soil of canada turning impatiently flush with the success he had made of his life in america saying we are not africans look at us we are as much white as black and dont tell us about colonialism we read the papers we see television we know how most of the people in the world live and we are much better off   it was a terrible moment but it has passed fred hart who was embarrassed by his old acquaintance would be proud of the new crop of young blacks moving out over the african continent to find and enrich their past to nourish their roots but more than that of course so much more the new ones have no hunger to be embraced by america they will surrender no portion of their dignity to that passion they have turned eastward toward the spirituality and the peace of africa and the orient their natural sphere it is not simply courage which permits them to say no to america and her values it is also a recognitionboth guttural and instinctivethat the emptiness of those values lead only to death    africa is both the old world and the new boumediene knows that kwame nkrumah knows it julius nyerere knows it patrice lumumba also knew it it is a dangerous knowledge
epilogue we are aboard the air france caravelle flying north over the mediterranean toward europe junius griffin tries to pay for champagne with leftover dinars and the french hostess tells him we dont accept algerian money  i am not annoyed the positive feeling toward the festival and all that transpired there in the anomalous white facaded city now fading in the blue african mist cannot be ruined by the arrogance of frenchmen why do i feel positivei suppose the feeling has as much to do with the relative efficiency of the algerian handling of the difficult business of processing housing and managing the sudden deluge of thousands of visitors as it does with the conviction that the elusive and somewhat enigmatic hourari boumediene will lead his country toward true independence and power there were frustrating moments i admit but the algerians were generally accommodating congenial understanding and considering that they had no experience in mounting and conducting an event of so monumental a magnitude their performance was superb i find that i have no reservations about the countrys internal political situation it is a revolutionary government and even the detainment of ben bella while regrettable can be explained in that light what of ben bella i asked young abdul the hotel guide he is well msieur it is a question of the security of the revolution i did not ask of moise t shorn be for that might have been interpreted as an accusation and tshorn be was not worth the semblance of concern the benedict arnold of the congo the quisling of africa  it is of course a question americans will ask ignoring the implications of the denial of leroi jones right to leave the country the cia it is always an interesting game at gatherings of disaffected blacks to speculate on the identity of the american agents and some grow paranoid in the process labeling innocents all in the game   in the taxi hurtling through the mrv« ing streets en route to the airport i noted that i had not seen a single train in a week even though  had been whisked in test pilotstyle along the corniche adjacent to the tracks several times i was thinking of industry there are many factories the french les piedsnors invested much of themselves in the usines around the lovely country and one understands why they held on so tenaciously    but that is in the past algiers is moving forward and with defiance and she wants to take the rest of africa with her godspeed
